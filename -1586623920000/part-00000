It is a representative body that aims to represent students to both the university and the wider community.\n\nThe Students' Union is housed in the Portland Building on University Park campus, a building shared with some non-student union activities. The union receives a block grant from the university of over \u00a32 million to support its activities, although the union also raises money through income streams such as the Union shop and a bar.\n\nAll members of the [[University of Nottingham]] are automatically members of the Students' Union, unless they use their right to opt out of membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/finance/frequentlyaskedquestions/tuitionfeesfaq.aspx|title=Tuition Fees - Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=}}</ref> As such the University of Nottingham Students' Union has over 34,000 members.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/aboutus/theunion/</ref> The Union obtained charitable status in 2010 and is overseen by a [[Board of trustees|Board of Trustees]] made up of student-elected sabbatical officers and full-time staff.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:University Park MMB \u00ab73 Portland Building.jpg|thumb|left|University of Nottingham Students' Union is housed in the Portland Building (pictured) on [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham|University Park Campus, Nottingham]]]]\nThe Students' Union is a charitable organisation, enshrined by legislation such as the [[Education Act 1994]], and responsible for a number of areas of work: student representation, student activities, student advice on education and welfare, and campaigning.\n\n===Early years===\nThe Union's activity started in the 1880s when a cycling club was formed. At the old university college site in the city centre the 'RAG' started in 1923. ''The Gong'' Magazine (now ''[[Impact (student magazine)|Impact]]'', having been ''Gongster'' and ''Bias'' at various points) initiated in 1939 was an early sign of developing union life.\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:University Park MMB J9 Portland Building.jpg|right|thumb|The Portland Building's rear entrance during snow in December 2010]]\nIn 1928 the expanding college moved to the new out-of town Highfields Estate and here the Union's first permanent residence was in the lower corridor of the Trent Building. By 1956, the Portland Building had been opened, and was originally designated as a Union building, but although the Union is the major user, the management of the building has always rested with the university.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Union rationalised its representative system into a series of guilds, mostly based on halls of residence as 'constituencies'. This system worked well for over two decades, before a critical mass of students came to live outside halls, at which point the strong communities on which the guild system was based lost their universality.\n\nDuring the 1970s the Union took on a more militant air, with sit-ins and student strikes. This did lead to some positive results, such as student representation of many university committees \u2013 an opportunity openly satirised by the 1980s as less of a revolutionary shift than expected.\n\nThe pace of change in the Union accelerated after the [[Robbins Report]], as rises in student numbers drove it towards a bigger capacity, more permanent staff and sabbatical officers, more rooms and offices and bigger turnovers and budgets. Income rose from \u00a3250,000 in 1982 to \u00a31,480,000 in 2006. Membership rose by 23,000 in the same period, whilst staff numbers more than trebled.\n\n===UNU===\nPrior to 2000, the University of Nottingham Students' Union was known as the ''University of Nottingham Union'', abbreviated to UNU. The renaming was intended to clarify the Union's status as a students' union.\n\nRecently, the Union has started to address a number of pressing challenges presented by the dynamism and growth of the university under Sir [[Colin Campbell (lawyer)|Colin Campbell]] \u2013 such as provision of union services to members at [[East Midlands|East Midland]] sites beyond the main Nottingham campuses.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:University Park MMB \u00ab06c Union Council.jpg|thumb|The union executive committee 2012/13, taking questions at the 411th (1st) Union Council in October 2012.]]\nThe Students' Union is governed by its Constitution and Regulations, a document which is informally known as the 'Big Red Book'.<ref name=autogenerated5>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/about/constitution/</ref> The Students' Union also maintains a policy file, which outlines its stance on various issues.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> The Students' Union is established by the statutes of the university, which provide that \"There shall be a Union of Students of the University\" and that \"Ordinances shall prescribe the constitution, functions, privileges and other matters relating to the Union of Students.\" Ordinance XI: Union of Students fulfils this role. Changes to the Constitution, Regulations and Policy File are typically made by Students' Union Council; however, the whole membership can vote on a policy in a referendum. In 2016 a referendum was held on whether the Students' Union would remain a member of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.impactnottingham.com/2016/06/have-your-say-voting-for-nus-referendum-opens/ |title = Have Your Say: Voting for NUS Referendum Opens|date = June 2016}}</ref> The referendum was one of a number of referendums held by [[List of Students' Unions in the United Kingdom|Students' Unions]] following the election of [[Malia Bouattia]] as National Union of Students President. The Referendum came back with a strong Yes Vote, this was despite strong and substantiated evidence that the No Campaign predominantly led by students from Nottingham University Conservative Association had been supported including financially by Unidays which caused huge controversy and accusations of incompetence on the part of the returning officer.\n\n===Council===\nStudents' Union Council is the highest regularly meeting decision-making body of the Students' Union. It meets at least seven times per year. For Council to make any binding decisions it has to be [[quorum|quorate]]; the quorum for Students' Union Council is set at 50% of voting members of council. Members of Students' Union Council can be either voting or non-voting members. The voting members are designed to be representative of the membership of the Students' Union as a whole. Most non-voting members sit on council to represent various views that it is felt important to have represented at this level, but where they do not represent a clear constituency of students. Each Student-Run Service, for example, has a non-voting seat on Council, since it is felt that there will be issues that it will be useful to have their input on, but that those involved in their organisation are already represented through a council rep.\n\nThe constituencies for voting members of students' union council are, for the most part either residential or subject-based. Generally, first year undergraduates are grouped into constituencies determined by their residence, with students in subsequent years represented through their subject or faculty. The remaining Council positions are held by the Executive Officers, JCR and Association Heads, and Student-Run Service Heads.\n\nIn 2011 democratic reforms were announced that would in effect abolish Council and replace it with a new democratic structure. The current democratic structures have only been quorate 17% of the time in the past 10 years and it was widely felt that they were not publicised well enough.\n\n===Officers===\n[[File:Election hustings uon.jpg|thumb|right|Candidates attending a Candidate Question Time held on Sutton Bonington campus|255x255px]]\nThere are seven Full-Time officers of the Students' Union. These are sabbatical roles, which involve the office-holder either taking a year out from their studies, or taking office for a year after they finish their course. These are elected by a cross-campus ballot of all students.<ref name=unsu_exec>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/about/exec/</ref> Four of the Full-Time Officers are also trustees of the Union: the Education Officer, President, Sports Officer and Welfare Officer.<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/about/trustees/</ref> There are seven full-time sabbatical officers, as well as part-time non sabbatical officers.\n\nThere are also seven unpaid Part-Time Officers, who hold their positions alongside their studies. These Officers work to represent select constituencies of students and their interests. These officers are elected by a cross-campus ballot of students who self-define into the constituency of the respective officer. These roles were established in 2008.  \n\nAn individual is allowed to hold a sabbatical position for a maximum of two terms, while there is no term-limit on part-time roles.\n\nThe current Full-Time officers are<ref name=impact>{{cite web|url=https://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/make-the-change/your-officers/|title=Your Officers|publisher=University of Nottingham Students Union}}</ref>:\n* '''President''' - James Pheasey<br>\n* '''Education''' - Cassie Ulrich<br>\n* '''Equal Opportunities and Welfare''' - Myles Smith-Thompson<br>\n* '''Sports''' - Millie Doherty<br>\n* '''Activities''' - Georgina Pittman<br>\n* '''Community''' - Jacob Collier<br>\n* '''Postgraduate''' - Abdi Ahmed<br>\n\n\nThe current Part-Time Officers are<ref name=impact>{{cite web|url=https://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/make-the-change/your-officers/|title=Your Officers|publisher=University of Nottingham Students Union}}</ref>: \n\n* '''International''' - Denis Lelin<br>\n* '''Women's''' - Delphine Avraam<br>\n* '''LGBT+''' - Sam Hawkins<br>\n* '''Disabled Students''' - Beth Titchiner<br>\n* '''Black and Minority Ethnic''' - Omolade Osinaike & Bridget Mohammed<br>\n* '''Mature Students''' - Rebecca Craven<br>\n* '''Environment & Social Justice''' - Lee Taylor<br>\n\n==Activities==\n\n=== Residential associations ===\n[[File:Broadgate park.jpg|thumb|right| [[Broadgate Park]] (pictured) has a residential Association which represents over 2000 people.]]\n{{further|University of Nottingham Halls of Residence}}\nMore commonly called JCRs ([[Junior Common Room|junior common rooms]]) these committees are elected from students in halls to put on social events throughout the year.{{Update inline|date=December 2018|reason=Do the halls still have JCRs}}<ref>As Melton Hall is solely for postgraduate students and others such as Broadgate Park contain sizable numbers of postgraduate students the term 'Residential Association' is often used in place of JCR</ref> There is also a Regional Students Association for students who are not living in halls.<ref name=\"su.nottingham.ac.uk\">http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/studentgroups/association/RSA/</ref>\n\nThere is a Presidents' Committee ('Pres Com') where presidents of halls can share best practice.

There are over 200 societies that cover a wide range of interests from [[Nottingham University Society of Change Ringers|bell-ringing]] to chess to [[Nottingham University Gliding Club|gliding]].<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/activities2/societies/</ref> There are also extensive local and international volunteering opportunities at the Students' Union, notably the [[InterVol]] project which works in [[Uganda]] on health and sanitation, Golden Futures which works to support children in Cambodia as well as local initiatives to support the [[British Red Cross]] and [[Oxfam]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/volunteering/what/ |title = Volunteering}}</ref>\n\n=== Sports ===\nThere are over 70 sporting clubs affiliated to the Students' Union. As well as the Sports Clubs, the Union also runs one of the largest intramural sporting programmes in the country with hundreds of teams competing each week in a variety of sports including rugby, football (5-a-side and 11-a-side), hockey, basketball, ten pin bowling and volleyball. The winners of each sport then compete in an annual intramural varsity match against [[Loughborough University]].\n\n====Varsity Series====\nHeld annually, the [[The Varsity Series (Nottingham universities)|Varsity Series]] is a series of sports matches against [[Nottingham Trent University]] held over the Spring term in ten different disciplines: rugby union (men's and women's), hockey (men's and women's), basketball (men's and women's), football (men's and women's), ice hockey (men's), Netball (women's), cricket (men's), swimming (men's and women's combined) and rugby league (men's).\n\nThe series is one of the best attended series in the UK, with over 6,000 watching the ice hockey, and 3,500 watching the football and rugby. The games are held at the top sporting venues in Nottingham; both the football and rugby at [[Meadow Lane]] (home of [[Notts County]]), and the ice hockey at the [[Trent FM Arena|National Ice Arena]].\n\n===Education Network===\nThe Education Network is the name given to the Course Rep system. The Network is chaired by the Education Officer.<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/ednetwork/officer/</ref> There are 5 Undergraduate Faculty Coordinators and 5 Postgraduate Faculty Reps (both elected in cross campus elections). There are School Reps for each School/Department and finally Course Reps (currently around 1000).\n\n==Campaigns==\nThe Students' Union has run a number of campaigns over the years on a wide range of subjects affecting students. These include B-EAT aimed at helping those with eating disorders<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/studentgroups/sca/beat/</ref> and an Exam Stress campaign aimed at helping students get through the exam period.<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/activities2/campaigns/examstress/</ref> Around January when students begin to consider housing options for the next year a campaign is run to help students look for housing.<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/advicesupport/house/</ref> The Student Advice and Representation Centre are also available to check housing contracts free of charge.\n\n===Living Wage and Anti-Casualisation Campaign===\nStarted in 2012/2013 the Living Wage campaign is an ongoing campaign to see the University of Nottingham become a [[Living Wage Foundation]] Accredited Employer together with the Students' Union.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/NottinghamLivingWage/</ref> The Campaign is led by student campaigners with the backing of the Students' Union alongside the University and College Union (UCU), Unite and Unison Trade Unions and Nottingham Citizens.\n\n==Prizes and awards==\nThere are currently four levels of awards granted by the Students' Union to graduating students:<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/asset/News/6001/Prizes-and-Awards-Booklet.pdf</ref>\n* ''Ordo Caligulae''\n* Honorary Life Membership\n* Union Prize\n* Student Experience Award\nThe Students' Union makes the following awards to non-students:\n* Don Varley Award\n* Golden Jubilee Award\n\n===''Ordo Caligulae''===\nThe ''Ordo Caligulae'' is the highest award of the Students' Union, and includes Honorary Life Membership of the Students' Union, and consequently members of the Ordo Caligulae enjoy those benefits detailed under Honorary Life Membership. Membership of the ''Ordo Caligulae'' (literally, \"The Order of the Boot\") is granted to those \"who have given outstanding contribution to the University of Nottingham Students\u2019 Union.\" It is probably named after [[Jesse Boot]] (later Lord Trent), who was a great benefactor of the University.\n\nMembers entering the Ordo Caligulae are presented with a cast metal boot on a pedestal at the Union's Annual General Meeting.\n\n===Honorary life membership===\nHonorary Life Membership is conferred on those who have furthered the achievements of the aims of the University of Nottingham Students\u2019 Union.\n\nThe Students' Union Constitution lays down certain rights of its members (including Honorary Members):\n# Take part in functions organised by the Students\u2019 Union.\n# Become members of all Clubs and Societies affiliated to the Students\u2019 Union.\n# Attend Union Council, Executive Committee and Standing Committees\n# Wear official university colours.\n\n(Further rights, such as the ability to stand and vote in Students' Union Elections, are reserved for \"Full Members\" \u2013 those registered as students at the University). In recent years typically five to eight new Honorary Life Members have been created in any year.\n\nWith typically thirty recipients each year (from a graduating class numbering around 8000) the Union Prize is presented to graduating students of the University of Nottingham in recognition of their contribution to the benefit of the students.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nottingham Trent Students' Union]]\n*[[List of students' unions in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk}}\n\n{{Aldwych Group}}\n{{University of Nottingham}}\n\n{{coord missing|Nottinghamshire}}\n\n[[Category:Organisations based in Nottingham]]\n[[Category:Student organizations established in 1928]]\n[[Category:Politics of Nottingham]]\n[[Category:Students' unions in England|Nottingham]]\n[[Category:University of Nottingham|Students']]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}\n{{Infobox students' union\n| name        = University of Nottingham Students' Union\n| logo        = University of Nottingham_Students' Union logo.jpg\n| logo_size   = 250px\n| established = [[Circa|c.]] 1880 (as cycling club)\n<br>1913 (as a formal entity)\n| institution = [[University of Nottingham]]\n| president   = James Pheasey\n| chief executive = Daryl Ormerod\n| other_sabbs = \n| location    = Portland Building, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/contact/</ref>\n| members     = 34,670 <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/spp/student-statistics/student-statistics-2018-19.aspx |title = Student Statistics 2018-19 - the University of Nottingham}}</ref> \n| affiliated  = [[Aldwych Group]],<br>\n[[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]],<br>\n[[British Universities Sports Association]],<br>\n[[Universitas 21]] Student Network,<br>\n[[National Postgraduate Committee]]\n[[Citizens UK]]\n| homepage    = {{url|http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/}}\n}}\n\nThe '''University of Nottingham Students' Union''' (often abbreviated as '''UoNSU'''<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/news/article/6001/3325/ | title=New Chief Exec for UoNSU}}</ref> ( /\u02c8j\u0252nsu\u02d0/)) is the [[students' union]] at the [[University of Nottingham]], England.

In 2016 a referendum was held on whether the Students' Union would remain a member of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.impactnottingham.com/2016/06/have-your-say-voting-for-nus-referendum-opens/ |title = Have Your Say: Voting for NUS Referendum Opens|date = June 2016}}</ref> The referendum was one of a number of referendums held by [[List of Students' Unions in the United Kingdom|Students' Unions]] following the election of [[Malia Bouattia]] as National Union of Students President. The Referendum came back with a strong Yes Vote, this was despite strong and substantiated evidence that the No Campaign predominantly led by students from Nottingham University Conservative Association had been supported including financially by Unidays which caused huge controversy and accusations of incompetence on the part of the returning officer.\n\n===Council===\nStudents' Union Council is the highest regularly meeting decision-making body of the Students' Union. It meets at least seven times per year. For Council to make any binding decisions it has to be [[quorum|quorate]]; the quorum for Students' Union Council is set at 50% of voting members of council. Members of Students' Union Council can be either voting or non-voting members. The voting members are designed to be representative of the membership of the Students' Union as a whole. Most non-voting members sit on council to represent various views that it is felt important to have represented at this level, but where they do not represent a clear constituency of students. Each Student-Run Service, for example, has a non-voting seat on Council, since it is felt that there will be issues that it will be useful to have their input on, but that those involved in their organisation are already represented through a council rep.\n\nThe constituencies for voting members of students' union council are, for the most part either residential or subject-based. Generally, first year undergraduates are grouped into constituencies determined by their residence, with students in subsequent years represented through their subject or faculty. The remaining Council positions are held by the Executive Officers, JCR and Association Heads, and Student-Run Service Heads.\n\nIn 2011 democratic reforms were announced that would in effect abolish Council and replace it with a new democratic structure. The current democratic structures have only been quorate 17% of the time in the past 10 years and it was widely felt that they were not publicised well enough.\n\n===Officers===\n[[File:Election hustings uon.jpg|thumb|right|Candidates attending a Candidate Question Time held on Sutton Bonington campus|255x255px]]\nThere are seven Full-Time officers of the Students' Union. These are sabbatical roles, which involve the office-holder either taking a year out from their studies, or taking office for a year after they finish their course. These are elected by a cross-campus ballot of all students.<ref name=unsu_exec>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/about/exec/</ref> Four of the Full-Time Officers are also trustees of the Union: the Education Officer, President, Sports Officer and Welfare Officer.<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/about/trustees/</ref> There are seven full-time sabbatical officers, as well as part-time non sabbatical officers.\n\nThere are also seven unpaid Part-Time Officers, who hold their positions alongside their studies. These Officers work to represent select constituencies of students and their interests. These officers are elected by a cross-campus ballot of students who self-define into the constituency of the respective officer. These roles were established in 2008.  \n\nAn individual is allowed to hold a sabbatical position for a maximum of two terms, while there is no term-limit on part-time roles.\n\nThe current Full-Time officers are<ref name=impact>{{cite web|url=https://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/make-the-change/your-officers/|title=Your Officers|publisher=University of Nottingham Students Union}}</ref>:\n* '''President''' - James Pheasey<br>\n* '''Education''' - Cassie Ulrich<br>\n* '''Equal Opportunities and Welfare''' - Myles Smith-Thompson<br>\n* '''Sports''' - Millie Doherty<br>\n* '''Activities''' - Georgina Pittman<br>\n* '''Community''' - Jacob Collier<br>\n* '''Postgraduate''' - Abdi Ahmed<br>\n\n\nThe current Part-Time Officers are<ref name=impact>{{cite web|url=https://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/make-the-change/your-officers/|title=Your Officers|publisher=University of Nottingham Students Union}}</ref>: \n\n* '''International''' - Denis Lelin<br>\n* '''Womens' ''' - Delphine Avraam<br>\n* '''LGBT+''' - Sam Hawkins<br>\n* '''Disabled Students''' - Beth Titchiner<br>\n* '''Black and Minority Ethnic''' - Omolade Osinaike & Bridget Mohammed<br>\n* '''Mature Students''' - Rebecca Craven<br>\n* '''Environment & Social Justice''' - Lee Taylor<br>\n\n==Activities==\n\n=== Residential associations ===\n[[File:Broadgate park.jpg|thumb|right| [[Broadgate Park]] (pictured) has a residential Association which represents over 2000 people.]]\n{{further|University of Nottingham Halls of Residence}}\nMore commonly called JCRs ([[Junior Common Room|junior common rooms]]) these committees are elected from students in halls to put on social events throughout the year.{{Update inline|date=December 2018|reason=Do the halls still have JCRs}}<ref>As Melton Hall is solely for postgraduate students and others such as Broadgate Park contain sizable numbers of postgraduate students the term 'Residential Association' is often used in place of JCR</ref> There is also a Regional Students Association for students who are not living in halls.<ref name=\"su.nottingham.ac.uk\">http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/studentgroups/association/RSA/</ref>\n\nThere is a Presidents' Committee ('Pres Com') where presidents of halls can share best practice.

There are over 200 societies that cover a wide range of interests from [[Nottingham University Society of Change Ringers|bell-ringing]] to chess to [[Nottingham University Gliding Club|gliding]].<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/activities2/societies/</ref> There are also extensive local and international volunteering opportunities at the Students' Union, notably the [[InterVol]] project which works in [[Uganda]] on health and sanitation, Golden Futures which works to support children in Cambodia as well as local initiatives to support the [[British Red Cross]] and [[Oxfam]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/volunteering/what/ |title = Volunteering}}</ref>\n\n=== Sports ===\nThere are over 70 sporting clubs affiliated to the Students' Union. As well as the Sports Clubs, the Union also runs one of the largest intramural sporting programmes in the country with hundreds of teams competing each week in a variety of sports including rugby, football (5-a-side and 11-a-side), hockey, basketball, ten pin bowling and volleyball. The winners of each sport then compete in an annual intramural varsity match against [[Loughborough University]].\n\n====Varsity Series====\nHeld annually, the [[The Varsity Series (Nottingham universities)|Varsity Series]] is a series of sports matches against [[Nottingham Trent University]] held over the Spring term in ten different disciplines: rugby union (men's and women's), hockey (men's and women's), basketball (men's and women's), football (men's and women's), ice hockey (men's), Netball (women's), cricket (men's), swimming (men's and women's combined) and rugby league (men's).\n\nThe series is one of the best attended series in the UK, with over 6,000 watching the ice hockey, and 3,500 watching the football and rugby. The games are held at the top sporting venues in Nottingham; both the football and rugby at [[Meadow Lane]] (home of [[Notts County]]), and the ice hockey at the [[Trent FM Arena|National Ice Arena]].\n\n===Education Network===\nThe Education Network is the name given to the Course Rep system. The Network is chaired by the Education Officer.<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/ednetwork/officer/</ref> There are 5 Undergraduate Faculty Coordinators and 5 Postgraduate Faculty Reps (both elected in cross campus elections). There are School Reps for each School/Department and finally Course Reps (currently around 1000).\n\n==Campaigns==\nThe Students' Union has run a number of campaigns over the years on a wide range of subjects affecting students. These include B-EAT aimed at helping those with eating disorders<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/studentgroups/sca/beat/</ref> and an Exam Stress campaign aimed at helping students get through the exam period.<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/activities2/campaigns/examstress/</ref> Around January when students begin to consider housing options for the next year a campaign is run to help students look for housing.<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/advicesupport/house/</ref> The Student Advice and Representation Centre are also available to check housing contracts free of charge.\n\n===Living Wage and Anti-Casualisation Campaign===\nStarted in 2012/2013 the Living Wage campaign is an ongoing campaign to see the University of Nottingham become a [[Living Wage Foundation]] Accredited Employer together with the Students' Union.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/NottinghamLivingWage/</ref> The Campaign is led by student campaigners with the backing of the Students' Union alongside the University and College Union (UCU), Unite and Unison Trade Unions and Nottingham Citizens.\n\n==Prizes and awards==\nThere are currently four levels of awards granted by the Students' Union to graduating students:<ref>http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/asset/News/6001/Prizes-and-Awards-Booklet.pdf</ref>\n* ''Ordo Caligulae''\n* Honorary Life Membership\n* Union Prize\n* Student Experience Award\nThe Students' Union makes the following awards to non-students:\n* Don Varley Award\n* Golden Jubilee Award\n\n===''Ordo Caligulae''===\nThe ''Ordo Caligulae'' is the highest award of the Students' Union, and includes Honorary Life Membership of the Students' Union, and consequently members of the Ordo Caligulae enjoy those benefits detailed under Honorary Life Membership. Membership of the ''Ordo Caligulae'' (literally, \"The Order of the Boot\") is granted to those \"who have given outstanding contribution to the University of Nottingham Students\u2019 Union.\" It is probably named after [[Jesse Boot]] (later Lord Trent), who was a great benefactor of the University.\n\nMembers entering the Ordo Caligulae are presented with a cast metal boot on a pedestal at the Union's Annual General Meeting.\n\n===Honorary life membership===\nHonorary Life Membership is conferred on those who have furthered the achievements of the aims of the University of Nottingham Students\u2019 Union.\n\nThe Students' Union Constitution lays down certain rights of its members (including Honorary Members):\n# Take part in functions organised by the Students\u2019 Union.\n# Become members of all Clubs and Societies affiliated to the Students\u2019 Union.\n# Attend Union Council, Executive Committee and Standing Committees\n# Wear official University colours.\n\n(Further rights, such as the ability to stand and vote in Students' Union Elections, are reserved for \"Full Members\" \u2013 those registered as students at the University). In recent years typically five to eight new Honorary Life Members have been created in any year.\n\nWith typically thirty recipients each year (from a graduating class numbering around 8000) the Union Prize is presented to graduating students of the University of Nottingham in recognition of their contribution to the benefit of the students.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nottingham Trent Students' Union]]\n*[[List of students' unions in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk}}\n\n{{Aldwych Group}}\n{{University of Nottingham}}\n\n{{coord missing|Nottinghamshire}}\n\n[[Category:Organisations based in Nottingham]]\n[[Category:Student organizations established in 1928]]\n[[Category:Politics of Nottingham]]\n[[Category:Students' unions in England|Nottingham]]\n[[Category:University of Nottingham|Students']]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "replaced: University \u2192 university (3),typo(s) fixed: Womens' \u2192 Women's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nottingham_Students%27_Union"}

One of the animals found here is the [[polar bear]], which is on the [[coat of arms]] of the Danish royal family in Greenland]] The '''history of Greenland''' is a history of life under extreme [[Arctic]] conditions: currently, an [[ice cap]] covers about 80 percent of the island, restricting human activity largely to the coasts.\n\nThe first humans are thought to have arrived in [[Greenland]] around 2500 BC. Their descendants apparently died out and were succeeded by several other groups migrating from continental [[North America]]. There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when [[Iceland]]ic [[Viking]]s settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived. The ancestors of the [[Inuit]] Greenlanders who live there today appear to have migrated there later, around AD 1200, from northwestern Greenland.  While the Inuit survived in the icy world of the [[Little Ice Age]], the early [[Eastern Settlement|Norse settlements]] along the southwestern coast disappeared, leaving the Inuit as the only inhabitants of the island for several centuries. During this time, [[Denmark-Norway]], apparently believing the Norse settlements had survived, continued to claim sovereignty over the island despite the lack of any contact between the Norse Greenlanders and their Scandinavian brethren. In 1721, aspiring to become a [[Danish colonial empire|colonial power]], Denmark-Norway sent a missionary expedition to Greenland with the stated aim of reinstating Christianity among descendants of the Norse Greenlanders who may have reverted to [[Norse mythology|paganism]]. When the missionaries found no descendants of the Norse Greenlanders, they baptized the Inuit Greenlanders they found living there instead. Denmark-Norway then developed trading colonies along the coast and imposed a trade monopoly and other colonial privileges on the area.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], when Germany invaded Denmark, Greenlanders became socially and economically less connected to Denmark and more connected to the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/1944-12-27_Yanks_Clear_Greenland_of_Nazis |title=Yanks Clear Greenland of Nazis,1944/12/27 (1944) |author= |date= |website= |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> After the war, Denmark resumed control of Greenland and in 1953, converted its status from colony to overseas ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|amt]]'' (county). Although Greenland is still a part of the Kingdom of [[Denmark]], it has enjoyed [[home rule]] since 1979. In 1985, the island decided to leave the European Economic Community (EEC), which it had joined as a part of Denmark in 1973; the [[Faroes]] had never joined.\n\n== Early Paleo-Eskimo cultures ==\n[[File:Arctic cultures 900-1500 (no caption).png|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=Maps showing the different cultures (Dorset, Thule, Norse, Innu, and Beothuk) in Greenland, Labrador, Newfoundland and the Canadian arctic islands in the years 900, 1100, 1300 and 1500|Arctic cultures from 900 to 1500:{{aligned table|fullwidth=y|nowrap2=y|{{legend-line|15px #56BD7E solid|[[Dorset culture|Dorset]]}}|{{legend-line|15px #F5F402 solid|[[Innu]]}}|{{legend-line|15px #2E42A2 solid|[[Thule people|Thule]]}}|{{legend-line|15px #F09C00 solid|[[Beothuk]]}}|{{legend-line|15px #A00018 solid|[[History of Greenland#Norse settlement|Norse]]}}}}]]\n\nThe [[prehistory]] of Greenland is a story of repeated waves of [[Paleo-Eskimo]] immigration from the islands north of the [[North America]]n mainland. (The peoples of those islands are thought to have descended, in turn, from inhabitants of [[Siberia]] who migrated into [[Canada]] thousands of years ago.) Because of Greenland's remoteness and climate, survival there was difficult. Over the course of centuries, one culture succeeded another as groups died out and were replaced by new immigrants. [[Archaeology]] can give only approximate dates for the cultures that flourished before the Norse exploration of Greenland in the 10th century.\n\nThe earliest known cultures in Greenland are the [[Saqqaq culture]] (2500\u2013800 BC)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.natmus.dk/sw18632.asp|title=Saqqaq culture chronology|publisher=Sila, the Greenland Research Centre at the National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=2 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419200203/http://www.natmus.dk/sw18632.asp|archivedate=19 April 2011}}</ref> and the [[Independence I culture]] in northern Greenland (2400\u20131300 BC).

During the 980s, explorers led by [[Erik the Red]] set out from [[Iceland]] and reached the southwest coast of Greenland, found the region uninhabited, and subsequently settled there. Erik named the island Greenland (''Gr\u0153nland'' in [[Old Norse]], ''Gr\u00e6nland'' in modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], ''Gr\u00f8nland'' in modern [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]) - in effect as a marketing device.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Both the ''Book of Icelanders'' (''[[\u00cdslendingab\u00f3k]]'', a medieval account of [[Icelandic history]] from the 12th century onward) and the ''[[Saga of Erik the Red|Saga of Eric the Red]]'' (''Eir\u00edks saga rau\u00f0a'', a medieval account of his life and of the Norse settlement of Greenland) state that Erik said that ''it would encourage people to go there that the land had a good name''.\"<ref>Grove, Jonath.

He sailed to Greenland, where he explored the coastline and claimed certain regions as his own. He then returned to Iceland to persuade people to join him in establishing a settlement on Greenland. The Icelandic sagas say that 25 ships left Iceland with Erik the Red in 985, and that only 14 of them arrived safely in Greenland.<ref name=\"The Fate of Greenland's Vikings\">[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/greenland/ The Fate of Greenland's Vikings]</ref> This date has been approximately confirmed by radiocarbon dating of remains at the first settlement at [[Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0|Brattahlid]] (now [[Qassiarsuk]]), which yielded a date of about 1000. According to the sagas, it was also in the year 1000 that Erik's son, [[Leif Eirikson]], left the settlement to explore the regions around [[Vinland]], which historians generally assume to have been located in what is now [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].\n\nThe Norse established settlements along Greenland's fjords. It is possible, that the bottom of the southern fjords at that time were covered by highgrown shrub as well as surrounded by hills covered with grass and brush as the [[Qinngua Valley]] currently is, but this hasn't been determined yet. <ref>{{cite web | url = https://ign.ku.dk/english/about/arboreta/arboretum-greenland/forest-plantations/ |title=The Forest Plantations in The Greenlandic Arboretum |}}</ref> If the presumption is true then the Norse probably cleared the landscape by felling trees to use as building material and fuel, and by allowing their sheep and goats to graze there in both summer and winter. The occurring soil erosion could have been an important factor in the demise of the colonies, as the land was stripped of its natural cover.\n \nThe Norse settled in three separate locations in south-western Greenland: the larger [[Eastern Settlement]], the smaller [[Western Settlement]], and the still smaller [[Ivittuut|Middle Settlement]] (often considered part of the Eastern one). Estimates put the combined population of the settlements at their height between 2,000 and 10,000, with more recent estimates<ref>N. Lynnerup, in {{harvnb|Fitzhugh|Ward|2000}}</ref> trending toward the lower figure. Archeologists have identified the ruins of approximately 620 farms: 500 in the Eastern Settlement, 95 in the Western Settlement, and 20 in the Middle.\n\n[[File:I. E. C. Rasmussen - Sommernat under den Gr\u00f8nlandske Kyst circa Aar 1000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Summer on the Greenland coast {{circa|1000}}]]\nThe economy of the Norse Greenlanders depended on a combination of pastoral farming with hunting and some fishing. Farmers kept cattle, sheep and goats - shipped into the island - for their milk, cheese and butter, while most of the consumed meat came from hunted caribou and seals. Both individual farmers and groups of farmers organised summer trips to the more northerly [[Disko Bay]] area where they hunted walruses, narwhals and polar bears for their skins, hides and ivory. Besides being used to make garments and shoes, these resources also functioned as a form of currency, as well as making up the most important export commodities.<ref>[https://www.ancient.eu/article/1208/viking-age-greenland/ Viking Age Greenland] ''Ancient History Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nThe settlements carried on a trade in [[ivory trade|ivory]] from [[walrus]] [[tusk]]s with Europe, as well as exporting rope, sheep, seals, wool and cattle hides (according to one 13th-century account). They depended on Iceland and Norway for iron tools, wood (especially for boat building, although they may also have obtained wood from coastal [[Labrador]] - ''[[Markland]]''), supplemental foodstuffs, and religious and social contacts. Trade ships from Iceland and Norway traveled to Greenland every year and would sometimes overwinter in Greenland. Beginning in the late-13th century, laws required all ships from Greenland to sail directly to Norway.  The climate became increasingly colder in the 14th and 15th centuries, during the period of colder weather known as the [[Little Ice Age]].\n\nIn 1126 the Roman Catholic Church founded a [[diocese]] at [[Gardar, Greenland|Gar\u00f0ar]] (now [[Igaliku]]). It was subject to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] archdiocese of [[Nidaros]] (now [[Trondheim]]); at least five churches in Norse Greenland are known from archeological remains. In 1261 the population accepted the overlordship of the [[King of Norway]], although it continued to have its own law. In 1380 the Norwegian kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. After initially thriving, the Norse settlements in Greenland declined in the 14th century. The Norse abandoned the Western Settlement around 1350. In 1378 there was no longer a [[bishop]] at Gar\u00f0ar. In 1402\u20131404, the [[Black Death]] hit Iceland for the first time and killed approximately half the population there - but there is no evidence that it reached Greenland.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=66333 | title=Hva\u00f0 er helst vita\u00f0 um svartadau\u00f0a \u00e1 \u00cdslandi?}}</ref> The last written record of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] Greenlanders documents a marriage in 1408 at [[Hvalsey Church]], whose ruins are the best-preserved of the Norse buildings of that period.\n\n[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Hvalsey Church]]\nAfter 1408 few written records mention the settlers.

In ''The Frozen Echo,'' [[Kirsten Seaver]] contests some of the more generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or [[Vinland]]. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. [[Midden]]s at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. [[Else Roesdahl]] argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.<ref name=\"Seaver 271\u2013292\">{{Cite journal|last=Seaver|first=Kirsten A.|date=2009-07-01|title=Desirable teeth: the medieval trade in Arctic and African ivory |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/div-classtitledesirable-teeth-the-medieval-trade-in-arctic-and-african-ivorya-hreffn1-ref-typefnadiv/50BFF0443A3CF1EB2C011672D54BAC76|journal=Journal of Global History|volume=4|issue=2|pages=271\u2013292|doi=10.1017/S1740022809003155 }}</ref>\n\nGreenland was always colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion of the soil was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland settlements may not have recognized until it was too late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. [[Palynologist]]s' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with [[soil erosion]] and [[deforestation]].<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{harvnb|Diamond|2005|p=217,222}}</ref> A Norse farm in the [[Vatnahverfi (Norse Greenland)|Vatnahverfi]] district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep.

However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool.

There are limited sources showing the two cultures interacting; however, scholars know that the Norse referred to the Inuit (and Vinland natives) as [[skr\u00e6ling]]. The ''[[Icelandic Annals]]'' are among the few existing sources that confirm contact between the Norse and the Inuit. They report an instance of hostility initiated by the Inuit against the Norse, leaving eighteen Greenlanders dead and two boys carried into slavery.<ref>Fitzhugh and Ward, 2000: p. 336</ref> Archaeological evidence seems to show that the Inuit traded with the Norse. On the other hand, the evidence shows many Norse artefacts at Inuit sites throughout Greenland and on the Canadian Arctic islands but very few Inuit artefacts in the Norse settlements. This may indicate either European indifference\u2014an instance of cultural resistance to Inuit crafts among them\u2014or perhaps hostile raiding by the Inuit. It is also quite possible that the Norse were trading for perishable items such as meat and furs and had little interest in other Inuit items, much as later Europeans who traded with Native Americans.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe Norse never learned the Inuit techniques of [[kayak]] navigation or [[Ringed seal|ring seal]] hunting. Archaeological evidence plainly establishes that by 1300 or so the Inuit had successfully expanded their winter settlements as close to the Europeans as the outer fjords of the Western Settlement. By 1350, the Norse had completely deserted their Western Settlement.<ref>{{cite book| last=Kendrick| first=Thomas Downing| author-link=T. D.

However, Christianity and European customs continued to hold sway among the Greenlanders for the greater part of the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1921, a Danish historian, Paul Norland, found human remains from the Eastern Settlement in the [[Herjolfsnes]] church courtyard. The bodies were dressed in 15th century medieval clothing with no indications of malnutrition or inbreeding.

It is clear that neither Danish and Norwegian nor Icelandic public functionaries were aware that the Norse Greenland colony had ceased to exist. Around 1514, the Norwegian archbishop Erik Valkendorf (Danish by birth, and still loyal to Christian II) planned an expedition to Greenland, which he believed to be part of a continuous northern landmass leading to the New World with all its wealth, and which he fully expected still to have a Norse population, whose members could be pressed anew to the bosom of church and crown after an interval of well over a hundred years.

This has led to much speculation and argument. Most archaeologists reject any decisive judgment based on this one fact, however, as fish bones decompose more quickly than other remains, and may have been disposed of in a different manner. Isotope analysis of the bones of inhabitants shows that marine food sources supplied more and more of the diet of the Norse Greenlanders, making up between 50% and 80% of their diet by the 14th century.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Arneborg |first=J. |last2=Heinemeier |first2=J. |last3=Lynnerup |first3=N. |last4=Nielsen |first4=H.L. |last5=Rud |first5=N. |last6=Sveinbjornsdottir |first6=A.E.|url=http://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2002/03/epn02301.pdf |title=C-14 dating and the disappearance of Norsemen from Greenland |journal=Europhysics News |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=77\u201380 |doi=10.1051/epn:2002301 |year=2002}}</ref>\n\nOne Inuit story recorded in the 18th century tells that raiding expeditions by European ships over the course of three years destroyed the settlement, after which many of the Norse sailed away south and the Inuit took in some of the remaining women and children before the final attack.<ref name=\"The Fate of Greenland's Vikings\"/>\n\n==Late Dorset and Thule cultures==\n[[Image:ThuleGreenlandersWhaling.png|right|thumbnail|The [[Thule (people)|Thule]] were skilled [[whaling|whalers]], as depicted here by Norwegian missionary [[Hans Egede]] in the 18th century.]]\n\nThe [[Late Dorset culture]] inhabited Greenland until the early fourteenth century.<ref>https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199766956.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199766956-e-36</ref> This culture was primarily located in the northwest of Greenland, far from the Norse who lived around the southern coasts.

The same ship that returned them, however, also brought the first [[Moravian church|Moravian missionaries]], who in time would convert a former [[angekok]] (Inuit shaman), experience a revival at their mission of [[Neu-Herrnhut|New Herrnhut]], and establish [[Moravian missions in Greenland|a string of mission houses along the southwest coast]]. Around the same time, the merchant [[Jacob Severin]] took over administration of the colony and its trade, and having secured a large royal stipend and full monopoly from the king, successfully repulsed the Dutch in a series of skirmishes in 1738 and 1739. Egede himself quit the colony on the death of his wife, leaving the Lutheran mission to his son [[Paul Egede|Poul]]. Both of them had studied the [[Kalaallisut language]] extensively and published works on it; as well, Poul and some of the other clergy sent by the Mission College, such as [[Otto Fabricius]], began wide-ranging study of Greenland's flora, fauna, and meteorology. However, though kale, lettuce, and other herbs were successfully introduced, repeated attempts to cultivate wheat or clover failed throughout Greenland, limiting the ability to raise European livestock.<ref name=\"BibNar\"/>\n\nAs a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to [[Sweden]] at the 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]]. The colonies, including Greenland, remained in Danish possession. The 19th century saw increased interest in the region on the part of polar explorers and scientists like [[William Scoresby]] and Greenland-born [[Knud Rasmussen]]. At the same time, the colonial elements of the earlier trade-oriented Danish presence in Greenland expanded. In 1861, the first [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic-language]] journal was founded. Danish law still applied only to the Danish settlers, though. At the turn of the 19th century, the northern part of Greenland was still sparsely populated; only scattered hunting inhabitants were found there.<ref>Nationalmuseet of Denmark. \"[http://www.natmus.dk/sw18658.asp Thule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313215205/http://www.natmus.dk/sw18658.asp |date=2007-03-13 }}\".</ref> During that century, however, Inuit families immigrated from [[British North America]] to settle in these areas. The last group from what later became Canada arrived in 1864. During the same time, the northeastern part of the coast became depopulated following the violent 1783 [[Lakag\u00edgar]] eruption in Iceland.\n\nDemocratic elections for the district assemblies of Greenland were held for the first time in 1862\u20131863, although no assembly for the land as a whole was allowed. In 1888, a party of six led by [[Fridtjof Nansen]] accomplished the first land crossing of Greenland. The men took 41 days to make the crossing on skis, at approximately 64\u00b0N latitude.<ref>Farley Mowat, ''The Polar Passion: The Quest for the North Pole''. McClelland and Stewart, 1967, pp. 199-222</ref> In 1911, two [[Landsting (Greenland)|Landstings]] were introduced, one for northern Greenland and one for southern Greenland, not to be finally merged until 1951. All this time, most decisions were made in [[Copenhagen]], where the Greenlanders had no representation. Towards the end of the 19th century, traders criticized the Danish trade monopoly. It was argued that it kept the natives in non-profitable ways of life, holding back the potentially large fishing industry. Many Greenlanders however were satisfied with the ''status quo'', as they felt the monopoly would secure the future of commercial whaling. It probably did not help that the only contact the local population had with the outside world was with Danish settlers. Nonetheless, the Danes gradually moved over their investments to the fishing industry.\n\nBy 1911, the population was about 14,000, scattered along the southern shores. They were nearly all Christian, thanks to the missionary efforts of Moravians and especially [[Hans Egede]] (1686\u20131758), a Lutheran missionary called \"the Apostle of Greenland.\" He founded Greenland's capital Godth\u00e5b, now known as Nuuk. His grandson [[Hans Egede Saabye]] (1746\u20131817) continued the missionary activities.<ref>Eve Garnett, ''To Greenland's icy mountains; the story of Hans Egede, explorer, coloniser, missionary'' (London: Heinemann. 1968)</ref>\n\n==Polar exploration==\nAt the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, American explorers, including [[Robert Peary]], explored the northern sections of Greenland, which up to that time had been a mystery and were often shown on maps as extending over the North Pole. Peary discovered that Greenland's northern coast in fact stopped well short of the pole. These discoveries were considered to be the basis of an American territorial claim in the area. But after the United States purchased the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] from Denmark in 1917, it agreed to relinquish all claims on Greenland.\n\n==Strategic importance==\n{{See also|History of Greenland during World War II|Denmark\u2013United_States_relations#Greenland}}\nAfter [[Norway]] regained full independence in 1905, it argued that Danish claims to Greenland were invalid since the island had been a Norwegian possession prior to 1815. In 1931, Norwegian meteorologist [[Hallvard Devold]] occupied uninhabited eastern Greenland, on his own initiative. After the fact, the occupation was supported by the Norwegian government, who claimed the area as [[Erik the Red's Land]]. Two years later, the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] ruled in favor of Denmark.\n\n[[Image:ThuleAirBase.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Thule Air Base]], established after [[World War II]], is the northernmost base of the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] ]]\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring [[World War II]], when [[Nazi Germany]] extended its war operations to Greenland, [[Henrik Kauffmann]], the [[Danish Ambassador to the United States|Danish Minister to the United States]]&nbsp;\u2014 who had already refused to recognize the German occupation of Denmark&nbsp;\u2014 signed a treaty with the United States on April 9, 1941, granting permission to establish stations in Greenland.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://arcticjournal.com/culture/2968/sledge-patrol|title=The Sledge Patrol|work=The Arctic Journal|access-date=2017-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308222716/http://arcticjournal.com/culture/2968/sledge-patrol|archive-date=2017-03-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kauffmann did this without the knowledge of the Danish government, and consequently \"the Danish government accused him of high treason, fired him and told him to come home immediately \u2013 none of which had any result\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Because it was difficult for the Danish government to govern the island during the war, and because of successful exports, especially of [[cryolite]], Greenland came to enjoy a rather independent status.

In 1953, Greenland was raised from the status of colony to that of an autonomous province or [[Countries of the Kingdom of Denmark|constituent country]] of the [[Danish Realm]]. Greenland was also assigned its own [[Counties of Denmark|Danish county]]. Despite its small population, it was provided nominal representation in the Danish [[Folketing]].\n\nA plantation of exotic arctic trees was created in 1954 near [[Narsarsuaq]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ign.ku.dk/om/arboreter/arboret-groenland/skovplantninger/ | title=Skovplantninger i Det Gr\u00f8nlandske Arboret| date=2013-10-10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenland flag on building.jpg|thumb|right|222px|[[Blok P]], the largest building in Greenland and formerly home to about 1% of its population, was demolished on October 19, 2012.]]\nDenmark also began a number of reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their dependence on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services such as health care, education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms have led to a number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous [[Blok P]] housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments.<ref>Bode, Mike & al. \"[http://www.artonline.jp/BGWG/mikestaffan/index.html Nuuk]\". 2003.

The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with [[Air Greenland]] and the [[Arctic Umiaq Line|Arctic Umiaq ferry]] heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former [[United States Air Force|US]] air base at [[Kangerlussuaq]] well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.\n\nGreenland's minimal representation in the Folketing meant that despite 70.3% of Greenlanders rejecting entry into the European [[European Economic Community|Common Market]] (EEC), it was pulled in along with Denmark in 1973. Fears that the [[customs union]] would allow foreign firms to compete and [[overfish]] its waters were quickly realized and the local parties began to push strongly for increased autonomy. The Folketing approved devolution in 1978 and the next year enacted [[Home rule#Greenland|home rule]] under a local [[Parliament of Greenland|Landsting]]. On 23 February 1982, a bare majority (53%) of Greenland's population voted to leave the EEC, a process which lasted until 1985.

Following a successful [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|referendum on self-government]] in 2008, the local parliament's powers were expanded and Danish was removed as an official language in 2009.\n\n[[International relations]] are now largely, but not entirely, also left to the discretion of the home rule government.

Their descendants apparently died out and were succeeded by several other groups migrating from continental [[North America]]. There has been no evidence discovered that Greenland was known to Europeans until the 10th century, when [[Iceland]]ic [[Viking]]s settled on its southwestern coast, which seems to have been uninhabited when they arrived. The ancestors of the [[Inuit]] Greenlanders who live there today appear to have migrated there later, around AD 1200, from northwestern Greenland.  While the Inuit survived in the icy world of the [[Little Ice Age]], the early [[Eastern Settlement|Norse settlements]] along the southwestern coast disappeared, leaving the Inuit as the only inhabitants of the island for several centuries. During this time, [[Denmark-Norway]], apparently believing the Norse settlements had survived, continued to claim sovereignty over the island despite the lack of any contact between the Norse Greenlanders and their Scandinavian brethren. In 1721, aspiring to become a [[Danish colonial empire|colonial power]], Denmark-Norway sent a missionary expedition to Greenland with the stated aim of reinstating Christianity among descendants of the Norse Greenlanders who may have reverted to [[Norse mythology|paganism]]. When the missionaries found no descendants of the Norse Greenlanders, they baptized the Inuit Greenlanders they found living there instead. Denmark-Norway then developed trading colonies along the coast and imposed a trade monopoly and other colonial privileges on the area.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], when Germany invaded Denmark, Greenlanders became socially and economically less connected to Denmark and more connected to the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/1944-12-27_Yanks_Clear_Greenland_of_Nazis |title=Yanks Clear Greenland of Nazis,1944/12/27 (1944) |author= |date= |website= |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> After the war, Denmark resumed control of Greenland and in 1953, converted its status from colony to overseas ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|amt]]'' (county).

During the 980s, explorers led by [[Erik the Red]] set out from [[Iceland]] and reached the southwest coast of Greenland, found the region uninhabited, and subsequently settled there.

He sailed to Greenland, where he explored the coastline and claimed certain regions as his own. He then returned to Iceland to persuade people to join him in establishing a settlement on Greenland. The Icelandic sagas say that 25 ships left Iceland with Erik the Red in 985, and that only 14 of them arrived safely in Greenland.<ref name=\"The Fate of Greenland's Vikings\">[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/greenland/ The Fate of Greenland's Vikings]</ref> This date has been approximately confirmed by radiocarbon dating of remains at the first settlement at [[Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0|Brattahlid]] (now [[Qassiarsuk]]), which yielded a date of about 1000. According to the sagas, it was also in the year 1000 that Erik's son, [[Leif Eirikson]], left the settlement to explore the regions around [[Vinland]], which historians generally assume to have been located in what is now [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].\n\nThe Norse established settlements along Greenland's fjords. It is possible, that the bottom of the southern fjords at that time were covered by highgrown shrub as well as surrounded by hills covered with grass and brush as the [[Qinngua Valley]] currently is, but this hasn't been determined yet. <ref>{{cite web | url = https://ign.ku.dk/english/about/arboreta/arboretum-greenland/forest-plantations/ |title=The Forest Plantations in The Greenlandic Arboretum |}}</ref> If the presumption is true then the Norse probably cleared the landscape by felling trees to use as building material and fuel, and by allowing their sheep and goats to graze there in both summer and winter. The occuring soil erosion could have been an important factor in the demise of the colonies, as the land was stripped of its natural cover.\n \nThe Norse settled in three separate locations in south-western Greenland: the larger [[Eastern Settlement]], the smaller [[Western Settlement]], and the still smaller [[Ivittuut|Middle Settlement]] (often considered part of the Eastern one). Estimates put the combined population of the settlements at their height between 2,000 and 10,000, with more recent estimates<ref>N. Lynnerup, in {{harvnb|Fitzhugh|Ward|2000}}</ref> trending toward the lower figure. Archeologists have identified the ruins of approximately 620 farms: 500 in the Eastern Settlement, 95 in the Western Settlement, and 20 in the Middle.\n\n[[File:I. E. C. Rasmussen - Sommernat under den Gr\u00f8nlandske Kyst circa Aar 1000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Summer on the Greenland coast {{circa|1000}}]]\nThe economy of the Norse Greenlanders depended on a combination of pastoral farming with hunting and some fishing. Farmers kept cattle, sheep and goats - shipped into the island - for their milk, cheese and butter, while most of the consumed meat came from hunted caribou and seals. Both individual farmers and groups of farmers organised summer trips to the more northerly [[Disko Bay]] area where they hunted walruses, narwhals and polar bears for their skins, hides and ivory. Besides being used to make garments and shoes, these resources also functioned as a form of currency, as well as making up the most important export commodities.<ref>[https://www.ancient.eu/article/1208/viking-age-greenland/ Viking Age Greenland] ''Ancient History Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nThe settlements carried on a trade in [[ivory trade|ivory]] from [[walrus]] [[tusk]]s with Europe, as well as exporting rope, sheep, seals, wool and cattle hides (according to one 13th-century account). They depended on Iceland and Norway for iron tools, wood (especially for boat building, although they may also have obtained wood from coastal [[Labrador]] - ''[[Markland]]''), supplemental foodstuffs, and religious and social contacts. Trade ships from Iceland and Norway traveled to Greenland every year and would sometimes overwinter in Greenland. Beginning in the late-13th century, laws required all ships from Greenland to sail directly to Norway.  The climate became increasingly colder in the 14th and 15th centuries, during the period of colder weather known as the [[Little Ice Age]].\n\nIn 1126 the Roman Catholic Church founded a [[diocese]] at [[Gardar, Greenland|Gar\u00f0ar]] (now [[Igaliku]]). It was subject to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] archdiocese of [[Nidaros]] (now [[Trondheim]]); at least five churches in Norse Greenland are known from archeological remains. In 1261 the population accepted the overlordship of the [[King of Norway]], although it continued to have its own law. In 1380 the Norwegian kingdom entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. After initially thriving, the Norse settlements in Greenland declined in the 14th century. The Norse abandoned the Western Settlement around 1350. In 1378 there was no longer a [[bishop]] at Gar\u00f0ar. In 1402\u20131404, the [[Black Death]] hit Iceland for the first time and killed approximately half the population there - but there is no evidence that it reached Greenland.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=66333 | title=Hva\u00f0 er helst vita\u00f0 um svartadau\u00f0a \u00e1 \u00cdslandi?}}</ref> The last written record of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] Greenlanders documents a marriage in 1408 at [[Hvalsey Church]], whose ruins are the best-preserved of the Norse buildings of that period.\n\n[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Hvalsey Church]]\nAfter 1408 few written records mention the settlers.

In ''The Frozen Echo,'' [[Kirsten Seaver]] contests some of the more generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or [[Vinland]]. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating impoverishment. [[Midden]]s at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. [[Else Roesdahl]] argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.<ref name=\"Seaver 271\u2013292\">{{Cite journal|last=Seaver|first=Kirsten A.|date=2009-07-01|title=Desirable teeth: the medieval trade in Arctic and African ivory |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/div-classtitledesirable-teeth-the-medieval-trade-in-arctic-and-african-ivorya-hreffn1-ref-typefnadiv/50BFF0443A3CF1EB2C011672D54BAC76|journal=Journal of Global History|volume=4|issue=2|pages=271\u2013292|doi=10.1017/S1740022809003155 }}</ref>\n\nGreenland was always colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion of the soil was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland settlements may not have recognized until it was too late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. [[Palynologist]]s' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with [[soil erosion]] and [[deforestation]].<ref name=\"Diamond\">{{harvnb|Diamond|2005|p=217,222}}</ref> A Norse farm in the [[Vatnahverfi (Norse Greenland)|Vatnahverfi]] district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of drifting sand up to 10 feet deep.

However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool.

There are limited sources showing the two cultures interacting; however, scholars know that the Norse referred to the Inuit (and Vinland natives) as [[skr\u00e6ling]]. The ''[[Icelandic Annals]]'' are among the few existing sources that confirm contact between the Norse and the Inuit. They report an instance of hostility initiated by the Inuit against the Norse, leaving eighteen Greenlanders dead and two boys carried into slavery.<ref>Fitzhugh and Ward, 2000: p. 336</ref> Archaeological evidence seems to show that the Inuit traded with the Norse. On the other hand, the evidence shows many Norse artefacts at Inuit sites throughout Greenland and on the Canadian Arctic islands but very few Inuit artefacts in the Norse settlements. This may indicate either European indifference\u2014an instance of cultural resistance to Inuit crafts among them\u2014or perhaps hostile raiding by the Inuit. It is also quite possible that the Norse were trading for perishable items such as meat and furs and had little interest in other Inuit items, much as later Europeans who traded with Native Americans.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe Norse never learned the Inuit techniques of [[kayak]] navigation or [[Ringed seal|ring seal]] hunting. Archaeological evidence plainly establishes that by 1300 or so the Inuit had successfully expanded their winter settlements as close to the Europeans as the outer fjords of the Western Settlement.

It is clear that neither Danish and Norwegian nor Icelandic public functionaries were aware that the Norse Greenland colony had ceased to exist. Around 1514, the Norwegian archbishop Erik Valkendorf (Danish by birth, and still loyal to Christian II) planned an expedition to Greenland, which he believed to be part of a continuous northern landmass leading to the New World with all its wealth, and which he fully expected still to have a Norse population, whose members could be pressed anew to the bosom of church and crown after an interval of well over a hundred years.

This has led to much speculation and argument.

This led to general confusion between [[Baffin Island]], Greenland, and [[Spitsbergen]], as seen, for example, in the difficulty locating the [[Frobisher Bay|Frobisher \"Strait\"]], which was not confirmed to be a bay until 1861. Nonetheless, interest in discovering a [[Northwest Passage]] to Asia led to repeated expeditions in the area, though none were successful until [[Northwest Passage#Roald Amundsen|Roald Amundsen]] in 1906 and even that success involved his being iced in for two years. [[Christian I of Denmark]] purportedly sent an expedition to the region under [[Hans Pothorst|Pothorst]] and [[Didrik Pining|Pining]] to Greenland in 1472 or 1473; [[Henry VII of England]] sent another under [[John Cabot|Cabot]] in 1497 and 1498; [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent a third under [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Corte-Real]] in 1500 and 1501.

Around the same time, the merchant [[Jacob Severin]] took over administration of the colony and its trade, and having secured a large royal stipend and full monopoly from the king, successfully repulsed the Dutch in a series of skirmishes in 1738 and 1739. Egede himself quit the colony on the death of his wife, leaving the Lutheran mission to his son [[Paul Egede|Poul]]. Both of them had studied the [[Kalaallisut language]] extensively and published works on it; as well, Poul and some of the other clergy sent by the Mission College, such as [[Otto Fabricius]], began wide-ranging study of Greenland's flora, fauna, and meteorology. However, though kale, lettuce, and other herbs were successfully introduced, repeated attempts to cultivate wheat or clover failed throughout Greenland, limiting the ability to raise European livestock.<ref name=\"BibNar\"/>\n\nAs a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to [[Sweden]] at the 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]]. The colonies, including Greenland, remained in Danish possession. The 19th century saw increased interest in the region on the part of polar explorers and scientists like [[William Scoresby]] and Greenland-born [[Knud Rasmussen]]. At the same time, the colonial elements of the earlier trade-oriented Danish presence in Greenland expanded. In 1861, the first [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic-language]] journal was founded. Danish law still applied only to the Danish settlers, though. At the turn of the 19th century, the northern part of Greenland was still sparsely populated; only scattered hunting inhabitants were found there.<ref>Nationalmuseet of Denmark. \"[http://www.natmus.dk/sw18658.asp Thule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313215205/http://www.natmus.dk/sw18658.asp |date=2007-03-13 }}\".</ref> During that century, however, Inuit families immigrated from [[British North America]] to settle in these areas. The last group from what later became Canada arrived in 1864. During the same time, the northeastern part of the coast became depopulated following the violent 1783 [[Lakag\u00edgar]] eruption in Iceland.\n\nDemocratic elections for the district assemblies of Greenland were held for the first time in 1862\u20131863, although no assembly for the land as a whole was allowed. In 1888, a party of six led by [[Fridtjof Nansen]] accomplished the first land crossing of Greenland. The men took 41 days to make the crossing on skis, at approximately 64\u00b0N latitude.<ref>Farley Mowat, ''The Polar Passion: The Quest for the North Pole''. McClelland and Stewart, 1967, pp. 199-222</ref> In 1911, two [[Landsting (Greenland)|Landstings]] were introduced, one for northern Greenland and one for southern Greenland, not to be finally merged until 1951. All this time, most decisions were made in [[Copenhagen]], where the Greenlanders had no representation. Towards the end of the 19th century, traders criticized the Danish trade monopoly. It was argued that it kept the natives in non-profitable ways of life, holding back the potentially large fishing industry. Many Greenlanders however were satisfied with the ''status quo'', as they felt the monopoly would secure the future of commercial whaling. It probably did not help that the only contact the local population had with the outside world was with Danish settlers. Nonetheless, the Danes gradually moved over their investments to the fishing industry.\n\nBy 1911, the population was about 14,000, scattered along the southern shores. They were nearly all Christian, thanks to the missionary efforts of Moravians and especially [[Hans Egede]] (1686\u20131758), a Lutheran missionary called \"the Apostle of Greenland.\" He founded Greenland's capital Godth\u00e5b, now known as Nuuk. His grandson [[Hans Egede Saabye]] (1746\u20131817) continued the missionary activities.<ref>Eve Garnett, ''To Greenland's icy mountains; the story of Hans Egede, explorer, coloniser, missionary'' (London: Heinemann. 1968)</ref>\n\n==Polar exploration==\nAt the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, American explorers, including [[Robert Peary]], explored the northern sections of Greenland, which up to that time had been a mystery and were often shown on maps as extending over the North Pole. Peary discovered that Greenland's northern coast in fact stopped well short of the pole. These discoveries were considered to be the basis of an American territorial claim in the area. But after the United States purchased the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] from Denmark in 1917, it agreed to relinquish all claims on Greenland.\n\n==Strategic importance==\n{{See also|History of Greenland during World War II|Denmark\u2013United_States_relations#Greenland}}\nAfter [[Norway]] regained full independence in 1905, it argued that Danish claims to Greenland were invalid since the island had been a Norwegian possession prior to 1815. In 1931, Norwegian meteorologist [[Hallvard Devold]] occupied uninhabited eastern Greenland, on his own initiative. After the fact, the occupation was supported by the Norwegian government, who claimed the area as [[Erik the Red's Land]].

These well-meaning reforms have led to a number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous [[Blok P]] housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit through the doors in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments.<ref>Bode, Mike & al. \"[http://www.artonline.jp/BGWG/mikestaffan/index.html Nuuk]\". 2003.

The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany. None of these institutions describes itself as a \"yeshiva\".\n\n====Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas====\n[[File:The old Beis Madrash Building of BMG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Beth Medrash Govoha]], Lakewood, New Jersey -  largest yeshiva outside Israel.<ref name=LargestYeshivaOutsideIsrael>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/04/lakewood-yeshiva-looks-to-use-old-golf-course-for-new-campus.html|title=Lakewood yeshiva looks to use old golf course for new campus|author=Steve Strunsky|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|date=April 16, 2019|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=Beth Medrash Gohova is said to be the world\u2019s largest Jewish-affiliated university outside of Israel.}}</ref><ref name=LargestYeshivaNorthAmerica>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/ocean/2017/08/11_ways_lakewood_is_like_nowhere_else_in_nj.html|title=10 ways Lakewood is unlike anywhere else in N.J.|author=Stephen Stirling|publisher=NJ Advance Media|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=The sea change can be pinned to one event: The founding of the Beth Medrash Govoha yeshiva in the mid-20th century.

Students are known as ''talmidim''.\n\n===Academic year===\n{{see also|Bein Hazmanim}}\nIn most yeshivot, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called ''zmanim'' (lit. times; sing. ''zman''). ''Elul zman'' starts from the beginning of the Hebrew month of [[Elul]] and extends until the end of [[Yom Kippur]]. The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur. Winter ''zman'' starts after [[Sukkot]] and lasts until about two weeks before [[Passover]], a duration of five months (six in a [[Jewish calendar|Jewish leap year]]).

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\nTraditionally, religious girls' schools are not called \"yeshiva.\" The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud. They are also sometimes called \"yeshiva\" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva). Post-high schools for women are generally called \"seminary\" or ''\"[[midrasha]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most Lithuanian and Hasidic yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in Jerusalem and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\nSephardi, Modern Orthodox, Zionist, and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis.

Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels, in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot, the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], sometimes  [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Jewish educational institution for Torah study}}\n{{About| the Jewish educational system|the private university|Yeshiva University| the website|Yeshiva.co}}\n{{original research|date=April 2019}}\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|religion}} \n[[File:Mirs 14.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Mir Yeshiva (Jerusalem)]] - largest yeshiva in the world]]\n[[File:BaisMedrashInterior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical [[beth midrash|''bet midrash'']] - [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]], [[Baltimore]]]]\n[[File:Carteret beis medrash.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Chavrusas in study - [[Yeshiva Gedola of Carteret]]]]\n[[File:OrYisrael8885.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Morning ''seder'', [[Petah_Tikva#Schools_and_religious_institutions|Or-Yisrael]] (a yeshiva founded by the [[Chazon Ish]])]]\n[[File:RoyLindmanRabbinicalSchoolJerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students in ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]]'', [[Jerusalem]]]]\n[[File:Rav_Kav_giving_Shiur_Klali_in_Yeshivas_Kerem_B'Yavne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Shiur klali'', [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]]]]\nA '''yeshiva''' ({{IPAc-en|j|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0283|i\u02d0|v|\u0259}}; {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4||sitting}}; pl. {{rtl-lang|he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea}}, {{transl|he|yeshivot}} or {{transl|he|yeshivos}}) is a [[Jewish education|Jewish]] [[educational institution]] that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the [[Talmud]] and the [[Torah]], and [[Halacha]] (Jewish law).

Today, all non-Orthodox and a few [[Modern Orthodox]] yeshivas are open to females.

The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany. None of these institutions describes itself as a \"yeshiva\".\n\n====Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas====\n[[File:The old Beis Madrash Building of BMG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Beth Medrash Govoha]], Lakewood, New Jersey -  largest yeshiva outside Israel.<ref name=LargestYeshivaOutsideIsrael>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/04/lakewood-yeshiva-looks-to-use-old-golf-course-for-new-campus.html|title=Lakewood yeshiva looks to use old golf course for new campus|author=Steve Strunsky|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|date=April 16, 2019|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=Beth Medrash Gohova is said to be the world\u2019s largest Jewish-affiliated university outside of Israel.}}</ref><ref name=LargestYeshivaNorthAmerica>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/ocean/2017/08/11_ways_lakewood_is_like_nowhere_else_in_nj.html|title=10 ways Lakewood is unlike anywhere else in N.J.|author=Stephen Stirling|publisher=NJ Advance Media|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=The sea change can be pinned to one event: The founding of the Beth Medrash Govoha yeshiva in the mid-20th century.

The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur.

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\nTraditionally, religious girls' schools are not called \"yeshiva.\" The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud. They are also sometimes called \"yeshiva\" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva). Post-high schools for women are generally called \"seminary\" or ''\"[[midrasha]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most Lithuanian and Hasidic yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in Jerusalem and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\nSephardi, Modern Orthodox, Zionist, and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis.

The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, ''halacha'', and Philosophy, with an [[Biblical_criticism#Contemporary_methods|openness to modern scholarship]]. \nNote that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\".<ref name=\"Blane\">Rabbi [[Steven Blane]] (N.D.). [https://jsli.net/apply-online/ordination-weekends/ \"Ordination and Semicha\"], jsli.net</ref> \n(These institutions' focus is also on \"the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work\". <ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ordination-semihah/2/ Ordination (Semicha)], myjewishlearning.com</ref>)\n[[Rabbi#Conservative_Judaism|Conservative programs]] occupy a position midway.<ref name=\"Blane\"/>\n\n===Talmud study===\n:''See also: [[Talmud #Commentaries]]; [[Gemara]]; [[Mishnah]]''\nIn the typical Orthodox yeshiva, the main emphasis is on Talmud study and analysis, or  ''[[Gemara]]''. Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels, in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot, the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], sometimes  [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Eliezer Yehuda Finkel\u2192Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (Poland and Jerusalem)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva"}

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of the day Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Earlier the same day Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester, and having rendezvoused with Wilmot, now had some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref>\n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it be necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of the day Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Earlier the same day Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester, and having rendezvoused with Wilmot, now had some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref>\n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

It covered part of the city of [[Plymouth]] in [[South West England]], including the former borough of [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]].\n\n== History ==\nThe constituency was created as '''Devonport''' in 1832, and elected two members until 1918, when the number was reduced to one.  Following the amalgamation of Devonport into Plymouth, the constituency was renamed as Plymouth, Devonport.\n\nDevonport has had a number of prominent MPs, including [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]], [[Michael Foot]] (who began his Commons career in the seat), and the former [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]] leader [[David Owen]]. One of its longest serving MPs was the National Liberal, later Conservative [[Dame Joan Vickers]], who held the seat from 1955 until her defeat at the General Election of February 1974.\n\n===Abolition===\nFollowing the [[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] by the [[Boundary Commission for England]], constituencies in Plymouth were reorganised, with both Plymouth Sutton and Plymouth Devonport being replaced by new constituencies of [[Plymouth Sutton and Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Sutton and Devonport]] and [[Plymouth Moor View (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Moor View]] from [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]].<ref name=\"BCEDevon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Devon_Plymouth_Torbay.doc |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091102211237/http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Devon_Plymouth_Torbay.doc |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 November 2009 |title=Final recommendations for Parliamentary constituencies in the counties of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay |publisher=[[Boundary Commission for England]] |date=24 November 2004 |accessdate=25 April 2010 }}</ref> The vast majority (nearly 90%) of the Plymouth Devonport constituency became part of the new Plymouth Moor View constituency; the exception was Devonport ward which became part of Plymouth Sutton and Devonport.\n<ref name=\"handbook\">{{cite book\n |last1= Waller\n |first1= Robert\n |last2= Criddle\n |first2= Byron\n |date= 2007\n |title= The Almanac of British Politics\n |edition= 8th\n |location=UK\n |publisher=Routledge\n |page= 750\n |isbn=978-0-415-37823-9}}</ref>\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918\u20131950''': The County Borough of Plymouth wards of Ford, Keyham, Molesworth, Nelson, St Aubyn, and St Budeaux.\n\n'''1950\u20131955''': The County Borough of Plymouth wards of Ford, Keyham, Molesworth, Mount Edgecumbe, Nelson, Pennycross, St Aubyn, St Budeaux, St Peter, and Stoke; and the parish of Tamerton Foliot in the Rural District of Plympton St Mary.\n\n'''1955\u20131974''': The County Borough of Plymouth wards of Drake, Ernesettle, Ford, Molesworth, Nelson, St Andrew, St Aubyn, St Budeaux, St Peter, and Stoke.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The County Borough of Plymouth wards of Ernesettle, Ford, St Andrew, St Aubyn, St Budeaux, St Peter, and Stoke.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The City of Plymouth wards of Budshead, Estover, Ham, Honicknowle, Keyham, St Budeaux, and Southway.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The City of Plymouth wards of Budshead, Eggbuckland, Estover, Ham, Honicknowle, Keyham, St Budeaux, and Southway.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1983, the constituency included Plymouth city centre.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\n=== MPs 1832\u20131918 ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!!!First member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|d|2|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!First party!!!!Second member<ref name=\"rayment\"/>!!Second party\n|-\n|[[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832]]\n| style=\"background-color: {{Whigs (British political party)/meta/color}}\" |\n|Sir [[Edward Codrington]]||[[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]]<ref name=\"stooks-smith\">{{cite book\n |last=Stooks Smith\n |first=Henry.\n |editor=[[F.

It covered part of the city of [[Plymouth]] in [[South West England]], including the former borough of [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]].\n\n== History ==\nThe constituency was created as '''Devonport''' in 1832, and elected two members until 1918, when the number was reduced to one.  Following the amalgamation of Devonport into Plymouth, the constituency was renamed as Plymouth, Devonport.\n\nDevonport has had a number of prominent MPs, including [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]], [[Michael Foot]] (who began his Commons career in the seat), and the former [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]] leader [[David Owen]]. One of its longest serving MPs was the National Liberal, later Conservative [[Dame Joan Vickers]], who held the seat from 1955 until her defeat at the General Election of February 1974.\n\n===Abolition===\nFollowing the [[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] by the [[Boundary Commission for England]], constituencies in Plymouth were reorganised, with both Plymouth Sutton and Plymouth Devonport being replaced by new constituencies of [[Plymouth Sutton and Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Sutton and Devonport]] and [[Plymouth Moor View (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Moor View]] from [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]].<ref name=\"BCEDevon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Devon_Plymouth_Torbay.doc |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091102211237/http://www.boundarycommissionforengland.org.uk/review_areas/downloads/FR_NR_Devon_Plymouth_Torbay.doc |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 November 2009 |title=Final recommendations for Parliamentary constituencies in the counties of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay |publisher=[[Boundary Commission for England]] |date=24 November 2004 |accessdate=25 April 2010 }}</ref> The vast majority (nearly 90%) of the Plymouth Devonport constituency became part of the new Plymouth Moor View constituency; the exception was Devonport ward which became part of Plymouth Sutton and Devonport.\n<ref name=\"handbook\">{{cite book\n |last1= Waller\n |first1= Robert\n |last2= Criddle\n |first2= Byron\n |date= 2007\n |title= The Almanac of British Politics\n |edition= 8th\n |location=UK\n |publisher=Routledge\n |page= 750\n |isbn=978-0-415-37823-9}}</ref>\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918\u20131950''': The County Borough of Plymouth wards of Ford, Keyham, Molesworth, Nelson, St Aubyn, and St Budeaux.\n\n'''1950\u20131955''': The County Borough of Plymouth wards of Ford, Keyham, Molesworth, Mount Edgecumbe, Nelson, Pennycross, St Aubyn, St Budeaux, St Peter, and Stoke; and the parish of Tamerton Foliot in the Rural District of Plympton St Mary.\n\n'''1955\u20131974''': The County Borough of Plymouth wards of Drake, Ernesettle, Ford, Molesworth, Nelson, St Andrew, St Aubyn, St Budeaux, St Peter, and Stoke.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The County Borough of Plymouth wards of Ernesettle, Ford, St Andrew, St Aubyn, St Budeaux, St Peter, and Stoke.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The City of Plymouth wards of Budshead, Estover, Ham, Honicknowle, Keyham, St Budeaux, and Southway.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The City of Plymouth wards of Budshead, Eggbuckland, Estover, Ham, Honicknowle, Keyham, St Budeaux, and Southway.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1983, the constituency included Plymouth city centre.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\n=== MPs 1832\u20131918 ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!!!First member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|d|2|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!First party!!!!Second member<ref name=\"rayment\"/>!!Second party\n|-\n|[[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832]]\n| style=\"background-color: {{Whigs (British political party)/meta/color}}\" |\n|Sir [[Edward Codrington]]||[[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]]<ref name=\"stooks-smith\">{{cite book\n |last=Stooks Smith\n |first=Henry.\n |editor=[[F.

This position paper was used by CFFC as the basis for the New York Times ad. CFFC's statement said that the [[Catholic Church]]'s doctrine condemning [[abortion]] as \"morally wrong in all instances\" was \"not the only legitimate Catholic position.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sturdyroots.org/PDFs/VOC/VOC_NYTimesAdpdf.pdf |title=A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion |work=Voices of Change: Risking All In Faith |publisher=Sturdy Roots |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216220911/http://sturdyroots.org/PDFs/VOC/VOC_NYTimesAdpdf.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-16 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> It said that \"a large number\" of Catholic theologians considered abortion to be a moral choice in some cases and cited a recent survey which found that only 11% of Catholics believed that abortion was wrong under all circumstances. It called for [[value pluralism]] and discussion within the Church on the subject. More signatures were added, bringing the total to 97 prominent Catholics including theologians, nuns, priests and lay persons.\n\nThe advertisement was intended to help 1984 vice-presidential candidate [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a pro-choice Catholic, to resist the sharp criticism directed at her by [[Archbishop of New York]] [[John Joseph O'Connor]] during the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 U.S. presidential election]]. Following the ad's publication, the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] denounced it and called it contrary to \"the clear and consistent teaching of the church that deliberately chosen abortion is objectively immoral.\" Subsequently, the Vatican pursued recantings by or reprimands of the signers who were directly subject to Church authority, including 24 nuns who became known as the \"Vatican 24\". Some signers recanted their affiliation with CFFC; most were said by their superiors to be in line with Catholic teaching.

It called for [[value pluralism]] and discussion within the Church on the subject. More signatures were added, bringing the total to 97 prominent Catholics including theologians, nuns, priests and lay persons.\n\nThe advertisement was intended to help 1984 vice-presidential candidate [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a pro-choice Catholic, to resist the sharp criticism directed at her by [[Archbishop of New York]] [[John Joseph O'Connor]] during the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 U.S. presidential election]]. Following the ad's publication, the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] denounced it and called it contrary to \"the clear and consistent teaching of the church that deliberately chosen abortion is objectively immoral.\" Subsequently, the Vatican pursued recantings by or reprimands of the signers who were directly subject to Church authority, including 24 nuns who became known as the \"Vatican 24\". Some signers recanted their affiliation with CFFC; most were said by their superiors to be in line with Catholic teaching.

{"title_page": "US-1 Trucks", "text_new": "[[File:US1Introduction1981.jpg|thumb|1981 Tyco Catalog Introduction to US-1 Electric Trucking]]\n\n'''US-1 Electric Trucking''', produced by [[Tyco Toys]] from 1981 to 1986, is a line of [[HO scale]] slot car sets focused around trucks. It was similar to previous Tyco HO Scale racing sets; however the vehicles could be run in reverse due to having guide pins at the front and rear of the chassis. The line was unique because most of the vehicles were able to pick up and deliver loads from various \u2018Action Accessories\u2019 without intervention from the operator.\n\nOne of those involved in the development of US-1 was Derek A. Brand (1926 to 2012) who had designed the first HO slot system - [[mettoy|Playcraft]] Electric Highways, which was launched in 1959. He also laid down the geometric principles of HO slot car track systems that Tyco and many other manufacturers followed for many years. (The 9\" roadway straight was derived from Atlas HO model railroad 'Snap Track', to enable his model highways use with model railroad layouts).\n\nWhile only lasting six years, a number of sets were made, with one being based on the [[G.I. Joe]] franchise. Many trucks, trailers, and other vehicles were produced, such as dump trucks, a car hauler and a fire truck. It was marketed under the tagline of \"You Control The Action!\"\n\n== How it works ==\n[[File:Custom Track Layout.jpg|left|thumb|Basic, Custom Track Layout]]\n'''Electrical''': The system was originally designed to be operated from a 6v dc supply, this later increased to 9v dc. [[Transformer]]s were supplied with the sets, but the vehicles can be safely worked from most modern conventional model railroad transformer/controllers, if the original US-1 control gear is not used.\n\n'''Track''': The trucks run on a gray variant of the Tyco Quick Clik track that provides power to the vehicles through two thin metal strips in the track, which is similar to many other HO scale road and racing systems. The track was initially produced with yellow centre lines and some other markings, although this is less common and most track was supplied unmarked.\n\nTwo types of trailing turnouts were made that allowed the vehicles to pass through unimpeded and then, if required, reverse back into a siding to access an Action Accessory. These junctions consisted of a sprung copper tongue that extended across the slot, interacting with the front and rear guide pins. A switchable '''Hi Adventure''' junction was supplied in the GI Joe set, which would allow vehicles to travel in either direction without being automatically directed into a siding. Various combinations of track sections were supplied in the sets, except the 45 degree 12\" radius curves, which were only sold separately and are hard to find. Other rare track pieces include the 9\" double turnout that only appeared in two sets and the Railroad [[grade crossing]].\n\n'''Chassis''': Longitudinal copper pick-up shoes span almost the entire length of the chassis, which transfer the power to the [[Electric motor|motor]]. The pick-ups were held in by screws and could be replaced, although some later vehicles are known to have rivets instead of screws. The motor itself is a universal clip-in type that uses a worm screw to turn a [[worm wheel]] on the rear axle. These worms and gears were originally brown, but on most vehicles they are white.\n\nAt the front and back of the chassis, guide pins keep the truck on the track, allowing it to go in reverse. Guide pins were originally brown plastic blades mounted on a wedge-shaped base, but later and most commonly, round metal pins were used. On most chassis there are two raised angled strips molded on either side of the guide pin mount, which stopped the original plastic guide blades rotating. Comparatively few chassis are without these. The actual pin mounting never changed and either type of pin can be fitted to any vehicle.\n\nThe rear axle has removable [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]] [[tires]], that will get hard over time and consequently lose grip. These occasionally require replacing. However the front axle, the extra axle on the three six-wheeled vehicles, all the axles on the trailers (and even those on the dummy Firebird) had hard plastic tires which run freely and with hardly any drag. Only the higher Stomper chassis had rubber tires front and rear.\n\nEach vehicle carries two weights - a flat plate at the front and a block at the rear with a tunnel to clear the worm gear. The rear weights vary in size to suit the vehicle. On the [[Semi-trailer truck]] (or [[Tractor unit]]) the rear weight was black and [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] in the  form of a [[Fifth-wheel coupling]] where the trailer was attached. These give the vehicle more traction and help it to pass through the sprung junctions, which can cause lighter (non US-1) vehicles to stall.\n\n'''Working Features''': The Wrecker and the Fire Truck both carried flashing lights, the latter carried a bell, too. These were [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanically]] activated by a geared drive taken off the rear axle. Despite those features being added, the core chassis inside these two vehicles, were the same as all the others in the range except the Stompers, which used a bespoke deeper chassis [[Injection moulding|molding]] to accommodate the lower reach required by the pick ups, which was necessary because of the higher tires.\n\nOperation of the accessories is done automatically, usually by contact with the truck or trailer. However, in the case of the crane, bulldozer, and airport, the accessory is operated by the vehicle's drive wheels acting on a roller, (as it continues to be powered in reverse, whilst pushing against a stop block).\n\n'''Controllers''': Since this was a roadway system instead of a race track, the controllers were not hand-held, but were intended to resemble the [[dashboard]] of a truck. Originally separate and attached to the track via some wires, each controller had a [[steering wheel]] (to control the speed) and a switch mounted to the side (to control the direction).\n\nThe first type of controllers are known to exist both with and without the yellow lines on the road surface. The output from the transformer was plugged directly into the terminal rail attached to the two controllers.\n\nLater these individual units were simplified so the steering wheel did both speed and direction. By this time yellow markings had stopped being applied to the road surface.\n\nThe final type of controllers came as one twin unit in the form of a single box, attached to a molded base on the side of the track and these also only had two steering wheels, which were mounted side by side. The transformer connection now plugged directly into the control box instead of the track. \n\nControllers are usually red but some of the final version were molded in green for the G.I. Joe and Stomper sets. The green ones only exist in this final twin version.\n\n== Vehicles & Trucks ==\n[[File:4 US-1 Trucks.jpg|thumb|2 Dump Trucks, a Semi Truck, & Fire Truck]]\nThe core chassis of all vehicles are of the same basic design throughout the range, (with only the Stompers using a different chassis molding) but there were many body types and different colors.\n\nThere were two makes of '''[[Semi-trailer truck|Semi-Tractor]]''' trucks modeled: One a [[Peterbilt]] conventional, the other a [[Kenworth]] C.O.E. ([[cab over engine]]). Both types had four wheels and were made to pull [[Semi-trailers]] in box, tank, flatbed, auto transporter and hopper varieties, using their exposed metal rear chassis weight which was also the Fifth Wheel Coupling.\n\nAll other vehicles except the wrecker and fire truck had plain rear chassis weights, which were hidden by the vehicle body.\n\nThere were three '''six-wheeled Peterbilt trucks''': [[dump truck]] (or tipper), troop carrier and a [[Vehicle recovery|Wrecker]]. On these, the extra axle was mounted under the body assembly.\n\n'''Other vehicles''' included a [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] [[Fire Truck]], [[police car]], [[Taxicab|taxi]], [[Pickup truck]], [[Dodge]] [[Panel van|delivery van]], [[ambulance]], [[Jeep]], and a [[Pontiac Firebird]] [[Coup\u00e9]] - The Firebird appeared in both powered (black color with gold eagle) and unpowered (white with black eagle) form, the latter for towing by the wrecker. The dummy car had a plastic chassis with a metal clip to help engage the jib of the wrecker.\n\n'''Body Colors''' were generally molded in pre-colored plastic, although the earliest known version of the Green and the Red Tipper, the Yellow/Orange and Red/White Strip Peterbilt Semi-tractors were molded in white plastic and given a painted finish. The same is true of the Mack Fire Truck, Airport Taxi, [[Goodyear Tires]] pick-up truck, Black Firebird and even the Police car, which was painted all over white before the blue panels, etc. were added. After-market re-sprays of models are becoming more common, too, they are sometimes offered for sale on Internet auction sites.\n\n'''Lights''': As well as the Wrecker and Fire Truck mentioned earlier, a number of Peterbilt trucks were made with working lights. These had a small bulb soldered to the two motor contacts. This nested in a recess within a clear plastic molding that plugged into the front grill and some openings in the cab roof. This also served as glazing in the cab windows.\n\nThe clear plastic transmitted the light from the bulb to the two rectangular headlights either side of the grille, two round lights in the bumper and an array on the cab roof. These lit up when the vehicle was travelling.\n\nThe radiator molding used on lighted trucks differed from the unlit ones as the rectangular headlights were left open, where normally they would be solid and in chrome finish like the rest of it. A similar molding to the clear one, but in dark plastic was also used in some trucks without lights, which makes them look as though they have heavily tinted windows!\n\nLighted versions of the following trucks are known: ''Peterbilt Semi-Tractors'': Yellow with Orange and Black Stripes, Red with White Stripes, Black with Gold Stripes, Yellow with Red Stripes. ''Peterbilt Tippers'' were also advertised with lights in the common Green, White with Brown and Orange Stripes and \u2018Dept of Highways\u2019 in Red and Black, however others are known such as the all over Red (Painted finish), Blue cab with the Yellow bucket and Blue cab with Silver bucket.\n\nLighted trucks were only supplied in one set 'Night Haulers',  which contained a green tipper and a red semi with white stripes. Although two lighted Kenworth trucks were sold in the racing series, there were none in the US-1 series. See '''Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1''' \n\n'''Variations''': Over the years, a number of changes were made to the Peterbilt tipper mouldings. Following the release of the initial painted versions, production switched to pre-coloured plastic and a small ridge appeared lengthways in the middle of the rear of the dump bed, where the tailgate rested when shut. This ridge did not last long and was removed by the time the tail gate gained a bottom lug and matching receptor in the bucket to aid more secure closing. At the same time the originally round hinges became oval to allow the extra travel needed to open/close it.\n\nThe final change to the tipper bucket was when the tail gate changed to a fat 'T' shape, with 'stubs' added at the top on either side and the hinges were enlarged again and made thinner to accommodate these. This makes them rather fragile too. It is quite common to find these later hinges broken and the tailgate missing, whereas the earlier thicker hinges normally survive.\n\nFrom around 1983, Peterbilt Semis and Tippers both acquired an oval 'Peterbilt' logo on the sides of the hood and the front of the [[Radiator]]. The name \"Peterbilt\" can be clearly seen with a magnifier. Finally, when the tipper chassis was adapted with extra slots to take the troop-carrier body for the GI Joe set in 1984, the opening above the motor was changed from a square to a T shape.\n\nAs of April 2020, none of the plain Green Tippers or the common Semi-Tractors in either yellow and orange (with black stripes) or red (with white stripes)-(Unlighted version), have been found with the Peterbilt logos. Nor have any green Tippers been found with the troop carrier modifications to the base or with the final 'T' shaped tailgate and thinner hinges on the bucket. \n\nAs these trucks appeared in several sets that were available until the end of the range, this remains an interesting and so far unexplained anomaly. From the examples seen it would appear that the same is true for the less common red tipper, although this is thought to have only ever been included in one set. However, the red Semi-tractor with white stripes (lighted version), can be found both with and without the Peterbilt logos.\n\nAlthough the Stomper [[Blazer|Blazer]] enjoyed a very short life, variations are known: Test-shot moldings exist that include a clear plastic light bar, although no light bar has ever been found fitted on production models in this series, nor was any US-1 Blazer ever fitted with lights. The headlights on the body shell are just open round holes. Early bodies were supplied fitted with a pair of thin weights, secured sandwich-like, at the rear of the body, by two plastic prongs, melted over to hold them in place. Most examples found seem not to have these.\n\n'''Trailers''' The flat bed trailer comes in two distinct variations. The rear panel is either completely smooth or has a 6mm long ridge across the bottom. All the different color versions of the flat bed can be found both with and without this feature. \nThe ridge appears to have been added later as it also appears on a small number of hopper trailers. \n\nAll post US-1 Box trailers have this too.

Some were based on designs which were originally part of the Tyco model railroad range. A full list appears later, but they are each worth describing in detail.\n\n'''Gravel''' \u2013 There was a small brown '''Gravel Unloading''' bin designed to sit under a length of single track that had a small oblong opening and a flat [[billboard]] at the end, where a single green 'Gravel' sticker was applied facing the track. The rear side was heavily reinforced by two half round molded pillars. As the gravel trailer was reversed into this, a raised portion of the roadway engaged with and opened the shutter underneath the trailer, causing the gravel to fall through the opening and into the bin.\n\nThis special track was later modified, gaining a box with raised sides around the opening, presumably to prevent spillages. Meanwhile, two long slots were also added on the sides to enable it to lock over the front of the gravel hopper to form the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' (see below). At the same time the billboard at the end was made double sided, by removing the reinforcing ribs at the rear, so that it could now take a green and white 'Gravel' sticker on each face.\n\nThe brown gravel bin was originally supplied with a tan-painted floor, discontinuing that was probably an early cost-cutting measure.\n\nTo fill the gravel trailer, there was an orange '''Operating Overhead Gravel Hopper''' that stood on a gantry over another type of single-road section (this was also used under the '''Barrel Loader'''). As the gravel trailer was reversed under the hopper it opened a shutter and was filled with gravel, ready to be driven away. This hopper was supplied with a small billboard type 'Gravel' sign that attached to the front of the hopper by two prongs. These are quite vulnerable and today are nearly always found broken. Adhesive putty can be used to mount billboards with broken prongs on the frame of the orange hopper. This is where it was often shown on the set box illustrations - (See Tyco Truck Resource link below).\n\nThe same hopper could be used as part of the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which consisted of a set of '''Elevated Piers''' and a later version of the section of track supplied with the '''Gravel Unloading''' bin. This time that unloading track was intended to be positioned above the hopper, making it possible to fill your gravel trailer, drive around the circuit and then put that same gravel back in the same hopper ready to do it all again! The included instruction sheet shows a track diagram of how to arrange the track to achieve this and details where to position all six graduated height Elevated Piers.\n\nThe '''Gravel Supply Terminal''' was a 'dock' where a gravel trailer could park. There was a small brown building with a black roof at the far end.  Although there was no loading or unloading here, a neat little mechanism allowed the Semi-Tractor to reverse in and automatically hitch or un-hitch the trailer as required.\n\nThe same dock molding was used for the '''Freight Terminal''' where one of the Box Trailers could be parked, which worked in the same way. This had an even smaller yellow hut with a gray roof at the far end. Usually the gravel terminal mechanism has fewer moving parts than that in the freight terminal, but on early examples the mechanisms were identical.\n\nOriginal US-1 gravel was made of small plastic pellets and was supplied in a sealed clear plastic packet, but is often lost. [[Mung bean|Mung Beans]] look similar and make a perfect replacement.\n\n'''Crates''' \u2013 These are sturdy looking objects which were set out on a gray platform outside a cream shed. This was the '''Crate Loader'''. As the flat trailer was reversed in, it pushed the platform back into the shed and the crates went onto the trailer.\n\nThe '''Crate Unloader''' is a light gray platform at one side of a single track with a small yard on the other. Access was through a tall dark gray hoop from which a hinged flap is hanging. The ominous yellow and black hatchings and the words \u2018Unload Here\u2019 are a clue to what happens \u2013 the trailer loaded with crates is reversed under the flap, which hinges open away from the main road, allowing the trailer and crates to pass beneath, but as the trailer is withdrawn, the flap locks vertical and rigid, then brutally tears the crates from the trailer onto the floor, irrespective of any \u2018Fragile\u2019, \u2018Handle With Care\u2019 or \u2018This Way Up\u2019 stickers that might be applied to them.\n\nIn the Army Transport set this Action Accessory became an '''Ammunition Dump''' with different stickers and the crates were a darker brown. Replica crates have been produced but were not widely available. If originals or replicas are unavailable, a 1\" Wooden Cube suffices. \n\n'''Car Loader''' \u2013 Similar in principle to the crate loader, a double-deck red hollow \u2018cartridge\u2019 is loaded up with the four brightly colored automobiles \u2013 two on each level. The yellow [[Car carrier trailer|car trailer]] reverses against the cartridge, moving it back against a tall red stop block. This causes the four cars to roll forward and fill the two decks of the trailer. The '''Car Unloader''' is a long roadway with an orange gantry leading to two ramps. As the Auto Transporter trailer reverses in, it engages with the gantry, causing the decks to rise up at the cab end, encouraging the cars to roll out of the trailer, onto the ramps and finally come to a rest, spread out on the black cardboard [[Parking Lot]] that is part of this item.\n\n'''Logs''' - These were brown-stained 9mm-diameter wood [[dowel]]s 1.5\u201d long and could be loaded into the dump truck by the '''Log Loader/Elevated Log Loader''', which held the loading device high on an orange girder gantry. It is designed to sit under a high-level roadway, so the loading rig is alongside. The actual loading part consisted of a sloping tray in which the logs are laid. This has a lever that is activated by the tipper truck reversing alongside. This released some of the logs into the truck. The loading portion could be removed from the girder base and clipped alongside track at ground level if desired. The actuating lever is quite fragile and many found today are broken. The lever tends to strike most larger passing vehicles when the loader is clipped in place.\n\n'''Operating Log-Loading Bulldozer''' - is a mechanical accessory of the type for which Tyco were famous. The bulldozer is activated by the motor of the truck that is being loaded. This is [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmitted]] to the mechanism by rollers. Once the truck was reversed in, it rested against a stop block. The power is kept on, causing the [[bulldozer]] to push the logs up a gentle slope and into the body of the truck. There is a driver wearing a blue uniform who sat in the controls of the bulldozer. He is prone to breakage or being lost, as are the exhaust pipes. Once the logs have been loaded and the truck has left, the bulldozer needs resetting by hand and the stock of logs, replenishing. Logs are often missing but dowelling of a suitable thickness (8mm-diameter adequately substitutes the original 9mm size) can be cut to length and stained in a commercial wood stain, or even tea or coffee, to look much the same as the originals.\n\n'''Boulders''' - There is an identical '''Boulder Loading Bulldozer''' which came with some boulders (these are actual small stones not imitations) instead of logs. This is much less common than the log-loading version and seems to have been introduced later. Today suitable replacement stones can be obtained from hobby stores. Tumbled and glazed ones reduce friction and avoid scuffing the surface of the accessory.\n\n'''Pipes''' - The '''Operating Crane Pipe Loader''' was another mechanically activated accessory borrowed from Tyco model railroads. The drive was the same as the bulldozer but activated a crane with a rigid wire hook in the shape of an 'L' to move in a back and forth, up and down movement. As it moved, it scooped up a pipe and deposited it in the rear of the waiting truck which supplied the power. It continued in the same movement while the power was applied. The pipes were 14mm-diameter wide white plastic tubular moulding, in 10mm lengths. These were held on edge in a narrow sloping trough, molded into the base, presenting their open side ready for the crane to engage. As one was taken, the next rolled into place ready for the crane to swing back. The crane did not need any manual intervention, other than more pipes being added when they ran out. Pipes, like logs and gravel are often missing but 15mm-diameter plastic water pipe cut into 10mm lengths makes a perfect substitute.\n\n'''Barrels''' - These are 13mm-diameter, 19mm long and have one end sealed. They are usually molded in off white plastic, but were dark butter yellow in the Army Transport set (with wrap around yellow 'Diesel' stickers) and white in the Stomper Set. The same barrel-molding was used as a load for a brown slat-sided semi-trailer in the TYCO TCR series, although in a luminous yellow plastic.\n\nThese were held in the '''Barrel Loader''' - a brown sloping rack mounted on a yellow girder frame. As the tipper truck reversed, it engaged with a lever that released some barrels, which rolled from the rack into the truck. A version with a blue sloping rack and the same yellow frame was shown in publicity material and on the carton of the Motor City set. All examples found have the same brown loader as all the others, but with '''Motor City Oil Co.''' stickers with blue writing on a white background. As yet, no substitute barrels have been found, but a 19mm-long, suitable-diameter pipe or dowel would probably suffice.\n\n'''Unloading Yards''' - There were two varieties, the more common '''Pipe and Log Unloading Yard''', which had a grey base and brown walls. This was sold separately, as well as being in most in most sets, and also appeared with blue walls in the 3209 Motor City Set. The blue unloading yard is labeled with Goodyear stickers and according to catalog illustrations was intended to receive tires, although a way of loading them was not devised. In the Army Transport Set, the standard brown-walled Unloading Yard became an '''Army Dump''' with different stickers.\n\nThe second smaller Unloading Yard arrived later and is much harder to find. It is on a 9\" 45 degree double turnout supplied in the 3213 Highways Wrecker Set and 3219 Night Haulers Set. Originally this track was just a double turnout, but a small unloading yard with brown walls was added on one side of the junction and most of these sections that are found have this.\n\nThe Unloading Yards worked by the lip at the entrance of the yard engaging with the 'steps' or 'mud flaps' on the rear of the reversing tipper's bucket. This causes it to rise, the tailgate to open and the goods to slide out into the yard. Logs, pipes, barrels, tires and presumably boulders could all be deposited in the unloading yards but not gravel, simply because the rear of the tipper was too large to go under the hopper.\n\n'''Airport''' - This mechanical accessory lacks any loading or unloading function. The rollers transmit the drive from the vehicle to the orange [[radar]] dish on a white cap, which rotates atop the terminal building. Attached to the inside of the cap is a long, rigid wire. On the far end of this is a small plastic plane. As the radar revolves in an [[Clockwise|anti-clockwise]] direction, the plane circulates the tower, soaring up and coming back down, over and over again, almost landing and then taking off. There is a cardboard mat supplied for the building to stand on which includes a short section of [[Runway|runway]].\n\nThis is popular at shows, causing gasps and wows as the plane appears to fly. There are two planes provided and they are both rather small for the scale of the trucks and the buildings. One of them is in [[FedEx]] livery, so a good vehicle to use with this would be the FedEx delivery van or the Airport Taxi, whilst the Semi-Tractor shown on the box looks rather out of place.\n\nThe radar dish is fragile and often broken or missing. The walls are blue and the windows lined in white with the word 'Airport' on the blue roof in big white letters. This was mainly sold as a separate item but appeared in one set (in this form), the 3225 Coast to Coast Set.\n\nThe Airport appeared again with brown walls and a gray roof, as the '''Forest Rescue''' centre in the very rare 3211 Stomper Set. This time the radar and cap were moulded in butter yellow and the plane has simpler decoration to allow for the application of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] stickers and Forest Rescue markings.\n\n'''G. I. Joe Satellite Launcher''' - This consisted of a two-piece sculpted concrete effect [[launch pad]] area with a straight approach track at the centre of one side. The base unit for the pad was clearly derived from the 3440 Unloading Yard.\n\nThe pivoting launching [[Gantry (rocketry)|gantry]] folds down horizontally, in line with the roadway, in order to engage with a [[missile]] loaded on a flatbed trailer as it is reversed towards it. In this position the launch gantry engages with the hollow missile and as the trailer backs further the gantry pivots to bring the missile to the upright position.\n\nMissiles are normally white with a gray cap but a few rare examples are known to have red caps. The gantry is a very delicate white plastic molding and many found today have broken pivot arms. This accessory was exclusive to the GI Joe set and was never available separately.\n\n'''Garage Type Buildings''' - This basic structure appeared in different colours, with different signs to serve as three differently purposed buildings, all with road access:\n\n1/ '''Highway Wrecker Set with Lighted Wrecker, Tow Car & Garage''' - The building was yellow with an orange roof and petrol pump. There also a special piece of single straight track with switch that allowed the towed car, the White Firebird, to be unhitched as it was reversed in to the opening.\n\n2/ '''Fire Station with Switch Track & Storage Yard''' - was a red version of the building with a black roof. This came off a different track section that formed a tuning-fork shape. The Fire station stood over the right lane, whilst the left lane was open. As a vehicle drove in to one lane, the turnout automatically switched to the other, isolating the first vehicle. There was a representation of a [[Siren (alarm)|siren]] on the roof of this building, which looks a bit like chimney.\n\n3/ '''Garage with Switch Track & Truck Stop''' - This was similar to the fire station, but had white walls, a blue roof, red windows, etc. It had the same track section as the fire station and operated in the same way. There was no siren or petrol pump.\n\n'''Flashing Danger Track''' - came with a '''15\" Straight Squeeze Track''' where one lane moved towards the other to avoid a hazard. This made it impossible for two vehicles to pass simultaneously. There is a red beacon with a flashing yellow light that sits at the side of the road warning oncoming vehicles. This accessory needed two AA batteries.\n\n'''3673 Overhead Interstate Highway Signs''' were sold in packs. These contained six gray over-road lattice gantries that each had two blank sign panels and sheets of different stickers to apply to them. They were also supplied in every US-1 set, including the Stomper Set with some special labels, including one for a Stomper Garage.\n\nMost of the stickers provided relate to the various action stations: Log Loader 3 Miles Ahead, Dump Site, Motor City Car Lot, Freight Terminal, Gravel Terminal, Gravel Hopper, Oil Refinery, etc. (There was never an Oil Refinery Action Station). The stickers have a tendency to dry out and fall off over time and the gantries themselves are delicate and prone to breakage, deformation and yellowing.\n\nThe earlier gantries have a clearance height of 60mm from the ground and have 35mm long flat feet on either side intended to be tucked under the track. These are not very effective at standing up and are too low for the loaded car transporter to pass beneath.\n\nThe later type of gantries have a 70mm clearance from the ground and the feet are only 25mm long, but each has a wedge shape projecting against the side of the track. The newer design clips positively against the track and usually remains there.\n\nIn place, the gantries are scenic, but tend to obstruct the cleaning of contact rails or attending to a vehicle.\n\n'''3768 Overhead Highway Light''' is a neat little gray streetlamp, set on a huge base that housed an AA battery and was operated by a switch. The bulb is a Grain of Wheat type mounted in the head with a reflector behind. These are surprisingly effective when they work, but they often don't, due to failed bulbs, broken switches and corrosion from leaky batteries.\n\nAlthough never sold separately, the light gray '''US-1 Elevated Piers''' appeared in four of the trucking sets and were a key part of the '''3453 Elevated Gravel Unloader'''. A set of piers included two of each. Pier 1 is 19mm high, number 2 is 38mm and pier 3 reached a height of 57mm. In the top of each pier was a 11mm-diameter round hole that engaged with the corresponding round lugs on the underside of most lengths of US-1 Track.\n\nBesides the piers, elevated items in the US-1 series included the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which required the track to be at 73mm from the base and the '''Elevated Log Loader''' which needed it to be at 76mm high. The US-1 piers are the same as those sold to use with Tyco Quick Clik racing track although these were often cream instead of light gray. The shape of the pillars (a gently tapered series of progressively smaller concentric oblongs), goes back to the Tyco Pro series of track, although the top fixings of those were not compatible with US-1 or Quick Clik.\n\n'''Working Height:''' Although sold for potential use with an HO-scale model railroad, the US-1 elevated track has a clearance of 57mm provided by the high level piers, which is insufficient to clear a train running below. This is made worse if a 'roadbed' type model railroad track is used, where the track sits on some imitation ballast, raising the height of the rails by several mm.\n\n57mm is also too low to allow a loaded car transporter pass underneath. However, as the elevated piers are hollow, it is possible to stack them upon each other, to give the extra height required, provided enough can be found.\n\nIt is still possible to get packs of brand new unused (old stock) Tyco piers from at least one supplier on the Internet. One layout that can be seen on a video app has a high level circuit supported by 87mm high pillars which have been created from 3 of the middle rise piers firmly stacked together. This height is enough to clear an HO Railroad on a roadbed type track, as well as any US-1 road circuit running a loaded car transporter.\n\nThere were also three [[Plastic model|Plastic Construction Kits]]: a '''[[Mobil Oil|Mobil Truck Station]]''', a '''[[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson's Truck Stop]]''', and a '''P.I.E. Freight Terminal''', each molded in several colors to be glued together. These were supplied by Pola, in what was then [[West Germany]] and were also sold for a time as part of the Tyco model railroad range, but in plain Tyco 'Brown Box' packaging and with slightly different names and in some cases different colourings or markings. The Truck station and Freight Terminal kits have appeared in other ranges over the years and are still available, but now as part of the [[Wm. K. Walthers|Walther's]] Trainline range and with different colourings and markings.\n\n=== Sets ===\nMost US-1 pieces came together in a series of sets, based on certain duties a truck would need to do. Numerous sets came out between 1981 and 1986, each with varied action accessories as described above. Some sets were themed, such as the 3235 Road & Rail set, with a complete railroad and two of the 3727 grade crossings, or the 3217 G.I. Joe High Adventure Set, based around soldiers and their equipment.\n\nThe vehicles supplied in the sets were however only a small selection of those available: The Peterbilt tipper appeared in most sets (except the G.I. Joe, Highway Wrecker and Stomper Sets) - Usually in the standard lime green, but was olive green especially for the army transport set and is believed to have been red in the rare Empire Set\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi-tractor was also included in most sets, (except Army Transport, Fire Alert and Stomper sets) the colors being red with white stripes or yellow with orange and black stripes (both are consequently common colors for this vehicle). It was in Army Green in the GI Joe set.\n\nThe Kenworth Semi-tractor was only sold in two sets - appearing in blue with stripes in the Fire Alert set, whilst the olive version was exclusive to the Army Transport set. In the Night Haulers set the Green tipper and the Red Peterbilt semi-tractor were both lighted versions\n\nOther vehicles featuring in sets are the Fire Truck, Wrecker, Dummy Firebird, Stomper Blazer, Stomper Pick Up and the Cobra Troop carrier which was only available in the G.I. Joe set\n\nThe G.I. Joe set also came with soldiers, tanks, jeeps, a helicopter, a boat, a bridge, paratroopers, a die-cut Secret Cobra Command Headquarters, a full-color G.I. Joe Action Battle Mat (with Mountain Backdrop) and a unique '''Satellite Launching Pad with Gantry''' Action Accessory.\n\nArguably, one of the rarest and most expensive sets has a [[Schaper Toys|Schaper]] Stompers theme. Only produced in 1985, complete examples are very rare. It contains a special version of the Airport in brown (3434), unique this set. A die-cut cardboard building can be folded to make a garage for the cars. The set sits on a Stompers-themed playmat, with a portion of the track supported by Elevated Piers.\n\nAnother rare set is the 3213 Highway Wrecker Set, released in 1984. This set contains a gravel loader, gravel unloader, garage, double turnout, special straight with [[Telephone booth|phone booth]], billboard sign.

This is usually because most sections of US-1 track were just a gray variant of the Quick Clik black racing track. Some items can be found with a racing and US-1 reference underneath - the Squeeze track and the Lane changer for example, but even then the number molded is usually a part number rather than a catalogue number. For example the bespoke 9\" Junction carries the reference 3016 beneath but was listed as 3700. Most separate track appears to have been sold in pairs in carded blister packs except the 9\" junction and the railroad crossing which were individually sold in blister packs and the squeeze track which was sold with the flashing beacon in an illustrated box.\n\nWe have listed the special and rare 'set only' items of track in the table above by their molded numbers, to help identify them.\n\nThere were several different '''Assortment Packs''' advertised in the annual catalogs. These contained substantial quantities of track, and other items such as Street Lamps or Overhead Signs. The contents and reference numbers changed over time, but the packs always appeared to contain three transformers and three controllers, which seems rather odd. It is not known how these were packaged and they were never shown on retail price lists, so they may well have been aimed at dealers.\n\nBoulder Loading Bulldozer*  - Two reference numbers have come to light for this item: 3414 is shown on literature enclosed with the accessory, whilst 3470 appears in the 1984 and 1985 Tyco catalogs. Both are shown above. Anyone with access to a box for this please feel free to update!\n\n\n== Tyco US-1 Catalogues and literature  or  \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" ==\nThe US-1 range first appeared in the joint Tyco racing and model railroad catalogue in 1981 and was then shown every year until 1986. It featured in a number of other promotional leaflets too, as well as magazine adverts etc.\n\nOne big issue for the collector is the accuracy of how the range was represented in some of those illustrations and also the images on the various set and accessory boxes. The set boxes also carried large artist's renderings of other makes and types of trucks and trailers that didn't appear in the range. How things were illustrated was not necessarily how they actually appeared when sold.\n\nThe first example of this is the track with yellow centre lines. This was produced only briefly, but was still being illustrated in catalogues several years later. Some of the images of the assembled set contents showed yellow lines throughout their time in the range, although this wasn't the case.\n\nThe second issue is of prototype or pre-production models being shown instead of the final version. This is particularly true of the crate unloader, gravel hopper, gravel bin and pipe loading crane illustrations, some of which are clearly not the versions actually produced, all differing in several details.\n\nThe third example is the type of trucks shown in the various set content illustrations. If you see the section on lighted vehicles you will see that these were only supplied in one set. There were also clear differences between lighted vehicles and those without lights, most noticeably the two rectangular headlights either side of the grill were open instead of solid, with a clear plastic lens inside.\n\nIf you study various set illustrations you will see that many of the vehicles shown accompanying some of the sets are actually lighted ones, even though these were not supplied in that particular set. Conversely it appears that early some early lighted trucks were listed without them actually being identified as such. The lighted Semi-Tractor in Yellow with orange and black stripes appears to be one example of this.\n\nFinally, a few items are shown in a color finish the actual items never carried. For example the top section of the motor city barrel loader is shown as being blue, but was in reality just the normal brown version with Motor City Stickers. The US-1 Police car was a two door Dodge Charger but at least once it was shown as a four door Plymouth Satellite with a large blower.\n\nSo even though Tyco may have illustrated it, that does not mean that you can find it!\n\n==Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1 ==\nThe Peterbilt Semi-Tractor had preceded the US-1 range, being introduced in 1979 on the lighted HP2 racing chassis and a slotless, lighted Command Control chassis. The latter was black with flames and no hole in the fifth wheel - or sometimes a hole, which was too small for the later trailers.\n\nCommand Control was Tyco\u2019s first attempt at slotless racing and a direct competitor to the original [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] [[Total Control Racing]] or TCR. The same body was later used again in the Tyco version of the Slotless TCR system produced from 1991 to 1993\n\nBoth the Peterbilt and Kenworth Semi-tractor moldings were used in racing form, with a chromed plastic fifth wheel, which was initially attached by a rivet and two melted-over plastic side pegs to the platform behind the driver\u2019s cab. On later Peterbilts the rivet was deleted and the side pegs were considered enough, although the rivet hole remained. \n\nTwo versions of the Kenworth 'Cab over' Semis were available in racing form between 1983 and 1985 with HP7 chassis. One is mainly black with a red stripe that has white edges and the other mainly white with blue patches and orange stripes. \n\nMost of the racing and Slotless Semi-tractor bodies can be easily adapted to fit a US-1 chassis by drilling out the hollow rivet and pegs that hold the chromed plastic fifth wheel in place. Any vehicle so modified will have three evenly spaced tell-tale holes visible on the platform just behind the cab. On some early examples of the Peterbilt Semi-Tractor this rear platform is lower and consequently these bodies will not fit a US-1 chassis without further work.\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi bodies that won't fit on a US-1 chassis can be identified by their colors: Baby Blue with Black Stripes or White with Red Stripes. Also some in Yellow with fine Orange and Red Stripes or Black with Flames used the original version of the body as well as the later version that will fit. Some of these had gray grills and exhausts instead of Chrome.\n\nOf the many US-1 trailers, only the box type made it into the racing series, appearing in various color schemes. The later had a redesigned reversible bogie with a slot-guide plus a bar magnet to encourage it to stay on the track, although some are known to carry the US-1-type bogie. At the front end, these box trailers kept their US-1 style pivot, allowing them to be run with US-1 Semi-Tractors.\n\nThe Dodge Van can be found in various liveries in racing form and also in Tyco TCR form as the Blue and White \u2018Emergency\u2019 Jam Car. This featured the red light-bar that had been used on the US-1 Mack Fire Truck.\n\nPolice Cars: There is a US-1 publicity photo showing a four-door [[Plymouth Satellite]] in use as the US-1 Police Car: with roof lights, a large hood mounted blower and side pipes, but this was never released as part of the US-1 range. (See the Tyco Resource in the '''External Links''' section Below - Vehicles page)\n\nThe US-1 \u2018911\u2019 police car and Airport Taxi were based on the two-door [[Dodge Charger]] that had been introduced to the Tyco range back in 1977. This was done without \u2018door-netting\u2019 on the glazing and the body was modified to take the roof lights for the police car. The Charger remained in the Tyco racing range until 2005.\n\nOther US-1 vehicles that can be found with a racing chassis are the Jeep in civilian colors which was available from 1980 to 1983 and the Black and Gold Firebird which was sold from 1979 to 1983 but was to eventually reappear in 2005 and 2006 in two special sets.\n\nThere are eight non-US-1 versions of the Stomper Blazer, five of which were equipped with lights, that the US-1 version never carried. One was sold as part of the Faller AMS series. The three 'flame paint' versions had no lights\n\nThe Mack Fire Truck was also sold as part of the Faller AMS range, both individually (cat no. 5631) and in the 'Feuer Alarm' set (Cat no. 3907), which also contained a lighted blue and white racing version of the Pontiac Firebird. These were both introduced in 1983 and the truck was catalogued for at least two years. From two examples seen, it would appear to be the standard US-1 offering, with the same chassis, mechanical bell, lights and American markings. Even the molded 'Tyco H.K.'markings were underneath.\n\nUnusually, at this late stage, Faller AMS had extensive links to Aurora AFX. The Fire Truck appeared in the Faller range alongside some of the same Semi-Tractors and trailers which were also sold as part of the Aurora 'Big Ryder' series, (which was their answer to Tyco US-1), as well as other Tyco offerings.\n\n== Spare Parts, Running and Collecting ==\n'''Spare parts:''' Some parts, such as pick-ups, were originally available from the manufacturers, but today these are hard to find. Luckily a number of people have begun producing parts to keep US-1 vehicles running. Tires which fit all the standard vehicles are available from a number of vendors. Specially stamped and shaped replacement pick-ups can be obtained too, which fit all the vehicles in the series, (including the Stompers). Recently, batches of light bars for the wrecker and fire engine have been made, along with the unique tires for the Stomper and some US-1-type metal guide pins. Their availability can be seen on the Internet.\n\n'''Motor''': The motor used throughout US-1 was a standard [[Mabuchi Motor|Mabuchi]] item and can also be found fitted to other vehicles, including 'Ideal' Slot Cars, later some slotless Tyco TCR 'Jam Cars'. [[New old stock]] spares can sometimes be found and many similar, but not identical motors were made. When checking a Mabuchi motor to see if it will be a suitable replacement, the available length of the shaft to take the worm gear and the position of the contacts (which is on the side of US-1 motors) need to be considered.\n\n'''Customised items and Replicas:''' One vendor specialises in making double 90 degree turnouts out of two single ones, along with 9\" and 6\" single straights. All very handy when maximising layout space. Vendors offering trucks, trailers, loads and Action Accessories in custom finishes, such as FedEx, can often be found on a well known Internet auction site\n\n'''Running suggestions:''' To run US-1 (and not use the original control gear), wires can be carefully soldered to the underside of the two contact strips, but given the age and condition of the track, it is recommended that as the layout size increases, the number of 'feeds' to each circuit are increased to avoid voltage drop. US-1 track has not always aged well and much found will have discolored or had minor bits broken off at the joints. To obtain the best running results, use the best track available and clean it well: Wash and scrub with a good detergent and then dry it thoroughly. Give the contact strips a rub with an abrasive track-cleaning block, (like those used for model railroads) and pay particular attention to the areas where the metal contact strips join. Treatment of the metal strips with a non-damaging contact oil can be helpful, but try to avoid getting any on the road surface.\n\n'''Integration with Other Makes:''' US-1 vehicles will run on most other makes of HO slot car track, but the Action Accessories can only be connected to Tyco US-1 track via the special US-1 turnouts. US-1 track is a gray version of Tyco Quick Clik and this is compatible with the later Mattel track.  Adaptor sections to join Quick Clik to the older Tyco Pro and Life-Like Racing tracks have been made, but only the [[Round 2 (company)|Auto World]] 'Tyco Quick Clik to Tomy AFX' type appears to still be in production.\n\nVehicles from this range are relatively wide, so if two trucks are simultaneously run on an earlier, narrower slot-car track, like Playcraft Highways or [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora Model Motoring]], they will collide.\n\nNon US-1 vehicles can be run on Trucking layouts, but lighter types like Aurora [[Pancake (slot car)|TJets]] will get 'beached' on the sprung copper tongues at the junctions, wheras Magnetic slot cars will generally cope quite well as they usually have enough 'virtual' weight to pass through them.\n\n'''Control Gear:''' In the experience of this contributor, (from running various makes of model electric roadways for around 35 years), the best type of controller to use is a Model Railroad 'feedback' type. These give good speed control and steady constant speed running, (resistance types of many makes have been tried but can cause erratic running). Videos exist showing the trucks being successfully run with Model Railroad [[Digital Command Control]] 'electronic chips' fitted. This is not for the faint-hearted and can also be expensive.\n\n'''Servicing:''' Any vehicle obtained will need a good clean, and the tunnel weight temporarily removed by prising the side with a small flat screwdriver. This allows removal of fluff, which accumulates around the worm screw and rear axle. Lightly oil the motor bearings, axles and gears, replace the tires if they are hardened and the pick ups, too, if they are 'rutted'.\n\n'''Fitting Replacement Pick Ups:''' Do not pre-bend them, the cast plate that holds them into the chassis will automatically set them to correct angle as they are screwed into place. (Pre-bending them can exert to much force on the roadway, resulting in lost traction). However it is important to ensure that the folded 'retaining brackets' at the ends of the strips are free to travel up and down in their open mountings. On the Semi-Tractors ensure that the 'return' portion of these brackets does not rub against the Fifth Wheel weight, or it will stop it moving freely and may cause a short circuit.\n\n'''Videos:''' Although today models and sets are bought by collectors, many US-1 trucks are operated either at home or at public shows. Videos showing this can be found on some video apps. Some of the films show the various loading and unloading accessories in action and original commercials for the range can be found, too: Search for 'Tyco Trucking' or 'Tyco US-1'.\n\n==External links==\nUS-1 Trucking Resource [http://tycotrain.tripod.com/tycous1trucking/]\n\nDerek A Brand - Tribute Page = [http://www.daveshobby.net/derek-brand-tribute.html]\n\nHistory of HO Slot Car racing [http://www.hoslotcarracing.com/History.html]\n\nTyco Catalogs (Year by year, page by page) [https://www.hoseeker.org/tyco.htm]\n\n==See also==\n* [[U.S. 1 (comics)]], a [[Marvel Comics]] series licensed from this toyline, set in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n[[Category:Toy cars and trucks]]\n\n\n{{Toy-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:US1Introduction1981.jpg|thumb|1981 Tyco Catalog Introduction to US-1 Electric Trucking]]\n\n'''US-1 Electric Trucking''', produced by [[Tyco Toys]] from 1981 to 1986, is a line of [[HO scale]] slot car sets focused around trucks. It was similar to previous Tyco HO Scale racing sets; however the vehicles could be run in reverse due to having guide pins at the front and rear of the chassis. The line was unique because most of the vehicles were able to pick up and deliver loads from various \u2018Action Accessories\u2019 without intervention from the operator.\n\nOne of those involved in the development of US-1 was Derek A. Brand (1926 to 2012) who had designed the first HO slot system - [[mettoy|Playcraft]] Electric Highways, which was launched in 1959. He also laid down the geometric principles of HO slot car track systems that Tyco and many other manufacturers followed for many years. (The 9\" roadway straight was derived from Atlas HO model railroad 'Snap Track', to enable his model highways use with model railroad layouts).\n\nWhile only lasting six years, a number of sets were made, with one being based on the [[G.I. Joe]] franchise. Many trucks, trailers, and other vehicles were produced, such as dump trucks, a car hauler and a fire truck. It was marketed under the tagline of \"You Control The Action!\"\n\n== How it works ==\n[[File:Custom Track Layout.jpg|left|thumb|Basic, Custom Track Layout]]\n'''Electrical''': The system was originally designed to be operated from a 6v dc supply, this later increased to 9v dc. [[Transformer]]s were supplied with the sets, but the vehicles can be safely worked from most modern conventional model railroad transformer/controllers, if the original US-1 control gear is not used.\n\n'''Track''': The trucks run on a gray variant of the Tyco Quick Clik track that provides power to the vehicles through two thin metal strips in the track, which is similar to many other HO scale road and racing systems. The track was initially produced with yellow centre lines and some other markings, although this is less common and most track was supplied unmarked.\n\nTwo types of trailing turnouts were made that allowed the vehicles to pass through unimpeded and then, if required, reverse back into a siding to access an Action Accessory. These junctions consisted of a sprung copper tongue that extended across the slot, interacting with the front and rear guide pins. A switchable '''Hi Adventure''' junction was supplied in the GI Joe set, which would allow vehicles to travel in either direction without being automatically directed into a siding. Various combinations of track sections were supplied in the sets, except the 45 degree 12\" radius curves, which were only sold separately and are hard to find. Other rare track pieces include the 9\" double turnout that only appeared in two sets and the Railroad [[grade crossing]].\n\n'''Chassis''': Longitudinal copper pick-up shoes span almost the entire length of the chassis, which transfer the power to the [[Electric motor|motor]]. The pick-ups were held in by screws and could be replaced, although some later vehicles are known to have rivets instead of screws. The motor itself is a universal clip-in type that uses a worm screw to turn a [[worm wheel]] on the rear axle. These worms and gears were originally brown, but on most vehicles they are white.\n\nAt the front and back of the chassis, guide pins keep the truck on the track, allowing it to go in reverse. Guide pins were originally brown plastic blades mounted on a wedge-shaped base, but later and most commonly, round metal pins were used. On most chassis there are two raised angled strips molded on either side of the guide pin mount, which stopped the original plastic guide blades rotating. Comparatively few chassis are without these. The actual pin mounting never changed and either type of pin can be fitted to any vehicle.\n\nThe rear axle has removable [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]] [[tires]], that will get hard over time and consequently lose grip. These occasionally require replacing. However the front axle, the extra axle on the three six-wheeled vehicles, all the axles on the trailers (and even those on the dummy Firebird) had hard plastic tires which run freely and with hardly any drag. Only the higher Stomper chassis had rubber tires front and rear.\n\nEach vehicle carries two weights - a flat plate at the front and a block at the rear with a tunnel to clear the worm gear. The rear weights vary in size to suit the vehicle. On the [[Semi-trailer truck]] (or [[Tractor unit]]) the rear weight was black and [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] in the  form of a [[Fifth-wheel coupling]] where the trailer was attached. These give the vehicle more traction and help it to pass through the sprung junctions, which can cause lighter (non US-1) vehicles to stall.\n\n'''Working Features''': The Wrecker and the Fire Truck both carried flashing lights, the latter carried a bell, too. These were [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanically]] activated by a geared drive taken off the rear axle. Despite those features being added, the core chassis inside these two vehicles, were the same as all the others in the range except the Stompers, which used a bespoke deeper chassis [[Injection moulding|molding]] to accommodate the lower reach required by the pick ups, which was necessary because of the higher tires.\n\nOperation of the accessories is done automatically, usually by contact with the truck or trailer. However, in the case of the crane, bulldozer, and airport, the accessory is operated by the vehicle's drive wheels acting on a roller, (as it continues to be powered in reverse, whilst pushing against a stop block).\n\n'''Controllers''': Since this was a roadway system instead of a race track, the controllers were not hand-held, but were intended to resemble the [[dashboard]] of a truck. Originally separate and attached to the track via some wires, each controller had a [[steering wheel]] (to control the speed) and a switch mounted to the side (to control the direction).\n\nThe first type of controllers are known to exist both with and without the yellow lines on the road surface. The output from the transformer was plugged directly into the terminal rail attached to the two controllers.\n\nLater these individual units were simplified so the steering wheel did both speed and direction. By this time yellow markings had stopped being applied to the road surface.\n\nThe final type of controllers came as one twin unit in the form of a single box, attached to a molded base on the side of the track and these also only had two steering wheels, which were mounted side by side. The transformer connection now plugged directly into the control box instead of the track. \n\nControllers are usually red but some of the final version were molded in green for the G.I. Joe and Stomper sets. The green ones only exist in this final twin version.\n\n== Vehicles & Trucks ==\n[[File:4 US-1 Trucks.jpg|thumb|2 Dump Trucks, a Semi Truck, & Fire Truck]]\nThe core chassis of all vehicles are of the same basic design throughout the range, (with only the Stompers using a different chassis molding) but there were many body types and different colors.\n\nThere were two makes of '''[[Semi-trailer truck|Semi-Tractor]]''' trucks modeled: One a [[Peterbilt]] conventional, the other a [[Kenworth]] C.O.E. ([[cab over engine]]). Both types had four wheels and were made to pull [[Semi-trailers]] in box, tank, flatbed, auto transporter and hopper varieties, using their exposed metal rear chassis weight which was also the Fifth Wheel Coupling.\n\nAll other vehicles except the wrecker and fire truck had plain rear chassis weights, which were hidden by the vehicle body.\n\nThere were three '''six-wheeled Peterbilt trucks''': [[dump truck]] (or tipper), troop carrier and a [[Vehicle recovery|Wrecker]]. On these, the extra axle was mounted under the body assembly.\n\n'''Other vehicles''' included a [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] [[Fire Truck]], [[police car]], [[Taxicab|taxi]], [[Pickup truck]], [[Dodge]] [[Panel van|delivery van]], [[ambulance]], [[Jeep]], and a [[Pontiac Firebird]] [[Coup\u00e9]] - The Firebird appeared in both powered (black color with gold eagle) and unpowered (white with black eagle) form, the latter for towing by the wrecker. The dummy car had a plastic chassis with a metal clip to help engage the jib of the wrecker.\n\n'''Body Colors''' were generally molded in pre-colored plastic, although the earliest known version of the Green and the Red Tipper, the Yellow/Orange and Red/White Strip Peterbilt Semi-tractors were molded in white plastic and given a painted finish. The same is true of the Mack Fire Truck, Airport Taxi, [[Goodyear Tires]] pick-up truck, Black Firebird and even the Police car, which was painted all over white before the blue panels, etc. were added. After-market re-sprays of models are becoming more common, too, they are sometimes offered for sale on Internet auction sites.\n\n'''Lights''': As well as the Wrecker and Fire Truck mentioned earlier, a number of Peterbilt trucks were made with working lights. These had a small bulb soldered to the two motor contacts. This nested in a recess within a clear plastic molding that plugged into the front grill and some openings in the cab roof. This also served as glazing in the cab windows.\n\nThe clear plastic transmitted the light from the bulb to the two rectangular headlights either side of the grille, two round lights in the bumper and an array on the cab roof. These lit up when the vehicle was travelling.\n\nThe radiator molding used on lighted trucks differed from the unlit ones as the rectangular headlights were left open, where normally they would be solid and in chrome finish like the rest of it. A similar molding to the clear one, but in dark plastic was also used in some trucks without lights, which makes them look as though they have heavily tinted windows!\n\nLighted versions of the following trucks are known: ''Peterbilt Semi-Tractors'': Yellow with Orange and Black Stripes, Red with White Stripes, Black with Gold Stripes, Yellow with Red Stripes. ''Peterbilt Tippers'' were also advertised with lights in the common Green, White with Brown and Orange Stripes and \u2018Dept of Highways\u2019 in Red and Black, however others are known such as the all over Red (Painted finish), Blue cab with the Yellow bucket and Blue cab with Silver bucket.\n\nLighted trucks were only supplied in one set 'Night Haulers',  which contained a green tipper and a red semi with white stripes. Although two lighted Kenworth trucks were sold in the racing series, there were none in the US-1 series. See '''Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1''' \n\n'''Variations''': Over the years, a number of changes were made to the Peterbilt tipper mouldings. Following the release of the initial painted versions, production switched to pre-coloured plastic and a small ridge appeared lengthways in the middle of the rear of the dump bed, where the tailgate rested when shut. This ridge did not last long and was removed by the time the tail gate gained a bottom lug and matching receptor in the bucket to aid more secure closing. At the same time the originally round hinges became oval to allow the extra travel needed to open/close it.\n\nThe final change to the tipper bucket was when the tail gate changed to a fat 'T' shape, with 'stubs' added at the top on either side and the hinges were enlarged again and made thinner to accommodate these. This makes them rather fragile too. It is quite common to find these later hinges broken and the tailgate missing, whereas the earlier thicker hinges normally survive.\n\nFrom around 1983, Peterbilt Semis and Tippers both acquired an oval 'Peterbilt' logo on the sides of the hood and the front of the [[Radiator]]. The name \"Peterbilt\" can be clearly seen with a magnifier. Finally, when the tipper chassis was adapted with extra slots to take the troop-carrier body for the GI Joe set in 1984, the opening above the motor was changed from a square to a T shape.\n\nAs of April 2020, none of the plain Green Tippers or the common Semi-Tractors in either yellow and orange (with black stripes) or red (with white stripes)-(Unlighted version), have been found with the Peterbilt logos. Nor have any green Tippers been found with the troop carrier modifications to the base or with the final 'T' shaped tailgate and thinner hinges on the bucket. \n\nAs these trucks appeared in several sets that were available until the end of the range, this remains an interesting and so far unexplained anomaly. From the examples seen it would appear that the same is true for the less common red tipper, although this is thought to have only ever been included in one set. However, the red Semi-tractor with white stripes (lighted version), can be found both with and without the Peterbilt logos.\n\nAlthough the Stomper [[Blazer|Blazer]] enjoyed a very short life, variations are known: Test-shot moldings exist that include a clear plastic light bar, although no light bar has ever been found fitted on production models in this series, nor was any US-1 Blazer ever fitted with lights. The headlights on the body shell are just open round holes. Early bodies were supplied fitted with a pair of thin weights, secured sandwich-like, at the rear of the body, by two plastic prongs, melted over to hold them in place. Most examples found seem not to have these.\n\n'''Trailers''' The flat bed trailer comes in two distinct variations. The rear panel is either completely smooth or has a 6mm long ridge across the bottom. All the different color versions of the flat bed can be found both with and without this feature. \nThe ridge appears to have been added later as it also appears on a small number of hopper trailers. \n\nAll post US-1 Box trailers have this too. So far no tank trailers are known with this. See the section '''US-1 Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1''' for information about the non US-1 versions of the Box trailer.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Vehicles, Trucks, & Trailers\n!Trucks\n!Trailers\n!Vehicles\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Red with White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3903 - 1981-1983)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Bekins)'''\n\n(No. 3928 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(White and Blue with Red Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3962 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Orange and Yellow with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3904 - 1981-1982)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Gravel Supply Company)'''\n\n(No. 3925 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(Yellow/Gray/White with Orange Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3963 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan with Initials \"PB\" on Doors)'''\n\n(No.3908 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Highway Construction Company)'''\n\n(No. 3926 - 1981-1984)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Green and White with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3965 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Black with Yellow/Tan/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3909 - 1982-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Navajo)'''\n\n(No. 3930 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Yellow with Black and White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3966 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Blue with White/Yellow/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3910 - 1982)\n|'''Box Trailer'''\n'''(Pacific Intermountain Express)'''\n\n(No. 3927 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Pick-Up Truck'''\n'''(Smith's Tire Orange and Black)'''\n\n(No.3951 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Coastal Trucking Blue with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3913 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Smith Transfer)'''\n\n(No. 3929 - 1981, 1982)\n|Dodge '''Van''' \n'''(Federal Express)'''\n\n(No.3952 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Cab Over Truck Cab''' \n'''(Red/White/Orange)'''\n\n(No.3914 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Red Line)'''\n\n(No. 3931 - 1982)\n|Dodge Charger '''Police Car''' \n'''(Blue and White)'''\n\n(No.3953 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan)'''\n\n(No. 3935 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1982, 1983)\n|Dodge '''Ambulance'''\n(No.3954 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Black with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No. 3939 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer with 3 Crates''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1984)\n|Dodge Charger '''Airport Taxi''' \n'''(Blue)'''\n\n(No.3955 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Green)'''\n\n(No.3901 - 1981)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Shell)'''\n\n(No. 3940 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Pontiac Firebird''' \n'''(Black)'''\n\n(No.3956 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red)'''\n\n(No.3902 - 1981 and 1983)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Exxon)'''\n\n(No. 3941 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Army Jeep'''\n(No.3957 - 1983-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck'''\n'''(Red and Tan with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3905 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Dupont)'''\n\n(No. 3942 - 1982)\n|'''Fire Truck''' \n'''(Lights, Bell, & Working Ladder)'''\n\n(No. 3911 - 1983-1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Blue and Silver)'''\n\n(No.3912 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Borden's)'''\n\n(No. 3943 - 1982)\n|'''Peterbilt Wrecker with Disabled Car''' \n'''(Lighted Black Peterbilt with Shell logo; White Firebird)'''\n\n(No. 3918 - 1984, 1985)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red and Black)'''\n\n(No. 3937 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Auto Transport with 4 Cars'''\n(No. 3946 - 1983, 1984)\n|'''G.I.

Some were based on designs which were originally part of the Tyco model railroad range. A full list appears later, but they are each worth describing in detail.\n\n'''Gravel''' \u2013 There was a small brown '''Gravel Unloading''' bin designed to sit under a length of single track that had a small oblong opening and a flat [[billboard]] at the end, where a single green 'Gravel' sticker was applied facing the track. The rear side was heavily reinforced by two half round molded pillars. As the gravel trailer was reversed into this, a raised portion of the roadway engaged with and opened the shutter underneath the trailer, causing the gravel to fall through the opening and into the bin.\n\nThis special track was later modified, gaining a box with raised sides around the opening, presumably to prevent spillages. Meanwhile, two long slots were also added on the sides to enable it to lock over the front of the gravel hopper to form the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' (see below). At the same time the billboard at the end was made double sided, by removing the reinforcing ribs at the rear, so that it could now take a green and white 'Gravel' sticker on each face.\n\nThe brown gravel bin was originally supplied with a tan-painted floor, discontinuing that was probably an early cost-cutting measure.\n\nTo fill the gravel trailer, there was an orange '''Operating Overhead Gravel Hopper''' that stood on a gantry over another type of single-road section (this was also used under the '''Barrel Loader'''). As the gravel trailer was reversed under the hopper it opened a shutter and was filled with gravel, ready to be driven away. This hopper was supplied with a small billboard type 'Gravel' sign that attached to the front of the hopper by two prongs. These are quite vulnerable and today are nearly always found broken. Adhesive putty can be used to mount billboards with broken prongs on the frame of the orange hopper. This is where it was often shown on the set box illustrations - (See Tyco Truck Resource link below).\n\nThe same hopper could be used as part of the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which consisted of a set of '''Elevated Piers''' and a later version of the section of track supplied with the '''Gravel Unloading''' bin. This time that unloading track was intended to be positioned above the hopper, making it possible to fill your gravel trailer, drive around the circuit and then put that same gravel back in the same hopper ready to do it all again! The included instruction sheet shows a track diagram of how to arrange the track to achieve this and details where to position all six graduated height Elevated Piers.\n\nThe '''Gravel Supply Terminal''' was a 'dock' where a gravel trailer could park. There was a small brown building with a black roof at the far end.  Although there was no loading or unloading here, a neat little mechanism allowed the Semi-Tractor to reverse in and automatically hitch or un-hitch the trailer as required.\n\nThe same dock molding was used for the '''Freight Terminal''' where one of the Box Trailers could be parked, which worked in the same way. This had an even smaller yellow hut with a gray roof at the far end. Usually the gravel terminal mechanism has fewer moving parts than that in the freight terminal, but on early examples the mechanisms were identical.\n\nOriginal US-1 gravel was made of small plastic pellets and was supplied in a sealed clear plastic packet, but is often lost. [[Mung bean|Mung Beans]] look similar and make a perfect replacement.\n\n'''Crates''' \u2013 These are sturdy looking objects which were set out on a gray platform outside a cream shed. This was the '''Crate Loader'''. As the flat trailer was reversed in, it pushed the platform back into the shed and the crates went onto the trailer.\n\nThe '''Crate Unloader''' is a light gray platform at one side of a single track with a small yard on the other. Access was through a tall dark gray hoop from which a hinged flap is hanging. The ominous yellow and black hatchings and the words \u2018Unload Here\u2019 are a clue to what happens \u2013 the trailer loaded with crates is reversed under the flap, which hinges open away from the main road, allowing the trailer and crates to pass beneath, but as the trailer is withdrawn, the flap locks vertical and rigid, then brutally tears the crates from the trailer onto the floor, irrespective of any \u2018Fragile\u2019, \u2018Handle With Care\u2019 or \u2018This Way Up\u2019 stickers that might be applied to them.\n\nIn the Army Transport set this Action Accessory became an '''Ammunition Dump''' with different stickers and the crates were a darker brown. Replica crates have been produced but were not widely available. If originals or replicas are unavailable, a 1\" Wooden Cube suffices. \n\n'''Car Loader''' \u2013 Similar in principle to the crate loader, a double-deck red hollow \u2018cartridge\u2019 is loaded up with the four brightly colored automobiles \u2013 two on each level. The yellow [[Car carrier trailer|car trailer]] reverses against the cartridge, moving it back against a tall red stop block. This causes the four cars to roll forward and fill the two decks of the trailer. The '''Car Unloader''' is a long roadway with an orange gantry leading to two ramps. As the Auto Transporter trailer reverses in, it engages with the gantry, causing the decks to rise up at the cab end, encouraging the cars to roll out of the trailer, onto the ramps and finally come to a rest, spread out on the black cardboard [[Parking Lot]] that is part of this item.\n\n'''Logs''' - These were brown-stained 9mm-diameter wood [[dowel]]s 1.5\u201d long and could be loaded into the dump truck by the '''Log Loader/Elevated Log Loader''', which held the loading device high on an orange girder gantry. It is designed to sit under a high-level roadway, so the loading rig is alongside. The actual loading part consisted of a sloping tray in which the logs are laid. This has a lever that is activated by the tipper truck reversing alongside. This released some of the logs into the truck. The loading portion could be removed from the girder base and clipped alongside track at ground level if desired. The actuating lever is quite fragile and many found today are broken. The lever tends to strike most larger passing vehicles when the loader is clipped in place.\n\n'''Operating Log-Loading Bulldozer''' - is a mechanical accessory of the type for which Tyco were famous. The bulldozer is activated by the motor of the truck that is being loaded. This is [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmitted]] to the mechanism by rollers. Once the truck was reversed in, it rested against a stop block. The power is kept on, causing the [[bulldozer]] to push the logs up a gentle slope and into the body of the truck. There is a driver wearing a blue uniform who sat in the controls of the bulldozer. He is prone to breakage or being lost, as are the exhaust pipes. Once the logs have been loaded and the truck has left, the bulldozer needs resetting by hand and the stock of logs, replenishing. Logs are often missing but dowelling of a suitable thickness (8mm-diameter adequately substitutes the original 9mm size) can be cut to length and stained in a commercial wood stain, or even tea or coffee, to look much the same as the originals.\n\n'''Boulders''' - There is an identical '''Boulder Loading Bulldozer''' which came with some boulders (these are actual small stones not imitations) instead of logs. This is much less common than the log-loading version and seems to have been introduced later. Today suitable replacement stones can be obtained from hobby stores. Tumbled and glazed ones reduce friction and avoid scuffing the surface of the accessory.\n\n'''Pipes''' - The '''Operating Crane Pipe Loader''' was another mechanically activated accessory borrowed from Tyco model railroads. The drive was the same as the bulldozer but activated a crane with a rigid wire hook in the shape of an 'L' to move in a back and forth, up and down movement. As it moved, it scooped up a pipe and deposited it in the rear of the waiting truck which supplied the power. It continued in the same movement while the power was applied. The pipes were 14mm-diameter wide white plastic tubular moulding, in 10mm lengths. These were held on edge in a narrow sloping trough, molded into the base, presenting their open side ready for the crane to engage. As one was taken, the next rolled into place ready for the crane to swing back. The crane did not need any manual intervention, other than more pipes being added when they ran out. Pipes, like logs and gravel are often missing but 15mm-diameter plastic water pipe cut into 10mm lengths makes a perfect substitute.\n\n'''Barrels''' - These are 13mm-diameter, 19mm long and have one end sealed. They are usually molded in off white plastic, but were dark butter yellow in the Army Transport set (with wrap around yellow 'Diesel' stickers) and white in the Stomper Set. The same barrel-molding was used as a load for a brown slat-sided semi-trailer in the TYCO TCR series, although in a luminous yellow plastic.\n\nThese were held in the '''Barrel Loader''' - a brown sloping rack mounted on a yellow girder frame. As the tipper truck reversed, it engaged with a lever that released some barrels, which rolled from the rack into the truck. A version with a blue sloping rack and the same yellow frame was shown in publicity material and on the carton of the Motor City set. All examples found have the same brown loader as all the others, but with '''Motor City Oil Co.''' stickers with blue writing on a white background. As yet, no substitute barrels have been found, but a 19mm-long, suitable-diameter pipe or dowel would probably suffice.\n\n'''Unloading Yards''' - There were two varieties, the more common '''Pipe and Log Unloading Yard''', which had a grey base and brown walls. This was sold separately, as well as being in most in most sets, and also appeared with blue walls in the 3209 Motor City Set. The blue unloading yard is labeled with Goodyear stickers and according to catalog illustrations was intended to receive tires, although a way of loading them was not devised. In the Army Transport Set, the standard brown-walled Unloading Yard became an '''Army Dump''' with different stickers.\n\nThe second smaller Unloading Yard arrived later and is much harder to find. It is on a 9\" 45 degree double turnout supplied in the 3213 Highways Wrecker Set and 3219 Night Haulers Set. Originally this track was just a double turnout, but a small unloading yard with brown walls was added on one side of the junction and most of these sections that are found have this.\n\nThe Unloading Yards worked by the lip at the entrance of the yard engaging with the 'steps' or 'mud flaps' on the rear of the reversing tipper's bucket. This causes it to rise, the tailgate to open and the goods to slide out into the yard. Logs, pipes, barrels, tires and presumably boulders could all be deposited in the unloading yards but not gravel, simply because the rear of the tipper was too large to go under the hopper.\n\n'''Airport''' - This mechanical accessory lacks any loading or unloading function. The rollers transmit the drive from the vehicle to the orange [[radar]] dish on a white cap, which rotates atop the terminal building. Attached to the inside of the cap is a long, rigid wire. On the far end of this is a small plastic plane. As the radar revolves in an [[Clockwise|anti-clockwise]] direction, the plane circulates the tower, soaring up and coming back down, over and over again, almost landing and then taking off. There is a cardboard mat supplied for the building to stand on which includes a short section of [[Runway|runway]].\n\nThis is popular at shows, causing gasps and wows as the plane appears to fly. There are two planes provided and they are both rather small for the scale of the trucks and the buildings. One of them is in [[FedEx]] livery, so a good vehicle to use with this would be the FedEx delivery van or the Airport Taxi, whilst the Semi-Tractor shown on the box looks rather out of place.\n\nThe radar dish is fragile and often broken or missing. The walls are blue and the windows lined in white with the word 'Airport' on the blue roof in big white letters. This was mainly sold as a separate item but appeared in one set (in this form), the 3225 Coast to Coast Set.\n\nThe Airport appeared again with brown walls and a gray roof, as the '''Forest Rescue''' centre in the very rare 3211 Stomper Set. This time the radar and cap were moulded in butter yellow and the plane has simpler decoration to allow for the application of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] stickers and Forest Rescue markings.\n\n'''G. I. Joe Satellite Launcher''' - This consisted of a two-piece sculpted concrete effect [[launch pad]] area with a straight approach track at the centre of one side. The base unit for the pad was clearly derived from the 3440 Unloading Yard.\n\nThe pivoting launching [[Gantry (rocketry)|gantry]] folds down horizontally, in line with the roadway, in order to engage with a [[missile]] loaded on a flatbed trailer as it is reversed towards it. In this position the launch gantry engages with the hollow missile and as the trailer backs further the gantry pivots to bring the missile to the upright position.\n\nMissiles are normally white with a gray cap but a few rare examples are known to have red caps. The gantry is a very delicate white plastic molding and many found today have broken pivot arms. This accessory was exclusive to the GI Joe set and was never available separately.\n\n'''Garage Type Buildings''' - This basic structure appeared in different colours, with different signs to serve as three differently purposed buildings, all with road access:\n\n1/ '''Highway Wrecker Set with Lighted Wrecker, Tow Car & Garage''' - The building was yellow with an orange roof and petrol pump. There also a special piece of single straight track with switch that allowed the towed car, the White Firebird, to be unhitched as it was reversed in to the opening.\n\n2/ '''Fire Station with Switch Track & Storage Yard''' - was a red version of the building with a black roof. This came off a different track section that formed a tuning-fork shape. The Fire station stood over the right lane, whilst the left lane was open. As a vehicle drove in to one lane, the turnout automatically switched to the other, isolating the first vehicle. There was a representation of a [[Siren (alarm)|siren]] on the roof of this building, which looks a bit like chimney.\n\n3/ '''Garage with Switch Track & Truck Stop''' - This was similar to the fire station, but had white walls, a blue roof, red windows, etc. It had the same track section as the fire station and operated in the same way. There was no siren or petrol pump.\n\n'''Flashing Danger Track''' - came with a '''15\" Straight Squeeze Track''' where one lane moved towards the other to avoid a hazard. This made it impossible for two vehicles to pass simultaneously. There is a red beacon with a flashing yellow light that sits at the side of the road warning oncoming vehicles. This accessory needed two AA batteries.\n\n'''3673 Overhead Interstate Highway Signs''' were sold in packs. These contained six gray over-road lattice gantries that each had two blank sign panels and sheets of different stickers to apply to them. They were also supplied in every US-1 set, including the Stomper Set with some special labels, including one for a Stomper Garage.\n\nMost of the stickers provided relate to the various action stations: Log Loader 3 Miles Ahead, Dump Site, Motor City Car Lot, Freight Terminal, Gravel Terminal, Gravel Hopper, Oil Refinery, etc. (There was never an Oil Refinery Action Station). The stickers have a tendency to dry out and fall off over time and the gantries themselves are delicate and prone to breakage, deformation and yellowing.\n\nThe earlier gantries have a clearance height of 60mm from the ground and have 35mm long flat feet on either side intended to be tucked under the track. These are not very effective at standing up and are too low for the loaded car transporter to pass beneath.\n\nThe later type of gantries have a 70mm clearance from the ground and the feet are only 25mm long, but each has a wedge shape projecting against the side of the track. The newer design clips positively against the track and usually remains there.\n\nIn place, the gantries are scenic, but tend to obstruct the cleaning of contact rails or attending to a vehicle.\n\n'''3768 Overhead Highway Light''' is a neat little gray streetlamp, set on a huge base that housed an AA battery and was operated by a switch. The bulb is a Grain of Wheat type mounted in the head with a reflector behind. These are surprisingly effective when they work, but they often don't, due to failed bulbs, broken switches and corrosion from leaky batteries.\n\nAlthough never sold separately, the light gray '''US-1 Elevated Piers''' appeared in four of the trucking sets and were a key part of the '''3453 Elevated Gravel Unloader'''. A set of piers included two of each. Pier 1 is 19mm high, number 2 is 38mm and pier 3 reached a height of 57mm. In the top of each pier was a 11mm-diameter round hole that engaged with the corresponding round lugs on the underside of most lengths of US-1 Track.\n\nBesides the piers, elevated items in the US-1 series included the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which required the track to be at 73mm from the base and the '''Elevated Log Loader''' which needed it to be at 76mm high. The US-1 piers are the same as those sold to use with Tyco Quick Clik racing track although these were often cream instead of light gray. The shape of the pillars (a gently tapered series of progressively smaller concentric oblongs), goes back to the Tyco Pro series of track, although the top fixings of those were not compatible with US-1 or Quick Clik.\n\n'''Working Height:''' Although sold for potential use with an HO-scale model railroad, the US-1 elevated track has a clearance of 57mm provided by the high level piers, which is insufficient to clear a train running below. This is made worse if a 'roadbed' type model railroad track is used, where the track sits on some imitation ballast, raising the height of the rails by several mm.\n\n57mm is also too low to allow a loaded car transporter pass underneath. However, as the elevated piers are hollow, it is possible to stack them upon each other, to give the extra height required, provided enough can be found.\n\nIt is still possible to get packs of brand new unused (old stock) Tyco piers from at least one supplier on the Internet. One layout that can be seen on a video app has a high level circuit supported by 87mm high pillars which have been created from 3 of the middle rise piers firmly stacked together. This height is enough to clear an HO Railroad on a roadbed type track, as well as any US-1 road circuit running a loaded car transporter.\n\nThere were also three [[Plastic model|Plastic Construction Kits]]: a '''[[Mobil Oil|Mobil Truck Station]]''', a '''[[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson's Truck Stop]]''', and a '''P.I.E. Freight Terminal''', each molded in several colors to be glued together. These were supplied by Pola, in what was then [[West Germany]] and were also sold for a time as part of the Tyco model railroad range, but in plain Tyco 'Brown Box' packaging and with slightly different names and in some cases different colourings or markings. The Truck station and Freight Terminal kits have appeared in other ranges over the years and are still available, but now as part of the [[Wm. K. Walthers|Walther's]] Trainline range and with different colourings and markings.\n\n=== Sets ===\nMost US-1 pieces came together in a series of sets, based on certain duties a truck would need to do. Numerous sets came out between 1981 and 1986, each with varied action accessories as described above. Some sets were themed, such as the 3235 Road & Rail set, with a complete railroad and two of the 3727 grade crossings, or the 3217 G.I. Joe High Adventure Set, based around soldiers and their equipment.\n\nThe vehicles supplied in the sets were however only a small selection of those available: The Peterbilt tipper appeared in most sets (except the G.I. Joe, Highway Wrecker and Stomper Sets) - Usually in the standard lime green, but was olive green especially for the army transport set and is believed to have been red in the rare Empire Set\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi-tractor was also included in most sets, (except Army Transport, Fire Alert and Stomper sets) the colors being red with white stripes or yellow with orange and black stripes (both are consequently common colors for this vehicle). It was in Army Green in the GI Joe set.\n\nThe Kenworth Semi-tractor was only sold in two sets - appearing in blue with stripes in the Fire Alert set, whilst the olive version was exclusive to the Army Transport set. In the Night Haulers set the Green tipper and the Red Peterbilt semi-tractor were both lighted versions\n\nOther vehicles featuring in sets are the Fire Truck, Wrecker, Dummy Firebird, Stomper Blazer, Stomper Pick Up and the Cobra Troop carrier which was only available in the G.I. Joe set\n\nThe G.I. Joe set also came with soldiers, tanks, jeeps, a helicopter, a boat, a bridge, paratroopers, a die-cut Secret Cobra Command Headquarters, a full-color G.I. Joe Action Battle Mat (with Mountain Backdrop) and a unique '''Satellite Launching Pad with Gantry''' Action Accessory.\n\nArguably, one of the rarest and most expensive sets has a [[Schaper Toys|Schaper]] Stompers theme. Only produced in 1985, complete examples are very rare. It contains a special version of the Airport in brown (3434), unique this set. A die-cut cardboard building can be folded to make a garage for the cars. The set sits on a Stompers-themed playmat, with a portion of the track supported by Elevated Piers.\n\nAnother rare set is the 3213 Highway Wrecker Set, released in 1984. This set contains a gravel loader, gravel unloader, garage, double turnout, special straight with [[Telephone booth|phone booth]], billboard sign. The phone booth straight and [[billboard]] sign were only available in this set and are extremely difficult to procure.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Set Ref.\n!1981\n!1982\n!1983\n!1984\n!1985\n!1986\n|-\n|3201\n|Big City Trucking\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3202\n!\n|City Hauler Starter\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3203\n!\n!\n|Big Hauler\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3204\n!\n!\n|Army Transport\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3205\n|Cross Country Trucking\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3206\n!\n|Interstate Delivery\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3208\n!\n!\n|Interstate Delivery\n|Interstate Delivery\n|Interstate Delivery\n|Interstate Delivery\n|-\n|3209\n!\n!\n|Motor City\n|Motor City\n|Motor City\n|Motor City\n|-\n|3210\n|Interstate Trucking\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3211\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|Stomper\nHigh Adventure\n!\n|-\n|3212\n!\n|Highway Construction\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3213\n!\n!\n!\n|Highway Wrecker\n!\n!\n|-\n|3215\n|Long Haul Trucker\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3216\n!\n|Highway Overpass\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|3217\n!\n!\n!\n|G.I.

This is usually because most sections of US-1 track were just a gray variant of the Quick Clik black racing track. Some items can be found with a racing and US-1 reference underneath - the Squeeze track and the Lane changer for example, but even then the number molded is usually a part number rather than a catalogue number. For example the bespoke 9\" Junction carries the reference 3016 beneath but was listed as 3700. Most separate track appears to have been sold in pairs in carded blister packs except the 9\" junction and the railroad crossing which were individually sold in blister packs and the squeeze track which was sold with the flashing beacon in an illustrated box.\n\nWe have listed the special and rare 'set only' items of track in the table above by their molded numbers, to help identify them.\n\nThere were several different '''Assortment Packs''' advertised in the annual catalogs. These contained substantial quantities of track, and other items such as Street Lamps or Overhead Signs. The contents and reference numbers changed over time, but the packs always appeared to contain three transformers and three controllers, which seems rather odd. It is not known how these were packaged and they were never shown on retail price lists, so they may well have been aimed at dealers.\n\nBoulder Loading Bulldozer*  - Two reference numbers have come to light for this item: 3414 is shown on literature enclosed with the accessory, whilst 3470 appears in the 1984 and 1985 Tyco catalogs. Both are shown above. Anyone with access to a box for this please feel free to update!\n\n\n== TYCO US-1 Catalogues and literature  or  \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" ==\nThe US-1 range first appeared in the joint Tyco racing and model railroad catalogue in 1981 and was then shown every year until 1986. It featured in a number of other promotional leaflets too, as well as magazine adverts etc.\n\nOne big issue for the collector is the accuracy of how the range was represented in some of those illustrations and also the images on the various set and accessory boxes. The set boxes also carried large artist's renderings of other makes and types of trucks and trailers that didn't appear in the range. How things were illustrated was not necessarily how they actually appeared when sold.\n\nThe first example of this is the track with yellow centre lines. This was produced only briefly, but was still being illustrated in catalogues several years later. Some of the images of the assembled set contents showed yellow lines throughout their time in the range, although this wasn't the case.\n\nThe second issue is of prototype or pre-production models being shown instead of the final version. This is particularly true of the crate unloader, gravel hopper, gravel bin and pipe loading crane illustrations, some of which are clearly not the versions actually produced, all differing in several details.\n\nThe third example is the type of trucks shown in the various set content illustrations. If you see the section on lighted vehicles you will see that these were only supplied in one set. There were also clear differences between lighted vehicles and those without lights, most noticeably the two rectangular headlights either side of the grill were open instead of solid, with a clear plastic lens inside.\n\nIf you study various set illustrations you will see that many of the vehicles shown accompanying some of the sets are actually lighted ones, even though these were not supplied in that particular set. Conversely it appears that early some early lighted trucks were listed without them actually being identified as such. The lighted Semi-Tractor in Yellow with orange and black stripes appears to be one example of this.\n\nFinally, a few items are shown in a color finish the actual items never carried. For example the top section of the motor city barrel loader is shown as being blue, but was in reality just the normal brown version with Motor City Stickers. The US-1 Police car was a two door Dodge Charger but at least once it was shown as a four door Plymouth Satellite with a large blower.\n\nSo even though Tyco may have illustrated it, that does not mean that you can find it!\n\n==Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1 ==\nThe Peterbilt Semi-Tractor had preceded the US-1 range, being introduced in 1979 on the lighted HP2 racing chassis and a slotless, lighted Command Control chassis. The latter was black with flames and no hole in the fifth wheel - or sometimes a hole, which was too small for the later trailers.\n\nCommand Control was Tyco\u2019s first attempt at slotless racing and a direct competitor to the original [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] [[Total Control Racing]] or TCR. The same body was later used again in the Tyco version of the Slotless TCR system produced from 1991 to 1993\n\nBoth the Peterbilt and Kenworth Semi-tractor moldings were used in racing form, with a chromed plastic fifth wheel, which was initially attached by a rivet and two melted-over plastic side pegs to the platform behind the driver\u2019s cab. On later Peterbilts the rivet was deleted and the side pegs were considered enough, although the rivet hole remained. \n\nTwo versions of the Kenworth 'Cab over' Semis were available in racing form between 1983 and 1985 with HP7 chassis. One is mainly black with a red stripe that has white edges and the other mainly white with blue patches and orange stripes. \n\nMost of the racing and Slotless Semi-tractor bodies can be easily adapted to fit a US-1 chassis by drilling out the hollow rivet and pegs that hold the chromed plastic fifth wheel in place. Any vehicle so modified will have three evenly spaced tell-tale holes visible on the platform just behind the cab. On some early examples of the Peterbilt Semi-Tractor this rear platform is lower and consequently these bodies will not fit a US-1 chassis without further work.\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi bodies that won't fit on a US-1 chassis can be identified by their colors: Baby Blue with Black Stripes or White with Red Stripes. Also some in Yellow with fine Orange and Red Stripes or Black with Flames used the original version of the body as well as the later version that will fit. Some of these had gray grills and exhausts instead of Chrome.\n\nOf the many US-1 trailers, only the box type made it into the racing series, appearing in various color schemes. The later had a redesigned reversible bogie with a slot-guide plus a bar magnet to encourage it to stay on the track, although some are known to carry the US-1-type bogie. At the front end, these box trailers kept their US-1 style pivot, allowing them to be run with US-1 Semi-Tractors.\n\nThe Dodge Van can be found in various liveries in racing form and also in Tyco TCR form as the Blue and White \u2018Emergency\u2019 Jam Car. This featured the red light-bar that had been used on the US-1 Mack Fire Truck.\n\nPolice Cars: There is a US-1 publicity photo showing a four-door [[Plymouth Satellite]] in use as the US-1 Police Car: with roof lights, a large hood mounted blower and side pipes, but this was never released as part of the US-1 range. (See the Tyco Resource in the '''External Links''' section Below - Vehicles page)\n\nThe US-1 \u2018911\u2019 police car and Airport Taxi were based on the two-door [[Dodge Charger]] that had been introduced to the Tyco range back in 1977. This was done without \u2018door-netting\u2019 on the glazing and the body was modified to take the roof lights for the police car. The Charger remained in the Tyco racing range until 2005.\n\nOther US-1 vehicles that can be found with a racing chassis are the Jeep in civilian colors which was available from 1980 to 1983 and the Black and Gold Firebird which was sold from 1979 to 1983 but was to eventually reappear in 2005 and 2006 in two special sets.\n\nThere are eight non-US-1 versions of the Stomper Blazer, five of which were equipped with lights, that the US-1 version never carried. One was sold as part of the Faller AMS series. The three 'flame paint' versions had no lights\n\nThe Mack Fire Truck was also sold as part of the Faller AMS range, both individually (cat no. 5631) and in the 'Feuer Alarm' set (Cat no. 3907), which also contained a lighted blue and white racing version of the Pontiac Firebird. These were both introduced in 1983 and the truck was catalogued for at least two years. From two examples seen, it would appear to be the standard US-1 offering, with the same chassis, mechanical bell, lights and American markings. Even the molded 'Tyco H.K.'markings were underneath.\n\nUnusually, at this late stage, Faller AMS had extensive links to Aurora AFX. The Fire Truck appeared in the Faller range alongside some of the same Semi-Tractors and trailers which were also sold as part of the Aurora 'Big Ryder' series, (which was their answer to Tyco US-1), as well as other Tyco offerings.\n\n== Spare Parts, Running and Collecting ==\n'''Spare parts:''' Some parts, such as pick-ups, were originally available from the manufacturers, but today these are hard to find. Luckily a number of people have begun producing parts to keep US-1 vehicles running. Tires which fit all the standard vehicles are available from a number of vendors. Specially stamped and shaped replacement pick-ups can be obtained too, which fit all the vehicles in the series, (including the Stompers). Recently, batches of light bars for the wrecker and fire engine have been made, along with the unique tires for the Stomper and some US-1-type metal guide pins. Their availability can be seen on the Internet.\n\n'''Motor''': The motor used throughout US-1 was a standard [[Mabuchi Motor|Mabuchi]] item and can also be found fitted to other vehicles, including 'Ideal' Slot Cars, later some slotless Tyco TCR 'Jam Cars'. [[New old stock]] spares can sometimes be found and many similar, but not identical motors were made. When checking a Mabuchi motor to see if it will be a suitable replacement, the available length of the shaft to take the worm gear and the position of the contacts (which is on the side of US-1 motors) need to be considered.\n\n'''Customised items and Replicas:''' One vendor specialises in making double 90 degree turnouts out of two single ones, along with 9\" and 6\" single straights. All very handy when maximising layout space. Vendors offering trucks, trailers, loads and Action Accessories in custom finishes, such as FedEx, can often be found on a well known Internet auction site\n\n'''Running suggestions:''' To run US-1 (and not use the original control gear), wires can be carefully soldered to the underside of the two contact strips, but given the age and condition of the track, it is recommended that as the layout size increases, the number of 'feeds' to each circuit are increased to avoid voltage drop. US-1 track has not always aged well and much found will have discolored or had minor bits broken off at the joints. To obtain the best running results, use the best track available and clean it well: Wash and scrub with a good detergent and then dry it thoroughly. Give the contact strips a rub with an abrasive track-cleaning block, (like those used for model railroads) and pay particular attention to the areas where the metal contact strips join. Treatment of the metal strips with a non-damaging contact oil can be helpful, but try to avoid getting any on the road surface.\n\n'''Integration with Other Makes:''' US-1 vehicles will run on most other makes of HO slot car track, but the Action Accessories can only be connected to Tyco US-1 track via the special US-1 turnouts. US-1 track is a gray version of Tyco Quick Clik and this is compatible with the later Mattel track.  Adaptor sections to join Quick Clik to the older Tyco Pro and Life-Like Racing tracks have been made, but only the [[Round 2 (company)|Auto World]] 'Tyco Quick Clik to Tomy AFX' type appears to still be in production.\n\nVehicles from this range are relatively wide, so if two trucks are simultaneously run on an earlier, narrower slot-car track, like Playcraft Highways or [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora Model Motoring]], they will collide.\n\nNon US-1 vehicles can be run on Trucking layouts, but lighter types like Aurora [[Pancake (slot car)|TJets]] will get 'beached' on the sprung copper tongues at the junctions, wheras Magnetic slot cars will generally cope quite well as they usually have enough 'virtual' weight to pass through them.\n\n'''Control Gear:''' In the experience of this contributor, (from running various makes of model electric roadways for around 35 years), the best type of controller to use is a Model Railroad 'feedback' type. These give good speed control and steady constant speed running, (resistance types of many makes have been tried but can cause erratic running). Videos exist showing the trucks being successfully run with Model Railroad [[Digital Command Control]] 'electronic chips' fitted. This is not for the faint-hearted and can also be expensive.\n\n'''Servicing:''' Any vehicle obtained will need a good clean, and the tunnel weight temporarily removed by prising the side with a small flat screwdriver. This allows removal of fluff, which accumulates around the worm screw and rear axle. Lightly oil the motor bearings, axles and gears, replace the tires if they are hardened and the pick ups, too, if they are 'rutted'.\n\n'''Fitting Replacement Pick Ups:''' Do not pre-bend them, the cast plate that holds them into the chassis will automatically set them to correct angle as they are screwed into place. (Pre-bending them can exert to much force on the roadway, resulting in lost traction). However it is important to ensure that the folded 'retaining brackets' at the ends of the strips are free to travel up and down in their open mountings. On the Semi-Tractors ensure that the 'return' portion of these brackets does not rub against the Fifth Wheel weight, or it will stop it moving freely and may cause a short circuit.\n\n'''Videos:''' Although today models and sets are bought by collectors, many US-1 trucks are operated either at home or at public shows. Videos showing this can be found on some video apps. Some of the films show the various loading and unloading accessories in action and original commercials for the range can be found, too: Search for 'Tyco Trucking' or 'Tyco US-1'.\n\n==External links==\nUS-1 Trucking Resource [http://tycotrain.tripod.com/tycous1trucking/]\n\nDerek A Brand - Tribute Page = [http://www.daveshobby.net/derek-brand-tribute.html]\n\nHistory of HO Slot Car racing [http://www.hoslotcarracing.com/History.html]\n\nTyco Catalogs (Year by year, page by page) [https://www.hoseeker.org/tyco.htm]\n\n==See also==\n* [[U.S. 1 (comics)]], a [[Marvel Comics]] series licensed from this toyline, set in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n[[Category:Toy cars and trucks]]\n\n\n{{Toy-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Highwayman97", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTYCO US-1 Catalogues and literature  or  \"It Ain't Necessarily So\":tidy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-1_Trucks"}
