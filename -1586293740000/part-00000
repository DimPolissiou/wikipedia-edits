He had already been summoned to Parliament as '''Lord Harclay''' (or Lord Harcla) in 1321. However, Lord Carlisle was executed for treason in 1322, with his titles forfeited.\n\nThe second creation came in 1622, when [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|James Hay, 1st Viscount Doncaster]], was made '''Earl of Carlisle'''.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carlisle, Earls of}}</ref> He was a great favourite of [[James VI and I|James I]] and had already been created '''Lord Hay''' in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] in 1606, as well as '''Baron Hay''', of Sawley in the County of York, and '''Viscount Doncaster''' in 1618. The latter titles were in the Peerage of England. Lord Carlisle was the member of a junior branch of the Hay family, headed by the [[Earl of Erroll]]. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the second Earl. In 1637, he also succeeded his maternal grandfather, Charles Goring, 2nd Earl of Norwich, as second Baron Denny (a title created by writ in 1604; see [[Earl of Norwich]]). However, Carlisle was childless and on his death in 1660, all the titles became extinct.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe third creation came in 1660, when [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Sir Charles Howard]] was made '''Baron Dacre of Gillesland''', in the County of Cumberland, '''Viscount Howard of Morpeth''', in the County of Northumberland, and '''Earl of Carlisle'''. A member of the prominent [[Howard family]], he was the great-grandson of [[Lord William Howard]], third son of [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]]. Lord William Howard's wife was Elizabeth Dacre, youngest daughter of [[Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre]] (of Gillesland), a title which had fallen into [[abeyance]] on the death of the fifth Baron in 1569. Through this marriage, [[Naworth Castle]] and Henderskelfe Castle (which later became the site of [[Castle Howard]]) came into the Howard family. Lord Carlisle had earlier supported the Parliamentarian cause in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], and he is supposed to have been created ''Baron Gilsland'' and ''Viscount Howard of Morpeth'' by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1657 (it is certain that he was summoned to Cromwell's House of Lords the same year as \"Lord Viscount Howard\").<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle|the second Earl]]. He represented [[Morpeth (UK Parliament constituency)|Morpeth]], [[Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|Cumberland]] and [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland]]. On his death, the titles passed to his son, [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle|the third Earl]].<ref name=EB1911/> He was a prominent statesman and served as [[First Lord of the Treasury]] from 1701 to 1702, and in 1715. His third but eldest surviving son, [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle|the fourth Earl]],<ref name=EB1911/> sat as Member of Parliament for Morpeth. He was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle|the fifth Earl]]. He was an influential politician and held office as [[First Lord of Trade]], as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], as [[Lord Steward of the Household]] and as [[Lord Privy Seal]].\n\nHis eldest son, [[George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle|the sixth Earl]], also gained political prominence. He served as [[First Commissioner of Woods and Forests]] and as [[Lord Privy Seal]], and was [[Minister without Portfolio]] between 1830 and 1834 in the famous [[Whig Government 1830-1834|Whig government]] of [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]]. He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle|the seventh Earl]]. He was a noted politician and served as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was a clergyman and served as Rector of [[Londesborough]] in Yorkshire. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. [[Charles Wentworth George Howard]], fifth son of the sixth Earl. He represented [[Cumberland East (UK Parliament constituency)|Cumberland East]] in Parliament as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and was also a well-regarded painter.\n\nHis eldest son, the tenth Earl, was [[Liberal Unionist]] Member of Parliament for [[Birmingham South (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham South]]. He was succeeded by his only son, the eleventh Earl. He married as his first wife Bridget Helen Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven of Freeland (see [[Lord Ruthven of Freeland]] for earlier history of this title). On his death in 1963, the titles passed to his only son, the twelfth Earl. In 1982, he also succeeded his mother as twelfth Lord Ruthven of Freeland. {{As of|2020}}, the peerages are held by his eldest son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1994. Lord Carlisle unsuccessfully contested [[Easington (UK Parliament constituency)|Easington]] in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] and [[Leeds West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds West]] in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].\n\nSeveral other members of this branch of the Howard family have gained distinction. The Hon. [[Charles Howard (British army officer)|Sir Charles Howard]], fourth son of the third Earl, was a general in the Army and also represented Carlisle in the House of Commons for many years. [[Charles Howard, Viscount Morpeth]], eldest son of the fourth Earl from his first marriage, briefly represented [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] before his early death from [[tuberculosis]]. The Hon. Frederick Howard, third son of the fifth Earl, was a major in the [[10th Hussars]] and fought at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, where he was killed in action. His eldest son [[Frederick John Howard]] was Member of Parliament for [[Youghal (UK Parliament constituency)|Youghal]]. The Very Reverend the Hon. Henry Edward John Howard, fourth son of the fifth Earl, was Dean of Lichfield. His third son Edward Henry Howard was a [[vice-admiral]] in the Navy.\n\nAdmiral the Hon. [[Edward Howard, 1st Baron Lanerton|Edward Granville George Howard]], fourth son of the sixth Earl, was created [[Baron Lanerton]] in 1874. The aforementioned the Hon. [[Charles Wentworth George Howard]], fifth son of the sixth Earl, represented [[East Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|East Cumberland]] in Parliament for almost forty years. [[Harriet Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Lady Harriet Howard]], third daughter of the sixth Earl, was the wife of [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland]]. She was [[Mistress of the Robes]] to [[Queen Victoria]] and an active [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] in society circles. The Hon. [[Geoffrey William Algernon Howard]], fifth son of the ninth Earl, was a Liberal Member of Parliament. His second son was [[George Howard, Baron Howard of Henderskelfe]].\n\nThe [[heir apparent]] to the earldom, when one exists, is styled ''Viscount Morpeth''.\n\nThe principal family seat today is [[Naworth Castle]], while [[Castle Howard]] is now held by a [[cadet branch]] of the family.\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, First Creation (1322)==\n* [[Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (died 1323) (forfeit 1323)\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, Second Creation (1622)==\n* [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (c. 1590\u20131636)\n* [[James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle]] (1612\u20131660) (extinct)\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, Third Creation (1661)==\n* [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (1629\u20131685)\n* [[Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle]] (1646\u20131692); eldest son of the 1st Earl\n* [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle]] (1669\u20131738); eldest son of the 2nd Earl\n* [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]] (1694\u20131758); eldest son of the 3rd Earl\n** Hon.

He represented [[Morpeth (UK Parliament constituency)|Morpeth]], [[Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|Cumberland]] and [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland]]. On his death, the titles passed to his son, [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle|the third Earl]].<ref name=EB1911/> He was a prominent statesman and served as [[First Lord of the Treasury]] from 1701 to 1702, and in 1715. His third but eldest surviving son, [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle|the fourth Earl]],<ref name=EB1911/> sat as Member of Parliament for Morpeth. He was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle|the fifth Earl]]. He was an influential politician and held office as [[First Lord of Trade]], as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], as [[Lord Steward of the Household]] and as [[Lord Privy Seal]].\n\nHis eldest son, [[George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle|the sixth Earl]], also gained political prominence. He served as [[First Commissioner of Woods and Forests]] and as [[Lord Privy Seal]], and was [[Minister without Portfolio]] between 1830 and 1834 in the famous [[Whig Government 1830-1834|Whig government]] of [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]]. He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle|the seventh Earl]]. He was a noted politician and served as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was a clergyman and served as Rector of [[Londesborough]] in Yorkshire. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. [[Charles Wentworth George Howard]], fifth son of the sixth Earl. He represented [[Cumberland East (UK Parliament constituency)|Cumberland East]] in Parliament as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and was also a well-regarded painter.\n\nHis eldest son, the tenth Earl, was [[Liberal Unionist]] Member of Parliament for [[Birmingham South (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham South]]. He was succeeded by his only son, the eleventh Earl. He married as his first wife Bridget Helen Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven of Freeland (see [[Lord Ruthven of Freeland]] for earlier history of this title). On his death in 1963, the titles passed to his only son, the twelfth Earl. In 1982, he also succeeded his mother as twelfth Lord Ruthven of Freeland. {{As of|2020}}, the peerages are held by his eldest son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1994. Lord Carlisle unsuccessfully contested [[Easington (UK Parliament constituency)|Easington]] in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] and [[Leeds West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds West]] in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].\n\nSeveral other members of this branch of the Howard family have gained distinction. The Hon. [[Charles Howard (British army officer)|Sir Charles Howard]], fourth son of the third Earl, was a general in the Army and also represented Carlisle in the House of Commons for many years. [[Charles Howard, Viscount Morpeth]], eldest son of the fourth Earl from his first marriage, briefly represented [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire]] before his early death from [[tuberculosis]]. The Hon. Frederick Howard, third son of the fifth Earl, was a major in the [[10th Hussars]] and fought at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, where he was killed in action. His eldest son [[Frederick John Howard]] was Member of Parliament for [[Youghal (UK Parliament constituency)|Youghal]]. The Very Reverend the Hon. Henry Edward John Howard, fourth son of the fifth Earl, was Dean of Lichfield. His third son Edward Henry Howard was a [[vice-admiral]] in the Navy.\n\nAdmiral the Hon. [[Edward Howard, 1st Baron Lanerton|Edward Granville George Howard]], fourth son of the sixth Earl, was created [[Baron Lanerton]] in 1874. The aforementioned the Hon. [[Charles Wentworth George Howard]], fifth son of the sixth Earl, represented [[East Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|East Cumberland]] in Parliament for almost forty years. [[Harriet Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Lady Harriet Howard]], third daughter of the sixth Earl, was the wife of [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland]]. She was [[Mistress of the Robes]] to [[Queen Victoria]] and an active [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] in society circles. The Hon. [[Geoffrey William Algernon Howard]], fifth son of the ninth Earl, was a Liberal Member of Parliament. His second son was [[George Howard, Baron Howard of Henderskelfe]].\n\nThe [[heir apparent]] to the earldom, when one exists, is styled ''Viscount Morpeth''.\n\nThe principal family seat today is [[Naworth Castle]], while [[Castle Howard]] is now held by a [[cadet branch]] of the family.\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, First Creation (1322)==\n* [[Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (died 1323) (forfeit 1323)\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, Second Creation (1622)==\n* [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (c. 1590\u20131636)\n* [[James Hay, 2nd Earl of Carlisle]] (1612\u20131660) (extinct)\n\n==Earls of Carlisle, Third Creation (1661)==\n* [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle]] (1629\u20131685)\n* [[Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle]] (1646\u20131692); eldest son of the 1st Earl\n* [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle]] (1669\u20131738); eldest son of the 2nd Earl\n* [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]] (1694\u20131758); eldest son of the 3rd Earl\n** Hon.

Maria Eleonora ordered that the king should not be buried until she could be buried with him. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open, and went to see it regularly, patting it and taking no notice of the [[putrefaction]]. Eventually, the embarrassed chancellor, [[Axel Oxenstierna]], saw no other solution than to have a guard posted at the room to prevent further episodes.<ref>Peter Englund: ''S\u00f8lvmasken'' (s. 159), edited by Spartacus, Oslo 2009, {{ISBN|978-82-430-0466-5}}</ref> As a result, he was not buried until 22&nbsp;June 1634, more than eighteen months later.\n\nIn 1634, the [[Instrument of Government (1634)|Instrument of Government]], a new constitution, was introduced by Oxenstierna.

In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, [[Ebba Leijonhufvud]] and [[Christina Natt och Dag]] were appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title ''Upptuktelse-F\u00f6rest\u00e5nderska'' ('Castigation Mistress'), while [[Beata Oxenstierna]] and [[Ebba Ryning]] were appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of ''Hovm\u00e4starinna''.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\">Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62</ref>\n\n[[File:Queenchristine.jpg|thumb|The 14-year-old Christina as queen, painting by [[Jacob Heinrich Elbfas]]]]\nThe Royal Council's method of giving Queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person appears to have been effective, as Christina did not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and did not seem to have formed any attachment to any of them; in fact, with only a few exceptions, such as [[Ebba Sparre]], [[Lady Jane Ruthven]] and [[Louise van der Nooth]], Christina did not show any interest in any of her female courtiers, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than they.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\"/>\n\nChristina was educated as a royal male would have been. The theologian [[Johannes Matthiae Gothus]] became her tutor; he gave her lessons in [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. Chancellor Oxenstierna taught her politics and discussed [[Tacitus]] with her. Oxenstierna wrote proudly of the 14-year-old girl that, \"She is not at all like a female\" and that she had \"a bright intelligence\". Christina seemed happy to study ten hours a day.

He won several battles, and in 1631, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] decided France would support Sweden with money and soldiers. But Gustavus was killed in 1632.\n\nCount Oxenstierna became regent and continued Sweden's part in the war. Defeated in the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)]], the Swedish army retreated from southern Germany to [[Pomerania]]. Though Sweden won some later battles, the war effort was exhausting.\n\nChristina reached her majority in 1644, and Chancellor Oxenstierna soon discovered that her political views differed from his own. In 1645 he sent his son, [[Johan Oxenstierna]], to the Peace Congress in the [[Westphalia]]n cities of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], to argue against peace. Christina, however, wanted peace at any cost and sent her own delegate, [[Johan Adler Salvius]].\n\nThe [[Peace of Westphalia]] was signed between May and October 1648, effectively ending the [[European wars of religion]]. Sweden received an indemnity of five million [[thaler]]s, used primarily to pay its troops. Sweden further received [[Western Pomerania]] (henceforth [[Swedish Pomerania]]), [[Wismar]], the [[Archbishopric of Bremen]], and the [[Bishopric of Verden]] as hereditary fiefs, thus gaining a seat and vote in the [[Diet of the Holy Roman Empire]] and in the respective diets (''[[Kreistag]]'') of three [[Imperial Circles]]: the [[Upper Saxon Circle]], [[Lower Saxon Circle]], and [[Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle]]; the city of Bremen was disputed.<ref>B\u00f6hme, Klaus-R (2001).

A second expedition in 1654 had failed and the [[Henry II, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]] gave up. <!--Supported by the [[Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena|Duke of Modena]], Mazarin was now considering Christina as a possible queen for Naples.--> Christina's goal was to become a mediator between France and Spain in their contest to control Naples. Her plan detailed that she would lead French troops to take Naples and rule until bequeathing the crown to France after her death. Christina sent home all her Spanish servants, including her confidant Pimentel and her confessor Gu\u00eames.<ref>D. Lanoye, p. 150.</ref> On 20 July 1656 Christina set sail from [[Civitavecchia]] for Marseille where she arrived nine days later. In early August she traveled to Paris, accompanied by the Duke of Guise. Mazarin gave her no official sponsorship, but gave instructions that she be celebrated and entertained in every town on her way north.\n\nOn 8 September she arrived in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her masculine appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier|la Grande Mademoiselle]], she, as the latter recalls, \"surprised me very much \u2013 applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature\".<ref>''Memoirs of Mademoiselle de Montpensier''. H. Colburn, 1848. Page 48.</ref>\n\nChristina was treated with respect by the young [[Louis XIV]] and his mother, [[Anne of Austria]], in [[Compi\u00e8gne]]. On 22 September 1656, the arrangement between her and Louis XIV was ready.  He would recommend Christina as queen to the Kingdom of Naples, and serve as guarantor against Spanish aggression. As Queen of Naples she would be financially independent of the Swedish king, and also capable of negotiating peace between France and Spain.{{refn|group=note|Mazarin however found another arrangement to ensure peace; he strengthened this with a marriage arrangement between Louis XIV and his first cousin, [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] \u2013 the wedding took place in 1660. But this was unknown to Christina, who sent different messengers to Mazarin to remind him of their plan.}}\n\nOn her way back Christina visited the beautiful and atheistic [[Ninon de l'Enclos]] in the convent at [[Lagny-sur-Marne]]. In early October she left France and arrived in [[Torino]]. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in [[Pesaro]], probably to flee the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in Rome.

It is not known where she stayed that summer. In Fontainebleau she was ordered by the court to halt. <!--In Madrid and Naples they seem to have had an idea about her plans; 3,000 soldiers are sent to the Kingdom of Naples and new fortifications appear along the coast?

He insisted that betrayal should be punished with death. She was convinced that he had pronounced his own death sentence. After an hour or so Le Bel was to receive his confession. Both Le Bel and Monaldeschi entreated for mercy, but he was stabbed by her domestics \u2013 notably Ludovico Santinelli \u2013 in his stomach and in his neck. Wearing his [[coat of mail]], which protected him, he was chased around in an adjacent room before they finally succeeded in dealing him a fatal wound in his throat. \"In the end, he died, confessing his infamy and admitting [Santinelli's] innocence, protesting that he had invented the whole fantastic story in order to ruin [him].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|title=Gribble, Francis (2013) The Court of Christina of Sweden, and the Later Adventures of the Queen in Exile, pp. 196\u20137.|accessdate=10 July 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428064942/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Court_of_Christina_of_Sweden_and_the_Later_Adventures_of_the_Queen_in_1000493935/217|archivedate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Palace of Fontainebleau 030.jpg|thumb|Galerie des Cerfs]]\n\nFather Le Bel was told to have him buried inside the church, and Christina, seemingly unfazed, paid an abbey to say a number of Masses for his soul.

She wrote to Louis XIV who two weeks later paid her a friendly visit without mentioning it. In Rome, people felt differently; Monaldeschi had been an Italian nobleman, murdered by a foreign barbarian with Santinelli as one of her executioners. The letters proving his guilt are gone; Christina left them with Le Bel and only he confirmed that they existed. Christina never revealed what was in the letters, but according to Le Bel, it is supposed to have dealt about her \"amours\", either with Monaldeschi or another person.

His nephew, Pompeo Azzolino, was his sole heir, and he rapidly sold off Christina's art collections.\n\n==Art collector==\n\n[[File:Drottning Kristina av Sverige.jpg|thumb|left|Christina by [[David Beck]]]]\nUntil 1649, when Christina was twenty-three, the Swedish royal art collection was unimpressive, with good [[tapestries]] but for paintings, little more than \"about a hundred works by minor German, Flemish, and Swedish painters\".<ref>Watson, 97</ref>  But in May 1649 the fabulous loot from the [[Battle of Prague (1648)|occupation of Prague Castle]] the previous year arrived, with the pick of the collection amassed by the obsessive collector [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1552\u20131612), one of the most important in Europe.  Rudolf's bulk purchases had included the famous collection of [[Emperor Charles V]]'s leading minister [[Cardinal Granvelle]] (1517\u201386), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the \"greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of [[Titian]] and [[Leone Leoni|Leoni]] and many other artists\",<ref>Trevor-Roper, 112.</ref>\n\nChristina was entranced by her new possessions, and remained a keen collector for the rest of her life, and as a female art collector is only exceeded by [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia in the [[Early Modern period]].  Rudolf had collected old and contemporary works from both Italy and northern Europe, but it was the Italian paintings that excited Christina, and by her death her collection contained relatively few northern works other than portraits.<ref>Watson, 97\u201398</ref>\n\nMost of the Prague booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art.  She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to [[Antwerp]] in a ship in August 1653, almost a year before she abdicated, an early sign of her intentions.<ref>Watson, 127\u20139</ref>\n\nChristina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small [[Raphael]] [[predella]] panels from the [[Colonna Altarpiece]], including the ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome.<ref>Watson, 158. The other panels are now in London: two at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the other National Gallery; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/studying-raphael-division-of-altarpieces National Gallery page on the division of the Raphael altarpiece].</ref>  She was apparently given Titian's ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' by the greatest collector of the age, [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]], Viceroy in Brussels \u2013 she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion,<ref>Penny, 255.  It is clearly shown in one of the Tenier's views of Leopold's galleries. Leopold's collection is now part of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.</ref> and gave some generous gifts herself, notably [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s panels of [[Adam and Eve (D\u00fcrer)|''Adam'' and ''Eve'']] to [[Philip IV of Spain]] (now [[Prado]]).  She also gave away two paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Dull Gret]]'' and ''[[The Cripples]]'' (now [[Louvre]]).  In such ways the balance of her collection shifted to Italian art.<ref>Grate</ref>\n\nThe Riario Palace finally provided a suitable setting for her collection, and the ''Sala dei Quadri'' (\"Paintings Room\") had her finest works, with thirteen [[Titian]]s and eleven [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]s, five [[Raphael]]s and several [[Correggio]]s.<ref>Watson, 160\u2013161; not all these attributions would hold today.</ref> [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' was among them.  ''Venus mourns Adonis'' by Veronese was from Prague, and is now back in Sweden ([[Nationalmuseum]]).\n\n[[File:Busto-ritratto di Cristina di Svezia - Cartari.jpg|thumb|Bust of Christina by [[Giulio Cartari]] in [[Palacio Real de La Granja de San Ildefonso]]]]\nChristina liked to commission portraits of herself, friends, and also notable people she had not met, from 1647 sending [[David Beck]], her Dutch court painter, to several countries to paint notabilities.<ref>Watson, 120\u2013121</ref>  She encouraged artists to study her collection, including the drawings, and exhibited some of her paintings, but apart from portraits she commissioned or bought few works by living painters, except for drawings.  Sculptors did rather better, and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] was a friend, while others were commissioned to restore the large collection of classical sculpture which she had begun to assemble while still in Sweden.<ref>Grate; Watson, 110, 142, 152\u2013162</ref>\n\nOn her death she left her collection to Cardinal Decio Azzolino, who himself died within a year, leaving the collection to his nephew, who sold it to Don Livio [[Odescalchi]], commander of the Papal army,<ref>Watson,168\u20139; Odescalchi was the nephew of [[Pope Innocent XI]], though in fact his money was inherited and his career greatly improved after his uncle's death.</ref> at which point it contained 275 paintings, 140 of them Italian.<ref>Watson, 170; Penny 463 has different numbers, saying Crozat initially saw over 400 paintings.</ref>  The year after Odescalchi's death in 1713, his heirs began protracted negotiations with the great French connoisseur and collector [[Pierre Crozat]], acting as intermediary for [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], from 1715 the Regent of France.  The sale was finally concluded and the 123 paintings included in the sale delivered in 1721, forming the core of the [[Orleans Collection]], the paintings from which were mostly sold in London after the [[French Revolution]], many still remaining in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Penny, 462\u20133, and [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/the_agony_in_the_garden/objectview.aspx?page=1&sort=0&sortdir=asc&keyword=Orleans&fp=1&dd1=11&dd2=0&vw=1&collID=11&OID=110001821&vT=1 Metropolitan]</ref>  The French experts complained that Christina had cut down several paintings to fit her ceilings,<ref name=\"Penny, 462\">Penny, 462</ref> and had over-restored some of the best works, especially the [[Correggio]]s, implicating [[Carlo Maratti]].<ref>Watson, 196\u20137</ref>\n\nAt first, removing her collections  from Sweden was seen as a great loss to the country; but in 1697 Stockholm castle burned down with the loss of almost everything inside, so they would have been destroyed if they had remained there.

It is possible she was [[insanity|insane]]. After the king died on 6&nbsp;November 1632 on the battlefield, his corpse was brought home in a coffin, with his heart in a separate box. Maria Eleonora ordered that the king should not be buried until she could be buried with him. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open, and went to see it regularly, patting it and taking no notice of the [[putrefaction]]. Eventually, the embarrassed chancellor, [[Axel Oxenstierna]], saw no other solution than to have a guard posted at the room to prevent further episodes.<ref>Peter Englund: ''S\u00f8lvmasken'' (s. 159), edited by Spartacus, Oslo 2009, {{ISBN|978-82-430-0466-5}}</ref> As a result, he was not buried until 22&nbsp;June 1634, more than eighteen months later.\n\nIn 1634, the [[Instrument of Government (1634)|Instrument of Government]], a new constitution, was introduced by Oxenstierna.

This solution did not suit Maria Eleonora, who had her sister-in-law banned from the castle.

In order to avoid the young queen from being dependent upon a single individual and favorite mother figure, the Royal Council decided to split the office of head lady-in-waiting (responsible for the queen's female courtiers) and the office royal governess (or foster mother) in four, with two women appointed to share each office. Accordingly, [[Ebba Leijonhufvud]] and [[Christina Natt och Dag]] were appointed to share the position of royal governess and foster mother with the title ''Upptuktelse-F\u00f6rest\u00e5nderska'' ('Castigation Mistress'), while [[Beata Oxenstierna]] and [[Ebba Ryning]] were appointed to share the position of head lady-in-waiting, all four with the formal rank and title of ''Hovm\u00e4starinna''.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\">Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n: Drottning Christina : en biografi (2008) p. 62</ref>\n\n[[File:Queenchristine.jpg|thumb|The 14-year-old Christina as queen, painting by [[Jacob Heinrich Elbfas]]]]\nThe Royal Council's method of giving Queen Christina several foster mothers to avoid her forming an attachment to a single person appears to have been effective, as Christina did not mention her foster mothers directly in her memoirs and did not seem to have formed any attachment to any of them; in fact, with only a few exceptions, such as [[Ebba Sparre]], [[Lady Jane Ruthven]] and [[Louise van der Nooth]], Christina did not show any interest in any of her female courtiers, and she generally mentions them in her memoirs only to compare herself favorably toward them by referring to herself as more masculine than they.<ref name=\"Marie-Louise Rod\u00e9n 2008 p. 62\"/>\n\nChristina was educated as a royal male would have been. The theologian [[Johannes Matthiae Gothus]] became her tutor; he gave her lessons in [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. Chancellor Oxenstierna taught her politics and discussed [[Tacitus]] with her. Oxenstierna wrote proudly of the 14-year-old girl that, \"She is not at all like a female\" and that she had \"a bright intelligence\". Christina seemed happy to study ten hours a day.

He won several battles, and in 1631, [[Cardinal Richelieu]] decided France would support Sweden with money and soldiers. But Gustavus was killed in 1632.\n\nCount Oxenstierna became regent and continued Sweden's part in the war. Defeated in the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)]], the Swedish army retreated from southern Germany to [[Pomerania]]. Though Sweden won some later battles, the war effort was exhausting.\n\nChristina reached her majority in 1644, and Chancellor Oxenstierna soon discovered that her political views differed from his own. In 1645 he sent his son, [[Johan Oxenstierna]], to the Peace Congress in the [[Westphalia]]n cities of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], to argue against peace. Christina, however, wanted peace at any cost and sent her own delegate, [[Johan Adler Salvius]].\n\nThe [[Peace of Westphalia]] was signed between May and October 1648, effectively ending the [[European wars of religion]]. Sweden received an indemnity of five million [[thaler]]s, used primarily to pay its troops. Sweden further received [[Western Pomerania]] (henceforth [[Swedish Pomerania]]), [[Wismar]], the [[Archbishopric of Bremen]], and the [[Bishopric of Verden]] as hereditary fiefs, thus gaining a seat and vote in the [[Diet of the Holy Roman Empire]] and in the respective diets (''[[Kreistag]]'') of three [[Imperial Circles]]: the [[Upper Saxon Circle]], [[Lower Saxon Circle]], and [[Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle]]; the city of Bremen was disputed.<ref>B\u00f6hme, Klaus-R (2001).

In early August she traveled to Paris, accompanied by the Duke of Guise. Mazarin gave her no official sponsorship, but gave instructions that she be celebrated and entertained in every town on her way north.\n\nOn 8 September she arrived in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her masculine appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with [[Anne Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duchess of Montpensier|la Grande Mademoiselle]], she, as the latter recalls, \"surprised me very much \u2013 applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself back in her chair, crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons...

On 22 September 1656, the arrangement between her and Louis XIV was ready.  He would recommend Christina as queen to the Kingdom of Naples, and serve as guarantor against Spanish aggression. As Queen of Naples she would be financially independent of the Swedish king, and also capable of negotiating peace between France and Spain.{{refn|group=note|Mazarin however found another arrangement to ensure peace; he strengthened this with a marriage arrangement between Louis XIV and his first cousin, [[Maria Theresa of Spain]] \u2013 the wedding took place in 1660.

In early October she left France and arrived in [[Torino]]. During the winter Christina lived in the apostolic palace in [[Pesaro]], probably to flee the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in Rome.

The letters proving his guilt are gone; Christina left them with Le Bel and only he confirmed that they existed.

Rudolf's bulk purchases had included the famous collection of [[Emperor Charles V]]'s leading minister [[Cardinal Granvelle]] (1517\u201386), which he had forced Granvelle's nephew and heir to sell to him. Granvelle had been the \"greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of [[Titian]] and [[Leone Leoni|Leoni]] and many other artists\",<ref>Trevor-Roper, 112.</ref>\n\nChristina was entranced by her new possessions, and remained a keen collector for the rest of her life, and as a female art collector is only exceeded by [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia in the [[Early Modern period]].  Rudolf had collected old and contemporary works from both Italy and northern Europe, but it was the Italian paintings that excited Christina, and by her death her collection contained relatively few northern works other than portraits.<ref>Watson, 97\u201398</ref>\n\nMost of the Prague booty remained in Sweden after Christina's departure for exile: she only took about 70 to 80 paintings with her, including about 25 portraits of her friends and family, and some 50 paintings, mostly Italian, from the Prague loot, as well as statues, jewels, 72 tapestries, and various other works of art.  She was concerned that the royal collections would be claimed by her successor, and prudently sent them ahead to [[Antwerp]] in a ship in August 1653, almost a year before she abdicated, an early sign of her intentions.<ref>Watson, 127\u20139</ref>\n\nChristina greatly expanded her collection during her exile in Rome, for example adding the five small [[Raphael]] [[predella]] panels from the [[Colonna Altarpiece]], including the ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' now reunited with the main panel in New York, which were bought from a convent near Rome.<ref>Watson, 158. The other panels are now in London: two at the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] and the other National Gallery; [https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/studying-raphael-division-of-altarpieces National Gallery page on the division of the Raphael altarpiece].</ref>  She was apparently given Titian's ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'' by the greatest collector of the age, [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]], Viceroy in Brussels \u2013 she received many such gifts from Catholic royalty after her conversion,<ref>Penny, 255.  It is clearly shown in one of the Tenier's views of Leopold's galleries. Leopold's collection is now part of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.</ref> and gave some generous gifts herself, notably [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s panels of [[Adam and Eve (D\u00fcrer)|''Adam'' and ''Eve'']] to [[Philip IV of Spain]] (now [[Prado]]).  She also gave away two paintings by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Dull Gret]]'' and ''[[The Cripples]]'' (now [[Louvre]]).  In such ways the balance of her collection shifted to Italian art.<ref>Grate</ref>\n\nThe Riario Palace finally provided a suitable setting for her collection, and the ''Sala dei Quadri'' (\"Paintings Room\") had her finest works, with thirteen [[Titian]]s and eleven [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]s, five [[Raphael]]s and several [[Correggio]]s.<ref>Watson, 160\u2013161; not all these attributions would hold today.</ref> [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|Venus Anadyomene]]'' was among them.

The sale was finally concluded and the 123 paintings included in the sale delivered in 1721, forming the core of the [[Orleans Collection]], the paintings from which were mostly sold in London after the [[French Revolution]], many still remaining in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>Penny, 462\u20133, and [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/the_agony_in_the_garden/objectview.aspx?page=1&sort=0&sortdir=asc&keyword=Orleans&fp=1&dd1=11&dd2=0&vw=1&collID=11&OID=110001821&vT=1 Metropolitan]</ref>  The French experts complained that Christina had cut down several paintings to fit her ceilings,<ref name=\"Penny, 462\">Penny, 462</ref> and had over-restored some of the best works, especially the [[Correggio]]s, implicating [[Carlo Maratti]].<ref>Watson, 196\u20137</ref>\n\nAt first, removing her collections  from Sweden was seen as a great loss to the country; but in 1697 Stockholm castle burned down with the loss of almost everything inside, so they would have been destroyed if they had remained there.  The sculpture collection was sold to the King of Spain, and mostly remains in Spanish museums and palaces.<ref>Penny, 463</ref>  Her large and important library was bought by [[Alexander VIII]] for the [[Vatican library]], while most of the paintings ended up in France, as the core of the [[Orleans Collection]] \u2013 many remain together in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]].  1700 drawings from her collection (among them works by [[Michelangelo]] (25) and [[Raphael]]) were acquired in 1790 by [[Willem Anne Lestevenon]] for the [[Teylers Museum]] in Haarlem, the Netherlands.<ref name=\"Teylers The Royal drawings\">{{cite web |title=The Royal Drawings |url=http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&id=6&nvlng=en |publisher=Teylers Museum |work=The Oval Room 1784 |accessdate=3 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501172201/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&id=6&nvlng=en |archivedate=1 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Appearance ==\n{{anchor|Appearance, body, and comportment}}\n\n[[File:Persisk rock - Livrustkammaren - 85153.tif|thumb|left|Persian coat owned by Christina, probably woven under [[Shah Abbas the Great]]'s Government (1586\u20131628)]]\n\nHistorical accounts of Christina include regular reference to her [[physical features]], [[comportment|mannerisms]] and [[style of dress]].  Christina was known to have a [[Kyphosis|bent back]], a deformed chest, and irregular shoulders.

Such ambiguity did not end with her birth; Christina made cryptic statements about her \"[[Health|constitution]]\" and body throughout her life.

It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premiss that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property. Historic proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Henry George.

There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone. From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions\u2014the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions\u2014neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a laissez-faire 'free' market. [...] Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory. The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all.}}</ref> tendencies such as [[anarcho-capitalism]],<ref>\"The philosophy of \"anarcho-capitalism\" dreamed up by the \"libertarian\" New Right, has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.\" [[Albert Meltzer|Meltzer, Albert]].

It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premiss that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property. Historic proponents of this view include Thomas Paine, Herbert Spencer, and Henry George.

There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone. From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions\u2014the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions\u2014neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a laissez-faire 'free' market. [...] Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory. The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all.}}</ref> tendencies such as [[anarcho-capitalism]],<ref>\"The philosophy of \"anarcho-capitalism\" dreamed up by the \"libertarian\" New Right, has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper.\" [[Albert Meltzer|Meltzer, Albert]].

The popularity of [[college football]] grew as it became the dominant version of the sport in the United States for the first half of the 20th century. [[Bowl game]]s, a college football tradition, attracted a national audience for college teams. Boosted by fierce [[List of NCAA college football rivalry games|rivalries]] and colorful traditions, college football still holds widespread appeal in the United States.\n\nThe origin of [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] can be traced back to 1892, with [[Pudge Heffelfinger]]'s $500 contract to play in a game for the [[Allegheny Athletic Association]] against the [[Pittsburgh Athletic Club (football)|Pittsburgh Athletic Club]]. In 1920 the American Professional Football Association was formed. This league changed its name to the [[National Football League]] (NFL) two years later, and eventually became the [[Major North American professional sports leagues|major league]] of American football. Primarily a sport of Midwestern industrial towns in the United States, professional football eventually became a national phenomenon.\n\nThe modern era of American football can be considered to have begun after the [[1932 NFL Playoff game]], which was the first indoor game [[World Series of Football (1902\u201303)|since 1902]] and the first American football game to feature [[hash marks]], forward passes anywhere behind the line of scrimmage, and the movement of the goal posts back to the goal line.  Other innovations to occur immediately after 1932 were the introduction of the [[AP Poll]] in 1934, the tapering of the ends of the football in 1934, the awarding of the first [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1935, the first [[1936 NFL draft|NFL draft in 1936]] and the [[1939 Waynesburg vs. Fordham football game|first televised game in 1939]].  Another important event was the American football game at the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], which combined with a similar demonstration game at [[1933 World's Fair]], led to the first [[College All-Star Game]] in 1934, which in turn was an important factor in the growth of [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] in the United States.<ref name=Schmidt>{{cite news|author=Ray Schmidt|title=THE OLYMPICS GAME|publisher=College Football Historical Society Newsletter|date=May 2004 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv17/CFHSNv17n3c.pdf}}</ref>  American football's explosion in popularity during the second half of the 20th century can be traced to the [[1958 NFL Championship Game]], a contest that has been dubbed the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\".

Early games appear to have had much in common with the traditional \"[[mob football]]\" played in England. The games remained largely unorganized until the 19th century, when [[intramural sports|intramural]] games of football began to be played. Organized varieties of football began to take form in 19th century in English public schools.  According to legend, William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football match in 1823, thus creating a new style of play in which running with the ball predominated instead of kicking. Football soon began to be played at colleges and universities in the United States.  Each school played its own variety of football. [[Princeton University]] students played a game called \"ballown\" as early as 1820. A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] tradition known as \"Bloody Monday\" began in 1827, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes, played at The Delta, the space where [[Memorial Hall (Harvard University)|Memorial Hall]] now stands. (A poem, \"The Battle of the Delta,\" was written about the first match: \"The Freshmen\u2019s wrath, to Sophs the direful spring / Of shins unnumbered bruised, great goddess sing!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUUf7ssp1u4C&lpg=PA206&ots=-pmX4prvB1&dq=%22the+freshmen's+wrath,+to+sophs%22&pg=PA206#v=onepage&q=%22the+freshmen's+wrath,+to+sophs%22&f=false|title=Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636\u20131936|first=Samuel Eliot|last=Morison|date=April 13, 1964|publisher=Harvard University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>)  In 1860, both the town police and the college authorities agreed that Bloody Monday had to go.  The Harvard students responded by going into mourning for a mock figure called \"Football Fightum\", for whom they conducted funeral rites. The authorities held firm and it was a dozen years before football was once again played at Harvard. [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] played its own version called \"[[Old division football]]\", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1830s. All of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They remained largely \"mob\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, and violence and injury were common.<ref name=PFRA1>{{cite web | title = No Christian End! | work = The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 | publisher = Professional Football Researchers Association | url = http://www.profootballresearchers.com/articles/No_Christian_End.pdf | accessdate = January 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name=ODF>{{cite web | last = Meacham | first = Scott | title = Old Division Football, The Indigenous Mob Soccer Of Dartmouth College (pdf) | publisher = dartmo.com | year = 2006 | url = http://www.dartmo.com/football/Football_Meacham.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = May 16, 2007}}</ref> The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them.

The first team to reach six goals was declared the winner. Rutgers won by a score of six to four. A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton's own set of rules (one notable difference was the awarding of a \"free kick\" to any player that caught the ball on the fly, which was a feature adopted from the Football Association's rules; the [[fair catch kick]] rule has survived through to modern American game). Princeton won that game by a score of 8\u20130.

Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The only way to score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded [[Rugby Football Union]], was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.<ref name=PFRA1/>\n\n[[File:McGill v harvard football game 1874.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the two [[Harvard Crimson football|Harvard]] vs. [[McGill Redmen football|McGill]] games played in 1874]]\nHarvard refused to attend the rules conference organized by the other schools and continued to play under its own code.<ref>Bernstein (2001), pp 9\u201310</ref> While Harvard's decision to maintain its code made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities,<ref>Fleisher, Goff and Tollison (1992), p 37</ref> it agreed to play [[McGill Redmen football|McGill University]], from [[Montreal]], in a two-game series in 1874.

The try would later evolve into the score known as the [[touchdown]]. On June 4, 1875, Harvard faced [[Tufts University]] in the first game between two American colleges played under rules similar to the McGill/Harvard contest, which was won by Tufts.<ref>Gardner (1996)</ref> The rules included each side fielding 11 men at any given time, the ball was advanced by kicking or carrying it, and tackles of the ball carrier stopped play.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gridiron gridlock: Citing research, Tufts claims football history is on its side |first=Kevin Paul |last=Dupont |date=September 23, 2004 |work=The Boston Globe |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/articles/2004/09/23/gridiron_gridlock/?page=full}}</ref> Further elated by the excitement of McGill's version of football, Harvard challenged its closest rival, Yale, to which the Bulldogs accepted. The two teams agreed to play under a set of rules called the \"Concessionary Rules\", which involved Harvard conceding something to Yale's soccer and Yale conceding a great deal to Harvard's rugby. They decided to play with 15 players on each team. On November 13, 1875, Yale and Harvard played each other for the first time ever, where Harvard won 4\u20130.  At the first [[The Game (Harvard-Yale)|The Game]]\u2014the annual contest between Harvard and Yale, among the 2000 spectators attending the game that day, was the future \"father of American football\" [[Walter Camp]].  Walter, who would enroll at Yale the next year, was torn between an admiration for Harvard's style of play and the misery of the Yale defeat and became determined to avenge Yale's defeat. Spectators from Princeton admired this type of game and it became the most popular version of football there.<ref name=PFRA1/>\n\n=== Walter Camp: Father of American football ===\n\n[[Walter Camp]] is widely considered to be the most important figure in the development of American football.<ref name=PFRA2/><ref name=histfoot/><ref name=NFL1869/> As a youth, he excelled in sports like [[Track and field athletics|track]], baseball, and association football, and after enrolling at [[Yale]] in 1876, he earned varsity honors in every sport the school offered.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nFollowing the introduction of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to him to be a disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the [[line of scrimmage]] and the [[Snap (football)|snap]] from [[center (American football)|center]] to [[quarterback]], was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nCamp's new scrimmage rules revolutionized the game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play to slow the game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each [[Down (American football)|down]]. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the establishment of the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nCamp was central to several more significant rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 53{{fraction|1|3}} yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for [[Extra point|kicks after touchdowns]], two points for safeties, and five for [[Field goal (football)|field goals]].  Camp's innovations in the area of point scoring influenced rugby union's move to point scoring in 1890.  In 1887, game time was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials\u2014a [[Referee (American football)|referee]] and an [[Official (American football)#Umpire|umpire]]\u2014were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nThe last, and arguably most important innovation, which would at last make American football uniquely \"American\", was the legalization of interference, or [[Blocking (American football)|blocking]], a tactic which was highly illegal under the rugby-style rules.  Interference remains strictly illegal in both rugby codes.  The prohibition of interference in the rugby game stems from the game's strict enforcement of its [[Offside (rugby)|offside rule]], which prohibited any player on the team with possession of the ball to loiter between the ball and the goal.  At first, American players would find creative ways of aiding the runner by pretending to accidentally knock into defenders trying to tackle the runner.  When Walter Camp witnessed this tactic being employed against his Yale team, he was at first appalled, but the next year had adopted the blocking tactics for his own team.  During the 1880s and 1890s, teams developed increasingly complex blocking tactics including the interlocking interference technique known as the [[Flying wedge]] or \"V-trick formation\", which was developed by [[Lorin F. Deland]] and first introduced by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in a [[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|collegiate game]] against [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1892.  Despite its effectiveness, it was outlawed two seasons later in 1894 through the efforts of the rule committee led by [[Parke H. Davis]], because of its contribution to serious injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballencyclopedia.com/cfeintro.htm|title=Introduction: A Brief History of College Football|publisher=College Football Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828190115/http://footballencyclopedia.com/cfeintro.htm|archivedate=August 28, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter his playing career at Yale ended in 1882, Camp was employed by the New Haven Clock Company until his death in 1925.

Four new [[bowl game]]s were created: the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], [[Sugar Bowl]], the [[Sun Bowl]] in 1935, and the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the [[Associated Press]] began its [[AP Poll|weekly poll]] of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the [[Mythical National Championship|National Champion]] of college football.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 30</ref>\n\nThe 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General [[Robert Neyland]] at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use and was the last college team to produce an undefeated, untied and unscored upon season in 1939.  Several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams' ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties\u2014a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone\u2014and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw.

In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma|ruled against the NCAA]] and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. [[ABC Sports]] began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.<ref>Vancil (2000) pp 46\u201348</ref>\n\nNew formations and play sets continued to be developed. [[Emory Bellard]], an assistant coach under [[Darrell Royal]] at the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]], developed a three-back [[option offense|option]] style offense known as the [[wishbone formation|wishbone]]. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense that depends on the quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including [[Bear Bryant]] at Alabama, [[Chuck Fairbanks]] at Oklahoma and [[Pepper Rodgers]] at [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]]; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 56</ref>  The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the [[spread offense]], developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to \"spread\" the field both horizontally and vertically.<ref name=formations>Bennett (1976), Appendix pp 209\u2013217</ref>  Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently.

By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight major college bowl games. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At the birth of cable television and cable sports networks like [[ESPN]], there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the thirty years from 1950 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2010, an additional 20 bowl games were added to the schedule.<ref name=bowls1/><ref name=hickok1>{{cite web|title=College Bowl Games |work=Hickok Sports |year=2006 |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/collbowl.shtml |accessdate=June 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223060707/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/collbowl.shtml |archivedate=February 23, 2002}}</ref>  Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game.

As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a [[Automatic bids to non-BCS bowls|tie-in]]), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the [[Bowl Coalition]], which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences\u2014the Pac-10 and Big Ten\u2014meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the [[Bowl Alliance]], which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three\u2014the [[Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta]], Sugar, and Orange Bowls\u2014and the participating conferences to five\u2014the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]], [[Southwest Conference|Southwest]], [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]], and [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]]. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]], or the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]], and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.<ref name=hickok1/><ref name=BCS>{{cite web | title = BCS Chronology | publisher=FOX Sports on MSN | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | accessdate =June 1, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070915010233/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history |archivedate = September 15, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Bowl Championship Series ====\n{{Main article|Bowl Championship Series}}\n{{See also|NCAA Division I Football Championship}}\n\nIn 1998, a new system was put into place called the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and all four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two \"at-large\" selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the No.1 and No.2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.<ref name=BCS/>\n\nThe system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] conferences, though only one selection\u2014[[2004 Utah Utes football team|Utah]] in 2005\u2014came from a BCS non-AQ conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game\u2014simply called the [[BCS National Championship Game]]\u2014was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences ([[Conference USA]], the [[Mid-American Conference]], the [[Mountain West Conference]], the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and the [[Western Athletic Conference]]), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings, or was within the top 16 of the BCS rankings and ranked higher than the champion of at least one of the [[Automatic Qualifying conference|\"BCS conferences\"]] (also known as \"AQ\" conferences, for Automatic Qualifying).<ref name=BCS/> Several times after this rule change was implemented, schools from non-AQ conferences played in BCS bowl games, most notably [[2006 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] in the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl]], in which they upset [[2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in overtime.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Mandel|first=Stewart|title=Behind the BCS: How Boise State\u2013TCU matchup was made possible|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=January 1, 2010|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2010/01/01/fiesta|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref> In 2009, [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] played [[2009 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] in the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]], the first time two schools from BCS non-AQ conferences played each other in a BCS bowl game.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilner|first=Jon|title=Bowl winners and losers: The BCS system is the biggest winner|work=The Mercury News|date=December 6, 2009|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports/2009/12/06/the-biggest-bowl-championship-series-winner-the-bowl-championship-series-naturally/|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref> The last team from the non-AQ ranks to reach a BCS bowl game was [[2012 Northern Illinois Huskies football team|Northern Illinois in 2012]], which played in (and lost) the [[2013 Orange Bowl]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Myerberg|first=Paul|title=Why those who busted the BCS will look back fondly on it|work=USA Today|date=December 4, 2013|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/12/04/bcs-bowl-championship-series-northern-illinois-mac-utah-tcu-mountain-west-boise-state-hawaii-wac/3871441/|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Dufresne|first=Chris|title=These teams could be the last true Bowl Championship Series busters|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 2, 2013|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/02/sports/la-sp-0803-college-football-bcs-20130803|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dodd|first=Dennis|title=Sun Belt finishes first (in non-AQ revenue) in last year of BCS|publisher=CBS Sports|date=January 24, 2014|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/sun-belt-finishes-first-in-non-aq-revenue-in-last-year-of-bcs/|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====College Football Playoff====\n{{Main article|College Football Playoff}}\nDue to the intensification of the [[college football playoff debate]] after nearly a decade of the sometimes disputable results of the BCS, the conference commissioners and Notre Dame's president voted to implement a [[Plus-One system]] which was to be called the 'College Football Playoff'.

The playoff proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the [[1933 NFL season|1933 season]], with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game. A number of new rule changes were also instituted: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, every play started from between the [[hash marks]], and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the [[line of scrimmage]] (instead of the previous five yards behind).<ref>{{cite web|title=History 1931\u20131940 |work=NFL.com |publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC |year=2007 |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timelline.aspx?csid1=46 |accessdate=October 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183348/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timelline.aspx?csid1=46 |archivedate=September 27, 2007}}</ref><ref name=hick32>{{cite web|last=Hickok |first=Ralph |title=The 1932 NFL Championship Game |publisher=HickokSports.com |year=2004 |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/histbit1.shtml |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021030202355/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/histbit1.shtml |archivedate=October 30, 2002}}</ref><ref>Bennett (1976), pp 32\u201333</ref>  In 1936, the NFL instituted the first [[NFL Draft|draft]] of college players.

In 1933, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles were founded.  1936 was the first year where there were no franchise moves,<ref>McDonough(1994), pp 54</ref> prior to that year 51 teams had gone defunct.<ref name=hicknfl/>  In 1941, the NFL named its first Commissioner, [[Elmer Layden]].

Among the short-lived merged teams were the [[Steagles]] (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia) in 1943, the [[Card-Pitt]]s (Chicago Cardinals and Pittsburgh) in 1944, and a team formed from the merger of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[Boston Yanks]] in 1945.<ref name=hicknfl/><ref name=NFL1941/>\n\n1946 was an important year in the history of professional football, as that was the year when the league [[desegregation|reintegrated]].  The [[Los Angeles Rams]] signed two African American players, [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]] and [[Woody Strode]]. Also that year, a competing league, the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), began operation.<ref name=NFL1941/>\n\nDuring the 1950s, additional teams entered the league. In 1950, the AAFC folded, and three teams from that league were absorbed into the NFL: the [[Cleveland Browns]] (who had won the AAFC Championship every year of the league's existence), the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and the Baltimore Colts (not the same as the modern franchise, this version folded after one year). The remaining players were chosen by the now 13 NFL teams in a [[dispersal draft]].

That same year, [[Dallas]] businessman [[Lamar Hunt]] led the formation of the rival [[American Football League]], the fourth such league to bear that name, with war hero and former South Dakota Governor [[Joe Foss]] as its Commissioner. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. With the exception of Los Angeles and New York, the AFL avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed with established NFL franchises. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams and a double round-robin schedule of fourteen games. New NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] took office the same year.<ref name=NFL1951/>\n\nThe AFL became a viable alternative to the NFL as it made a concerted effort to attract established talent away from the NFL, signing half of the NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960. The AFL worked hard to secure top college players, many from sources virtually untapped by the established league: small colleges and predominantly black colleges. Two of the eight coaches of the [[Foolish Club|Original Eight]] AFL franchises, [[Hank Stram]] ([[Kansas City Chiefs|Texans/Chiefs]]) and [[Sid Gillman]] ([[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]]) eventually were inducted to the Hall of Fame. Led by [[Oakland Raiders]] owner and AFL commissioner [[Al Davis]], the AFL established a \"war chest\" to entice top talent with higher pay than they got from the NFL. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback [[Babe Parilli]] became a star for the [[Boston Patriots]] during the early years of the AFL, and University of Alabama passer [[Joe Namath]] rejected the NFL to play for the [[New York Jets]]. Namath became the face of the league as it reached its height of popularity in the mid-1960s. Davis's methods worked, and in 1966, the junior league forced a partial merger with the NFL. The two leagues agreed to have a common [[NFL Draft|draft]] and play in a common season-ending championship game, known as the AFL-NFL World Championship. Two years later, the game's name was changed to the [[Super Bowl]].<ref name=NFL1961>{{cite web | title = NFL History 1961\u20131970 | work=NFL.com | publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC | year = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970 | accessdate =June 26, 2007}}</ref><ref name=AFL>{{cite web | title = Remember the AFL | publisher=American Football League Hall of Fame | year = 2003 | url =http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFL.htm | accessdate =June 26, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = History of the Super Bowl | publisher=SuperNFL.com | url = http://www.supernfl.com/SuperBowl/SuperBowlHistory.html | accessdate =June 26, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608100947/http://www.supernfl.com/SuperBowl/SuperBowlHistory.html| archivedate = June 8, 2007}}</ref>\nAFL teams won the next two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged]] to form a new 26-team league.

Among these important changes were the introduction of the [[line of scrimmage]], of [[Down (American football)|down-and-distance]] rules and of the legalization of [[Blocking (American football)|blocking]].<ref name=PFRA2/><ref name=histfoot/><ref name=NFL1869>{{cite web | title = NFL History3039\u20131910 | work=NFL.com | publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC | year = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910 | accessdate =May 15, 2007}}</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, gameplay developments by college coaches such as [[Eddie Cochems]], [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]], [[Parke H. Davis]],  [[Knute Rockne]], and [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Glenn \"Pop\" Warner]] helped take advantage of the newly introduced [[forward pass]]. The popularity of [[college football]] grew as it became the dominant version of the sport in the United States for the first half of the 20th century. [[Bowl game]]s, a college football tradition, attracted a national audience for college teams. Boosted by fierce [[List of NCAA college football rivalry games|rivalries]] and colorful traditions, college football still holds widespread appeal in the United States.\n\nThe origin of [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] can be traced back to 1892, with [[Pudge Heffelfinger]]'s $500 contract to play in a game for the [[Allegheny Athletic Association]] against the [[Pittsburgh Athletic Club (football)|Pittsburgh Athletic Club]]. In 1920 the American Professional Football Association was formed. This league changed its name to the [[National Football League]] (NFL) two years later, and eventually became the [[Major North American professional sports leagues|major league]] of American football. Primarily a sport of Midwestern industrial towns in the United States, professional football eventually became a national phenomenon.\n\nThe modern era of American football can be considered to have begun after the [[1932 NFL Playoff game]], which was the first indoor game [[World Series of Football (1902\u201303)|since 1902]] and the first American football game to feature [[hash marks]], forward passes anywhere behind the line of scrimmage, and the movement of the goal posts back to the goal line.  Other innovations to occur immediately after 1932 were the introduction of the [[AP Poll]] in 1934, the tapering of the ends of the football in 1934, the awarding of the first [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1935, the first [[1936 NFL draft|NFL draft in 1936]] and the [[1939 Waynesburg vs. Fordham football game|first televised game in 1939]].  Another important event was the American football game at the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], which combined with a similar demonstration game at [[1933 World's Fair]], led to the first [[College All-Star Game]] in 1934, which in turn was an important factor in the growth of [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] in the United States.<ref name=Schmidt>{{cite news|author=Ray Schmidt|title=THE OLYMPICS GAME|publisher=College Football Historical Society Newsletter|date=May 2004 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/CFHSN/CFHSNv17/CFHSNv17n3c.pdf}}</ref>  American football's explosion in popularity during the second half of the 20th century can be traced to the [[1958 NFL Championship Game]], a contest that has been dubbed the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\".

By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/Britain-home-of-football.html |title=History of Football \u2013 Britain, the home of Football |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=July 29, 2013}}</ref> These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the [[Highway Act 1835]] was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1835/50/pdfs/ukpga_18350050_en.pdf |title=An Act to consolidate and amend the Laws relating to Highways in that Part of Great Britain called England |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=August 31, 1835 |accessdate=October 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Football in America===\n[[File:Portrait of College Football Team, The \"Pirates,\" in Partial Uniform, and with Man in Business Suit 1879.jpg|thumb|250px|A Native American college football team]]\nAlthough there are some mentions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] playing football-like games, modern American football has its origins in the traditional football games played in the cities, villages and schools of Europe for many centuries before America was settled by Europeans.  Early games appear to have had much in common with the traditional \"[[mob football]]\" played in England. The games remained largely unorganized until the 19th century, when [[intramural sports|intramural]] games of football began to be played. Organized varieties of football began to take form in 19th century in English public schools.  According to legend, William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football match in 1823, thus creating a new style of play in which running with the ball predominated instead of kicking. Football soon began to be played at colleges and universities in the United States.  Each school played its own variety of football. [[Princeton University]] students played a game called \"ballown\" as early as 1820. A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] tradition known as \"Bloody Monday\" began in 1827, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes, played at The Delta, the space where [[Memorial Hall (Harvard University)|Memorial Hall]] now stands. (A poem, \"The Battle of the Delta,\" was written about the first match: \"The Freshmen\u2019s wrath, to Sophs the direful spring / Of shins unnumbered bruised, great goddess sing!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUUf7ssp1u4C&lpg=PA206&ots=-pmX4prvB1&dq=%22the+freshmen's+wrath,+to+sophs%22&pg=PA206#v=onepage&q=%22the+freshmen's+wrath,+to+sophs%22&f=false|title=Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636\u20131936|first=Samuel Eliot|last=Morison|date=April 13, 1964|publisher=Harvard University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>)  In 1860, both the town police and the college authorities agreed that Bloody Monday had to go.  The Harvard students responded by going into mourning for a mock figure called \"Football Fightum\", for whom they conducted funeral rites. The authorities held firm and it was a dozen years before football was once again played at Harvard. [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] played its own version called \"[[Old division football]]\", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1830s. All of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They remained largely \"mob\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, and violence and injury were common.<ref name=PFRA1>{{cite web | title = No Christian End! | work = The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 | publisher = Professional Football Researchers Association | url = http://www.profootballresearchers.com/articles/No_Christian_End.pdf | accessdate = January 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name=ODF>{{cite web | last = Meacham | first = Scott | title = Old Division Football, The Indigenous Mob Soccer Of Dartmouth College (pdf) | publisher = dartmo.com | year = 2006 | url = http://www.dartmo.com/football/Football_Meacham.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = May 16, 2007}}</ref> The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them.

The first team to reach six goals was declared the winner. Rutgers won by a score of six to four. A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton's own set of rules (one notable difference was the awarding of a \"free kick\" to any player that caught the ball on the fly, which was a feature adopted from the Football Association's rules; the [[fair catch kick]] rule has survived through to modern American game). Princeton won that game by a score of 8\u20130.

Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The only way to score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded [[Rugby Football Union]], was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.<ref name=PFRA1/>\n\n[[File:McGill v harvard football game 1874.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the two [[Harvard Crimson football|Harvard]] vs. [[McGill Redmen football|McGill]] games played in 1874]]\nHarvard refused to attend the rules conference organized by the other schools and continued to play under its own code.<ref>Bernstein (2001), pp 9\u201310</ref> While Harvard's decision to maintain its code made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities,<ref>Fleisher, Goff and Tollison (1992), p 37</ref> it agreed to play [[McGill Redmen football|McGill University]], from [[Montreal]], in a two-game series in 1874.

The try would later evolve into the score known as the [[touchdown]]. On June 4, 1875, Harvard faced [[Tufts University]] in the first game between two American colleges played under rules similar to the McGill/Harvard contest, which was won by Tufts.<ref>Gardner (1996)</ref> The rules included each side fielding 11 men at any given time, the ball was advanced by kicking or carrying it, and tackles of the ball carrier stopped play.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gridiron gridlock: Citing research, Tufts claims football history is on its side |first=Kevin Paul |last=Dupont |date=September 23, 2004 |work=The Boston Globe |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/articles/2004/09/23/gridiron_gridlock/?page=full}}</ref> Further elated by the excitement of McGill's version of football, Harvard challenged its closest rival, Yale, to which the Bulldogs accepted. The two teams agreed to play under a set of rules called the \"Concessionary Rules\", which involved Harvard conceding something to Yale's soccer and Yale conceding a great deal to Harvard's rugby. They decided to play with 15 players on each team. On November 13, 1875, Yale and Harvard played each other for the first time ever, where Harvard won 4\u20130.  At the first [[The Game (Harvard-Yale)|The Game]]\u2014the annual contest between Harvard and Yale, among the 2000 spectators attending the game that day, was the future \"father of American football\" [[Walter Camp]].  Walter, who would enroll at Yale the next year, was torn between an admiration for Harvard's style of play and the misery of the Yale defeat and became determined to avenge Yale's defeat. Spectators from Princeton admired this type of game and it became the most popular version of football there.<ref name=PFRA1/>\n\n=== Walter Camp: Father of American football ===\n\n[[Walter Camp]] is widely considered to be the most important figure in the development of American football.<ref name=PFRA2/><ref name=histfoot/><ref name=NFL1869/> As a youth, he excelled in sports like [[Track and field athletics|track]], baseball, and association football, and after enrolling at [[Yale]] in 1876, he earned varsity honors in every sport the school offered.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nFollowing the introduction of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to him to be a disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the [[line of scrimmage]] and the [[Snap (football)|snap]] from [[center (American football)|center]] to [[quarterback]], was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nCamp's new scrimmage rules revolutionized the game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play to slow the game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each [[Down (American football)|down]]. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the establishment of the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nCamp was central to several more significant rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 53{{fraction|1|3}} yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for [[Extra point|kicks after touchdowns]], two points for safeties, and five for [[Field goal (football)|field goals]].  Camp's innovations in the area of point scoring influenced rugby union's move to point scoring in 1890.  In 1887, game time was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials\u2014a [[Referee (American football)|referee]] and an [[Official (American football)#Umpire|umpire]]\u2014were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nThe last, and arguably most important innovation, which would at last make American football uniquely \"American\", was the legalization of interference, or [[Blocking (American football)|blocking]], a tactic which was highly illegal under the rugby-style rules.  Interference remains strictly illegal in both rugby codes.  The prohibition of interference in the rugby game stems from the game's strict enforcement of its [[Offside (rugby)|offside rule]], which prohibited any player on the team with possession of the ball to loiter between the ball and the goal.  At first, American players would find creative ways of aiding the runner by pretending to accidentally knock into defenders trying to tackle the runner.  When Walter Camp witnessed this tactic being employed against his Yale team, he was at first appalled, but the next year had adopted the blocking tactics for his own team.  During the 1880s and 1890s, teams developed increasingly complex blocking tactics including the interlocking interference technique known as the [[Flying wedge]] or \"V-trick formation\", which was developed by [[Lorin F. Deland]] and first introduced by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in a [[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|collegiate game]] against [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1892.  Despite its effectiveness, it was outlawed two seasons later in 1894 through the efforts of the rule committee led by [[Parke H. Davis]], because of its contribution to serious injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballencyclopedia.com/cfeintro.htm|title=Introduction: A Brief History of College Football|publisher=College Football Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 14, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828190115/http://footballencyclopedia.com/cfeintro.htm|archivedate=August 28, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter his playing career at Yale ended in 1882, Camp was employed by the New Haven Clock Company until his death in 1925.

Four new [[bowl game]]s were created: the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], [[Sugar Bowl]], the [[Sun Bowl]] in 1935, and the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the [[Associated Press]] began its [[AP Poll|weekly poll]] of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the [[Mythical National Championship|National Champion]] of college football.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 30</ref>\n\nThe 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General [[Robert Neyland]] at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use and was the last college team to produce an undefeated, untied and unscored upon season in 1939.  Several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams' ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties\u2014a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone\u2014and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw.

In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma|ruled against the NCAA]] and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. [[ABC Sports]] began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.<ref>Vancil (2000) pp 46\u201348</ref>\n\nNew formations and play sets continued to be developed. [[Emory Bellard]], an assistant coach under [[Darrell Royal]] at the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]], developed a three-back [[option offense|option]] style offense known as the [[wishbone formation|wishbone]]. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense that depends on the quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including [[Bear Bryant]] at Alabama, [[Chuck Fairbanks]] at Oklahoma and [[Pepper Rodgers]] at [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]]; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 56</ref>  The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the [[spread offense]], developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to \"spread\" the field both horizontally and vertically.<ref name=formations>Bennett (1976), Appendix pp 209\u2013217</ref>  Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently.

By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight major college bowl games. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At the birth of cable television and cable sports networks like [[ESPN]], there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the thirty years from 1950 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2010, an additional 20 bowl games were added to the schedule.<ref name=bowls1/><ref name=hickok1>{{cite web|title=College Bowl Games |work=Hickok Sports |year=2006 |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/collbowl.shtml |accessdate=June 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223060707/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/collbowl.shtml |archivedate=February 23, 2002}}</ref>  Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game.

As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a [[Automatic bids to non-BCS bowls|tie-in]]), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the [[Bowl Coalition]], which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences\u2014the Pac-10 and Big Ten\u2014meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the [[Bowl Alliance]], which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three\u2014the [[Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta]], Sugar, and Orange Bowls\u2014and the participating conferences to five\u2014the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]], [[Southwest Conference|Southwest]], [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]], and [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]]. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]], or the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]], and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.<ref name=hickok1/><ref name=BCS>{{cite web | title = BCS Chronology | publisher=FOX Sports on MSN | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | accessdate =June 1, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070915010233/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history |archivedate = September 15, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Bowl Championship Series ====\n{{Main article|Bowl Championship Series}}\n{{See also|NCAA Division I Football Championship}}\n\nIn 1998, a new system was put into place called the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and all four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two \"at-large\" selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the No.1 and No.2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.<ref name=BCS/>\n\nThe system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] conferences, though only one selection\u2014[[2004 Utah Utes football team|Utah]] in 2005\u2014came from a BCS non-AQ conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game\u2014simply called the [[BCS National Championship Game]]\u2014was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences ([[Conference USA]], the [[Mid-American Conference]], the [[Mountain West Conference]], the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and the [[Western Athletic Conference]]), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings, or was within the top 16 of the BCS rankings and ranked higher than the champion of at least one of the [[Automatic Qualifying conference|\"BCS conferences\"]] (also known as \"AQ\" conferences, for Automatic Qualifying).<ref name=BCS/> Several times after this rule change was implemented, schools from non-AQ conferences played in BCS bowl games, most notably [[2006 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] in the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl]], in which they upset [[2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in overtime.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Mandel|first=Stewart|title=Behind the BCS: How Boise State\u2013TCU matchup was made possible|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=January 1, 2010|url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2010/01/01/fiesta|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref> In 2009, [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] played [[2009 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] in the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]], the first time two schools from BCS non-AQ conferences played each other in a BCS bowl game.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilner|first=Jon|title=Bowl winners and losers: The BCS system is the biggest winner|work=The Mercury News|date=December 6, 2009|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports/2009/12/06/the-biggest-bowl-championship-series-winner-the-bowl-championship-series-naturally/|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref> The last team from the non-AQ ranks to reach a BCS bowl game was [[2012 Northern Illinois Huskies football team|Northern Illinois in 2012]], which played in (and lost) the [[2013 Orange Bowl]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Myerberg|first=Paul|title=Why those who busted the BCS will look back fondly on it|work=USA Today|date=December 4, 2013|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/12/04/bcs-bowl-championship-series-northern-illinois-mac-utah-tcu-mountain-west-boise-state-hawaii-wac/3871441/|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Dufresne|first=Chris|title=These teams could be the last true Bowl Championship Series busters|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 2, 2013|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/02/sports/la-sp-0803-college-football-bcs-20130803|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dodd|first=Dennis|title=Sun Belt finishes first (in non-AQ revenue) in last year of BCS|publisher=CBS Sports|date=January 24, 2014|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/sun-belt-finishes-first-in-non-aq-revenue-in-last-year-of-bcs/|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====College Football Playoff====\n{{Main article|College Football Playoff}}\nDue to the intensification of the [[college football playoff debate]] after nearly a decade of the sometimes disputable results of the BCS, the conference commissioners and Notre Dame's president voted to implement a [[Plus-One system]] which was to be called the 'College Football Playoff'.

The playoff proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the [[1933 NFL season|1933 season]], with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game. A number of new rule changes were also instituted: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, every play started from between the [[hash marks]], and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the [[line of scrimmage]] (instead of the previous five yards behind).<ref>{{cite web|title=History 1931\u20131940 |work=NFL.com |publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC |year=2007 |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timelline.aspx?csid1=46 |accessdate=October 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183348/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timelline.aspx?csid1=46 |archivedate=September 27, 2007}}</ref><ref name=hick32>{{cite web|last=Hickok |first=Ralph |title=The 1932 NFL Championship Game |publisher=HickokSports.com |year=2004 |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/histbit1.shtml |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021030202355/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/histbit1.shtml |archivedate=October 30, 2002}}</ref><ref>Bennett (1976), pp 32\u201333</ref>  In 1936, the NFL instituted the first [[NFL Draft|draft]] of college players.

In 1933, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles were founded.  1936 was the first year where there were no franchise moves,<ref>McDonough(1994), pp 54</ref> prior to that year 51 teams had gone defunct.<ref name=hicknfl/>  In 1941, the NFL named its first Commissioner, [[Elmer Layden]].

Among the short-lived merged teams were the [[Steagles]] (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia) in 1943, the [[Card-Pitt]]s (Chicago Cardinals and Pittsburgh) in 1944, and a team formed from the merger of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[Boston Yanks]] in 1945.<ref name=hicknfl/><ref name=NFL1941/>\n\n1946 was an important year in the history of professional football, as that was the year when the league [[desegregation|reintegrated]].  The [[Los Angeles Rams]] signed two African American players, [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]] and [[Woody Strode]]. Also that year, a competing league, the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), began operation.<ref name=NFL1941/>\n\nDuring the 1950s, additional teams entered the league. In 1950, the AAFC folded, and three teams from that league were absorbed into the NFL: the [[Cleveland Browns]] (who had won the AAFC Championship every year of the league's existence), the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and the Baltimore Colts (not the same as the modern franchise, this version folded after one year). The remaining players were chosen by the now 13 NFL teams in a [[dispersal draft]].

That same year, [[Dallas]] businessman [[Lamar Hunt]] led the formation of the rival [[American Football League]], the fourth such league to bear that name, with war hero and former South Dakota Governor [[Joe Foss]] as its Commissioner. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. With the exception of Los Angeles and New York, the AFL avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed with established NFL franchises. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams and a double round-robin schedule of fourteen games. New NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] took office the same year.<ref name=NFL1951/>\n\nThe AFL became a viable alternative to the NFL as it made a concerted effort to attract established talent away from the NFL, signing half of the NFL's first-round draft choices in 1960. The AFL worked hard to secure top college players, many from sources virtually untapped by the established league: small colleges and predominantly black colleges. Two of the eight coaches of the [[Foolish Club|Original Eight]] AFL franchises, [[Hank Stram]] ([[Kansas City Chiefs|Texans/Chiefs]]) and [[Sid Gillman]] ([[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]]) eventually were inducted to the Hall of Fame. Led by [[Oakland Raiders]] owner and AFL commissioner [[Al Davis]], the AFL established a \"war chest\" to entice top talent with higher pay than they got from the NFL. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback [[Babe Parilli]] became a star for the [[Boston Patriots]] during the early years of the AFL, and University of Alabama passer [[Joe Namath]] rejected the NFL to play for the [[New York Jets]]. Namath became the face of the league as it reached its height of popularity in the mid-1960s. Davis's methods worked, and in 1966, the junior league forced a partial merger with the NFL. The two leagues agreed to have a common [[NFL Draft|draft]] and play in a common season-ending championship game, known as the AFL-NFL World Championship. Two years later, the game's name was changed to the [[Super Bowl]].<ref name=NFL1961>{{cite web | title = NFL History 1961\u20131970 | work=NFL.com | publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC | year = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970 | accessdate =June 26, 2007}}</ref><ref name=AFL>{{cite web | title = Remember the AFL | publisher=American Football League Hall of Fame | year = 2003 | url =http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFL.htm | accessdate =June 26, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = History of the Super Bowl | publisher=SuperNFL.com | url = http://www.supernfl.com/SuperBowl/SuperBowlHistory.html | accessdate =June 26, 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608100947/http://www.supernfl.com/SuperBowl/SuperBowlHistory.html| archivedate = June 8, 2007}}</ref>\nAFL teams won the next two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged]] to form a new 26-team league.

One of the earliest youth football organizations was founded in Philadelphia, in 1929, as the Junior Football Conference. Organizer Joe Tomlin started the league to provide activities and guidance for teenage boys who were vandalizing the factory he owned. The original four-team league expanded to sixteen teams in 1933 when Pop Warner, who had just been hired as the new coach of the Temple University football team, agreed to give a lecture to the boys in the league.

A member of the party [[Left (Denmark)|Venstre]], she had previously been minister of agriculture and foods since 2002, in the government of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]].\n\nIn 2008, she was given the European Taxpayers' Award from the Taxpayers' Association of Europe for her decision to abolish export refunds for exports of live cattle from the EU, and for her ongoing efforts to improve the transparency of agricultural payments.\n\nIn 2008, she was presented with the Danish European Movement's price for \"European of the Year\".\n\nIn 2008, she was awarded the Wine Personality of the Year 2008 award by the International Wine Challenge, which said, about her efforts to drag the European wine industry into the 21st century, that \"family vineyards might have been pulled up and the family winemaking tradition lost had it not been for the intrepid heroine from the north\".\n\n==General approach to the CAP==\n\nAs Commissioner, FIscher Boel has based her work on three guiding principles:\n*The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) needed to take European farming towards still greater competitiveness and market-responsiveness by placing production decisions more firmly in the hands of farmers rather than administrators.\n*The CAP needed to address the needs of rural areas as a whole, not only those of agriculture.\n*In particular, the CAP needed to reflect growing concern about environmental issues, including [[climate change]].\n\nShe has continued the CAP reform process, notably within the three sectors that were exempted from the reform of 2003: sugar, fruit and vegetables, and wine. The sectors had initially been left alone partly because reforming them presented huge political difficulties.\n\nBoel also took steps to bolster the [[EU Rural Development Policy]], preparing it to deliver more coherent and balanced results against clear objectives in the new\nfinancial period of 2007 to 2013.\n\nLater in her mandate, she carried out a review of the CAP, which became known as the \u201cCAP Health Check\u201d and made further policy adjustments to ensure that the reformed CAP was working as intended and was addressing the challenges of the 21st century.\n\n==Sugar reform==\n\nWhen Boel took office in 2004, the EU had regulated its sugar sector in more or less\nthe same way for some 40 years, supporting a domestic sugar price far above world market prices to keep production in place in each country.\n\nAlthough the EU did not have a comparative advantage in sugar production, its policy was creating large surpluses that were exported with subsidies, which was not welcomed by many of its trade partners.\n\nWith Boel's reform, agreed in 2005, the benchmark EU sugar price was cut by 36 per cent over several years, which helped to bring the EU sugar industry back into a sustainable and more natural balance with the rest of the world market, as a net importer rather than exporter.\n\nBringing sugar beet farmers into the Single Payment Scheme gave them support which was in line with the need for competitiveness and which also depended on environmental standards (through crosscompliance). The reforms are also funding restructuring programmes in areas that sugar factories shut down, helping workers laid off to find new jobs and putting disused factory sites back into good environmental condition.\n\n==Fruit and vegetable reform==\n\nIn 2006, she proposed reforms to the fruit and vegetable sector, which was agreed in principle in June 2007. It gives extra incentives to producers to band together into \"producer organisations\", which can negotiate with retailers on a more equal footing.\nProducer organisations are now also in charge of managing market crises through disposal schemes and other methods, and they must spend a minimum share of their budget on care for the environment.\n\nAn aspect of the reform, very much inspired by emerging public needs, was the mandate to draw up a school fruit scheme to which the EU agreed in November 2008. It was launched in the 2009/2010 school year and operates in 22 EU countries. It provides funding to\ndistribute fruit and vegetables in schools as well as to support programmes to educate children, parents and teachers about healthy diets.\n\n==Wine reform==\nAs European Union agriculture commissioner, Boel has been a vocal advocate for various [[vine pull schemes]] in an attempt to compensate for the 1.7&nbsp;billion bottle [[wine surplus]] that Europe has had for the last several [[vintage]]s. Every year, the European Union spends 500&nbsp;million euros to [[distill]] the excess wine into [[industrial alcohol]].\n\nUnder the 2007 reform, subsidies for distilling unwanted wines are being phased out, and the money is being spent instead on a broad menu of measures to make the wine sector more competitive and to care for vine landscapes. In an important step to prepare for liberalisation, a three-year voluntary \"grubbing-up scheme\", with strong environmental safeguards, is offering money to uncompetitive producers who wish to dig up their vines and leave the sector.\n\nCritics have claimed that the implementation of Boel's plan will see a 5% drop in wine industry jobs and 7% decrease in wine prices by 2009, but most agree that the price of wine will eventually rise again. Supporters of Boel's plan have noted that European wine consumption has decreased an average of 0.65% a year and that in a few years, imports of [[New World wine]] into Europe will exceed European exports, which will also have negative effects on wine industry jobs and wine prices.<ref>M.

The package of adjustments was agreed to in November 2008, with the aim of keeping the CAP to the spirit of the 2003 reforms in the changing circumstances.\n\nUnder the health check, the EU's rural development policy was given a boost in order to help farms and other rural businesses respond to pressing challenges, such as fighting and adjusting to climate change, managing water more carefully, providing and using renewable energy, conserving biodiversity and pursuing innovation in all of these areas.\n\nIn order to finance the new projects, a key element of the Health Check agreement is that by 2012, EU farmers will be contributing an extra 5% of their income support payments to rural development policy (through modulation) for use in projects to help address the concerns listed above. A further 4% is being transferred annually from all income support payment amounts above a threshold of \u20ac300,000. That finally establishes a principle long supported by the public: farmers who receive high levels of income\nsupport from the EU budget should make larger \"contributions\" to projects of general public interest.\n\nTo make farming even more market-orientated, the Health Check is decoupling a greater share of farmers' income support payments.\n\nThe Health Check is also removing constraints on farmers\u2019 freedom to produce more in response to market demand. The requirement to set aside a portion of their arable land is abolished, and milk production quotas are being enlarged to prepare for their removal in 2015.\n\n==Increasing transparency, accountability and cutting red tape==\n\nDuring her five years in office, she introduced new rules, which have improved drastically transparency on CAP payments. Since April 2009, all member states have been required to maintain websites listing beneficiaries of CAP funding. For each beneficiary, the websites state the full name, the municipality and the value of funding received. The EU\u2019s EUROPA website contains links to these national websites.\n\nShe also succeeded in becoming the first agricultural commissioner to get the green light for the CAP spendings from the Court of Auditors, which means that 98% of all spendings were free of errors. She has also overseen a large amount of simplification projects, which have cut administrative burden and red tape in CAP. Most famously, she abolished marketing standards for 26 types of fruit and vegetable, which has led to the reintroduction of the curvy cucumber on supermarket shelves.\n\n==Helping the world to feed itself==\n\nIn 2008, she proposed to make available a so-called \"food facility\" worth \u20ac1&nbsp;billion over three years, which has given a much-needed boost to agricultural production in poorer countries, such as by helping farmers to access fertiliser and seed.

A member of the party [[Left (Denmark)|Venstre]], she had previously been minister of agriculture and foods since 2002, in the government of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]].\n\nIn 2008, she was given the European Taxpayers' Award from the Taxpayers' Association of Europe for her decision to abolish export refunds for exports of live cattle from the EU, and for her ongoing efforts to improve the transparency of agricultural payments.\n\nIn 2008, she was presented with the Danish European Movement's price for \"European of the Year\".\n\nIn 2008, she was awarded the Wine Personality of the Year 2008 award by the International Wine Challenge, which said, about her efforts to drag the European wine industry into the 21st century, that \"family vineyards might have been pulled up and the family winemaking tradition lost had it not been for the intrepid heroine from the north\".\n\n==General approach to the CAP==\n\nAs Commissioner, FIscher Boel has based her work on three guiding principles:\n*The [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) needed to take European farming towards still greater competitiveness and market-responsiveness by placing production decisions more firmly in the hands of farmers rather than administrators.\n*The CAP needed to address the needs of rural areas as a whole, not only those of agriculture.\n*In particular, the CAP needed to reflect growing concern about environmental issues, including [[climate change]].\n\nShe has continued the CAP reform process, notably within the three sectors that were exempted from the reform of 2003: sugar, fruit and vegetables, and wine. The sectors had initially been left alone partly because reforming them presented huge political difficulties.\n\nBoel also took steps to bolster the [[EU Rural Development Policy]], preparing it to deliver more coherent and balanced results against clear objectives in the new\nfinancial period of 2007 to 2013.\n\nLater in her mandate, she carried out a review of the CAP, which became known as the \u201cCAP Health Check\u201d and made further policy adjustments to ensure that the reformed CAP was working as intended and was addressing the challenges of the 21st century.\n\n==Sugar reform==\n\nWhen Boel took office in 2004, the EU had regulated its sugar sector in more or less\nthe same way for some 40 years, supporting a domestic sugar price far above world market prices to keep production in place in each country.\n\nAlthough the EU did not have a comparative advantage in sugar production, its policy was creating large surpluses that were exported with subsidies, which was not welcomed by many of its trade partners.\n\nWith Boel's reform, agreed in 2005, the benchmark EU sugar price was cut by 36 per cent over several years, which helped to bring the EU sugar industry back into a sustainable and more natural balance with the rest of the world market, as a net importer rather than exporter.\n\nBringing sugar beet farmers into the Single Payment Scheme gave them support which was in line with the need for competitiveness and which also depended on environmental standards (through crosscompliance). The reforms are also funding restructuring programmes in areas that sugar factories shut down, helping workers laid off to find new jobs and putting disused factory sites back into good environmental condition.\n\n==Fruit and vegetable reform==\n\nIn 2006, she proposed reforms to the fruit and vegetable sector, which was agreed in principle in June 2007. It gives extra incentives to producers to band together into \"producer organisations\", which can negotiate with retailers on a more equal footing.\nProducer organisations are now also in charge of managing market crises through disposal schemes and other methods, and they must spend a minimum share of their budget on care for the environment.\n\nAn aspect of the reform, very much inspired by emerging public needs, was the mandate to draw up a school fruit scheme to which the EU agreed in November 2008. It was launched in the 2009/2010 school year and operates in 22 EU countries. It provides funding to\ndistribute fruit and vegetables in schools as well as to support programmes to educate children, parents and teachers about healthy diets.\n\n==Wine reform==\nAs European Union agriculture commissioner, Boel has been a vocal advocate for various [[vine pull schemes]] in an attempt to compensate for the 1.7&nbsp;billion bottle [[wine surplus]] that Europe has had for the last several [[vintage]]s. Every year, the European Union spends 500&nbsp;million euros to [[distill]] the excess wine into [[industrial alcohol]].\n\nUnder the 2007 reform, subsidies for distilling unwanted wines are being phased out, and the money is being spent instead on a broad menu of measures to make the wine sector more competitive and to care for vine landscapes. In an important step to prepare for liberalisation, a three-year voluntary \"grubbing-up scheme\", with strong environmental safeguards, is offering money to uncompetitive producers who wish to dig up their vines and leave the sector.\n\nCritics have claimed that the implementation of Boel's plan will see a 5% drop in wine industry jobs and 7% decrease in wine prices by 2009, but most agree that the price of wine will eventually rise again. Supporters of Boel's plan have noted that European wine consumption has decreased an average of 0.65% a year and that in a few years, imports of [[New World wine]] into Europe will exceed European exports, which will also have negative effects on wine industry jobs and wine prices.<ref>M.

Before Ringway Airport was laid out, three farm fields between Rackhouse Road and Wythenshawe Road in Northern Moor, in what is now the north edge of Wythenshawe, were used as [[Manchester (Wythenshawe) Aerodrome]]. This was the UK's first municipal airfield, operating between April 1929 and early 1930. A barn was converted to act as the hangar and a farmhouse as the administration building. Temporary fuel pumps were installed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholefield|2004|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref> The last recorded flight from Wythenshawe Airport was on 19 June 1930.\n[[File:Aa oldwythenshawe 00.jpg|thumb|right|Area where [[Manchester Airport]] and Wythenshawe are now, as around 1925]]\n\n==Housing and social history==\nWythenshawe is Manchester's largest district, a massive housing estate that was started in the 1920s intended as a \"[[Garden city movement|garden city]]\" where people could be rehoused away from industrial Manchester. In 1920, town planner [[Patrick Abercrombie]] identified the area as the most suitable undeveloped land for a housing estate close to the city, and {{convert|2500|acres}} of land were purchased.<ref name=bbc-2019>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/iZKMPd0wjP/council_housing |title=When council estates were a dream |last=John-Baptiste |first=Ashley |work=BBC News |year=2019 |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nPart of Benchill (not the area southwest of Gladeside Road) and some areas in the north were built before [[World War II]] and called the Wythenshawe Ward of the City of Manchester. The rest was built after the Second World War, starting in the late 1940s as wartime building restrictions were relaxed. Parts of Baguley were still semi-rural in the 1960s, but now there is very little open country left.\n\nThe estate was built initially without many shops, amenities or services, and there was very little employment directly to hand. Although Northenden already had a shopping area on Palatine Road, the earliest new shops were built in the 1930s and included parades on Hollyhedge Road, and on Altrincham Road in Sharston (the latter was demolished in 1973 to make way for the [[M56 motorway|M56]] Sharston bypass). There were smaller local shops, usually a grocers - selling general household provisions, at Minsterly Parade (Woodhouse Park), Haverley Circle (Benchill), However, it took decades for some areas of Wythenshawe to get their own neighbourhood shops, which meant residents had to travel or visit a mobile shop van when it visited their area. Various residents' associations were set up to address those problems, but progress was very slow.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], Wythenshawe eventually expanded, with several further shops being built (such as Haveley Circle, built in the early 1950s but demolished in the 1990s) and businesses were attracted to the area with the expansion of the [[Sharston]] [[Industrial Estate]] and, later, the [[#Moss Nook|Moss Nook]] and Roundthorn industrial complexes. Wythenshawe gradually acquired all the amenities and facilities that the original planners had neglected to include with the building of several new schools, shops, pubs and churches. The area also got its own hospital, and [[Wythenshawe Hospital]] grew out of the earlier Baguley Hospital in 1948. The largest shopping area was built in the 1960s in the town centre, known as the Wythenshawe Civic Centre, which has been expanded further since it was first built. In 1971, the Wythenshawe Forum was opened there, which included a library, a swimming pool, a restaurant, a bar and a theatre.\n\nFrom the 1990s to the 2000s, the houses that were built and owned by the council were transferred to the control of local [[housing association]]s, such as Willow Park in east Wythenshawe and Parkway Green in west Wythenshawe. Both associations merged in 2013 to form the Wythenshawe Community Housing Group which is now responsible for around 14,000 homes in Wythenshawe.\n\nIn 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the housing estates in Wythenshawe as representing an \"extreme pocket of social deprivation and alienation\".<ref>{{cite news | title= How the Young Poor Measure Poverty in Britain: Drink, Drugs and Their Time in Jail | first= Sarah | last= Lyall | date= 10 March 2007 | work= [[The New York Times]] | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/10/world/europe/10britain.html?pagewanted=all}}</ref>\n\nMost of the farm buildings in the Wythenshawe area were demolished when the estate was built. Some of them, like Hollyhedge Farm and Floats Hall, were left among the houses but suffered from vandalism and had to be demolished later. Some of the present housing estates were named after former farms.\n\nPeel Hall Farm (which had a [[moat]]) survived for over 20 years {{clarify|date=March 2016}} as its occupant lived on the proceeds of selling his land, but soon after he left, the property was vandalised and had to be demolished.\n\nNewall Green Farm survived on the edge of the Newall Green housing estate area and was still occupied and run as a farm until the early 21st century when its last occupant died, when it was abandoned and fenced off. The buildings are [[listed building|listed]]. In 2006, a firm bought Newall Green Farm's buildings from Manchester Corporation. On 21 June 2014, vandals set fire to Newall Green Farm, and its roof was destroyed, but there are plans to turn the buildings into a [[care home]] for adults with [[intellectual disability|learning disabilities]], a working farm and a horse-riding centre.<ref>''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', page 21, 27 June 2014</ref>\n\n==Parks==\nWythenshawe has 12 parks and 18 woodland areas including [[Wythenshawe Park]], which was designated a [[Local Nature Reserve]] in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://secure.manchester.gov.uk/directory_record/89324/wythenshawe_park|title=Parks and open spaces - Wythenshawe Park {{!}} Manchester City Council|website=secure.manchester.gov.uk|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= |title=Wythenshawe Park |series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England}}</ref> It covers over {{convert|270|acre|ha}} of green space and is home to Manchester's only community farm, [[Wythenshawe community farm]]. At the centre of the park is the historic Wythenshawe Hall with its [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and Tatton heritage. The park also has riding stables, a horticulture centre, children's play area, athletics track, football pitches, tennis courts, bowls and golfing facilities.\n\nOther parks include Hollyhedge Park, Peel Hall Park, Painswick Park and Baguley Park. Northenden's Riverside Park is the first new park to be established in the city in the 21st century.\n\n==Governance==\n\nThe district is under the authority of [[Manchester City Council]].\n\n[[Manchester Wythenshawe]] was a parliamentary constituency created in 1950 and represented by [[Alf Morris]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] between 1964 and 1997. Before the 1997 election, the boundaries were redrawn and part of the neighbouring area of Sale included in the seat. The new constituency is called [[Wythenshawe and Sale East]]. In the same year, Alf Morris stepped down and was replaced by [[Paul Goggins]]. It is still considered a safe Labour seat, with Labour securing over 50% of the vote (and more than twice as many votes as its nearest rival) in [[Wythenshawe and Sale East#Election results|the 1997, 2001 and 2005 elections]]. Labour kept the seat in the 2010 elections, though their share of the vote was decreased to 44.1%. In early 2014, following the death of Paul Goggins, a [[2014 Wythenshawe and Sale East by-election|by-election was held]]. Labour candidate [[Mike Kane]] (a former Northenden councillor until 2008) won the seat with 55.3% of the vote, though voter turnout was low (28%). The [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] saw the largest vote share for Labour in the history of both the current and former Wythenshawe seat with 62.2% of the vote and a 15,000 majority.\n\nAt the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK Census]], Wythenshawe was divided into six local government [[Ward (politics)|wards]]: [[Baguley]], [[Benchill]], [[Northenden]], [[Sharston]], [[Woodhouse Park]] and [[Brooklands, Manchester|Brooklands]] (the latter being an area divided with the neighbouring borough of [[Trafford]]). Each ward was represented by three local councillors, giving Wythenshawe 21 of the 99 seats on Manchester City Council. Following a review by the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Committee for England]] published in 2003, the ward of Benchill was abolished, and its former territory was divided between the wards of Northenden, Sharston, and Woodhouse Park.<ref>{{cite web|title=Draft recommendations on the future electoral arrangements for Manchester |publisher=The Electoral Commission |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/file/0004/6538/Manchester_D_8002-7032__E__.pdf |date=February 2003 |accessdate=16 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327152034/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/file/0004/6538/Manchester_D_8002-7032__E__.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nWythenshawe typically returns all Labour councillors in local elections, although in the [[2008 United Kingdom local elections|2008 elections]] the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] gained a seat in [[Northenden]] and a second seat (in the same area) in the [[2010 United Kingdom local elections|2010 elections]]. Labour regained these seats in the [[2012 United Kingdom local elections|2012]] and [[2014 United Kingdom local elections|2014 elections]].\n\n==Geography==\nWythenshawe is {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} south of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] and is the southernmost district of Manchester.\nIt is surrounded by some of the most affluent areas in the UK. [[Altrincham]] and [[Hale, Greater Manchester|Hale]] lie to the south-west, [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] to the north-west and [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] to the east. [[Manchester Airport]], the third largest in the UK, is immediately to the south.\n\n'''Shadow Moss''' is an area south of Ringway Road in the southeast corner of Wythenshawe. On [[:File:Aa oldwythenshawe 00.jpg|this old map of Wythenshawe]] it is roughly the rectangular area between three country lanes with '''Heyhead''' at its northwest corner.<ref>Wythenshawe, A History of the [[Township (England)|township]]s of [[Northenden]], Northen Etchells and [[Baguley]], Volume 1: 10 1926, edited by W.H.Shercliff, {{ISBN|0-85972-008-X}}, published by Northenden Civic Society 1974</ref> On modern maps, its north edge is the southern branch of Ringway Road. It was partly in Northen Etchells township and partly in [[Styal]] parish. For many centuries it was a [[peat bog]] which was dug for [[peat]] fuel, locally called \"turf\"; local [[manorial]] law said that after digging peat the top living plant layer had to be lodged back to let more peat form afterwards. Each man's allocated part of the Moss was called his \"moss room\".\n\nIn the 19th century, [[manor]]ial control was lost over what people used their moss rooms for, and an 1839 [[tithe]] map of Northen Etchells shows Northen Etchells's part of Shadow Moss as about 2/3 [[arable land|arable]], about 1/3 [[meadow]], one field as [[pasture]], and one field as \"uncultivated moors\".<ref>W.H.Shercliff, 1974, page 3</ref>\n\nLater, the fertile [[Carrington Moss#Flora and fauna|lowland peat]] soil led to the area being much used for [[market gardening]], with large areas under [[greenhouse]]s. Of the people who worked there, many lived in Heyhead.\n\nAs of around 1970, Heyhead was a small settlement at the south end of Woodhouse Lane and the nearby part of Ringway Road. It comprised several [[terrace house]]s, a small shop, two or more old cottages, a [[chapel]], and the Ringway Haulage Company. [[Manchester Airport]]'s ground level car parking has been displaced from other areas and car parks have been formed to the north and south of the runways and under the approach path. The Heyhead area has been progressively replaced by level car parks, and by 2011 all of Heyhead's buildings had vanished (see [[History of Manchester Airport#Expansion]]).\n\nSome greenhouses remain at the far east of the Shadow Moss area as of June 2012, but are used by private car parking operators (not associated with the airport company) and not for growing any crop. The last market gardener there, who grew tomatoes, closed his business in 2011 due to competition from highly mechanized enormous greenhouse establishments elsewhere.\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring districts and places.'''\n|Northwest = [[Timperley]]\n|North     = [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]]\n|Northeast = [[Didsbury]]\n|West      = [[Altrincham]]\n|Centre    = Wythenshawe\n|East      = [[Gatley]]\n|Southwest = [[Hale, Greater Manchester|Hale]]\n|South     = [[Manchester Airport]]\n|Southeast = [[Styal]]\n}}\n\n==Public services==\nWythenshawe is policed by the city of Manchester Division of [[Greater Manchester Police]]. Wythenshawe's fire and rescue services are the responsibility of the [[Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service]], and are based at a fire station on Brownley Road.\n\n==Transport==\nThe [[M56 motorway]], constructed in the 1970s as a continuation of the [[A5103 road]] (Princess Parkway), bisects east and west Wythenshawe. A bypass connecting it to the nearby [[M60 motorway]] was built through Sharston and opened in 1974.\n\nThe nearest railway station to Wythenshawe was located adjacent to Longley Lane at the edge of Sharston on the [[Cheshire Lines Railway]] from [[Stockport]] to [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool]]. Named ''Northenden for Wythenshawe'', [[Northenden railway station]] was closed on 30 November 1964.<ref>Butt, p.173</ref> Wythenshawe did not then have a public railway service for several decades, with the nearest stations being located in the neighbouring areas of [[Gatley]], [[Heald Green]] and [[Altrincham]]. A [[Manchester Airport railway station|station at Manchester Airport]] was opened in 1993.\n\nThe [[Airport Line (Manchester Metrolink)|Airport Line]] branch of the [[Manchester Metrolink]] tram service includes twelve stops throughout Wythenshawe. The line opened on 3 November 2014, a year ahead of schedule.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Britton|first1=Paul|title=New Metrolink line to Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport to open on 3 November \u2013 a year ahead of schedule|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/new-metrolink-line-wythenshawe-manchester-7927130|accessdate=18 October 2014|work=Manchester Evening News|date=13 October 2014}}</ref> In addition to the building of the new Metrolink lines and stations, a new public transport hub was built in Wythenshawe Town Centre which opened in June 2015 and includes a new bus station and tram stop.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:WythenshaweCivic.jpg|thumb|upright|The Civic Centre in Wythenshawe.

There are four areas of industrial activity (estates) - Moss Nook, Ringway ([[Manchester Airport|Airport Cargo Centre]]), Roundthorn and Sharston. It is home to Manchester Airport and UHSM Wythenshawe Hospital, which are two of the largest employers in the area. Many national and international companies have premises or main offices in Wythenshawe, including [[Timpson (retailer)|Timpson Ltd]], [[HellermannTyton]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Vodafone]] and [[F. Duerr & Sons]].\n\nIn 1934, George Hamer Scholes built the Wylex Works to produce electrical accessories.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5294335 |publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org |accessdate=14 February 2014|doi=10.1049/ji-1.1946.0187 |title=Obituary notices |journal=Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers - Part I: General |volume=93 |issue=72 |pages=614\u2013620 |year=1946 }}</ref> The company was later acquired by Electrium, which is now under Siemens' ownership.\n\nSeveral [[greenfield land|greenfield]] and [[greyfield land|greyfield]] sites have been opened up to developers and there are several new housing developments within the area.\n\nThe town centre, known as the Civic Centre, was originally built in the 1960s. It expanded over the years and was renovated between 1999 and 2002 to include new stores and other new features, when the city council relinquished ownership and transferred it to [[St. Modwen Properties]]. The main shopping area now includes gates that are locked at night to prevent the vandalism that was seen in previous years. The Forum centre, which opened in 1971, houses a library, leisure centre, swimming pool, cafe and other amenities, has also been renovated in a more modern style.

Before Ringway Airport was laid out, three farm fields between Rackhouse Road and Wythenshawe Road in Northern Moor, in what is now the north edge of Wythenshawe, were used as [[Manchester (Wythenshawe) Aerodrome]]. This was the UK's first municipal airfield, operating between April 1929 and early 1930. A barn was converted to act as the hangar and a farmhouse as the administration building. Temporary fuel pumps were installed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholefield|2004|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref> The last recorded flight from Wythenshawe Airport was on 19 June 1930.\n[[File:Aa oldwythenshawe 00.jpg|thumb|right|Area where [[Manchester Airport]] and Wythenshawe are now, as around 1925]]\n\n==Housing and social history==\nWythenshawe is Manchester's largest district, a massive housing estate that was started in the 1920s intended as a \"[[Garden city movement|garden city]]\" where people could be rehoused away from industrial Manchester. In 1920, town planner [[Patrick Abercrombie]] identified the area as the most suitable undeveloped land for a housing estate close to the city, and {{convert|2500|acres}} of land were purchased.<ref name=bbc-2019>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/iZKMPd0wjP/council_housing |title=When council estates were a dream |last=John-Baptiste |first=Ashley |work=BBC News |year=2019 |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nPart of Benchill (not the area southwest of Gladeside Road) and some areas in the north were built before [[World War II]] and called the Wythenshawe Ward of the City of Manchester. The rest was built after the Second World War, starting in the late 1940s as wartime building restrictions were relaxed. Parts of Baguley were still semi-rural in the 1960s, but now there is very little open country left.\n\nThe estate was built initially without many shops, amenities or services, and there was very little employment directly to hand. Although Northenden already had a shopping area on Palatine Road, the earliest new shops were built in the 1930s and included parades on Hollyhedge Road, and on Altrincham Road in Sharston (the latter was demolished in 1973 to make way for the [[M56 motorway|M56]] Sharston bypass). There were smaller local shops, usually a grocers - selling general household provisions, at Minsterly Parade (Woodhouse Park), Haverley Circle (Benchill), However, it took decades for some areas of Wythenshawe to get their own neighbourhood shops, which meant residents had to travel or visit a mobile shop van when it visited their area. Various residents' associations were set up to address those problems, but progress was very slow.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], Wythenshawe eventually expanded, with several further shops being built (such as Haveley Circle, built in the early 1950s but demolished in the 1990s) and businesses were attracted to the area with the expansion of the [[Sharston]] [[Industrial Estate]] and, later, the [[#Moss Nook|Moss Nook]] and Roundthorn industrial complexes. Wythenshawe gradually acquired all the amenities and facilities that the original planners had neglected to include with the building of several new schools, shops, pubs and churches. The area also got its own hospital, and [[Wythenshawe Hospital]] grew out of the earlier Baguley Hospital in 1948. The largest shopping area was built in the 1960s in the town centre, known as the Wythenshawe Civic Centre, which has been expanded further since it was first built. In 1971, the Wythenshawe Forum was opened there, which included a library, a swimming pool, a restaurant, a bar and a theatre.\n\nFrom the 1990s to the 2000s, the houses that were built and owned by the council were transferred to the control of local [[housing association]]s, such as Willow Park in east Wythenshawe and Parkway Green in west Wythenshawe. Both associations merged in 2013 to form the Wythenshawe Community Housing Group which is now responsible for around 14,000 homes in Wythenshawe.\n\nIn 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the housing estates in Wythenshawe as representing an \"extreme pocket of social deprivation and alienation\".<ref>{{cite news | title= How the Young Poor Measure Poverty in Britain: Drink, Drugs and Their Time in Jail | first= Sarah | last= Lyall | date= 10 March 2007 | work= [[The New York Times]] | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/10/world/europe/10britain.html?pagewanted=all}}</ref>\n\nMost of the farm buildings in the Wythenshawe area were demolished when the estate was built. Some of them, like Hollyhedge Farm and Floats Hall, were left among the houses but suffered from vandalism and had to be demolished later. Some of the present housing estates were named after former farms.\n\nPeel Hall Farm (which had a [[moat]]) survived for over 20 years {{clarify|date=March 2016}} as its occupant lived on the proceeds of selling his land, but soon after he left, the property was vandalised and had to be demolished.\n\nNewall Green Farm survived on the edge of the Newall Green housing estate area and was still occupied and run as a farm until the early 21st century when its last occupant died, when it was abandoned and fenced off. The buildings are [[listed building|listed]]. In 2006, a firm bought Newall Green Farm's buildings from Manchester Corporation. On 21 June 2014, vandals set fire to Newall Green Farm, and its roof was destroyed, but there are plans to turn the buildings into a [[care home]] for adults with [[intellectual disability|learning disabilities]], a working farm and a horse-riding centre.<ref>''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', page 21, 27 June 2014</ref>\n\n==Parks==\nWythenshawe has 12 parks and 18 woodland areas including [[Wythenshawe Park]], which was designated a [[Local Nature Reserve]] in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://secure.manchester.gov.uk/directory_record/89324/wythenshawe_park|title=Parks and open spaces - Wythenshawe Park {{!}} Manchester City Council|website=secure.manchester.gov.uk|access-date=2019-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= |title=Wythenshawe Park |series=Local Nature Reserves|publisher=Natural England}}</ref> It covers over {{convert|270|acre|ha}} of green space and is home to Manchester's only community farm, [[Wythenshawe community farm]]. At the centre of the park is the historic Wythenshawe Hall with its [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and Tatton heritage. The park also has riding stables, a horticulture centre, children's play area, athletics track, football pitches, tennis courts, bowls and golfing facilities.\n\nOther parks include Hollyhedge Park, Peel Hall Park, Painswick Park and Baguley Park. Northenden's Riverside Park is the first new park to be established in the city in the 21st century.\n\n==Governance==\n\nThe district is under the authority of [[Manchester City Council]].\n\n[[Manchester Wythenshawe]] was a parliamentary constituency created in 1950 and represented by [[Alf Morris]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] between 1964 and 1997. Before the 1997 election, the boundaries were redrawn and part of the neighbouring area of Sale included in the seat. The new constituency is called [[Wythenshawe and Sale East]]. In the same year, Alf Morris stepped down and was replaced by [[Paul Goggins]]. It is still considered a safe Labour seat, with Labour securing over 50% of the vote (and more than twice as many votes as its nearest rival) in [[Wythenshawe and Sale East#Election results|the 1997, 2001 and 2005 elections]]. Labour kept the seat in the 2010 elections, though their share of the vote was decreased to 44.1%. In early 2014, following the death of Paul Goggins, a [[2014 Wythenshawe and Sale East by-election|by-election was held]]. Labour candidate [[Mike Kane]] (a former Northenden councillor until 2008) won the seat with 55.3% of the vote, though voter turnout was low (28%). The [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]] saw the largest vote share for Labour in the history of both the current and former Wythenshawe seat with 62.2% of the vote and a 15,000 majority.\n\nAt the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 UK Census]], Wythenshawe was divided into six local government [[Ward (politics)|wards]]: [[Baguley]], [[Benchill]], [[Northenden]], [[Sharston]], [[Woodhouse Park]] and [[Brooklands, Manchester|Brooklands]] (the latter being an area divided with the neighbouring borough of [[Trafford]]). Each ward was represented by three local councillors, giving Wythenshawe 21 of the 99 seats on Manchester City Council. Following a review by the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Committee for England]] published in 2003, the ward of Benchill was abolished, and its former territory was divided between the wards of Northenden, Sharston, and Woodhouse Park.<ref>{{cite web|title=Draft recommendations on the future electoral arrangements for Manchester |publisher=The Electoral Commission |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/file/0004/6538/Manchester_D_8002-7032__E__.pdf |date=February 2003 |accessdate=16 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327152034/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/file/0004/6538/Manchester_D_8002-7032__E__.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nWythenshawe typically returns all Labour councillors in local elections, although in the [[2008 United Kingdom local elections|2008 elections]] the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] gained a seat in [[Northenden]] and a second seat (in the same area) in the [[2010 United Kingdom local elections|2010 elections]]. Labour regained these seats in the [[2012 United Kingdom local elections|2012]] and [[2014 United Kingdom local elections|2014 elections]].\n\n==Geography==\nWythenshawe is {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} south of the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]] and is the southernmost district of Manchester.\nIt is surrounded by some of the most affluent areas in the UK. [[Altrincham]] and [[Hale, Greater Manchester|Hale]] lie to the south-west, [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] to the north-west and [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]] to the east. [[Manchester Airport]], the third largest in the UK, is immediately to the south.\n\n'''Shadow Moss''' is an area south of Ringway Road in the southeast corner of Wythenshawe. On [[:File:Aa oldwythenshawe 00.jpg|this old map of Wythenshawe]] it is roughly the rectangular area between three country lanes with '''Heyhead''' at its northwest corner.<ref>Wythenshawe, A History of the [[Township (England)|township]]s of [[Northenden]], Northen Etchells and [[Baguley]], Volume 1: 10 1926, edited by W.H.Shercliff, {{ISBN|0-85972-008-X}}, published by Northenden Civic Society 1974</ref> On modern maps, its north edge is the southern branch of Ringway Road. It was partly in Northen Etchells township and partly in [[Styal]] parish. For many centuries it was a [[peat bog]] which was dug for [[peat]] fuel, locally called \"turf\"; local [[manorial]] law said that after digging peat the top living plant layer had to be lodged back to let more peat form afterwards. Each man's allocated part of the Moss was called his \"moss room\".\n\nIn the 19th century, [[manor]]ial control was lost over what people used their moss rooms for, and an 1839 [[tithe]] map of Northen Etchells shows Northen Etchells's part of Shadow Moss as about 2/3 [[arable land|arable]], about 1/3 [[meadow]], one field as [[pasture]], and one field as \"uncultivated moors\".<ref>W.H.Shercliff, 1974, page 3</ref>\n\nLater, the fertile [[Carrington Moss#Flora and fauna|lowland peat]] soil led to the area being much used for [[market gardening]], with large areas under [[greenhouse]]s. Of the people who worked there, many lived in Heyhead.\n\nAs of around 1970, Heyhead was a small settlement at the south end of Woodhouse Lane and the nearby part of Ringway Road. It comprised several [[terrace house]]s, a small shop, two or more old cottages, a [[chapel]], and the Ringway Haulage Company. [[Manchester Airport]]'s ground level car parking has been displaced from other areas and car parks have been formed to the north and south of the runways and under the approach path. The Heyhead area has been progressively replaced by level car parks, and by 2011 all of Heyhead's buildings had vanished (see [[History of Manchester Airport#Expansion]]).\n\nSome greenhouses remain at the far east of the Shadow Moss area as of June 2012, but are used by private car parking operators (not associated with the airport company) and not for growing any crop. The last market gardener there, who grew tomatoes, closed his business in 2011 due to competition from highly mechanized enormous greenhouse establishments elsewhere.\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring districts and places.'''\n|Northwest = [[Timperley]]\n|North     = [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]]\n|Northeast = [[Didsbury]]\n|West      = [[Altrincham]]\n|Centre    = Wythenshawe\n|East      = [[Gatley]]\n|Southwest = [[Hale, Greater Manchester|Hale]]\n|South     = [[Manchester Airport]]\n|Southeast = [[Styal]]\n}}\n\n==Public services==\nWythenshawe is policed by the city of Manchester Division of [[Greater Manchester Police]].

A bypass connecting it to the nearby [[M60 motorway]] was built through Sharston and opened in 1974.\n\nThe nearest railway station to Wythenshawe was located adjacent to Longley Lane at the edge of Sharston on the [[Cheshire Lines Railway]] from [[Stockport]] to [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool]].

It expanded over the years and was renovated between 1999 and 2002 to include new stores and other new features, when the city council relinquished ownership and transferred it to [[St. Modwen Properties]]. The main shopping area now includes gates that are locked at night to prevent the vandalism that was seen in previous years. The Forum centre, which opened in 1971, houses a library, leisure centre, swimming pool, cafe and other amenities, has also been renovated in a more modern style. For thirty years it also housed the Forum Theatre, but this closed in 2002 and a health clinic and an adult education facility now occupy its space. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 2007, [[Asda]] opened a new superstore on the site of the old Co-operative store (originally built by [[Woolco]] in the mid-1970s, which also features a [[multi-storey car park]]). A walkway going between the multi-storey car park and the large supermarket building now features a wall mosaic depicting various aspects of the town. After the demolition of two 1960s blocks of multi-storey flats in 2007, new buildings were constructed on the site including a new [[Wilko (retailer)|Wilko]] shop, office premises and a local authority services hub that provides a new frontage for the town centre from its north-facing aspect.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==In the media==\nWythenshawe is the outdoor filming location for the Channel 4 series ''[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]'', which shows various shots of the local tower-blocks, housing estates and other architecture unique to this area.
