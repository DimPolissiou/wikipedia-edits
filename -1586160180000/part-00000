It joined the [[World Figure Skating Championships]] in 1952, and became a [[Winter Olympic Games]] medal sport in 1976.  According to the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU), an ice dance team consists of \"one Lady and one Man\".<ref>S&P/ID 2018, p. 9</ref>{{refn|group=note|Women are referred to as ladies in ISU regulations and communications.}}\n\nIn the early 1900s, ice dancing was primarily a recreational sport in England, Europe, and the United States.  British ice dance teams dominated the sport throughout the 1950s and 1960s, then Soviet teams up until the 1990s.  In the 1980s and 1990s, there was an attempt by ice dancers, their coaches, and choreographers to move ice dance away from its ballroom origins to more theatrical performances, but the ISU pushed back by tightening rules and definitions of ice dance to emphasize its connection to ballroom dancing.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, ice dance lost much of its integrity as a sport after a series of judging scandals.  There were calls to suspend the sport for a year to deal with the dispute, which seemed to impact ice dance teams from North America the most.  Teams from North America began to dominate the sport starting in the early 2000s.\n\nBefore the [[2010\u201311 figure skating season]], there were three segments in ice dance competitions: the [[compulsory dance]] (CD), the [[original dance]] (OD), and the [[Free dance (ice dance)|free dance]] (FD). In 2010, the ISU voted to change the competition format by eliminating the CD and the OD and adding the new [[short dance]] (SD) segment to the competition schedule.  In 2018, the ISU voted to rename the SD to the [[rhythm dance]] (RD).  Ice dance has required elements that ice dancers must perform during a competition and that make up a well-balanced skating program.  They include: the dance [[Figure skating lifts|lift]], the dance [[Figure skating spins|spin]], the [[step sequence]], [[twizzle]]s, and choreographic elements.  They must be performed in specific ways, as described in published communications by the ISU, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe ISU publishes violations and their points values yearly.  Deductions in ice dance include falls and interruptions, and violations in time, music, and clothing.\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Jackson Haines2.jpg|thumb|Jackson Haines, the \"father of figure skating\"]]\n\nThe roots of ice dance, like [[pairs skating]], are in the \"combined skating\" developed in the 19th century by skating clubs and organizations and by recreational social skating between couples and friends, who would skate [[waltzes]], marches, and other social dances together.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. xiv, p. 102</ref>  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, \"Ice dancing derives from the turn-of-the-century Viennese and English attempts to translate the waltz and other ballroom dances to the ice and to devise ballroom-style performances suitable for skates\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Kestnbaum, p. 221</ref>  Figure skating historian James Hines states that ice dance had its beginnings in hand-in-hand skating, a short-lived but popular disciple of figure skating in England in the 1890s; many of the positions used in ice dance today can be traced back to hand-in-hand skating.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 36</ref>  In 1836, the Oxford Skating Society published a simple program of figures for hand-in-hand skating.<ref name=\"hines2006-119\">Hines (2006), p. 119</ref>  The first steps in ice dance were similar to those used in ballroom dancing, so unlike modern ice dance, skaters tended to keep both feet on the ice most of the time, without the \"long and flowing edges associated with graceful figure skating\".<ref name=\"hines2006-120\">Hines (2006), p. 120</ref>\n\nIn the late 1800s, American [[Jackson Haines]], known as \"the Father of Figure Skating\",<ref name=\"blakemore\">{{cite web |last1=Blakemore |first1=Erin |title=The Man Who Invented Figure Skating Was Laughed Out of America |url=https://www.history.com/news/the-man-who-invented-figure-skating-was-laughed-out-of-america |website=History.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |accessdate=11 January 2020 |date=12 December 2017}}</ref> brought his style of skating to Europe, and taught people in Vienna, where he capitalized on their \"obsession with waltzing\",<ref name=\"blakemore\"/> how to dance on the ice, both singly and with partners.<ref name=\"blakemore\"/>  Haines introduced the American waltz, a simple four-step sequence, each step lasting one beat of music, repeated as the partners moved in a circular pattern, to Vienna.  By the 1880s, it and the Jackson Haines waltz, a variation of the American waltz, were among the most popular ice dances.<ref name=\"hines2006-120\"/>  Other popular ice dance steps included the [[mazurka]], a version of the Jackson Haines waltz developed in Sweden, and the three-step waltz, which was created in Paris in 1894 and was called \"the direct predecessor of ice dancing in the modern sense\".<ref name=\"hines2006-120\"/>\n\nIn the 1890s in Paris, a three-step waltz called the English waltz, which ice dance historian Cheryl Elton called \"the direct predecessor of modern ice dancing, featuring the speed and flowing edges that we see today\"<ref name=\"elton-1\">Elton, p. 1</ref> was created.  The English waltz became the standard for waltz skating competitions and was at first popular with inexperienced skaters, although skilled skaters made it more challenging by introducing more difficult steps such as [[Mohawk turn|mohawks]] and [[3 turn]]s.<ref name=\"hines2006-121\">Hines (2006), p. 121</ref><ref name=\"elton-1\"/>  Other early ice dances included the European waltz, inventor unknown, before the turn of the 20th century, and the ten-step, a precursor of the fourteen-step, both of which are still used in ice dance competitions today.<ref>Elton, p. 1-2</ref>  The killian, first skated in 1909 by Austrian [[Karl Schreiter]], was the last ice dance invented before [[World War I]] still being done today.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 123</ref>  According to Hines, the ten-step is the basis of the fourteen-step, the oldest dance still done in the sport.  The ten-step was created by Austrian champion [[Max Bohatsch]] in Vienna.<ref name=\"hines2006-122\">Hines (2006), p. 122</ref>  Also in the 1890s, combined and hand-in-hand skating moved skating away from \"the static confines of basic figures to continuous movement around a rink\".<ref name=\"hines2006-119\"/>  Hines insisted that the popularity of skating waltzes, which depended upon the speed and flow across the ice of couples in dance positions and not just on holding hands with a partner, \"dealt a death knell to hand-in-hand skating\".<ref name=\"hines2006-119\"/>  By the end of the 19th century, waltzing competitions became popular throughout the world.<ref name=\"hines2006-121\" />  According to Hines, Vienna was \"the dancing capital of Europe, both on and off skates\" in the 19th century.<ref name=\"hines2006-122\"/>\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Eva Romanov\u00e1 and Pavel Roman 1965.jpg|upright=1.0|thumb|left|[[Eva Romanov\u00e1]] and [[Pavel Roman]] in 1965]]\n\nBy the early 1900s, ice dancing was popular around the world and was primarily a recreational sport, although during the 1920s, local clubs in Britain and the U.S. conducted informal dance contests in waltzes and in marches such as the ten-step, the fourteen-step, and the killian, which were the only three dances used in competition until the 1930s.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2>Hines (2006), p. 124</ref>  Recreational skating became more popular during the 1930s in England, and new and more difficult set-pattern dances, which later were used in compulsory dances during competitions, were developed.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 222</ref>  Hines stated that the development of new ice dances was necessary to expand upon the three dances already developed; three British teams\u2014[[Erik van der Wyden]] and [[Eva Keats]], [[Reginald Wilkie]] and [[Daphne B. Wallis]], and [[Robert Dench]] and [[Rosemarie Stewart]]\u2014created one-fourth of the dances used in [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) competitions by 2006.  In 1933, the Westminster Skating Club conducted a competition encouraging the creation of new dances.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 123\u2014124</ref>  Beginning in the mid-1930s, national organizations began to introduce skating proficiency tests in set-pattern dances, improve the judging of dance tests, and oversee competitions.  The first national competitions occurred in England in 1934, Canada in 1935, the U.S. in 1936, and Austria in 1937.  These competitions included one or more compulsory dances, the original dance, and the free dance.<ref name=\"elton-2\">Elton, p. 2</ref><ref>Kestnbaum, pp. 222</ref><ref name=\"hines2011-102\">Hines (2011), p. 102</ref>  By the late 1930s, ice dancers swelled memberships in skating clubs throughout the world, and as Hines stated, \"became the backbone of skating clubs\".<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nThe ISU began to develop rules, standards, and international tests for ice dance in the 1950s.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\">Kestnbaum, p. 223</ref>  The first international ice dancing competition occurred as a special event at the [[1950 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships in 1950]] in London; [[Lois Waring]] and [[Michael McGean]] of the U.S. won the event, much to the embarrassment of the British, who considered themselves the best ice dancers in the world.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 173\u2014174</ref>  A second event was planned the following year, at the [[1951 World Figure Skating Championships|1951 World Championships]] in Milan; [[Jean Westwood (figure skater)|Jean Westwood]] and [[Lawrence Demmy]] of Great Britain came in first place.<ref name=\"hines2006-174\" />  Ice dance, with the CD and FD segments, was formally added to the [[1952 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships in 1952]].<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\"/>  Westwood and Demmy won the first championship; they went on to dominate ice dancing and win the next four World Championships.<ref name=\"hines2011-102\"/><ref name=\"hines2006-174\">Hines (2006), p. 174</ref>  British teams dominated ice dance throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, winning 12 out of the first 16 championships.<ref name=\"elton-2\"/>  [[Eva Romanova]] and [[Pavel Roman]] of Czechoslovakia were the first non-British ice dancers to win a world title, in 1962.<ref>Hines (2011), p.xxxi</ref>\n\n===1970s to 1990s===\nIce dance became an Olympic sport in 1976; [[Lyudmila Pakhomova]] and [[Aleksandr Gorshkov (figure skater)|Alexandr Gorshkov]] from the Soviet Union were the first gold medalists.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\"/><ref name=\"hines2011-xxvi\">Hines (2011), p. xxvi</ref><ref name=\"russell\">{{cite news |last1=Russell |first1=Susan D. |title=Lyudmila Pakhomova and Aleksandr Gorshkov: The Heroes of Olympic Ice Dance |url=http://www.ifsmagazine.com/articles/32605-lyudmila-pakhomova-and-aleksandr-gorshkov |accessdate=20 August 2018 |work=International Figure Skating |date=5 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234703/http://www.ifsmagazine.com/articles/32605-lyudmila-pakhomova-and-aleksandr-gorshkov |archive-date=2016-03-03 }}</ref>  The Soviets dominated ice dancing during most of the 1970s; as they did in pair skating, they won every Worlds and Olympic title between 1970 and 1978, and won medals at every competition between 1976 and 1982.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 217, 218</ref>  In 1984, British dancers [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]], who Hines called \"the greatest ice dancers in the history of the sport\",<ref>Hines (2006), p. 240</ref> briefly interrupted Soviet domination of ice dance by \"famously winning the Olympic gold medal\"<ref name=\"elton-2\"/> at the [[1984 Winter Olympics|Olympic Games in Sarajevo]], with their free dance to [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'',<ref name=\"elton-2\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=1984: British ice couple score Olympic gold |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_4156000/4156053.stm |accessdate=11 January 2020 |work=BBC |date=14 February 1984}}</ref> which has been called \"probably the most well known single program in the history of ice dance\".<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\">Kestnbaum, p. 228</ref>  Hines stated, about Torvill and Dean, that they dramatically altered \"established concepts of ice dancing\"<ref>Hines (2006), p. 239</ref> with their innovative choreography.\n\n[[File:Jayne_Torvill_and_Christopher_Dean_-_Dancing_on_Ice_2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|[[Torvill and Dean]] performing in 2011]]\n\nThroughout the 1970s, there was a movement in ice dance away from its ballroom roots to a more theatrical style.  As Kestnbaum stated, \"The top Soviet teams pioneered an emphasis on the dramatic qualities of ice dancing, choreographing programs around a single ballroom theme and incorporating elements of [[ballet]] and theatrical performances into their performances\".<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\"/>  Dance teams from all over the world were influenced by ballet techniques, especially \"the classic ballet ''[[pas de deux]]'' of the high-art instance of a man and woman dancing together\".<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\"/> They began to move ice dance away from its social dance origins, towards art dance, by performing as predictable characters, choreographing into their routines body positions that were no longer rooted in traditional ballroom holds, and using music with less predictable rhythms.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\"/><ref name=\"russell\"/>\n\nThe ISU pushed back during the 1980s and 1990s by tightening rules and definitions of ice dance to emphasize its connection to ballroom dancing, especially in the FD.

It joined the [[World Figure Skating Championships]] in 1952, and became a [[Winter Olympic Games]] medal sport in 1976.  According to the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU), an ice dance team consists of \"one Lady and one Man\".<ref>S&P/ID 2018, p. 9</ref>{{refn|group=note|Women are referred to as ladies in ISU regulations and communications.}}\n\nIn the early 1900s, ice dancing was primarily a recreational sport in England, Europe, and the United States.  British ice dance teams dominated the sport throughout the 1950s and 1960s, then Soviet teams up until the 1990s.  In the 1980s and 1990s, there was an attempt by ice dancers, their coaches, and choreographers to move ice dance away from its ballroom origins to more theatrical performances, but the ISU pushed back by tightening rules and definitions of ice dance to emphasize its connection to ballroom dancing.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, ice dance lost much of its integrity as a sport after a series of judging scandals.  There were calls to suspend the sport for a year to deal with the dispute, which seemed to impact ice dance teams from North America the most.  Teams from North America began to dominate the sport starting in the early 2000s.\n\nBefore the [[2010\u201311 figure skating season]], there were three segments in ice dance competitions: the [[compulsory dance]] (CD), the [[original dance]] (OD), and the [[Free dance (ice dance)|free dance]] (FD). In 2010, the ISU voted to change the competition format by eliminating the CD and the OD and adding the new [[short dance]] (SD) segment to the competition schedule.  In 2018, the ISU voted to re-name the SD to the [[rhythm dance]] (RD).  Ice dance has required elements that ice dancers must perform during a competition and that make up a well-balanced skating program.  They include: the dance [[Figure skating lifts|lift]], the dance [[Figure skating spins|spin]], the [[step sequence]], [[Twizzle|twizzles]], and choreographic elements.  They must be performed in specific ways, as described in published communications by the ISU, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe ISU publishes violations and their points values yearly.  Deductions in ice dance include falls and interruptions, and violations in time, music, and clothing.\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:Jackson Haines2.jpg|thumb|Jackson Haines, the \"father of figure skating\"]]\n\nThe roots of ice dance, like [[pairs skating]], are in the \"combined skating\" developed in the 19th century by skating clubs and organizations and by recreational social skating between couples and friends, who would skate [[waltzes]], marches, and other social dances together.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. xiv, p. 102</ref>  According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, \"Ice dancing derives from the turn-of-the-century Viennese and English attempts to translate the waltz and other ballroom dances to the ice and to devise ballroom-style performances suitable for skates\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Kestnbaum, p. 221</ref>  Figure skating historian James Hines states that ice dance had its beginnings in hand-in-hand skating, a short-lived but popular disciple of figure skating in England in the 1890s; many of the positions used in ice dance today can be traced back to hand-in-hand skating.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 36</ref>  In 1836, the Oxford Skating Society published a simple program of figures for hand-in-hand skating.<ref name=\"hines2006-119\">Hines (2006), p. 119</ref>  The first steps in ice dance were similar to those used in ballroom dancing, so unlike modern ice dance, skaters tended to keep both feet on the ice most of the time, without the \"long and flowing edges associated with graceful figure skating\".<ref name=\"hines2006-120\">Hines (2006), p. 120</ref>  \n\nIn the late 1800s, American [[Jackson Haines]], known as \"the Father of Figure Skating\",<ref name=\"blakemore\">{{cite web |last1=Blakemore |first1=Erin |title=The Man Who Invented Figure Skating Was Laughed Out of America |url=https://www.history.com/news/the-man-who-invented-figure-skating-was-laughed-out-of-america |website=History.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |accessdate=11 January 2020 |date=12 December 2017}}</ref> brought his style of skating to Europe, and taught people in Vienna, where he capitalized on their \"obsession with waltzing\",<ref name=\"blakemore\"/> how to dance on the ice, both singly and with partners.<ref name=\"blakemore\"/>  Haines introduced the American waltz, a simple four-step sequence, each step lasting one beat of music, repeated as the partners moved in a circular pattern, to Vienna.  By the 1880s, it and the Jackson Haines waltz, a variation of the American waltz, were among the most popular ice dances.<ref name=\"hines2006-120\"/>  Other popular ice dance steps included the [[mazurka]], a version of the Jackson Haines waltz developed in Sweden, and the three-step waltz, which was created in Paris in 1894 and was called \"the direct predecessor of ice dancing in the modern sense\".<ref name=\"hines2006-120\"/>\n\nIn the 1890s in Paris, a three-step waltz called the English waltz, which ice dance historian Cheryl Elton called \"the direct predecessor of modern ice dancing, featuring the speed and flowing edges that we see today\"<ref name=\"elton-1\">Elton, p. 1</ref> was created.  The English waltz became the standard for waltz skating competitions and was at first popular with inexperienced skaters, although skilled skaters made it more challenging by introducing more difficult steps such as [[Mohawk turn|mohawks]] and [[3 turn]]s.<ref name=\"hines2006-121\">Hines (2006), p. 121</ref><ref name=\"elton-1\"/>  Other early ice dances included the European waltz, inventor unknown, before the turn of the 20th century, and the ten-step, a precursor of the fourteen-step, both of which are still used in ice dance competitions today.<ref>Elton, p. 1-2</ref>  The killian, first skated in 1909 by Austrian [[Karl Schreiter]], was the last ice dance invented before [[World War I]] still being done today.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 123</ref>  According to Hines, the ten-step is the basis of the fourteen-step, the oldest dance still done in the sport.  The ten-step was created by Austrian champion [[Max Bohatsch]] in Vienna.<ref name=\"hines2006-122\">Hines (2006), p. 122</ref>  Also in the 1890s, combined and hand-in-hand skating moved skating away from \"the static confines of basic figures to continuous movement around a rink\".<ref name=\"hines2006-119\"/>  Hines insisted that the popularity of skating waltzes, which depended upon the speed and flow across the ice of couples in dance positions and not just on holding hands with a partner, \"dealt a death knell to hand-in-hand skating\".<ref name=\"hines2006-119\"/>  By the end of the 19th century, waltzing competitions became popular throughout the world.<ref name=\"hines2006-121\" />  According to Hines, Vienna was \"the dancing capital of Europe, both on and off skates\" in the 19th century.<ref name=\"hines2006-122\"/>\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Eva Romanov\u00e1 and Pavel Roman 1965.jpg|upright=1.0|thumb|left|[[Eva Romanov\u00e1]] and [[Pavel Roman]] in 1965]]\n\nBy the early 1900s, ice dancing was popular around the world and was primarily a recreational sport, although during the 1920s, local clubs in Britain and the U.S. conducted informal dance contests in waltzes and in marches such as the ten-step, the fourteen-step, and the killian, which were the only three dances used in competition until the 1930s.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2>Hines (2006), p. 124</ref>  Recreational skating became more popular during the 1930s in England, and new and more difficult set-pattern dances, which later were used in compulsory dances during competitions, were developed.<ref>Kestnbaum, p. 222</ref>  Hines stated that the development of new ice dances was necessary to expand upon the three dances already developed; three British teams\u2014[[Erik van der Wyden]] and [[Eva Keats]], [[Reginald Wilkie]] and [[Daphne B. Wallis]], and [[Robert Dench]] and [[Rosemarie Stewart]]\u2014created one-fourth of the dances used in [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) competitions by 2006.  In 1933, the Westminster Skating Club conducted a competition encouraging the creation of new dances.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 123\u2014124</ref>  Beginning in the mid-1930s, national organizations began to introduce skating proficiency tests in set-pattern dances, improve the judging of dance tests, and oversee competitions.  The first national competitions occurred in England in 1934, Canada in 1935, the U.S. in 1936, and Austria in 1937.  These competitions included one or more compulsory dances, the original dance, and the free dance.<ref name=\"elton-2\">Elton, p. 2</ref><ref>Kestnbaum, pp. 222</ref><ref name=\"hines2011-102\">Hines (2011), p. 102</ref>  By the late 1930s, ice dancers swelled memberships in skating clubs throughout the world, and as Hines stated, \"became the backbone of skating clubs\".<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nThe ISU began to develop rules, standards, and international tests for ice dance in the 1950s.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\">Kestnbaum, p. 223</ref>  The first international ice dancing competition occurred as a special event at the [[1950 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships in 1950]] in London; [[Lois Waring]] and [[Michael McGean]] of the U.S. won the event, much to the embarrassment of the British, who considered themselves the best ice dancers in the world.<ref>Hines (2006), pp. 173\u2014174</ref>  A second event was planned the following year, at the [[1951 World Figure Skating Championships|1951 World Championships]] in Milan; [[Jean Westwood (figure skater)|Jean Westwood]] and [[Lawrence Demmy]] of Great Britain came in first place.<ref name=\"hines2006-174\" />  Ice dance, with the CD and FD segments, was formally added to the [[1952 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships in 1952]].<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\"/>  Westwood and Demmy won the first championship; they went on to dominate ice dancing and win the next four World Championships.<ref name=\"hines2011-102\"/><ref name=\"hines2006-174\">Hines (2006), p. 174</ref>  British teams dominated ice dance throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, winning 12 out of the first 16 championships.<ref name=\"elton-2\"/>  [[Eva Romanova]] and [[Pavel Roman]] of Czechoslovakia were the first non-British ice dancers to win a world title, in 1962.<ref>Hines (2011), p.xxxi</ref>\n\n===1970s to 1990s===\nIce dance became an Olympic sport in 1976; [[Lyudmila Pakhomova]] and [[Aleksandr Gorshkov (figure skater)|Alexandr Gorshkov]] from the Soviet Union were the first gold medalists.<ref name=\"kestnbaum-223\"/><ref name=\"hines2011-xxvi\">Hines (2011), p. xxvi</ref><ref name=\"russell\">{{cite news |last1=Russell |first1=Susan D. |title=Lyudmila Pakhomova and Aleksandr Gorshkov: The Heroes of Olympic Ice Dance |url=http://www.ifsmagazine.com/articles/32605-lyudmila-pakhomova-and-aleksandr-gorshkov |accessdate=20 August 2018 |work=International Figure Skating |date=5 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234703/http://www.ifsmagazine.com/articles/32605-lyudmila-pakhomova-and-aleksandr-gorshkov |archive-date=2016-03-03 }}</ref>  The Soviets dominated ice dancing during most of the 1970s; as they did in pair skating, they won every Worlds and Olympic title between 1970 and 1978, and won medals at every competition between 1976 and 1982.<ref>Hines (2006), p. 217, 218</ref>  In 1984, British dancers [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]], who Hines called \"the greatest ice dancers in the history of the sport\",<ref>Hines (2006), p. 240</ref> briefly interrupted Soviet domination of ice dance by \"famously winning the Olympic gold medal\"<ref name=\"elton-2\"/> at the [[1984 Winter Olympics|Olympic Games in Sarajevo]], with their free dance to [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'',<ref name=\"elton-2\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=1984: British ice couple score Olympic gold |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_4156000/4156053.stm |accessdate=11 January 2020 |work=BBC |date=14 February 1984}}</ref> which has been called \"probably the most well known single program in the history of ice dance\".<ref name=\"kestnbaum-228\">Kestnbaum, p. 228</ref>  Hines stated, about Torvill and Dean, that they dramatically altered \"established concepts of ice dancing\"<ref>Hines (2006), p. 239</ref> with their innovative choreography.\n\n[[File:Jayne_Torvill_and_Christopher_Dean_-_Dancing_on_Ice_2011.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|[[Torvill and Dean]] performing in 2011]]\n\nThroughout the 1970s, there was a movement in ice dance away from its ballroom roots to a more theatrical style.
