This small area is essentially a narrow strip of high ground surrounded by swamps, marshland, bayous and bays, and prior to the discovery of crude oil deposits in the 1930s, seafood and trapping were its foremost industries.\u00a0Near this time, the small platform encampment called \u201cManila Village\u201d was developed by a Filipino man named Jacinto Quintin de la Cruz. It was located along the northern shore of Barataria Bay just west Bayou Dupont. In 1900, Jules Fisher was living with his brother Isidore and his family, both working as \u201cgrocers.\u201d\u00a0It is not known when Fisher came to possess Manila Village and its shrimp drying operation, but in 1896 Fisher is quoted at length by the newspaper, describing in great detail the shrimp drying operations by \u201cChinamen\u201d in the Barataria area. By 1910 it is clear that Jules Fisher was the owner of \u201cFisher Shrimp Company\u201d at the encampment of Manila Village.\n\nShrimp and wildlife were a very big part of the Fisher family.\u00a0In 1925, Jules Fisher was the President of the Louisiana Fur Industries. At the time of his death in 1926, his brother Isidore owned and operated a large seafood canning plant.\u00a0Manila Village prospered throughout the time that Jules Fisher owned it, which was up to his death in 1943.\u00a0But a little more than 20 years later, Hurricane Betsy completely destroyed Manila Village in 1965, and it was never redeveloped.\n\n== Death ==\nJules Gabriel Fisher died at his home in New Orleans on Octavia Street on May 14, 1943.\u00a0The funeral was held at Tharp-Sontheimer-Tharp Funeral Home at Claiborne Avenue and Milan, and religious services were held at the Gates of Prayer Temple on Napoleon Avenue. Fisher was interred in a plot with his son at the Gates of Prayer Cemetery No. 2 on Joseph Street in New Orleans. Two years later, his wife would also be interred in the same plot.\n\n== Religion and Immigration ==\nIt is apparent that Jules Fisher and his family were Jewish as both his marital and funeral services were held in Hebrew temples, in 1900 and 1943.\u00a0 Every member of his immediate household is interred in a Hebrew cemetery associated with the Gates of Prayer temple.\u00a0 According to the temple:\u00a0 \u201cCongregation Gates of Prayer is the oldest ongoing congregation in Greater New Orleans, established on January 6, 1850. The founders of the congregation, some of whose descendants are members of the congregation to this day, were primarily German Jews from the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. They were escaping from the terrible conditions that existed during the Franco-Prussian Wars.\u201d Fisher\u2019s grandfather and grandmother did indeed arrive in New Orleans in 1849 from France at the time of the Franco-Prussian wars when the temple was founded.\u00a0 Thus, it is likely that the Fisher family immigrated to New Orleans due to these circumstances.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe only public high school in the Lafitte area is Fisher Middle-High School, which was named for Jules Fisher.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{improve categories|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:1874 births]]\n[[Category:1943 deaths]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fisher, Jules}}\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=April 2020}}\n{{Orphan|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n'''Jules Gabriel Fisher''' (Apr 15, 1874 \u2013 May 14, 1943) was a Louisiana State Senator from Barataria, Louisiana, serving from 1924 to 1943.\u00a0Fisher became the owner of a major shrimp processing facility known as \u201cManila Village,\u201d located in Barataria Bay between Grand Isle and Lafitte and west of [[Port Sulphur]], Louisiana.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/readex/doc|title=J.Q. de la Cruz, Manila Village's Founder, Buried|date=Jan  15, 1936|work=Times Picayune|access-date=Apr 19, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\u00a0For many years, this camp village on stilts served as his part-time residence.\u00a0Fisher was a elected to the Jefferson Parish Police Jury and served as its President, was a delegate on the Louisiana State Constitution Committee, and was a dean of the State Senate when he died at the age of 69.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.genealogybank.com/doc/newspapers|title=Jules G.

In 1929, Huey Long was brought up on impeachment charges.

This small area is essentially a narrow strip of high ground surrounded by swamps, marshland, bayous and bays, and prior to the discovery of crude oil deposits in the 1930s, seafood and trapping were its foremost industries.\u00a0Near this time, the small platform encampment called \u201cManila Village\u201d was developed by a Filipino man named Jacinto Quintin de la Cruz. It was located along the northern shore of Barataria Bay just west Bayou Dupont. In 1900, Jules Fisher was living with his brother Isidore and his family, both working as \u201cgrocers.\u201d\u00a0It is not known when Fisher came to possess Manila Village and its shrimp drying operation, but in 1896 Fisher is quoted at length by the newspaper, describing in great detail the shrimp drying operations by \u201cChinamen\u201d in the Barataria area. By 1910 it is clear that Jules Fisher was the owner of \u201cFisher Shrimp Company\u201d at the encampment of Manila Village.\n\nShrimp and wildlife were a very big part of the Fisher family.\u00a0In 1925, Jules Fisher was the President of the Louisiana Fur Industries. At the time of his death in 1926, his brother Isidore owned and operated a large seafood canning plant.\u00a0Manila Village prospered throughout the time that Jules Fisher owned it, which was up to his death in 1943.\u00a0But a little more than 20 years later, Hurricane Betsy completely destroyed Manila Village in 1965, and it was never redeveloped.\n\n== Death ==\nJules Gabriel Fisher died at his home in New Orleans on Octavia Street on May 14, 1943.\u00a0The funeral was held at Tharp-Sontheimer-Tharp Funeral Home at Claiborne Avenue and Milan, and religious services were held at the Gates of Prayer Temple on Napoleon Avenue. Fisher was interred in a plot with his son at the Gates of Prayer Cemetery No. 2 on Joseph Street in New Orleans. Two years later, his wife would also be interred in the same plot.\n\n== Religion and Immigration ==\nIt is apparent that Jules Fisher and his family were Jewish as both his marital and funeral services were held in Hebrew temples, in 1900 and 1943.\u00a0 Every member of his immediate household is interred in a Hebrew cemetery associated with the Gates of Prayer temple.\u00a0 According to the temple:\u00a0 \u201cCongregation Gates of Prayer is the oldest ongoing congregation in Greater New Orleans, established on January 6, 1850. The founders of the congregation, some of whose descendants are members of the congregation to this day, were primarily German Jews from the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. They were escaping from the terrible conditions that existed during the Franco-Prussian Wars.\u201d Fisher\u2019s grandfather and grandmother did indeed arrive in New Orleans in 1849 from France at the time of the Franco-Prussian wars when the temple was founded.\u00a0 Thus, it is likely that the Fisher family immigrated to New Orleans due to these circumstances.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe only public high school in the Lafitte area is Fisher Middle-High School, which was named for Jules Fisher.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{improve categories|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:1874 births]]\n[[Category:1943 deaths]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fisher, Jules}}\n", "name_user": "Racer24ksi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePolitical Career:corrected date code on citation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_G._Fisher"}

English, 18th and early 19th C.]]\n[[Image:Tinderbox.jpg|thumb|Pocket tinderbox with firesteel and flint, this type was used during the Boer War due to a scarcity of matches]]\n\nA '''tinderbox''' is a container made of wood or metal containing [[flint]], [[firesteel]], and [[tinder]] (typically [[char cloth|charcloth]], but possibly a small quantity of dry, finely divided fibrous matter such as hemp), used together to help kindle a [[fire]]. They might also contain sulfur-tipped [[match]]es.\n\nTinderboxes fell out of general usage when friction matches were invented.\n\n== History and use ==\n\nThroughout prehistoric Europe [[flint]] and iron [[pyrites]] (commonly known as fool's gold) were struck against one another in order to create a spark for firelighting. As an example, [[\u00d6tzi]] was found with [[tinder fungus]] along with flint and pyrite for creating sparks.\n\nWith the development of iron ore smelting in the [[iron age]], the firesteel eventually replaced pyrites.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA272&dq=%22tinder+box%22 | title = The Jesuit relations and allied ... - Jesuits | publisher = Google Books |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref> This was simply a piece of [[carbon steel]] (it is difficult to obtain sparks with ordinary [[iron]]), which was usually wrought into a 'D' shape, or an oval ring, so that it could be conveniently looped around two or three fingers for striking. The flint was sometimes chipped to provide a suitably sharp edge to obtain a spark and if necessary other hard stones, such as [[quartzite]], [[chert]] or [[chalcedony]] could be substituted.<ref>Mors Kochanski, ''Bushcraft: Outdoor Skills and Wilderness Survival'' (Edmonton: Lone Pine Publishing, 1987), p. 16</ref>\n\n\nThe [[char cloth|charcloth]] was fabric made from vegetable fibre (e.g. [[cotton]], [[linen]], or [[jute]]) which had previously been charred via [[pyrolysis]], giving it the low ignition temperature and slow burning characteristics suitable for use as [[tinder]]. Rotten wood, known as [[touchwood]], was also used, as well as [[amadou]], which was a tinder prepared from fungus steeped in potassium nitrate ([[saltpetre]]) and dried.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5oDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA196&dq=%22tinder+box%22 | title = An encyclop\u0107dia of domestic economy ... - Thomas Webster, Mrs. William Parkes | publisher = Google Books | accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn use the flint was struck in a vigorous downward motion against the steel, sending a shower of sparks into the tinder which was arranged in the bottom of the box. The sparks (actually pieces of burning steel broken off by the harder flint) created very small embers as they fell onto the charcloth, the glow of which, with some gentle blowing, would be enough to ignite a [[sulfur]] tipped wooden splint. The splint could then be carried to a candle, often set in a holder on the top of the box, and finally the cloth would be extinguished with a damper to preserve it for further use.<ref name=\"Old Implements\">Seymour Lindsay, J. (1927). ''Iron And Brass Implements Of The English House'', part iii. Reprinted Alec Tiranti 1970. {{ISBN|0854589996}}</ref> With skill, a fire could be started in under a minute, but at other times it took longer and occasionally a tiny pinch of [[gunpowder]] was added to encourage the process.<ref name=\"Old West Surrey\"/>\n\n[[File:Wooden_tinderbox_with_fire_steel_and_flint.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden tinderbox with separate compartments for the firesteel, flint etc. and tinder.

English, 18th and early 19th C.]]\n[[Image:Tinderbox.jpg|thumb|Pocket tinderbox with firesteel and flint, this type was used during the Boer War due to a scarcity of matches]]\n\nA '''tinderbox''' is a container made of wood or metal containing [[flint]], [[firesteel]], and [[tinder]] (typically [[char cloth|charcloth]], but possibly a small quantity of dry, finely divided fibrous matter such as hemp), used together to help kindle a [[fire]]. They might also contain sulfur-tipped [[match]]es.\n\nTinderboxes fell out of general usage when friction matches were invented.\n\n== History and use ==\n\nThroughout prehistoric Europe [[flint]] and iron [[pyrites]] (commonly known as fool's gold) were struck against one another in order to create a spark for firelighting. As an example, [[\u00d6tzi]] was found with [[tinder fungus]] along with flint and pyrite for creating sparks.\n\nWith the development of iron ore smelting in the [[iron age]], the firesteel eventually replaced pyrites.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA272&dq=%22tinder+box%22 | title = The Jesuit relations and allied ... - Jesuits | publisher = Google Books |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref> This was simply a piece of [[carbon steel]] (it is difficult to obtain sparks with ordinary [[iron]]), which was usually wrought into a 'D' shape, or an oval ring, so that it could be conveniently looped around two or three fingers for striking. The flint was sometimes chipped to provide a suitably sharp edge to obtain a spark and if necessary other hard stones, such as [[quartzite]], [[chert]] or [[chalcedony]] could be substituted.<ref>Mors Kochanski, ''Bushcraft: Outdoor Skills and Wilderness Survival'' (Edmonton: Lone Pine Publishing, 1987), p. 16</ref>\n\n\nThe [[char cloth|charcloth]] was fabric made from vegetable fibre (e.g. [[cotton]], [[linen]], or [[jute]]) which had previously been charred via [[pyrolysis]], giving it the low ignition temperature and slow burning characteristics suitable for use as [[tinder]]. Rotten wood, known as 'touchwood' was also used, as well as [[amadou]], which was a tinder prepared from fungus steeped in potassium nitrate ([[saltpetre]]) and dried.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5oDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA196&dq=%22tinder+box%22 | title = An encyclop\u0107dia of domestic economy ... - Thomas Webster, Mrs. William Parkes | publisher = Google Books | accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn use the flint was struck in a vigorous downward motion against the steel, sending a shower of sparks into the tinder which was arranged in the bottom of the box. The sparks (actually pieces of burning steel broken off by the harder flint) created very small embers as they fell onto the charcloth, the glow of which, with some gentle blowing, would be enough to ignite a [[sulfur]] tipped wooden splint. The splint could then be carried to a candle, often set in a holder on the top of the box, and finally the cloth would be extinguished with a damper to preserve it for further use.<ref name=\"Old Implements\">Seymour Lindsay, J.
