The championship has always been played on a regional basis, whereby the respective champions from the Mid, North, South and West championships contest the county series of games. However, in recent years, the championship has followed the same system as the senior grade in Tipperary. Currently (2018) there are 21 teams in the county championship divided up into 6 groups (3 groups with 4 teams, 3 groups with 3 teams). The top 2 teams of each group qualify for the knock out phase of the championship along with the 4 divisional winners. It is quite common for clubs to progress from their group and also win their respective divisional championship.\n\nThe Tipperary County Championship is an integral part of the wider [[Munster Intermediate Club Hurling Championship|Munster GAA Intermediate Club Hurling Championship]]. The winners of the Tipperary county final join the champions of the other hurling counties to contest the provincial championship.\n\nThe title has been won at least once by 32 different clubs.\n\n[[Se\u00e1n Treacy's GAA (County Tipperary)|Se\u00e1n Treacys]] are the current (2019) title-holders, having beaten [[Kiladangan GAA|Kiladangan]] in the final.\n\n==Roll of honour==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" |\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Team'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winner'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winning Years'''\n!Runners Up\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1\n| [[Newport GAA|Newport]]\n| 3\n| 2016, 2002, \n1989\n|2008,\n2000\n|-\n| [[Silvermines GAA|Silvermines]]\n| 3\n| 2012<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|title=Redemption for Silvermines as Ballina lament poor start champions|date=20 October 2012|publisher=The Nationalist|accessdate=22 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130619220137/http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|archivedate=19 June 2013}}</ref>1999,\n\n1972\n|1994,\n1987\n|-\n|\n| [[Moyne-Templetuohy GAA|Moyne-Templetuohy]]\n| 2\n| 2014,\n1983\n|2013,\n2004,\n\n2001\n|-\n|\n|[[Burgess GAA|Burgess]]\n| 2\n| 2005,\n1993\n|2003,\n1992\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2\n|[[Templederry Kenyons GAA|Templederry Kenyons]]\n| 2\n| 2008, 2000\n|1999\n|-\n|[[Borrisokane GAA|Borrisokane]]\n| 2\n| 2010,\n1982\n|\n|-\n| [[\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty GAA|\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty]]\n| 2\n| 2006,\n1994\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"26\" |3\n|[[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n|1\n|2018\n|2016,\n\n2015,\n\n2014,\n\n1989\n|-\n| [[Kildangan GAA (Tipperary)|Kildangan]]\n| 1\n| 2004\n|1980,\n2002,\n\n2019\n|-\n|[[Arravale Rovers GAA|Arravale Rovers]]\n| 1\n| 1997\n|2009,\n1991,\n\n1988\n|-\n|[[Gortnahoe-Glengoole GAA|Gortnahoe-Glengoole]]\n| 1\n| 1988\n|2017,\n2011,\n\n2010\n|-\n|[[J.K.

[[hurling]] competition organised by the [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary County Board]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] since 1979 for the third-tier hurling teams in the county of [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] in Ireland.\n\nThe series of games are played during the summer and autumn months with the county final currently being played at [[Semple Stadium]] in October. The championship has always been played on a regional basis, whereby the respective champions from the Mid, North, South and West championships contest the county series of games. However, in recent years, the championship has followed the same system as the senior grade in Tipperary. Currently (2018) there are 21 teams in the county championship divided up into 6 groups (3 groups with 4 teams, 3 groups with 3 teams). The top 2 teams of each group qualify for the knock out phase of the championship along with the 4 divisional winners. It is quite common for clubs to progress from their group and also win their respective divisional championship.\n\nThe Tipperary County Championship is an integral part of the wider [[Munster Intermediate Club Hurling Championship|Munster GAA Intermediate Club Hurling Championship]]. The winners of the Tipperary county final join the champions of the other hurling counties to contest the provincial championship.\n\nThe title has been won at least once by 31 different clubs.\n\n[[St Mary's Clonmel]] are the current (2017) title-holders, having beaten [[Gortnahoe-Glengoole GAA|Gortnahoe-Glengoole]] in the final.\n\n==Roll of honour==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" |\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Team'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winner'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winning Years'''\n!Runners Up\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1\n| [[Newport GAA|Newport]]\n| 3\n| 2016, 2002, \n1989\n|2008,\n2000\n|-\n| [[Silvermines GAA|Silvermines]]\n| 3\n| 2012<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|title=Redemption for Silvermines as Ballina lament poor start champions|date=20 October 2012|publisher=The Nationalist|accessdate=22 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130619220137/http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|archivedate=19 June 2013}}</ref>1999,\n\n1972\n|1994,\n1987\n|-\n|\n| [[Moyne-Templetuohy GAA|Moyne-Templetuohy]]\n| 2\n| 2014,\n1983\n|2013,\n2004,\n\n2001\n|-\n|\n|[[Burgess GAA|Burgess]]\n| 2\n| 2005,\n1993\n|2003,\n1992\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2\n|[[Templederry Kenyons GAA|Templederry Kenyons]]\n| 2\n| 2008, 2000\n|1999\n|-\n|[[Borrisokane GAA|Borrisokane]]\n| 2\n| 2010,\n1982\n|\n|-\n| [[\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty GAA|\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty]]\n| 2\n| 2006,\n1994\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"26\" |3\n|[[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n|1\n|2018\n|2016,\n\n2015,\n\n2014,\n\n1989\n|-\n| [[Kildangan GAA (Tipperary)|Kildangan]]\n| 1\n| 2004\n|1980,\n2002,\n\n2019\n|-\n|[[Arravale Rovers GAA|Arravale Rovers]]\n| 1\n| 1997\n|2009,\n1991,\n\n1988\n|-\n|[[Gortnahoe-Glengoole GAA|Gortnahoe-Glengoole]]\n| 1\n| 1988\n|2017,\n2011,\n\n2010\n|-\n|[[J.K.

Its only broadcast was in [[Japan]] on December 16, 1997. In the episode, [[Ash Ketchum|Ash]] and his friends find at the local [[Pok\u00e9mon Center]] that there is something wrong with the [[Pok\u00e9 Ball]] transmitting device. To find out what is wrong, they must go inside the machine.\n\nThe episode contained repetitive visual effects that induced [[photosensitive epilepsy|photosensitive epileptic]] [[seizure]]s in a substantial number of Japanese viewers, an incident referred to as the {{nihongo|\"Pok\u00e9mon Shock\"|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af|Pok\u00e9mon Shokku|}} by the Japanese press. As a result of the seizures 685 viewers were taken to hospitals; two remained hospitalized for more than two weeks. Due to this, the episode has not been [[Pok\u00e9mon episodes removed from rotation|rebroadcast]] worldwide. After the incident, the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime went into a four-month [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]], removing the TV Tokyo red circle logo and the \u30c1\u30e5\u30b7! text from the Japanese anime, Pok\u00e9mon Season 1: Indigo League Opening Credits & Ending Credits, the opening animation was redone, removing the white flash from the Dare da? segment, rerun the first 37 episodes of Pok\u00e9mon Season 1: Indigo League on Kids Station in Tokyo, Japan, and it returned on [[TV Tokyo]] on April 16, 1998. Since then, the episode has been parodied and referenced in cultural media, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]]\" and the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Chinpokomon]]\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ash Ketchum|Ash]], [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]], [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]] and [[Pikachu]] discover that the system used to transfer Pok\u00e9mon from one Pok\u00e9mon Center to the other is malfunctioning. On [[List of Pok\u00e9mon anime characters#Nurse Joy|Nurse Joy]]'s request, they go to Professor Akihabara, the one who created the Pok\u00e9 Ball transfer system. He tells them that [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]] stole his prototype [[Porygon]], a digital Pok\u00e9mon that can exist in [[cyberspace]], and is using it to steal trainers' Pok\u00e9mon from inside the computer system.\n\nAkihabara sends Ash, Misty, Brock, Pikachu and his second Porygon into the system to stop Team Rocket, whom they learn have set up a blockade that stops Pok\u00e9balls from traveling the network. Porygon is able to defeat Team Rocket's Porygon, but Nurse Joy, monitoring the situation and unaware that Ash and the others are inside, has sent an anti-virus program into the system to combat the [[computer virus]] Team Rocket set up.

In May 1833, he travelled to Berlin, meeting such surgeons as [[Karl Ferdinand von Graefe]], [[Johann Nepomuk Rust]] and [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] at the [[University of Berlin]]. Professor [[Bernhard von Langenbeck]] taught Pirogov how to properly use the [[scalpel]]. Pirogov also visited the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] and on his return served as a professor at his alma matter (1836\u20141840).<ref name=r1/>\n\n===Years as doctor and field surgeon===\nIn October 1840, Pirogov took up an appointment as professor of surgery at the [[S.M. Kirov Military Medical Academy|Imperial Academy of Military Medicine]] in [[Saint Petersburg]],<ref name=r1/> and undertook three years of military service in this period. He first used [[diethyl ether|ether]] as an [[anaesthetic]] in 1847, and investigated [[cholera]] from 1848. Around this time he compiled his anatomical atlas, ''Topographical anatomy of the human body'' (vol. 1\u20134, 1851\u20131854).\n\n[[File:\u0421\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c, 1855.jpg|upright|thumb|Russian Sisters of Mercy in the Crimea, 1854-1855]]\nHe worked as an army surgeon in the [[Crimean War]], arriving in [[Simferopol]] on December 11, 1854.

He was also the first to use anesthesia in the field, particularly during the siege of [[Sevastopol]], and he introduced a system of [[triage]] into five categories.

Same year he bought an estate in the Vishnya village near [[Vinnytsia]].\n\nIn 1862, he took charge of a delegation of Russian students sent overseas to prepare for professorship. He lived in [[Heidelberg]] and at one point treated [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s injury sustained at [[Aspromonte]] on 28 August. In 1866 upon return to Russia he settled down at his estate, treating local peasants and establishing a free clinic.<ref name=\"r1\" />\n\nIn 1870 he visited the battlefields and field hospitals of the [[Franco\u2013Prussian War]] as a representative of the Russian [[Red Cross]], and in 1877\u20141878 spent several months working as a field surgeon during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War]], treating both Russian and [[Bulgaria]]n soldiers and organizing field hospitals. In 1879 he published The Old Physician's Diary and \"Questions of Life\".<ref name=\"r1\" />\n\nHe last appeared in public on 24 May 1881 and died later that year at his Vishnya estate, [[Podolian Governorate]] (modern-day Vinnytsia, [[Ukraine]]). His body is preserved using [[embalming]] techniques he himself developed, and rests in a church in Vinnytsia. Compared to the corpse of [[Lenin]], which undergoes thorough maintenance in a special underground clinic twice a week, the body of Pirogov rests untouched and unchanging: it is said that only dust has to be brushed off of it. It resides at room temperature in a glass-lid coffin (while Lenin's body is preserved at a constant low temperature).\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:1960 CPA 2504.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet 1960 stamp, published during his 150th anniversary]]\n\nNikolay Pirogov was from 1847 corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and received in 1844, 1851 and 1860 the [[Demidov Prize]] by the academy. He was appointed honorary citizen of Moscow in 1881. The Pirogov Society was founded four years after his death, which aims for better medical training and treatment in Russia.\n\nThe Pirogov Museum is located in Vinnytsia, Ukraine at his former estate and clinic. Near this 1947 building is a [[mausoleum]] which is used as a family chapel and in which his embalmed body is visible in public.

The medical universities [[Russian National Research Medical University]] and [[Odessa State Medical University]] were formerly named after him, until the [[1917 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution]]; [[Vinnytsia Medical University]] was named after N. Pirogov in 1960. Stamps with his portrait were published in the Soviet Union in 1949 and his 150th anniversary in 1960. The highest humanitarian prize in the Soviet Union was the Pirogov Gold Medal.\n\nApart from his developed foot amputation techniques, several anatomical structures were named after him, such as the [[Pirogoff angle]]; the [[Pirogoff aponeurosis]], a structure from [[fascia]] and the [[aponeurosis]] of the [[biceps]]; the [[Pirogoff triangle]], a triangular area located between the [[mylohyoid muscle]], the intermediate [[tendon]] of the [[musculus digastricus]] and the [[hypoglossal nerve]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book|url=http://runeberg.org/nfca/0518.html|title=Nordisk Familjebok.

Around this time he compiled his anatomical atlas, ''Topographical anatomy of the human body'' (vol. 1\u20134, 1851\u20131854).\n\n[[File:\u0421\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c, 1855.jpg|upright|thumb|Russian Sisters of Mercy in the Crimea, 1854-1855]]\nHe worked as an army surgeon in the [[Crimean War]], arriving in [[Simferopol]] on December 11, 1854.  From his works in the Crimea, he is considered to be the father of field surgery.  He followed work by [[Louis-Joseph Seutin]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu-brugmann.be/fr/histo/seutin.asp|title=Louis Seutin (1793\u20131862)|publisher=Brugmann|language=french}}</ref> in introducing [[Orthopedic cast|plaster cast]]s for setting broken bones, and developed a new [[Osteoplasty|osteoplastic]] method for [[amputation]] of the foot, known as the \"Pirogov amputation\".  He was also the first to use anesthesia in the field, particularly during the siege of [[Sevastopol]], and he introduced a system of [[triage]] into five categories. He encouraged female volunteers as an organised corps of nurses, the [[Khrestovozdvizhenskaya]] ([[:ru:\u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0451\u0440 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f|ru]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encblago.lfond.spb.ru/showObject.do?object=2824182532|title= Exaltation of the Holy Cross Community of Sisters of Charity|language=russian}}</ref> at the Saint Petersburg Charity Encyclopedia community of nurses established by [[Grand Duchess Yelena Pavlovna]] in 1854<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2492652?seq=1 Russian Sisters of Mercy in the Crimea, 1854-1855]</ref>, after the Crimean War [[Florence Nightingale]] laid the foundations of professional nursing for the British.\n\n===Return and retirement===\n[[File:Ilya Repin Portrait of the Surgeon Nikolay Pirogov 1881.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Nikolay Pirogov by [[Ilya Repin]], 1881]]\nIn 1856 after the end of war he returned to Saint Petersburg and withdrew from the academy following the suggestion to work as a superintendent of schools of the Odessa Educational District which united several governorates.<ref name='shtreich' /> He wrote an influential paper on the problems of [[pedagogy]], arguing for the [[universal education|education]] of the poor, non-Russians, and women. (He was influential in his family's decision to educate his niece [[Henriette Saloz-Joudra|Henriette Joudra]] who would go on to earn her medical doctorate and become the first woman to open a private medical practice in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://100elles.ch/biographies/henriette-saloz-joudra/|title=Henriette SALOZ-JOUDRA|website=100 Elles*|language=fr-CH|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nHe also argued against early specialisation, and for the development of [[secondary school]]s. In 1858 he received the rank of [[Privy Councillor (Russia)|Privy Councillor]] and was transferred to [[Kiev]] as a superintendent of schools of the Kiev Educational District after disagreements with the Odessa governor general.<ref name='shtreich' /> In 1861 he became a member of the Main Directorate of Schools, serving at the [[Ministry of National Education (Russian Empire)|Ministry of National Education]] up until his death. Same year he bought an estate in the Vishnya village near [[Vinnytsia]].\n\nIn 1862, he took charge of a delegation of Russian students sent overseas to prepare for professorship. He lived in [[Heidelberg]] and at one point treated [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s injury sustained at [[Aspromonte]] on 28 August. In 1866 upon return to Russia he settled down at his estate, treating local peasants and establishing a free clinic, visited by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].<ref name=\"r1\" />\n\nIn 1870 he visited the battlefields and field hospitals of the [[Franco\u2013Prussian War]] as a representative of the Russian [[Red Cross]], and in 1877\u20141878 spent several months working as a field surgeon during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War]], treating both Russian and [[Bulgaria]]n soldiers and organizing field hospitals. In 1879 he published The Old Physician's Diary and \"Questions of Life\".<ref name=\"r1\" />\n\nHe last appeared in public on 24 May 1881 and died later that year at his Vishnya estate, [[Podolian Governorate]] (modern-day Vinnytsia, [[Ukraine]]). His body is preserved using [[embalming]] techniques he himself developed, and rests in a church in Vinnytsia. Compared to the corpse of [[Lenin]], which undergoes thorough maintenance in a special underground clinic twice a week, the body of Pirogov rests untouched and unchanging: it is said that only dust has to be brushed off of it. It resides at room temperature in a glass-lid coffin (while Lenin's body is preserved at a constant low temperature).\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:1960 CPA 2504.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet 1960 stamp, published during his 150th anniversary]]\n\nNikolay Pirogov was from 1847 corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and received in 1844, 1851 and 1860 the [[Demidov Prize]] by the academy. He was appointed honorary citizen of Moscow in 1881. The Pirogov Society was founded four years after his death, which aims for better medical training and treatment in Russia.\n\nThe Pirogov Museum is located in Vinnytsia, Ukraine at his former estate and clinic. Near this 1947 building is a [[mausoleum]] which is used as a family chapel and in which his embalmed body is visible in public.

The medical universities [[Russian National Research Medical University]] and [[Odessa State Medical University]] were formerly named after him, until the [[1917 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution]]; [[Vinnytsia Medical University]] was named after N. Pirogov in 1960. Stamps with his portrait were published in the Soviet Union in 1949 and his 150th anniversary in 1960. The highest humanitarian prize in the Soviet Union was the Pirogov Gold Medal.\n\nApart from his developed foot amputation techniques, several anatomical structures were named after him, such as the [[Pirogoff angle]]; the [[Pirogoff aponeurosis]], a structure from [[fascia]] and the [[aponeurosis]] of the [[biceps]]; the [[Pirogoff triangle]], a triangular area located between the [[mylohyoid muscle]], the intermediate [[tendon]] of the [[musculus digastricus]] and the [[hypoglossal nerve]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book|url=http://runeberg.org/nfca/0518.html|title=Nordisk Familjebok.

{"title_page": "College of West Africa", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=March 2016}}\nThe '''College of West Africa''' is a [[Methodist]] [[high school]] in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]]. The school was opened in 1839 (as the \"Monrovia Seminary\"), making it one of the oldest European-style schools in [[Africa]]. It has produced many of Liberia's leaders. Alumni include Liberian President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], the first woman elected as president in an African state, and Liberian Vice President [[Joseph Boakai]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Melville B. Cox.jpg|thumbnail|Melville B. Cox (1799-1833)]]\n[[File:(1912) College of Westafrica.jpg|thumbnail|Main Building (c.1910)]]\nThe College of West Africa's main building is named in memory of [[Melville B. Cox]], a Methodist missionary from [[Edenton Street United Methodist Church]], who was a founder of the college. A historic [[stained glass]] window in the College's auditorium reads: \"Though a thousand fall, let not Africa be given up\". The Cox family was active in the Methodist Society from its beginning. \n\nIn March 1821 Melville Cox was licensed to preach by the Kennebec District Conference of [[Maine]], United States, and received his first pastoral appointment in 1822. Ill health, however, forced Cox to return to Maine in 1825.<!-- from where? -->\n\nCox moved south in November 1826 to avoid the Maine winter and hopefully recover his health. He preached on and off until 1828, when he married and settled in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. During the next two years he was editor of ''The Itinerant'' in Baltimore. After his wife died in December 1830,  Cox returned to the ministry, although his health was still fragile. \n\nBy mid-1831 Cox had become interested in missions. The Methodist Episcopal Church had formed a Missionary Society in 1819, but no suitable foreign missionary had yet been found. Cox offered himself to Bishop Elijah Hedding for the South American field. Instead, Hedding asked if he would go to Liberia, a colony established on Africa's west coast by the [[American Colonization Society]] for resettlement of free American blacks and newly freed American slaves.\n\nCox sailed from [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on November 6, 1832, arriving in Monrovia on March 8, 1833. He was the first Methodist missionary to Liberia. He envisioned establishing a mission house, a school, a seminary for young Christian converts, and churches. He purchased a house formerly the property of the Basel Missionary Society from [[Switzerland]]. He established the Methodist Church in Liberia as a branch of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in the U.S. He held camp meetings, started regular worship and Sunday school, and developed mission strategies all within a few weeks of his arrival. He contracted [[malaria]] and died of the disease on July 21, 1833 after three months of decline. Such tropical diseases had a high mortality rate among new American settlers to the colony.\n\nCox's story inspired many in the early missions movement. Before he sailed for Liberia, Cox told a friend that should he die in Africa, the friend should write his epitaph. What, asked the friend, should the epitaph say? Cox replied, \"Let a thousand die before Africa be given up.\"\n\n==Other Methodist mission successes==\nIn 1816 the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church institutionalized the course of study for candidates to the ministry. A conference seminary was needed in Liberia to meet this mandate. The Monrovia Seminary was established for this purpose in 1839. (Its program was expanded to preparatory classes and it was later renamed as the College of West Africa in later years.) The Rev. Jabez A. Burton was commissioned as the Seminary's first principal immediately after its establishment; he served until his death in August 1842.\n\nThe Rev. Alexander P. Camphor was appointed principal in 1896. At the end of his first year of administration, he began the re-organization of the seminary to include a high school. In 1897 Camphor presented his plans to the Liberian Annual conference, where he gained a majority vote for the adaptation of the Monrovia Seminary to the College of West Africa. Its charter included the following:  that it be the one central and leading school of all Methodist educational institutions; providing degree-granting courses in ministerial training while also providing a high school education; that dormitory facilities be established for male and female students.\n\nFor the next ten years Rev. Camphor worked to implement this new plan. His first project was construction of the school building that was named the Cox Memorial Auditorium (for Melville B. Cox, in recognition of his mission work.) In 1904, by an act of the [[Liberian Legislature]], the college was officially recognized and confirmed as the College of West Africa.\n\nBy 1925, as a result of personnel and financial difficulties, and political interference, the College was forced to close its collegiate department. It continued to function as a secondary school with the appointment of the Rev. R. L. Embree as its new president. Rev. Embree reorganized the curriculum and programs of the school to continue the college preparatory courses, as a high school. He continued the building project started by Rev. Camphor. As a result of his efforts, ground-breaking ceremonies were held on May 25, 1927. Construction was completed and the building ready for dedication on March 7, 1933.\n\nThe name \u201cCollege of West Africa\u201d was retained because of its charter to serve as a degree-granting institution. It later added a curriculum and classes to grant associate degrees in Business and Finance.\n\nThe school is 100% owned and operated by the Liberian Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church.\n\n==Notable people==\n===Notable alumni===\n{{expand section|date=April 2015}}\n* [[Charles McArthur Emmanuel]], son of [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]]<ref name=\"chucky\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/23/liberia-war-crimes-chucky-taylor |title=The all-American warlord |work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=14 February 2011 |first=Johnny |last=Dwyer |date=23 November 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Y55efpqa?url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/23/liberia-war-crimes-chucky-taylor |archivedate=26 April 2015 }}.
