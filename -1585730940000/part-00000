One recommendation from the commissioners that consolidated the New Zealand statutes, prior to enactment of the Statutes Revision Act 1879 that allowed for their reprinting, was that the criminal law should be codified in a way that suited New Zealand conditions, rather than merely adopting similar legislative changes being debated in 1880 by the English Parliament. A Criminal Code bill was first drafted in 1883 and introduced into the House of Representatives in June that year.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Joint Statutes Revision Committee |title=Statutes Revision Commission: Report on the Criminal Code |url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_bill/ccb188431125.pdf |website=nzlii.org |accessdate=25 January 2020 |date=7 August 1883}}</ref> However, over the next 10 years the bill's passage through the Parliament failed to achieve majority support at various stages, despite repeated introductions and initial support. The bill was finally passed at the end of September 1893 and the Criminal Code Act 1893 received royal assent on 6 October 1893.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Finn |first1=Jeremy |title=Codification of the Criminal Law: the Australasian parliamentary experience. |url=https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/1828/12590980_Codification%20of%20the%20Criminal%20Law.pdf;sequence=1 |website=ir.canterbury.ac.nz |publisher=University of Canterbury |date=2003 |accessdate=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nEnactment of the Consolidated Statutes Enactment Act 1908 on 4 August 1908 resulted in the Criminal Code Act 1893 being consolidated into the Crimes Act 1908. The 1908 Act was further consolidated and amended with the passage of the Crimes Act 1961 on 1 November 1961.<ref name=nzlegislationcrimesact />\n\n===Since 1961===\nThe Crimes Act has been substantially amended since 1961.\n\nAmendments in 1985 resulted in crime of [[rape]] being replaced with one of [[sexual violation]], a similar offence but without gender specificity. Further changes in 2005 resulted in gender specificity being removed from all criminal sexual offences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 128: Sexual violation defined |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329051.html |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPart 10 of the act, ''Crimes against the right of property'', was totally rewritten in 2003.

However, due to growing general public opposition to the death penalty, reformist [[New Zealand National Party]] Minister of Justice [[Ralph Hanan]] and other National MPs exercised a [[conscience vote]] and voted with the abolitionist [[New Zealand Labour Party]] to forbid judges passing sentence of death other than in cases of treason.{{Citation needed|reason=This explanation should have asorce that documents the history of the legislation.|date=January 2019}} That was the functional abolition in New Zealand, with no one executed after this date.

Children aged between 10 and 13 years inclusive have the [[rebuttable presumption]] of incapacity to commit a crime; they cannot be charged unless the prosecution can prove the child knew what they were doing was a criminal offence.\n\nSections 50 and 169 dealt with the [[provocation defence]] which mitigated fatal assaults to the lesser charge and penalty due to [[manslaughter]], rather than [[murder]]. It was abolished through multipartisan consent in 2009, with the exception of the [[ACT New Zealand]] party.{{Citation needed|reason=Normally found in Hansard, or other commentary.|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]] abolished Section 59 of the Crimes Act, which had previously allowed parental [[corporal punishment]] of children, despite opposition from religious social conservatives and others.{{Citation needed|reason=Normally found in commentary on the parliamentary process.|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Crimes against public order (Part 5)==\nIncludes [[treason]] and other crimes against the Queen and the State; offence of oath to commit offence; unlawful assemblies, riots, and breaches of the peace; [[piracy]]; slave dealing; participation in criminal gang; and smuggling and trafficking in people.{{Explain|date=January 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=12%| Section(s) of Act !! width=12%| ANZSOC code !!

This closed a legal loophole which prevented adult females from being convicted of sexual offending against boys under 16.\n\nSection 144A of the Crimes Act deals with New Zealand citizens and ordinary residents that commit acts of [[child sexual abuse]] in overseas jurisdictions through [[child sex tourism]]. It applies existing prohibitions against sexual connection and indecent acts with children under twelve and young people to children within overseas jurisdictions. Under Section 144C, it is also illegal to promote child sex tourism overseas from New Zealand.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Prostitution Law Reform Act 2003]] decriminalised sex work, removing sections 147-149A of the Crimes Act, which had formerly prohibited most forms of [[prostitution in New Zealand]] through maintaining criminal penalties against soliciting, living off the proceeds of sex work, brothel-keeping and managing sex workers.\n\n==Crimes against the person (Part 8)==\n\nIncludes duties tending to the preservation of life; [[homicide]]; [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]]; [[abortion]]; assaults and injuries to the person; [[female genital mutilation]]; bigamy and feigned marriage; and abduction and kidnapping.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=12%| Section(s) of Act !! width=12%| ANZSOC Code<ref>{{cite web |last1=ABS |title=1234.0 - Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC), 2011 |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1234.0Main%20Features12011?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=1234.0&issue=2011 |website=abs.govt.au |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref> !!

A Criminal Code bill was first drafted in 1883 and introduced into the House of Representatives in June that year.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Joint Statutes Revision Committee |title=Statutes Revision Commission: Report on the Criminal Code |url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_bill/ccb188431125.pdf |website=nzlii.org |accessdate=25 January 2020 |date=7 August 1883}}</ref> However, over the next 10 years the bill's passage through the Parliament failed to achieve majority support at various stages, despite repeated introductions and initial support. The bill was finally passed at the end of September 1893 and the Criminal Code Act 1893 received royal assent on 6 October 1893. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Finn |first1=Jeremy |title=Codification of the Criminal Law: the Australasian parliamentary experience. |url=https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/1828/12590980_Codification%20of%20the%20Criminal%20Law.pdf;sequence=1 |website=ir.canterbury.ac.nz |publisher=University of Canterbury |date=2003 |accessdate=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nEnactment of the Consolidated Statutes Enactment Act 1908 on 4 August 1908 resulted in the Criminal Code Act 1893 being consolidated into the Crimes Act 1908. The 1908 Act was further consolidated and amended with the passage of the Crimes Act 1961 on 1 November 1961.<ref name=nzlegislationcrimesact />\n\n===Since 1961===\nThe Crimes Act has been substantially amended since 1961.\n\nAmendments in 1985 resulted in crime of [[rape]] being replaced with one of [[sexual violation]], a similar offence but without gender specificity. Further changes in 2005 resulted in gender specificity being removed from all criminal sexual offences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 128: Sexual violation defined |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM329051.html |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPart 10 of the act, ''Crimes against the right of property'', was totally rewritten in 2003. In doing so, the definition of [[Burglary]] was revised and simplified to only require entry to be unauthorised rather than also requiring an act of breaking.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 231: Burglary |url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM330242.html |website=Legislation New Zealand |publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Counsel Office]] |accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nFamily Violence related amendments in 2018 introduced offences for ''Strangulation'' and ''Assaulting a family member'', which promptly resulted in offenders being prosecuted for their offending.\n\nAn ammendment in 2019 introduced the concept of ''Burglary of agricultural land'' along with increasing penalties for ''Theft of animals'', in response to increasing reports of stock rustling as well as nighttime hunting, slaughtering and butchering of farm animals in roadside fields.\n\n==Punishments (Part 2)==\nSection 14 of the Crimes Act 1961 allowed [[capital punishment in New Zealand|death sentences]]. However, due to growing general public opposition to the death penalty, reformist [[New Zealand National Party]] Minister of Justice [[Ralph Hanan]] and other National MPs exercised a [[conscience vote]] and voted with the abolitionist [[New Zealand Labour Party]] to forbid judges passing sentence of death other than in cases of treason.{{Citation needed|reason=This explanation should have asorce that documents the history of the legislation.|date=January 2019}} That was the functional abolition in New Zealand, with no one executed after this date.

Children aged under 10 years old are assumed incapable of committing a crime and cannot be charged with any crime. Children aged between 10 and 13 years inclusive have the [[rebuttable presumption]] of incapacity to commit a crime; they cannot be charged unless the prosecution can prove the child knew what they were doing was a criminal offence.\n\nSections 50 and 169 dealt with the [[provocation defence]] which mitigated fatal assaults to the lesser charge and penalty due to [[manslaughter]], rather than [[murder]]. It was abolished through multipartisan consent in 2009, with the exception of the [[ACT New Zealand]] party.{{Citation needed|reason=Normally found in Hansard, or other commentary.|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]] abolished Section 59 of the Crimes Act, which had previously allowed parental [[corporal punishment]] of children, despite opposition from religious social conservatives and others.{{Citation needed|reason=Normally found in commentary on the parliamentary process.|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Crimes against public order (Part 5)==\nIncludes [[treason]] and other crimes against the Queen and the State; offence of oath to commit offence; unlawful assemblies, riots, and breaches of the peace; [[piracy]]; slave dealing; participation in criminal gang; and smuggling and trafficking in people.{{Explain|date=January 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=12%| Section(s) of Act !! width=12%| ANZSOC code !!

This closed a legal loophole which prevented adult females from being convicted of sexual offending against boys under 16.\n\nSection 144A of the Crimes Act deals with New Zealand citizens and ordinary residents that commit acts of [[child sexual abuse]] in overseas jurisdictions through [[child sex tourism]]. It applies existing prohibitions against sexual connection and indecent acts with children under twelve and young people to children within overseas jurisdictions. Under Section 144C, it is also illegal to promote child sex tourism overseas from New Zealand.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Prostitution Law Reform Act 2003]] decriminalised sex work, removing sections 147-149A of the Crimes Act, which had formerly prohibited most forms of [[prostitution in New Zealand]] through maintaining criminal penalties against soliciting, living off the proceeds of sex work, brothel-keeping and managing sex workers.\n\n==Crimes against the person (Part 8)==\n\nIncludes duties tending to the preservation of life; [[homicide]]; [[murder]] and [[manslaughter]]; [[abortion]]; assaults and injuries to the person; [[female genital mutilation]]; bigamy and feigned marriage; and abduction and kidnapping.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=12%| Section(s) of Act !! width=12%| ANZSOC Code<ref>{{cite web |last1=ABS |title=1234.0 - Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC), 2011 |url=https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/1234.0Main%20Features12011?opendocument&tabname=Summary&prodno=1234.0&issue=2011 |website=abs.govt.au |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref> !!

It extends from the [[Inner Mongolia]]n [[Plateau]] in China northward into Mongolia. It includes the [[Yin Mountains]] and many low-lying areas with salt pans and small ponds. It is bounded by the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland]] to the north, the Yellow River Plain to the southeast, and the Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the southeast and east.\n* '''Alashan Plateau semi-desert''', lies west and southwest of the Eastern Gobi desert steppe. It consists of the desert basins and low mountains lying between the Gobi Altai range on the north, the [[Helan Mountains]] to the southeast, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and northeastern portion of the Tibetan Plateau on the southwest.\n* '''Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe''', ecoregion lies north of Alashan Plateau semi-desert, between the Gobi Altai range to the south and the [[Khangai Mountains]] to the north.\n* '''[[Dzungarian Basin]] semi-desert''', includes the desert basin lying between the Altai mountains on the north and the [[Tian Shan]] range on the south. It includes the northern portion of China's Xinjiang province and extends into the southeastern corner of Mongolia. The Alashan Plateau semi-desert lies to the east, and the [[Emin Valley steppe]] to the west, on the China-[[Kazakhstan]] border.\n* '''[[Tian Shan range]]''', separates the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert from the [[Taklamakan Desert]], which is a low, sandy desert basin surrounded by the high mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau to the south and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] to the west. The Taklamakan Desert ecoregion includes the [[Desert of Lop]].\n\n===Eastern Gobi desert steppe===\n{{main|Eastern Gobi desert steppe}}\n[[File:Khulan.JPG|thumb|A Khulan ([[Mongolian wild ass]]) on a hill in the eastern Gobi of [[Mongolia]] at sunset.]]\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between [[Ulaanbaatar]] ({{Coord|48|00|N|107|00|E|}}) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor ({{Coord|43|45|N|111|50|E|}}), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation {{convert|150|to|180|m|abbr=on}}), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between {{convert|900|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea-level. Farther south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the [[Yellow River]], comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000\u20131100&nbsp;m and the former at {{convert|1070|to|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep, and are sometimes penetrated by \"bays\" of the lowlands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|1630|m|abbr=on}}. Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|mi|0}} south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated {{convert|2|to|abbr=on|3|m}} deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of [[loess]], {{convert|5|to|6|m|abbr=on}} thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to [[Kalgan]], the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from {{convert|1000|to|1700|m|abbr=on}}, and those of the ranges from {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=on}} higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}. The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens and basins. But the [[Plateaus|tablelands]], built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai ([[Vladimir Obruchev|Obruchev]]'s Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the [[Takla Makan]] and the [[desert of Lop]]. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, ''Kalidium gracile'', [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[saxaul]], ''[[Nitraria]] schoberi'', ''[[Caragana]]'', [[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]], saltwort and the [[Poaceae|grass]] ''[[Lasiagrostis]] splendens''.<ref name=EB1911/> The taana wild onion ''[[Allium]] polyrrhizum'' is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel [[Kumis|airag]] (fermented milk).\n\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]] (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar ({{convert|960|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Jiuquan]] (in [[Gansu]]) to Hami {{convert|670|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; from Hami to Beijing ({{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Hohhot]] to Hami and Barkul; and from [[Lanzhou]] (in Gansu) to Hami.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Alashan Plateau semi-desert===\n{{main|Alashan Plateau semi-desert}}\n[[File:- panoramio - \u6469\u6e38\u4e50 (47).jpg|thumb|[[Alxa Left Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the [[Hetao|Xitao]] and the [[Little Gobi]], fills the space between the great north loop of the [[Yellow River]] on the east, the [[Ejin River]] on the west, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and narrow rocky chain of [[Longshou]], {{convert|3200|to|3500|m|abbr=on}} in altitude, on the southwest. The [[Ordos Desert]], which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n\"Topographically,\" says [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], \"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them ''Tengger'' (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=on}}, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300&nbsp;m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammondendron]]'') and ''[[Agriophyllum gobicum]]''. The others include prickly [[convolvulus]], field wormwood (''[[Artemisia campestris]]''), [[acacia]], ''[[Inula ammophila]]'', ''[[Sophora flavescens]]'', ''[[Convolvulus ammanii]]'', ''[[Peganum]]'' and ''[[Astragalus]]'' species, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, [[Henderson's ground jay]] (''[[Podoces hendersoni]]''), [[horned lark]] (''[[Eremophila alpestris]]''), and [[crested lark]] (''[[Galerida cristata]]'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Dzungarian Basin semi-desert===\n{{quote|The structure here is that of the mighty [[Tian Shan|T'ien Shan]], or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'\u2014that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.<ref>Lattimore (1973), p. 238.</ref>}}\n\nThe Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol ({{Coord|43|N|83|E |region:CN-65}}\u2013{{Coord|43|N|86|E |region:CN-65}}) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with [[Lake Bosten]] in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from [[Lukchun]] ({{convert|130|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level) to [[Hami City|Hami]] ({{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of [[Lop Nur]], the [[Kum-tagh]] desert, and the valley of the [[Bulunzir-gol]]. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the [[Mongols]] give the name of ''[[Ghashuun-Gobi]]'' or \"Salt Desert\". It is some {{convert|130|to|160|km|abbr=on}} across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, {{convert|40|to|80|km|abbr=on}} wide, at an elevation of {{convert|900|to|1370|m|abbr=on}}. The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. The [[hydrography]] of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the highest range on the great swelling [[Grigory Grum-Grshimailo]] gives the name of [[Tuge-tau]], its altitude being {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the level of the sea and some {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the [[Choltagh]] system, whereas [[Sven Hedin]] would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of [[Kharateken-ula]] (also known as the [[Kyzyl-sanghir]], [[Sinir]], and [[Singher Mountains]]), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of [[Ak-bel-kum]] (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 91\u00b0 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the \u00e9cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the [[Pe-shan]] (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] ''(Haloxylon)'', ''[[Anabasis (plant)|anabasis]]'', reeds (kamish), [[tamarisk]]s, [[Populus|poplars]], and [[Ephedra]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century, the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by [[Mongol]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and [[Kazakhs]]. The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, and information was confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert.

It extends from the [[Inner Mongolia]]n [[Plateau]] in China northward into Mongolia. It includes the [[Yin Mountains]] and many low-lying areas with salt pans and small ponds. It is bounded by the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland]] to the north, the Yellow River Plain to the southeast, and the Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the southeast and east.\n* '''Alashan Plateau semi-desert''', lies west and southwest of the Eastern Gobi desert steppe. It consists of the desert basins and low mountains lying between the Gobi Altai range on the north, the [[Helan Mountains]] to the southeast, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and northeastern portion of the Tibetan Plateau on the southwest.\n* '''Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe''', ecoregion lies north of Alashan Plateau semi-desert, between the Gobi Altai range to the south and the [[Khangai Mountains]] to the north.\n* '''[[Dzungarian Basin]] semi-desert''', includes the desert basin lying between the Altai mountains on the north and the [[Tian Shan]] range on the south. It includes the northern portion of China's Xinjiang province and extends into the southeastern corner of Mongolia. The Alashan Plateau semi-desert lies to the east, and the [[Emin Valley steppe]] to the west, on the China-[[Kazakhstan]] border.\n* '''[[Tian Shan range]]''', separates the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert from the [[Taklamakan Desert]], which is a low, sandy desert basin surrounded by the high mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau to the south and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] to the west. The Taklamakan Desert ecoregion includes the [[Desert of Lop]].\n\n===Eastern Gobi desert steppe===\n[[File:Khulan.JPG|thumb|A Khulan ([[Mongolian wild ass]]) on a hill in the eastern Gobi of [[Mongolia]] at sunset.]]\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between [[Ulaanbaatar]] ({{Coord|48|00|N|107|00|E|}}) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor ({{Coord|43|45|N|111|50|E|}}), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation {{convert|150|to|180|m|abbr=on}}), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between {{convert|900|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea-level. Farther south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the [[Yellow River]], comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000\u20131100&nbsp;m and the former at {{convert|1070|to|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep, and are sometimes penetrated by \"bays\" of the lowlands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|1630|m|abbr=on}}. Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|mi|0}} south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated {{convert|2|to|abbr=on|3|m}} deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of [[loess]], {{convert|5|to|6|m|abbr=on}} thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to [[Kalgan]], the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from {{convert|1000|to|1700|m|abbr=on}}, and those of the ranges from {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=on}} higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}. The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens and basins. But the [[Plateaus|tablelands]], built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai ([[Vladimir Obruchev|Obruchev]]'s Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the [[Takla Makan]] and the [[desert of Lop]]. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, ''Kalidium gracile'', [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[saxaul]], ''[[Nitraria]] schoberi'', ''[[Caragana]]'', [[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]], saltwort and the [[Poaceae|grass]] ''[[Lasiagrostis]] splendens''.<ref name=EB1911/> The taana wild onion ''[[Allium]] polyrrhizum'' is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel [[Kumis|airag]] (fermented milk).\n\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]] (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar ({{convert|960|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Jiuquan]] (in [[Gansu]]) to Hami {{convert|670|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; from Hami to Beijing ({{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Hohhot]] to Hami and Barkul; and from [[Lanzhou]] (in Gansu) to Hami.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Alashan Plateau semi-desert===\n{{main|Alashan Plateau semi-desert}}\n[[File:- panoramio - \u6469\u6e38\u4e50 (47).jpg|thumb|[[Alxa Left Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the [[Hetao|Xitao]] and the [[Little Gobi]], fills the space between the great north loop of the [[Yellow River]] on the east, the [[Ejin River]] on the west, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and narrow rocky chain of [[Longshou]], {{convert|3200|to|3500|m|abbr=on}} in altitude, on the southwest. The [[Ordos Desert]], which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n\"Topographically,\" says [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], \"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them ''Tengger'' (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=on}}, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300&nbsp;m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammondendron]]'') and ''[[Agriophyllum gobicum]]''. The others include prickly [[convolvulus]], field wormwood (''[[Artemisia campestris]]''), [[acacia]], ''[[Inula ammophila]]'', ''[[Sophora flavescens]]'', ''[[Convolvulus ammanii]]'', ''[[Peganum]]'' and ''[[Astragalus]]'' species, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, [[Henderson's ground jay]] (''[[Podoces hendersoni]]''), [[horned lark]] (''[[Eremophila alpestris]]''), and [[crested lark]] (''[[Galerida cristata]]'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Dzungarian Basin semi-desert===\n{{quote|The structure here is that of the mighty [[Tian Shan|T'ien Shan]], or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'\u2014that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.<ref>Lattimore (1973), p. 238.</ref>}}\n\nThe Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol ({{Coord|43|N|83|E |region:CN-65}}\u2013{{Coord|43|N|86|E |region:CN-65}}) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with [[Lake Bosten]] in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from [[Lukchun]] ({{convert|130|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level) to [[Hami City|Hami]] ({{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of [[Lop Nur]], the [[Kum-tagh]] desert, and the valley of the [[Bulunzir-gol]]. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the [[Mongols]] give the name of ''[[Ghashuun-Gobi]]'' or \"Salt Desert\". It is some {{convert|130|to|160|km|abbr=on}} across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, {{convert|40|to|80|km|abbr=on}} wide, at an elevation of {{convert|900|to|1370|m|abbr=on}}. The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. The [[hydrography]] of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the highest range on the great swelling [[Grigory Grum-Grshimailo]] gives the name of [[Tuge-tau]], its altitude being {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the level of the sea and some {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the [[Choltagh]] system, whereas [[Sven Hedin]] would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of [[Kharateken-ula]] (also known as the [[Kyzyl-sanghir]], [[Sinir]], and [[Singher Mountains]]), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of [[Ak-bel-kum]] (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 91\u00b0 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the \u00e9cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the [[Pe-shan]] (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] ''(Haloxylon)'', ''[[Anabasis (plant)|anabasis]]'', reeds (kamish), [[tamarisk]]s, [[Populus|poplars]], and [[Ephedra]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century, the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by [[Mongol]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and [[Kazakhs]]. The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, and information was confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert.

It was the eighth race of the [[1993 Formula One World Championship]].\n\nThe 72-lap race was won by home favourite [[Alain Prost]], driving a [[Williams FW15C|Williams]]-[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]], after he started from second position. Prost's English teammate [[Damon Hill]] finished second, having started from [[pole position]] and led the first 26 laps, with German [[Michael Schumacher]] third in a [[Benetton B193|Benetton]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. With Prost's Brazilian rival [[Ayrton Senna]] finishing fourth in his [[McLaren MP4/8|McLaren]]-Ford, Prost extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 12 points.\n\nThe race marked Prost's 100th Formula One podium, making him the first driver to achieve the milestone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statsf1.com/en/statistiques/pilote/podium/chronologie-record.aspx|title=Statistics Drivers - Podiums - Chronology of the record|last=|first=|date=|website=www.statsf1.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> It was also the last Grand Prix for [[Fabrizio Barbazza]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statsf1.com/en/fabrizio-barbazza/engagement.aspx|title=Fabrizio BARBAZZA - Involvement|last=|first=|date=|website=www.statsf1.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n==Report==\n\n===Qualifying===\nWith local hero Prost taking pole in all of the previous seven races, there was a massive turnout for qualifying where the Williams were usually dominant. The Williams did take 1\u20132 in qualifying, but it was Hill who took his first Formula One pole ahead of Prost. The [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] team, in its home race, filled the second row with [[Martin Brundle]] ahead of [[Mark Blundell]], and thus completed a 1-2-3-4 for [[Renault]]-powered cars. [[Ayrton Senna]] in the [[McLaren MP4/8|McLaren]] and [[Jean Alesi]] in the [[Ferrari F93A|Ferrari]] were on the third row, Schumacher in the [[Benetton B193|Benetton]] and [[Rubens Barrichello]] in the [[Jordan 193|Jordan]] made up the fourth, and the [[Larrousse]] team, also contesting its home race, took up the fifth with [[\u00c9rik Comas]] ahead of [[Philippe Alliot]].\n\n===Race===\nAt the start, the top 5 stayed the same while Schumacher got ahead of Alesi. Hill led from Prost, Brundle, Blundell, Senna and Schumacher.\n\nThe Williams pulled away while Brundle pulled away from Blundell who was holding up Senna and Schumacher. However, this ended when Blundell was pushed off the road and into retirement on lap 21 as he attempted to lap de Cesaris. It was time for the mid-race stops during which Prost got ahead of Hill and Senna and Schumacher closed up on Brundle.\n\nDuring the second stops, Prost stayed ahead - just by two-tenths while Senna and Schumacher got ahead of Brundle. Schumacher passed Senna when the two were going through traffic and pulled away. Prost won with Hill right behind to make it a Williams 1-2 ahead of Schumacher, Senna, Brundle and Andretti.\n\nThus, at the halfway stage of the season, Prost led the World Championship with 57 points. Senna was a further 12 points behind in second with 45, Hill was third with 28, Schumacher was fourth with 24, Brundle fifth with 9, Blundell sixth with 6, Herbert seventh with 6 and Lehto eighth with 5. There were no real battles in the Constructors Championship with Williams comfortably leading with 85 points with McLaren 37 points behind in second with 48. Benetton were third with 29 and Ligier were fourth with 15.\n\nFollowing the death of former world champion [[James Hunt]], former British driver [[Jonathan Palmer]] moved from Pit Lane reporter and took Hunt's place in the [[BBC]] commentary booth for the race. Palmer would continue to partner [[Murray Walker]] in the booth until the end of the {{f1|1996}} season.\n\nBy winning the race, Prost became the first Formula One driver to reach 100 career podiums.\n\n==Classification==\n\n===Qualifying===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

It was the eighth race of the [[1993 Formula One World Championship]].\n\nThe 72-lap race was won by home favourite [[Alain Prost]], driving a [[Williams FW15C|Williams]]-[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]], after he started from second position. Prost's English teammate [[Damon Hill]] finished second, having started from [[pole position]] and led the first 26 laps, with German [[Michael Schumacher]] third in a [[Benetton B193|Benetton]]-[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. With Prost's Brazilian rival [[Ayrton Senna]] finishing fourth in his [[McLaren MP4/8|McLaren]]-Ford, Prost extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 12 points.\n\nThe race marked Prost's 100th Formula One podium, making him the first driver to acheive the milestone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statsf1.com/en/statistiques/pilote/podium/chronologie-record.aspx|title=Statistics Drivers - Podiums - Chronology of the record|last=|first=|date=|website=www.statsf1.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> It was also the last Grand Prix for [[Fabrizio Barbazza]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statsf1.com/en/fabrizio-barbazza/engagement.aspx|title=Fabrizio BARBAZZA - Involvement|last=|first=|date=|website=www.statsf1.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>\n\n==Report==\n\n===Qualifying===\nWith local hero Prost taking pole in all of the previous seven races, there was a massive turnout for qualifying where the Williams were usually dominant. The Williams did take 1-2 in qualifying, but it was Hill who took his first Formula One pole ahead of Prost. The [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] team, in its home race, filled the second row with [[Martin Brundle]] ahead of [[Mark Blundell]], and thus completed a 1-2-3-4 for [[Renault]]-powered cars. [[Ayrton Senna]] in the [[McLaren MP4/8|McLaren]] and [[Jean Alesi]] in the [[Ferrari F93A|Ferrari]] were on the third row, Schumacher in the [[Benetton B193|Benetton]] and [[Rubens Barrichello]] in the [[Jordan 193|Jordan]] made up the fourth, and the [[Larrousse]] team, also contesting its home race, took up the fifth with [[\u00c9rik Comas]] ahead of [[Philippe Alliot]].\n\n===Race===\nAt the start, the top 5 stayed the same while Schumacher got ahead of Alesi. Hill led from Prost, Brundle, Blundell, Senna and Schumacher. \n\nThe Williams pulled away while Brundle pulled away from Blundell who was holding up Senna and Schumacher. However, this ended when Blundell was pushed off the road and into retirement on lap 21 as he attempted to lap de Cesaris. It was time for the mid-race stops during which Prost got ahead of Hill and Senna and Schumacher closed up on Brundle. \n\nDuring the second stops, Prost stayed ahead - just by two-tenths while Senna and Schumacher got ahead of Brundle. Schumacher passed Senna when the two were going through traffic and pulled away. Prost won with Hill right behind to make it a Williams 1-2 ahead of Schumacher, Senna, Brundle and Andretti. \n\nThus, at the halfway stage of the season, Prost led the World Championship with 57 points. Senna was a further 12 points behind in second with 45, Hill was third with 28, Schumacher was fourth with 24, Brundle fifth with 9, Blundell sixth with 6, Herbert seventh with 6 and Lehto eighth with 5. There were no real battles in the Constructors Championship with Williams comfortably leading with 85 points with McLaren 37 points behind in second with 48. Benetton were third with 29 and Ligier were fourth with 15.\n\nFollowing the death of former world champion [[James Hunt]], former British driver [[Jonathan Palmer]] moved from Pit Lane reporter and took Hunt's place in the [[BBC]] commentary booth for the race.

He serves as  Director of [[the National Marriage Project]] and Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Virginia]], Senior Fellow at the Institute for Family Studies, and a Visiting Scholar at the [[American Enterprise Institute]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nWilcox was born on August 21, 1970. As an undergraduate, Wilcox was a [[Jefferson Scholars Foundation|Jefferson Scholar]] at the [[University of Virginia]]. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1992.  He graduated with a PhD from [[Princeton University]] in 2001. He held research fellowships at Princeton University, [[Yale University]], and the [[Brookings Institution]] before joining the faculty of the University of Virginia, where he is a Professor of Sociology and director of graduate studies. His sociological research centers on marriage, fatherhood, and cohabitation, particularly on how family structure, civil society, and culture affect the quality and stability of family life, and the ways families shape the economic outcomes of individuals and societies. He teaches undergraduate- and graduate-level courses on statistics, family, and religion.<ref>[http://sociology.virginia.edu/people/faculty/bradford-wilcox%20 University of Virginia, Department of Sociology website]</ref>\n\n==Work==\nWilcox has authored and edited several books, and published numerous articles on marriage, fatherhood, parenting, and religion. His work has appeared in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'', ''[[Social Forces]]'',<ref>[http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/search?submit=yes&pubdate_year=&volume=&firstpage=&doi=&author1=wilcox%2C+bradford&author2=&title=&andorexacttitle=and&titleabstract=&andorexacttitleabs=and&fulltext=&andorexactfulltext=and&fmonth=&fyear=&tmonth=&tyear=&flag=&format=standard&hits=10&sortspec=relevance&submit=yes&submit=Search ''Social Forces'' list of publications]</ref> and ''The Journal of Marriage and Family''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ellison | first1 = C.

As director of the National Marriage Project, Wilcox also oversees the publication of an annual report on marriage in America, entitled ''The State of Our Unions''.<ref>[http://www.stateofourunions.org/ ''State of Our Unions'' website]</ref>\n\n==In the media==\nWilcox's research on marriage, religion, and family life has been featured in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'',<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/technology-and-divorce-a-_n_794643.html Lee, Amy (2010), \"Technology and Divorce: A Correlation?\" ''Huffington Post'']</ref> ''[[National Review Online]]'', ''[[National Journal]]'',<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/the-no-good-very-bad-outlook-for-the-working-class-american-man-20121205 Rauch, Jonathan (2012), \"The No Good, Very Bad Outlook for the Working-Class American Man\" ''National Journal'']</ref> [[National Public Radio]], ''[[CBS Evening News with Katie Couric]]'', NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'', and numerous other media outlets.

His topic was \"The Family in Transition: Should We Be Concerned About Declines in Fertility and Marriage?\"<ref>[http://www.familyperspective.org/act/act-0017-en.php Family Perspective website]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, in February 2015, Wilcox testified before the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Human Resources about the challenges low-income families face in today's economy.<ref>[http://waysandmeans.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=398014 Committee on Ways and Means website]</ref>\n\n==Debate==\nIn July 2012 [[Mark Regnerus]]'s newly published study titled \"How Different Are the Adult Children of Parents Who Have Same-Sex Relationships?

Bradford Wilcox as two of the three anonymous peer reviewers who vetted the scientific methodology of this study.<ref>http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2013/08/02/controversy-continues-over-gay-parenting-study</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIn May 2016, Wilcox narrated a five minute long video lecture for the [[YouTube]] channel [[PragerU]] entitled \"Be a Man. Get Married\" in which he attempts to present an argument as to why marriage is beneficial to men. The video was very poorly received; as of March 2020, the video has received more than twice as many downvotes as upvotes. Wilcox's lecture became a target of ridicule and vitriol via numerous video responses from users who identify as [[Men Going Their Own Way|MGTOW]] or as being part of the Men's Rights movement. Among the criticisms were Wilcox's failure to mention biased family courts that often result in fathers being unjustly cut off from their children as well as divorce settlements that frequently leave men financially ruined.

Get Married\" in which he attempts to present an argument as to why marriage is beneficial to men. The video was very poorly received; as of March 2020, the video has received more than twice as many downvotes as upvotes. Wilcox's lecture became a target of ridicule and vitriol via numerous video responses from users who identify as [[Men Going Their Own Way|MGTOW]] or as being part of the Men's Rights movement. Among the criticisms were Wilcox's failure to mention biased family courts that often result in fathers being unjustly cut off from their children as well as divorce settlements that frequently leave men financially ruined. Wilcox was also accused of being condescending and out of touch regarding the current state of the marriage institution.\n\nWilcox attempted to address the grievances in an article for The Federalist.<ref>http//thefederalist.com/2016/05/19/the-divorce-revolution-has-bred-an-army-of-woman-haters/ </ref>\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n===Books===\n* ''Soft Patriarchs and New Men: How Christianity Shapes Fathers and Husbands'', The University of Chicago Press, 2004\n* ''Gender and Parenthood: Biological and Social Scientific Perspectives'', Columbia University Press, 2013\n* ''Whither the Child?

An immediate impact was felt as he brought in the quality required to challenge. Boris McLaughlin, Buzz Lamont, David Beaton and Iain Gallacher to name a few.\n\nIn season 2001/02 The Rose went on what would become one of the most iconic seasons in the history of the club. Led by Gallacher, Linlithgow won the Final John Walker League Trophy and all but one competition entered. The finale being a 1-0 win over Auchinleck Talbot at Firhill, Glasgow in the Scottish Junior Cup coutesry of Jimmy Creaney.

Season 2003/04 seen The Rose win their first ever East Region Superleague.\n\nSinnet made large changes after two fairly barren seasons and 2006/07 saw the Rose re-installed as Junior champions in a Double winning season, winning the Super League and Scottish Junior Cup. Brian Carrigan and Mark Whyte, in the last minute of Extra time, scored the goals to defeat Kelty Hearts 2-1. The game was played at [[East End Park]] in front of 5,000 Rose fans.\n\nDue to reforms by the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]], Linlithgow Rose took part in the [[2007\u201308 Scottish Cup]]. On 24 November 2007, they beat [[Dalbeattie Star F.C.|Dalbeattie Star]] 1\u20130 in the third round thanks to a goal from Stuart McArthur in the second minute of the game. They progressed into the fourth round where they were drawn against [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]].

However they were knocked out in the next round. Linlithgow in this period were successful in upgrading Prestonfield to enable full SFA license, allowing the team to compete in the Scottish FA cup indefinitely, a path which is no longer available to any club outside the Senior League Setup.\n\nJim Sinnet, who was one of the most successful managers in the club's history, resigned during the 2007\u201308 season.

An immediate impact was felt as he brought in the quality required to challenge. Boris McLaughlin, Buzz Lamont, David Beaton and Iain Gallacher to name a few.\n\nIn season 2001/02 The Rose went on what would become one of the most iconic seasons in the history of the club.

Brian Carrigan and Mark Whyte, in the last minute of Extra time, scored the goals to defeat Kelty Hearts 2-1.

It was formed under the mandate of the 1987 [[Indo-Sri Lankan Accord]] that aimed to end the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] between  [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Sri Lankan Tamil nationalists]] such as the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) and the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|Sri Lankan military]].{{Ref|1}}\n\nThe main task of the IPKF was to disarm the different terrorist groups, not just the LTTE. It was to be quickly followed by the formation of an Interim Administrative Council. These were the tasks as per the terms of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, signed at the behest of Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. Given the escalation of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and with the pouring of refugees into India, Gandhi took the decisive step to push this accord through. The IPKF was inducted into Sri Lanka on the request of Sri Lankan President [[J. R. Jayewardene]] under the terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.<ref name=Hennayake/>\n\nThe force was initially not expected to be involved in any significant combat by the [[Indian Armed Forces#Organization and command structure|Indian High Command]].<ref name=dixitrediff/> However, within a few months, the IPKF became embroiled in battle with the LTTE to enforce peace. The differences started with LTTE trying to dominate the Interim Administrative Council, and also refusing to disarm, which was a pre-condition to enforce peace in the island. Soon, these differences led to the LTTE attacking the IPKF, at which point the IPKF decided to disarm the LTTE militants, by force if required. In the two years it was in northern Sri Lanka, the IPKF launched a number of combat operations aimed at destroying the LTTE-led insurgency. It soon escalated into repeated skirmishes between the IPKF and LTTE.\n\nThe IPKF began withdrawing from Sri Lanka in 1989, on the orders of the newly elected Sri Lankan President [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] and following the election of the [[V. P. Singh]] government in India.<ref name=dixitrediff/> The last IPKF contingents left Sri Lanka in March 1990.\n\nIndia's battle in Sri Lanka is often compared and called as 'India's Vietnam' by International Media.<ref>https://www.ozy.com/flashback/indias-vietnam-moment-the-ill-advised-war-that-ended-in-humiliation/81702</ref><ref>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indian-army-sri-lanka-ltte-liberation-tigers-of-tamil-eelam-jaffna-indian-peace-keeping-force-ipkf-in-fact-on-indian-military-decisions-of-today-shadow-of-a-pyrrhic-victory-yesterday-4887671/</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Operation Poomalai}}\nSri Lanka, from the early 1980s, was facing increasingly violent ethnic strife in the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. The [[origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War]] can be traced to the [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence of Sri Lanka]] in 1948, after the end of [[British Ceylon|British rule]]. At the time, a [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] majority government was instituted. This government, which included the Tamil Congress, passed legislation deemed discriminatory by some against the [[Tamils of Sri Lanka|Tamil]] minority in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the 1970s, two major Tamil [[List of political parties in Sri Lanka|parties]], the [[Tamil Congress]] and a split, the [[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi|Federal Party]] united to form the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF), a [[Separatism|separatist]] Tamil nationalist group that agitated for a separate state of [[Tamil Eelam]] in north and eastern Sri Lanka<ref name= GlobSec>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ltte.htm|title=Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), World Tamil Association (WTA), World Tamil Movement (WTM), Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils (FACT), Ellalan Force.

Emboldened by this support, supporters in Tamil Nadu provided a sanctuary for the separatists and helped the LTTE smuggle arms and ammunition into Sri Lanka, making them the strongest force on the island. In fact in 1982, the LTTE supremo Prabhakran was arrested by the police in Tamil Nadu, for a shoot-out with his rival Uma Maheswaran, in the middle of the city. Both of them were arrested and later released by the police. This activity was left unchecked as India's regional and domestic interests wanted to limit foreign intervention on what was deemed as an ethnic issue between the Tamils and the Sinhalese. To this end, the Indira Gandhi government sought to make it clear to Sri Lankan president [[Junius Richard Jayewardene]] that armed intervention in support of the Tamil movement was an option India would consider if diplomatic solutions should fail.<ref name=Haggerty>'''India's Regional Security Doctrine.'''\nHagerty D.T.

The riots only aided in the deterioration of the ethnic relations. Militant factions, including the LTTE, at this time recruited in large numbers and continued building on popular Tamil dissent and stepped up the [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]].

At least 150 civilians died in the hour-long attack.\n\nGandhi's government attempted to re-establish friendly relations with the various factions in Sri Lanka while maintaining diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the conflict as well as limiting overt aid to the Tamil fighters.<ref name=Haggerty/><ref name=fo>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/india/raw/|title=Research and Analysis Wing.

Five [[Antonov An-32]]s under [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] cover flew over Jaffna to airdrop 25 tons of supplies, all the time keeping well within the range of Sri Lankan radar coverage. At the same time the Sri Lankan Ambassador to New Delhi, [[Bernard Tilakaratna]], was summoned to the Foreign Office to be informed by the [[Indian Foreign Minister|Minister of State, External Affairs]], [[K. Natwar Singh]], of the ongoing operation and also indicated that the operation was expected not to be hindered by the [[Sri Lankan Air Force]].

Avoiding mines, eight men and two officers shifted to the wooden rafts and paddled to the jetty then fixed demolition charges to the jetty and LTTE speedboats. The commandos were detected but laid down suppressive fire and detonated the explosives before retreating to the Geminis without taking casualties. Two nights later, commandos swam back into the harbour amidst heavy patrolling by the LTTE to destroy the remaining speedboats. They were again detected and sustained minor injuries. These actions helped recapture Trincomalee and Jaffna harbours from the LTTE. For leading these actions the 30-year-old Lt.

The LTTE casualties are not known.\n\n===Intelligence Failures===\nThe Indian intelligence agencies failed to consistently provide accurate information to the forces. One example is the [[Jaffna football ground massacre]]. The LTTE's [[disinformation]] machinery leaked fake information to the Indian army that the LTTE leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] was hiding in a building near the Jaffna university football ground.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A major operational plan was chalked out by the Indian generals to capture him alive. The plan involved airdropping commandos on the ground, while tank formations would move to surround the area, to prevent anyone from the stadium and its surrounding buildings to escape.\n\nHowever, when the plan was executed, the Indian troops came under heavy attack from hidden LTTE sharpshooters. the tanks moving on the ground were ensnared by anti-tank mines placed by the LTTE fighters. This resulted in heavy losses for the Indian side.<ref>citation needed</ref> According to later accounts, the LTTE leader, Prabhakaran was not in the area at the time of the operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DF08Df01.html|title=Asia Times: India/Pakistan|website=www.atimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe IPKF complained that accurate maps of the operational theaters were not made available to them by the various intelligence agencies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThere was also a case where an agent of [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW) was killed in an ambush set up by the IPKF. He had been acting on orders to carry out back channel diplomacy and peacetalks with the [[LTTE]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Impact==\nThe IPKF mission while having gained tactical successes, did not succeed in its intended goals. On 21 May 1991, the LTTE [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|assassinated]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]] for his role in sending the IPKF to Sri Lanka.\n\nThe primary impact of the IPKF, has been that it shaped India's [[counter-insurgency]] techniques and military doctrine. On the international scene, it does not find significant mention in National or International military history. The political fallout, the IPKF's casualties, as well as the deterioration of international relations has however shaped India's foreign policy towards the Sri Lankan conflict. (see below)\n\n===Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi===\nThe decision to send the IPKF in Sri Lanka was taken by then prime-minister of India, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who held office until 1989. The operation in Sri Lanka was one of the factors that led to the ouster of the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government in 1989.\n\nRajiv Gandhi was assassinated at a rally at [[Sriperumbudur]] on 21 May 1991, while he was campaigning for re-election during the 1991 Indian General Election, by a [[suicide bomber]], who was a member of the LTTE, named [[Thenmuli Rajaratnam|Dhanu]].\n\n===India's foreign policy===\nThe debacle that was IPKF's intervention in Sri Lanka is raised at times in Indian political discourse whenever the situation in Sri Lanka shows signs of deteriorating, and there is a question of intervening; or, in Sri Lankan politics (particularly by the LTTE), when it is proposed that India, or, more broadly, other foreigners, ought to have a role in promoting peace on the island nation.\n\nAs a result, relations between India and Sri Lanka became extremely sour and India vowed never to offer any military help to Sri Lanka again. This policy has not been changed since and no defence pact has been signed between India and Sri Lanka. India has never been directly involved in the peace talks between the LTTE and Sri Lanka but has supported Norway's efforts.\n\n==Controversies==\nThe IPKF's role in the Sri Lankan conflict was much maligned by voices both there and at home at the time. It was alleged by the LTTE to have engaged in a number of incidents of human rights violation. Some neutral organisations also alleged the IPKF and LTTE engaged with scant regard for civilian safety and to have violated human rights. These allegations led to considerable outcry and public resentment within Sri Lanka as well as India, especially in [[Tamil Nadu]], where the IPKF came to be viewed as an invading and oppressing force.\n\nIndian forces were accused of indulging in number of civilian massacres, [[Involuntary disappearances]] and rapes during their time in the [[Northeastern province of Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nesohr.org/inception-sept2007/human-rights-reports/StatisticsOnCiviliansAffectedByWar.pdf|title= Statistics on civilians affected by war from 1974 \u2013 2004|accessdate= 2008-11-15|work= NESOHR|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225211013/http://nesohr.org/inception-sept2007/human-rights-reports/StatisticsOnCiviliansAffectedByWar.pdf|archive-date= 25 February 2009|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=CM>{{cite book | last=McDowell | first=Chris | title= A Tamil Asylum Diaspora: Sri Lankan Migration, Settlement and Politics in Switzerland (Studies in Forced Migration)  | year=1996 | publisher= Berghahn Books |isbn=1-57181-917-7}} p.181</ref> These include complicity in the incidents such as [[1989 Valvettithurai massacre|Valvettiturai massacre]] in which on\n2, 3, and 4 August 1989 over 50 Tamils were massacred by the Indian Peace Keeping Force in [[Valvettiturai]], Jaffna.

It was formed under the mandate of the 1987 [[Indo-Sri Lankan Accord]] that aimed to end the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] between  [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Sri Lankan Tamil nationalists]] such as the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) and the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|Sri Lankan military]].{{Ref|1}}\n\nThe main task of the IPKF was to disarm the different terrorist groups, not just the LTTE. It was to be quickly followed by the formation of an Interim Administrative Council. These were the tasks as per the terms of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, signed at the behest of Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. Given the escalation of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and with the pouring of refugees into India, Gandhi took the decisive step to push this accord through. The IPKF was inducted into Sri Lanka on the request of Sri Lankan President [[J. R. Jayewardene]] under the terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.<ref name=Hennayake/>\n\nThe force was initially not expected to be involved in any significant combat by the [[Indian Armed Forces#Organization and command structure|Indian High Command]].<ref name=dixitrediff/> However, within a few months, the IPKF became embroiled in battle with the LTTE to enforce peace. The differences started with LTTE trying to dominate the Interim Administrative Council, and also refusing to disarm, which was a pre-condition to enforce peace in the island. Soon, these differences led to the LTTE attacking the IPKF, at which point the IPKF decided to disarm the LTTE militants, by force if required. In the two years it was in northern Sri Lanka, the IPKF launched a number of combat operations aimed at destroying the LTTE-led insurgency. It soon escalated into repeated skirmishes between the IPKF and LTTE.\n\nThe IPKF began withdrawing from Sri Lanka in 1989, on the orders of the newly elected Sri Lankan President [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] and following the election of the [[V. P. Singh]] government in India.<ref name=dixitrediff/> The last IPKF contingents left Sri Lanka in March 1990.\n\nIndia's battle in Sri Lanka is often compared and called as 'India's Vietnam' by International Media.<ref>https://www.ozy.com/flashback/indias-vietnam-moment-the-ill-advised-war-that-ended-in-humiliation/81702</ref><ref>https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/indian-army-sri-lanka-ltte-liberation-tigers-of-tamil-eelam-jaffna-indian-peace-keeping-force-ipkf-in-fact-on-indian-military-decisions-of-today-shadow-of-a-pyrrhic-victory-yesterday-4887671/</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Operation Poomalai}}\nSri Lanka, from the early 1980s, was facing increasingly violent ethnic strife in the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]]. The [[origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War]] can be traced to the [[Sri Lankan independence movement|independence of Sri Lanka]] in 1948, after the end of [[British Ceylon|British rule]]. At the time, a [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] majority government was instituted. This government, which included the Tamil Congress, passed legislation deemed discriminatory by some against the [[Tamils of Sri Lanka|Tamil]] minority in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the 1970s, two major Tamil [[List of political parties in Sri Lanka|parties]], the [[Tamil Congress]] and a split, the [[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi|Federal Party]] united to form the [[Tamil United Liberation Front]] (TULF), a [[Separatism|separatist]] Tamil nationalist group that agitated for a separate state of [[Tamil Eelam]] in north and eastern Sri Lanka<ref name= GlobSec>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ltte.htm|title=Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), World Tamil Association (WTA), World Tamil Movement (WTM), Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils (FACT), Ellalan Force.

Emboldened by this support, supporters in Tamil Nadu provided a sanctuary for the separatists and helped the LTTE smuggle arms and ammunition into Sri Lanka, making them the strongest force on the island. In fact in 1982, the LTTE supremo Prabhakran was arrested by the police in Tamil Nadu, for a shoot-out with his rival Uma Maheswaran, in the middle of the city. Both of them were arrested and later released by the police. This activity was left unchecked as India's regional and domestic interests wanted to limit foreign intervention on what was deemed as an ethnic issue between the Tamils and the Sinhalese. To this end, the Indira Gandhi government sought to make it clear to Sri Lankan president [[Junius Richard Jayewardene]] that armed intervention in support of the Tamil movement was an option India would consider if diplomatic solutions should fail.<ref name=Haggerty>'''India's Regional Security Doctrine.'''\nHagerty D.T.

On 4 June 1987, in a bid to provide relief, the [[Indian Air Force]] mounted [[Operation Poomalai]]. Five [[Antonov An-32]]s under [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] cover flew over Jaffna to airdrop 25 tons of supplies, all the time keeping well within the range of Sri Lankan radar coverage. At the same time the Sri Lankan Ambassador to New Delhi, [[Bernard Tilakaratna]], was summoned to the Foreign Office to be informed by the [[Indian Foreign Minister|Minister of State, External Affairs]], [[K. Natwar Singh]], of the ongoing operation and also indicated that the operation was expected not to be hindered by the [[Sri Lankan Air Force]].

[[J N Dixit]], the then Indian ambassador to Colombo, in an interview to [[rediff.com]] in 2000 described that ostensibly, Jayawardene's decision to request Indian assistance came in the face of increasing civil riots and violence within the southern Sinhalese majority areas, including the capital [[Colombo]] that were initiated by the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] and the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] that necessitated the withdrawal of the Sri Lankan Army from the Tamil areas of northern Sri Lanka to maintain order.<ref name= dixitrediff>{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2000/mar/24lanka.htm|title='''J N Dixit''' (ex-Indian Ambassador to Colombo) speaking to Rediff.com|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Order of battle==\n<!--[[File:IPKF Troops.gif|thumb|right|200px|IPKF troops in Sri Lanka.]]-->\nOriginally a reinforced division with small naval and air elements, the IPKF at its peak deployed four divisions and nearly 80,000 men with one mountain (4th) and three Infantry Divisions (36th, 54th, 57th) as well as supporting arms and services. At the peak of its operational deployment, IPKF operations also included a large [[Indian Paramilitary Force]] and [[Special Forces of India|Indian Special Forces]] elements. Indeed, Sri Lanka was first theatre of active operation for the [[MARCOS|Indian Navy Commandos]]. The main deployment of the IPKF was in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. Upon its withdrawal from Sri Lanka the IPKF was renamed the [[XXI Corps (India)|21st Corps]] and was headquartered near [[Bhopal]] and became a [[quick reaction force]] for the Indian Army.\n\n===Indian Army===\nThe first [[Indian Army]] troops to be inducted into Sri Lanka were a ten thousand strong force from the [[54th Infantry Division (India)|54th Infantry Division]] commanded by [[Major General]] [[Harkirat Singh (general)|Harkirat Singh]], which flew into [[Jaffna Airport|Palali Airbase]] from 30 July onwards.<ref name=rediffstory>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/may/22lanka.htm|title='''Sri Lanka- war without end, peace without hope.'''

Avoiding mines, eight men and two officers shifted to the wooden rafts and paddled to the jetty then fixed demolition charges to the jetty and LTTE speedboats. The commandos were detected but laid down suppressive fire and detonated the explosives before retreating to the Geminis without taking casualties. Two nights later, commandos swam back into the harbour amidst heavy patrolling by the LTTE to destroy the remaining speedboats. They were again detected and sustained minor injuries. These actions helped recapture Trincomalee and Jaffna harbours from the LTTE. For leading these actions the 30-year-old Lt.

The LTTE casualties are not known.\n\n===Intelligence Failures===\nThe Indian intelligence agencies failed to consistently provide accurate information to the forces. One example is the [[Jaffna football ground massacre]]. The LTTE's [[disinformation]] machinery leaked fake information to the Indian army that the LTTE leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] was hiding in a building near the Jaffna university football ground.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A major operational plan was chalked out by the Indian generals to capture him alive. The plan involved airdropping commandos on the ground, while tank formations would move to surround the area, to prevent anyone from the stadium and its surrounding buildings to escape.\n\nHowever, when the plan was executed, the Indian troops came under heavy attack from hidden LTTE sharpshooters. the tanks moving on the ground were ensnared by anti-tank mines placed by the LTTE fighters. This resulted in heavy losses for the Indian side.<ref>citation needed</ref> According to later accounts, the LTTE leader, Prabhakaran was not in the area at the time of the operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DF08Df01.html|title=Asia Times: India/Pakistan|website=www.atimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe IPKF complained that accurate maps of the operational theaters were not made available to them by the various intelligence agencies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThere was also a case where an agent of [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW) was killed in an ambush set up by the IPKF. He had been acting on orders to carry out back channel diplomacy and peacetalks with the [[LTTE]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Impact==\nThe IPKF mission while having gained tactical successes, did not succeed in its intended goals. On 21 May 1991, the LTTE [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|assassinated]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]] for his role in sending the IPKF to Sri Lanka.\n\nThe primary impact of the IPKF, has been that it shaped India's [[counter-insurgency]] techniques and military doctrine. On the international scene, it does not find significant mention in National or International military history. The political fallout, the IPKF's casualties, as well as the deterioration of international relations has however shaped India's foreign policy towards the Sri Lankan conflict. (see below)\n\n===Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi===\nThe decision to send the IPKF in Sri Lanka was taken by then prime-minister of India, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who held office until 1989. The operation in Sri Lanka was one of the factors that led to the ouster of the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government in 1989.\n\nRajiv Gandhi was assassinated at a rally at [[Sriperumbudur]] on 21 May 1991, while he was campaigning for re-election during the 1991 Indian General Election, by a [[suicide bomber]], who was a member of the LTTE, named [[Thenmuli Rajaratnam|Dhanu]].\n\n===India's foreign policy===\nThe debacle that was IPKF's intervention in Sri Lanka is raised at times in Indian political discourse whenever the situation in Sri Lanka shows signs of deteriorating, and there is a question of intervening; or, in Sri Lankan politics (particularly by the LTTE), when it is proposed that India, or, more broadly, other foreigners, ought to have a role in promoting peace on the island nation.\n\nAs a result, relations between India and Sri Lanka became extremely sour and India vowed never to offer any military help to Sri Lanka again. This policy has not been changed since and no defence pact has been signed between India and Sri Lanka. India has never been directly involved in the peace talks between the LTTE and Sri Lanka but has supported Norway's efforts.\n\n==Controversies==\nThe IPKF's role in the Sri Lankan conflict was much maligned by voices both there and at home at the time. It was alleged by the LTTE to have engaged in a number of incidents of human rights violation. Some neutral organisations also alleged the IPKF and LTTE engaged with scant regard for civilian safety and to have violated human rights. These allegations led to considerable outcry and public resentment within Sri Lanka as well as India, especially in [[Tamil Nadu]], where the IPKF came to be viewed as an invading and oppressing force.\n\nIndian forces were accused of indulging in number of civilian massacres, [[Involuntary disappearances]] and rapes during their time in the [[Northeastern province of Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nesohr.org/inception-sept2007/human-rights-reports/StatisticsOnCiviliansAffectedByWar.pdf|title= Statistics on civilians affected by war from 1974 \u2013 2004|accessdate= 2008-11-15|work= NESOHR|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225211013/http://nesohr.org/inception-sept2007/human-rights-reports/StatisticsOnCiviliansAffectedByWar.pdf|archive-date= 25 February 2009|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=CM>{{cite book | last=McDowell | first=Chris | title= A Tamil Asylum Diaspora: Sri Lankan Migration, Settlement and Politics in Switzerland (Studies in Forced Migration)  | year=1996 | publisher= Berghahn Books |isbn=1-57181-917-7}} p.181</ref> These include complicity in the incidents such as [[1989 Valvettithurai massacre|Valvettiturai massacre]] in which on\n2, 3, and 4 August 1989 over 50 Tamils were massacred by the Indian Peace Keeping Force in [[Valvettiturai]], Jaffna.
