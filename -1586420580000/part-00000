The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching.

Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature. Thus Type 304 SS is rarely used in contact with sulfuric acid.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

It only absorbs a small amount of carbon because of its cubic crystalline structure, which consists of one iron in each corner and a central iron atom; the central atom is what gives it magnetic properties. \n\nGrades with low coercitive field Hc have been developed for electrovalves used in household appliances  and for injection systems in internal combustion engines\n\nAnnealed [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] stainless steels are usually [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Values for some common materials|non-magnetic]].   \n\nSome applications require non-magnetic materials, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Magnetic permeability of some austenitic  stainless steel grades after annealing 2 hours at 1050{{nbsp}}\u00b0C<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fofanov|first=D.|url=|title=Magnetic properties of Stainless Steels: applications, opportunities and new developments|date=29 Nov 2011|work=Stainless steel World Conference|access-date=|last2=Riedner|first2=S.}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse together. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/ReviewofWearandGallingCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9006_.ashx |title=Review of the Wear and Galling Characteristics of Stainless Steels |last=Committee of Stainless Steel Producers.

Additionally, threaded joints may be [[Lubrication|lubricated]] to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Also, [[Nitronic]] 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Standard finishes==\n{{Main|Brushed metal}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

H. Tuthill|date=2002|website=Nickel Institute|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA wide range of stainless steels are used throughout the papermaking process. For example, duplex stainless steels are being used in [[Kraft process|digesters]] to convert wood chips into wood pulp. 6% Mo superaustenitics are used in the [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleach plant]] and Type 316 is used extensively in the [[paper machine]].\n\n===Chemical processing and petrochemical===\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in these industries for their corrosion resistance to both aqueous, gaseous and high temperature environments, their mechanical properties at all temperatures from cryogenic to the very high, and occasionally for other special physical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelsforChemicalProcessEquipment_14038_.ashx|title=Stainless Steels for Chemical Process Equipment|last=G.

Stainless steels do not affect the taste of the product, they are easily cleaned and sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination of the food, and they are durable.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in cookware, commercial food processing, commercial kitchens, brewing beer, wine making, and meat processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/FoodAndBeverage/WhyStainless.aspx|title=Food & Beverage Industry|last=Nickel Institute|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nAcidic foods with high salt additions, such as tomato sauce, and highly salted condiments, such as soya sauce may require higher alloyed stainless steels such as 6% Mo superaustenitics to prevent pitting corrosion by chloride.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n;  Automobiles\n{{See also|Braided stainless steel brake lines}}\nThe [[Allegheny Technologies|Allegheny Ludlum Corporation]] worked with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] on various [[concept car]]s with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s to demonstrate the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles,<ref>[[Stanley Malamed|Malamed, Stanley]] (2004). ''Handbook of Local Anesthesia'', 5th Edition.

Conversely, stainless steel is used in fuel cells that do the opposite, react hydrogen with oxygen to produce water and electrical energy.\n\n===Culinary===\n\nStainless steel is often preferred for [[sink|kitchen sinks]] because of its ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, [[acoustic noise]] is controlled by applying [[Sound dampening|resilient undercoating]] to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as [[kitchen appliance|appliances]] and [[Kitchen|backsplashes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Cookware and bakeware]] may be clad in stainless steels, to enhance their cleanability and durability, and to permit their use in [[induction cooking]] (this requires a [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]] grade of stainless steel, such as 432).

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

Technical Development Dept., Nippon Metal Industry, Co., Ltd.</ref>\n* 300 series are chromium-nickel alloys, which achieve their austenitic microstructure almost exclusively by nickel alloying; some very highly alloyed grades include some nitrogen to reduce nickel requirements. 300 series is the largest group and the most widely used. \n** Type 304: The best known grade is Type 304, also known as 18/8 and 18/10 for its composition of 18% chromium and 8%/10% nickel, respectively. \n** Type 316: The second most common austenitic stainless steel is Type 316. The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

They offer a higher toughness and higher corrosion resistance. Grade EN 1.4303 (Casting grade CA6NM) with 13% Cr and 4% Ni is used for most [[Pelton wheel|Pelton]], [[Kaplan turbine|Kaplan]] and [[Francis turbine]]s in [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plant]]<nowiki/>s <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|title=Stainless teel in Micro Hydro turbines|publisher=International Stainless Steel Forum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316010101/http://worldstainless.org/publications/brochures_and_posters|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018}}</ref> because it has good casting properties, a good weldability and a good resistance to [[cavitation]] erosion.\n# Precipitation hardening grades: Grade EN 1.4542 (a.k.a. 17/4PH), the best known grade, combines martensitic hardening and precipitation hardening.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching. At this point, the structure remains austenitic. Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts. Yield stress levels above 1400{{nbsp}}MPa are then reached.\n\n- Austenitic A286<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rolledalloys.com/alloys/stainless-steels/a-286/en/|title=A-286 - Rolled Alloys, Inc.|website=www.rolledalloys.com}} </ref>(ASTM 660 EN 1.4980)  has the following typical analysis Cr 15%, Ni 25%, Ti 2.1%, Mo 1.2%, V 1.3%, and B 0.005%.\n\nThe structure remains austenitic at all temperatures.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves solution treatment and quenching, followed by aging at 715&nbsp;\u00b0C. Aging forms Ni<sub>3</sub>Ti precipitates and increases the yield strength to about 650{{nbsp}}MPa at room temperature. Unlike the above grades, the mechanical properties and creep resistance of this PH steel remain very good at temperatures up to 700&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nA286 is in fact a Fe-based superalloy, used in jet engines and gas turbines, turbo parts, etc.\n\nThe designation \"CRES\" is used in various industries to refer to corrosion-resistant steel.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid.

Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse together. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/ReviewofWearandGallingCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9006_.ashx |title=Review of the Wear and Galling Characteristics of Stainless Steels |last=Committee of Stainless Steel Producers.

Additionally, threaded joints may be [[Lubrication|lubricated]] to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Also, [[Nitronic]] 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Standard finishes==\n{{Main|Brushed metal}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

For example, duplex stainless steels are being used in [[Kraft process|digesters]] to convert wood chips into wood pulp. 6% Mo superaustenitics are used in the [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleach plant]] and Type 316 is used extensively in the [[paper machine]].\n\n===Chemical processing and petrochemical===\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in these industries for their corrosion resistance to both aqueous, gaseous and high temperature environments, their mechanical properties at all temperatures from cryogenic to the very high, and occasionally for other special physical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelsforChemicalProcessEquipment_14038_.ashx|title=Stainless Steels for Chemical Process Equipment|last=G.

Stainless steels do not affect the taste of the product, they are easily cleaned and sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination of the food, and they are durable.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in cookware, commercial food processing, commercial kitchens, brewing beer, wine making, and meat processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/FoodAndBeverage/WhyStainless.aspx|title=Food & Beverage Industry|last=Nickel Institute|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nAcidic foods with high salt additions, such as tomato sauce, and highly salted condiments, such as soya sauce may require higher alloyed stainless steels such as 6% Mo superaustenitics to prevent pitting corrosion by chloride.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n;  Automobiles\n{{See also|Braided stainless steel brake lines}}\nThe [[Allegheny Technologies|Allegheny Ludlum Corporation]] worked with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] on various [[concept car]]s with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s to demonstrate the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry.

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

As this is an average, countries that have low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in their electricity production (such as France with nuclear energy) will have lower figures.  Ferritics without Ni will have a lower CO<sub>2</sub> footprint than austenitics with 8% Ni or more.\n\nCarbon footprint must not be the only factor for deciding the choice of materials:\n* over any product life,  maintenance, repairs (when possible) or early end of life (planned obsolescence) can increase the overall footprint way beyond the difference between materials only.  In addition loss of service (typically for bridges) may induce large hidden costs (queues, wasted fuel, loss of man-hours;)\n* how much material is used to provide a given service varies with the performance, particularly the strength level, which allows lighter structures and components.\n\nStainless steel is 100% [[recyclable]].<ref>{{citation |author= Johnson, J., Reck, B.K., Wang, T., Graede, T.E. |title=The energy benefit of stainless steel recycling |year=2008 |journal=Energy Policy\n|volume=36 |pages=181\u2013192 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.08.028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingStainlessSteel.aspx|title=Recycling Stainless Steel|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingofNickelcontainingalloys.aspx|title=Recycling of Nickel-containing Alloys|website=Nickel Instiitute}}</ref> An average stainless steel object is composed of about 60% recycled material of which approximately 40% originates from end-of-life products and about 60% comes from manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110127075255/http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 27 January 2011\n |title      = The Recycling of Stainless Steel (\"Recycled Content\" and \"Input Composition\" slides)\n |accessdate = 19 November 2006\n |year       = 2006\n |format     = Flash\n |publisher  = International Stainless Steel Forum\n}}</ref> What prevents a higher recycling content is the availability of stainless steel scrap, in spite of a very high recycling rate. According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

Production and development began with each member meeting with Higgins to discuss their personal and professional experiences since the release of their third album ''[[Chemistry (Girls Aloud album)|Chemistry]]'' (2005). It was recorded separately between April and July 2007.\n\nAccording to member [[Cheryl (entertainer)|Cheryl]], ''Tangled Up'' emphasizes a more mature nature than their previous efforts. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]] album that incorporates elements of [[dance-pop]], [[synthpop]], and various [[electronic dance music|EDM]] sub-genres. Lyrically, it delves into themes of love, relationships and femininity. Majority of the numbers consists of synthesizers, drum machines, electric and acoustic guitars, and keyboards, whilst it was the group's first experimentation with tools such as [[autotune]] and [[vocoder]].\n\nUpon its release, ''Tangled Up'' received universal acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who commended the dance-oriented sound, songwriting and fun production. However, minor criticism was aimed towards certain inclusions on the record. Despite this, ''Tangled Up'' has been identified by numerous commentators as Girls Aloud and Xenomania's best work. Commercially, it experienced success in the [[United Kingdom]], peaking at number four, and was certified platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for shipments of 300,000 units. It performed moderately in Ireland, reaching number 25, and was certified gold by the [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] (IRMA) for 7,500 claimed sales.\n\nIn order to promote the album, Girls Aloud conducted a series of promotional activities such as television, commercial and magazine appearances. Three singles were released from the record: \"[[Sexy! No No No...]]\", \"[[Call the Shots]]\" and \"[[Can't Speak French]]\", all achieving critical and commercial success in Europe. Furthermore, the girl group embarked on their [[Tangled Up Tour]] which saw them tour in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Like the album, it achieved critical and commercial acclaim, and a live DVD was distributed on 27 October 2008.\n\n== Background and development ==\n\nIn April 2007, the group announced that they would release a new studio album in November of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/girls-aloud/news/girls-aloud-were-not-splitting|title=Girls Aloud: \"We're not splitting!\"|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=16 April 2007|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> Initial ideas started in March of that year where each member met with British producer [[Brian Higgins (producer)|Brian Higgins]], who had worked with them together on their previous records. Each singer visited Higgins at his home in England and discussed their experiences and life endeavours after the release of the third Girls Aloud studio album ''[[Chemistry (Girls Aloud album)|Chemistry]]'' (2005); to his advantage, he decided to take inspiration from those discussions and work further on the new record, along with his production team [[Xenomania]]. Member [[Nicola Roberts]] reaffirmed that it was important for Higgins to be \"up to date with where [Girls Aloud are] at,\" and further commented, \"Our songs have to reflect us so that's why we do it.\"<ref name=\"walesonline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/ps-and-qs-girls-aloud-2219903|title=Ps and Qs: Girls Aloud|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|date=27 November 2007|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> Moreover, when asked in an interview with [[Fascination Records]] about what fans and critics could expect from the album, member [[Cheryl (entertainer)|Cheryl]] said they were heading for a \"more mature direction.\" She also believed that the ideal focus for the record was not to sing \"about things that we would have when we were 16. Now we're singing about things that you talk about in your early 20s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fascinationrecords.com/index.php?id=111&m=8&y=1966|title=Cheryl Cole Exclusive Interview!|publisher=[[Fascination Records]]|date=2007|accessdate=19 December 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130216013700/http://www.fascinationrecords.com/index.php?id=111&m=8&y=1966|archivedate=16 February 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn late March 2007, Higgins and Xenomania started crafting demo songs for the girl group to record, which commenced the following month. However, Higgins provided the demos for member [[Nadine Coyle]] to solely record as she had moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] that year; the motive was to allow Coyle to choose what sounds and sections from each song worked for her.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web|author=McLean, Craig|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/11/popandrock.girlsaloud|title=Smashed Hits|work=[[The Observer]].

Furthermore, she noted that sessions for their previous albums would take a \"matter of weeks\", but took longer because the members wanted to experiment more with the production; moreover, recording had to be halted due to the promotion of the lead single \"[[Sexy!

It was released through [[Fascination Records|Fascination]] and [[Polydor Records]] on 16 November 2007, and distributed in two physical formats and available for [[Music download|digital consumption]]. The record was produced by [[Brian Higgins]] and production team [[Xenomania]]; the band members earned songwriting credits for two tracks. Production and development began with each member meeting with Higgins to discuss their personal and professional experiences since the release of their third album ''[[Chemistry (Girls Aloud album)|Chemistry]]'' (2005). It was recorded separately between April and July 2007.\n\nAccording to member [[Cheryl (entertainer)|Cheryl]], ''Tangled Up'' emphasizes a more mature nature than their previous efforts. Musically, it is a [[Pop music|pop]] album that incorporates elements of [[dance-pop]], [[synthpop]], and various [[electronic dance music|EDM]] sub-genres. Lyrically, it delves into themes of love, relationships and femininity. Majority of the numbers consists of synthesizers, drum machines, electric and acoustic guitars, and keyboards, whilst it was the group's first experimentation with tools such as [[autotune]] and [[vocoder]].\n\nUpon its release, ''Tangled Up'' received universal acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who commended the dance-oriented sound, songwriting and fun production. However, minor criticism was aimed towards certain inclusions on the record. Despite this, ''Tangled Up'' has been identified by numerous commentators as Girls Aloud and Xenomania's best work. Commercially, it experienced success in the [[United Kingdom]], peaking at number four, and was certified platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for shipments of 300,000 units. It performed moderately in Ireland, reaching number 25, and was certified gold by the [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] (IRMA) for 7,500 claimed sales.\n\nIn order to promote the album, Girls Aloud conducted a series of promotional activities such as television, commercial and magazine appearances. Three singles were released from the record: \"[[Sexy! No No No...]]\", \"[[Call the Shots]]\" and \"[[Can't Speak French]]\", all achieving critical and commercial success in Europe. Furthermore, the girl group embarked on their [[Tangled Up Tour]] which saw them tour in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Like the album, it achieved critical and commercial acclaim, and a live DVD was distributed on 27 October 2008.\n\n== Background and development ==\n\nIn April 2007, the group announced that they would release a new studio album in November of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/girls-aloud/news/girls-aloud-were-not-splitting|title=Girls Aloud: \"We're not splitting!\"|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=16 April 2007|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> Initial ideas started in March of that year where each member met with British producer [[Brian Higgins (producer)|Brian Higgins]], who had worked with them together on their previous records. Each singer visited Higgins at his home in England and discussed their experiences and life endeavours after the release of the third Girls Aloud studio album ''[[Chemistry (Girls Aloud album)|Chemistry]]'' (2005); to his advantage, he decided to take inspiration from those discussions and work further on the new record, along with his production team [[Xenomania]]. Member [[Nicola Roberts]] reaffirmed that it was important for Higgins to be \"up to date with where [Girls Aloud are] at,\" and further commented, \"Our songs have to reflect us so that's why we do it.\"<ref name=\"walesonline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/ps-and-qs-girls-aloud-2219903|title=Ps and Qs: Girls Aloud|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|date=27 November 2007|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> Moreover, when asked in an interview with [[Fascination Records]] about what fans and critics could expect from the album, member [[Cheryl (entertainer)|Cheryl]] said they were heading for a \"more mature direction.\" She also believed that the ideal focus for the record was not to sing \"about things that we would have when we were 16. Now we're singing about things that you talk about in your early 20s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fascinationrecords.com/index.php?id=111&m=8&y=1966|title=Cheryl Cole Exclusive Interview!|publisher=[[Fascination Records]]|date=2007|accessdate=19 December 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130216013700/http://www.fascinationrecords.com/index.php?id=111&m=8&y=1966|archivedate=16 February 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn late March 2007, Higgins and Xenomania started crafting demo songs for the girl group to record, which commenced the following month. However, Higgins provided the demos for member [[Nadine Coyle]] to solely record as she had moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] that year; the motive was to allow Coyle to choose what sounds and sections from each song worked for her.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web|author=McLean, Craig|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/11/popandrock.girlsaloud|title=Smashed Hits|work=[[The Observer]].

Furthermore, she noted that sessions for their previous albums would take a \"matter of weeks\", but took longer because the members wanted to experiment more with the production; moreover, recording had to be halted due to the promotion of the lead single \"[[Sexy! No No No...]]\" in the middle of finishing the record.<ref name=\"walesonline\"/> ''Tangled Up'' was finished in October 2007, and was mastered by Higgins himself, with the help of Dick Beetham of 360 Masterings.<ref name=\"cd\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Tangled Up|others=Girls Aloud|year=2007|type=CD; Liner notes|publisher=Fascination.
