High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionisation, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionisation is determined by the [[electron temperature]] relative to the [[ionization energy]] (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the [[Saha equation]]. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states\u2014atoms<ref name=\"Nicholson\">{{cite book |title=Introduction to Plasma Theory |last=Nicholson |first= Dwight R. |date=1983 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-09045-8}}</ref>\u2014and the plasma will eventually become a gas.\n\nIn most cases the electrons are close enough to [[thermal equilibrium]] that their temperature is relatively well-defined; this is true even when there is a significant deviation from a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] energy [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]], for example, due to [[UV radiation]], energetic particles, or strong [[electric field]]s. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionized technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the [[ambient temperature]].\n\n====Fully vs. partially (weakly) ionized gases====\n{{main|Degree of ionization}}\n{{see also|Spitzer resistivity}}\nFor plasma to exist, [[ionization|ionisation]] is necessary. The term \"plasma density\" by itself usually refers to the \"electron density\", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The [[degree of ionization|degree of ionisation]] of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled by the electron and ion temperatures and electron-ion vs electron-neutral collision frequencies.

If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of \"quasineutrality\", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (<math>n_e = \\langle Z\\rangle n_i</math>), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:\n:<math>n_e \\propto e^{e\\Phi/k_BT_e}.</math>\n\nDifferentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:\n:<math>\\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\\nabla n_e/n_e).</math>\n\nIt is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise, it will be dissipated by the repulsive [[electrostatic force]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Plasma science : from fundamental research to technological applications|date=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|others=National Research Council (U.S.).

However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behaviour, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s.

A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., <math>\\omega_{\\mathrm{ce}} / v_{\\mathrm{coll}} > 1</math>, where <math>\\omega_{\\mathrm{ce}}</math> is the \"electron gyrofrequency\" and <math>v_{\\mathrm{coll}}</math> is the \"electron collision rate\". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are ''[[anisotropic]]'', meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by <math>\\mathbf{E} = -v\\times\\mathbf{B}</math> (where <math>\\mathbf{E}</math> is the electric field, <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> is the velocity, and <math>\\mathbf{B}</math> is the magnetic field), and is not affected by [[Debye shielding]].<ref>Richard Fitzpatrick, ''Introduction to Plasma Physics'', [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html Magnetized plasmas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301073703/http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html |date=1 March 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Comparison of plasma and gas phases===\nPlasma is often called the ''fourth state of matter'' after solid, liquids and gases, despite plasma typically being an ionized gas.<ref>{{cite book\n |last        = Frank-Kamenetskii\n |first       = David A.\n |authorlink  = David A.

One simple fluid model, [[magnetohydrodynamics]], treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. A more general description is the [[two-fluid plasma]] picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s, nor resolve wave-particle effects.\n\n===Kinetic model===\nKinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The [[Vlasov equation]] may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.\nIn magnetized plasmas, a [[gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic]] approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation.\n\n==Artificial plasmas==\nMost artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gas. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:\n*The type of power source used to generate the plasma\u2014DC, AC (typically with [[radio frequency]] ([[RF]])) and microwave\n*The pressure they operate at\u2014vacuum pressure (< 10&nbsp;mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (\u22481&nbsp;Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760&nbsp;Torr or 100 kPa)\n*The degree of ionisation within the plasma\u2014fully, partially, or weakly ionized\n*The temperature relationships within the plasma\u2014thermal plasma (<math>T_e = T_i = T_{gas}</math>), non-thermal or \"cold\" plasma (<math>T_e \\gg T_i = T_{gas}</math>)\n*The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma\n*The magnetization of the particles within the plasma\u2014magnetized (both ion and electrons are trapped in [[Gyroradius|Larmor orbits]] by the magnetic field), partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate [[Lorentz force]]s){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Generation of artificial plasma===\n[[File:Simple representation of a discharge tube - plasma.png|thumb]]\n[[File:Plasma jacobs ladder.jpg|thumb|alt=Artificial plasma produced in air by a Jacob's Ladder|Artificial plasma produced in air by a [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]]]]\nJust like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation, however, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.<ref name=\"Hippler\" /> For this case, plasma is generated when an [[electric current]] is applied across a [[dielectric gas]] or fluid (an electrically [[Electrical conductor|non-conducting]] material) as can be seen in the adjacent image, which shows a [[discharge tube]] as a simple example ([[direct current|DC]] used for simplicity).\n\nThe [[potential difference]] and subsequent [[electric field]] pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the [[anode]] (positive electrode) while the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.<ref name=\"Chen\">{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion |last=Chen |first=Francis F. |date=1984 |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-41332-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115215631/https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimuOfm_pXXAhVrzFQKHTrOCaUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |archivedate=15 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As the [[voltage]] increases, the current stresses the material (by [[electric polarization]]) beyond its [[dielectric strength|dielectric limit]] (termed strength) into a stage of [[electrical breakdown]], marked by an [[electric spark]], where the material transforms from being an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] into a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (as it becomes increasingly [[ionized]]). The underlying process is the [[Townsend avalanche]], where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be seen in the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons.

High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionisation, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionisation is determined by the [[electron temperature]] relative to the [[ionization energy]] (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the [[Saha equation]]. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states\u2014atoms<ref name=\"Nicholson\">{{cite book |title=Introduction to Plasma Theory |last=Nicholson |first= Dwight R. |date=1983 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-09045-8}}</ref>\u2014and the plasma will eventually become a gas.\n\nIn most cases the electrons are close enough to [[thermal equilibrium]] that their temperature is relatively well-defined; this is true even when there is a significant deviation from a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] energy [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]], for example, due to [[UV radiation]], energetic particles, or strong [[electric field]]s. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionized technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the [[ambient temperature]].\n\n====Fully vs. partially (weakly) ionized gases====\n{{main|Degree of ionization}}\n{{see also|Spitzer resistivity}}\nFor plasma to exist, [[ionization|ionisation]] is necessary. The term \"plasma density\" by itself usually refers to the \"electron density\", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The [[degree of ionization|degree of ionisation]] of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled by the electron and ion temperatures and electron-ion vs electron-neutral collision frequencies. The degree of ionisation, <math>\\alpha</math>, is defined as <math>\\alpha = \\frac{n_i}{n_i + n_n}</math>, where <math>n_i</math> is the number density of ions and <math>n_n</math> is the number density of neutral atoms. The ''electron density'' is related to this by the average charge state{{Explain|date=August 2018}} <math>\\langle Z\\rangle</math> of the ions through <math>n_e = \\langle Z\\rangle n_i</math>, where <math>n_e</math> is the number density of electrons.\n\nIn a plasma, the electron-ion collision frequency <math>\\nu_{ei}</math> is much greater than the electron-neutral collision frequency <math>\\nu_{en}</math>. Therefore, with a weak degree of ionization <math>\\alpha</math>, the electron-ion collision frequency can equal the electron-neutral collision frequency: <math>\\nu_{ei} = \\nu_{en}</math> is the limit separating a plasma from being partially or fully ionized.\n\n* The term ''fully ionized gas'' introduced by [[Lyman Spitzer]] does not mean the degree of ionization is unity, but only that the plasma is in a ''Coulomb-collision dominated regime'', i.e. when <math>\\nu_{ei} > \\nu_{en}</math>, which can correspond to a degree of ionization as low as 0.01%.<ref name=\"Chapman 1980\">{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Brian |date=25 September 1980 |title=Glow Discharge Processes: Sputtering and Plasma Etching |chapter-url=https://fr.scribd.com/document/150525600/Brian-Chapman-Glow-Discharge-Processes |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=49 |chapter=Chapter 3: Plasmas |isbn=978-0471078289}}</ref>\n* A ''partially'' or ''weakly ionized gas'' means the plasma is not dominated by [[Coulomb collision]]s, i.e. when <math>\\nu_{ei} < \\nu_{en}</math>.\n\nMost of \"technological\" (engineered) plasmas are weakly ionized gases.\n\n====Thermal vs. nonthermal (cold) plasmas====\n{{main|Nonthermal plasma}}\n{{see also|Anisothermal plasma}}\nBased on the relative temperatures of the electrons, ions and neutrals, plasmas are classified as \"thermal\" or \"non-thermal\" (also referred to as \"cold plasmas\").\n\n* ''Thermal plasmas'' have electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature, i.e. they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.\n* ''Nonthermal plasmas'' on the other hand are non-equilibrium ionized gases, with two temperatures: ions and neutrals stay at a low temperature (sometimes [[room temperature]]), whereas electrons are much hotter.

If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of \"quasineutrality\", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (<math>n_e = \\langle Z\\rangle n_i</math>), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:\n:<math>n_e \\propto e^{e\\Phi/k_BT_e}.</math>\n\nDifferentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:\n:<math>\\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\\nabla n_e/n_e).</math>\n\nIt is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise, it will be dissipated by the repulsive [[electrostatic force]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Plasma science : from fundamental research to technological applications|date=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|others=National Research Council (U.S.).

However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behaviour, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s.

A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., <math>\\omega_{\\mathrm{ce}} / v_{\\mathrm{coll}} > 1</math>, where <math>\\omega_{\\mathrm{ce}}</math> is the \"electron gyrofrequency\" and <math>v_{\\mathrm{coll}}</math> is the \"electron collision rate\". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are ''[[anisotropic]]'', meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by <math>\\mathbf{E} = -v\\times\\mathbf{B}</math> (where <math>\\mathbf{E}</math> is the electric field, <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> is the velocity, and <math>\\mathbf{B}</math> is the magnetic field), and is not affected by [[Debye shielding]].<ref>Richard Fitzpatrick, ''Introduction to Plasma Physics'', [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html Magnetized plasmas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301073703/http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html |date=1 March 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Comparison of plasma and gas phases===\nPlasma is often called the ''fourth state of matter'' after solid, liquids and gases, despite plasma typically being an ionized gas.<ref>{{cite book\n |last        = Frank-Kamenetskii\n |first       = David A.\n |authorlink  = David A.

At high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] to kilometers in length.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Chin, S.

One simple fluid model, [[magnetohydrodynamics]], treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. A more general description is the [[two-fluid plasma]] picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s, nor resolve wave-particle effects.\n\n===Kinetic model===\nKinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The [[Vlasov equation]] may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.\nIn magnetized plasmas, a [[gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic]] approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation.\n\n==Artificial plasmas==\nMost artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gas. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:\n*The type of power source used to generate the plasma\u2014DC, AC (typically with [[radio frequency]] ([[RF]])) and microwave\n*The pressure they operate at\u2014vacuum pressure (< 10&nbsp;mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (\u22481&nbsp;Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760&nbsp;Torr or 100 kPa)\n*The degree of ionisation within the plasma\u2014fully, partially, or weakly ionized\n*The temperature relationships within the plasma\u2014thermal plasma (<math>T_e = T_i = T_{gas}</math>), non-thermal or \"cold\" plasma (<math>T_e \\gg T_i = T_{gas}</math>)\n*The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma\n*The magnetization of the particles within the plasma\u2014magnetized (both ion and electrons are trapped in [[Gyroradius|Larmor orbits]] by the magnetic field), partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate [[Lorentz force]]s){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Generation of artificial plasma===\n[[File:Simple representation of a discharge tube - plasma.png|thumb]]\n[[File:Plasma jacobs ladder.jpg|thumb|alt=Artificial plasma produced in air by a Jacob's Ladder|Artificial plasma produced in air by a [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]]]]\nJust like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation, however, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.<ref name=\"Hippler\" /> For this case, plasma is generated when an [[electric current]] is applied across a [[dielectric gas]] or fluid (an electrically [[Electrical conductor|non-conducting]] material) as can be seen in the adjacent image, which shows a [[discharge tube]] as a simple example ([[direct current|DC]] used for simplicity).\n\nThe [[potential difference]] and subsequent [[electric field]] pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the [[anode]] (positive electrode) while the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.<ref name=\"Chen\">{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion |last=Chen |first=Francis F. |date=1984 |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-41332-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115215631/https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimuOfm_pXXAhVrzFQKHTrOCaUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |archivedate=15 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As the [[voltage]] increases, the current stresses the material (by [[electric polarization]]) beyond its [[dielectric strength|dielectric limit]] (termed strength) into a stage of [[electrical breakdown]], marked by an [[electric spark]], where the material transforms from being an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] into a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (as it becomes increasingly [[ionized]]).

He is best known as the author of ''[[Tirukkural|Thirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37]]'', a collection of couplets on ethics, political and economical matters, and love. The text is considered an exceptional and widely cherished work of the [[Tamil literature]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=123-124}}\n\nAlmost no authentic information is available about Thiruvalluvar, states [[Kamil Zvelebil]] \u2013 a scholar of Tamil literature.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124}} His life and likely background are variously inferred from his literary works by different biographers. There are unauthentic hagiographic and legendary accounts of Thiruvalluvar life, and all major Indian religions, as well as Christian missionaries of the 19th-century, have tried to claim him as secretly inspired (''crypto-'') or originally belonging to their tradition.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125}} Little is known with certainty about his family background, religious affiliation, or birthplace. He is believed to have lived at least in the town of [[Mylapore]] (a neighbourhood of the present-day [[Chennai]]), and his [[floruit]] is dated variously from 4th century BCE to early 6th century CE, based on the traditional accounts and the linguistic analyses of his writings. Maraimalai Adigal gives 31 BCE as the birth year of Valluvar, while Kamil Zvelebil infers the ''Thirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' and Thiruvalluvar are best dated to around 500 CE.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=155-156 (c. 450\u2013550 CE)}};<br>{{harvnb|Kamil Zvelebil|1974|p=119 (c. 450\u2013500 CE)}};<br>{{harvnb|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124 (c. 500 CE)}}</ref>{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|p=454}}\n\nValluvar has influenced a wide range of scholars down the ages since his time across the ethical, social, political, economical, religious, philosophical, and spiritual spheres.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=7\u201313}}{{sfn|Sundaramurthi, 2000|p=624}} He has long been venerated as a great sage, and his literary works a classic of Tamil culture.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=168}}\n\n== Life ==\nThere is negligible authentic information available about Thiruvalluvar's life.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155}} In fact, neither his actual name nor the original title of his work can be determined with certainty.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125}} ''Tirukkural'' itself does not name its author. [[Monsieur Ariel]], a [[French people|French]] translator of his work in the 19th century, famously said it is \"the book without a name by an author without a name\".{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i}} The name ''Thiruvalluvar'' (''lit.'' Saint Valluvar) was first mentioned in the later text ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]''.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=449-482}}\n\nThe speculations about Thiruvalluvar's life are largely inferred from his work ''Thirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' and other Tamil literature that quote him. According to Zvelebil, Thiruvalluvar was \"probably a learned Jain with eclectic leanings and intimate acquaintance with the early works of Tamil classical period and some knowledge of the Sanskrit legal and didactic texts (''[[subhashita]]'')\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125 with footnotes)}}{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155 with footnotes)}}\n\n===Traditional biographies===\nThe Shaivite Hindu text ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]'' contains the earliest known textual reference to the legend of Thiruvalluvar, but it remains undated.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=456-457}}{{refn|group=note|Blackburn suggests 10th century, but expresses his doubt with a question mark.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|p=454}}}} This text attracted attention in the colonial era, because an early 19th-century commentary referred to him as \"Valluvan\" (Valluvar) whose text presented the \"esoteric wisdom of the Vedas to the world\".{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=456-457}} The original text relates the Kurral in the context of Sanskrit literature. The commentary includes the gloss that Valluvan was \"born in a low caste\", but the original text does not. According to Stuart Blackburn, this comment appears to be extra-textual and possibly based on the [[oral tradition]]. No other pre-colonial textual sources have been found to support any legends about the life of Thiruvalluvar. Starting around early 19th-century, numerous legends on Thiruvalluvar in Indian languages and English were published.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=456-457}}\n\nVarious claims have been made regarding Valluvar's family background and occupation in the colonial era literature, all inferred from selective sections of his text or hagiographies published since the colonial era started in Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=458-464}} One traditional version claims that he was a [[Paraiyar]] weaver.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=124-125}} Another theory is that he must have been from the agricultural caste of [[Vellalar]]s because he extols agriculture in his work.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} Another states he was an outcaste, born to a Pariah woman and Brahmin father.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=458-464}} [[M. Raghava Iyengar|Mu Raghava Iyengar]] speculated that \"valluva\" in his name is a variation of \"vallabha\", the designation of a royal officer.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] derived his name from \"valluvan\" (a Paraiyar caste of royal drummers) and theorized that he was \"the chief of the proclaiming boys analogous to a trumpet-major of an army\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Pavanar, 2017|pp=24\u201326}} Thiruvalluvar was likely married to a woman named Vasuki and lived in Mylapore.{{sfn|Periyanna, 1968|p=23}} According to traditional accounts, Valluvar died on the day of [[Anuradha (nakshatra)|Anusham]] in the Tamil month of [[Vaikasi]].{{sfn|Periyanna, 1968|p=227}}\n\nThe poem ''Kapilar Agaval'', purportedly written by [[Kapilar]], describes its author as a brother of Valluvar. It states that they were children of a [[Pulaya]] mother named Adi and a [[Brahmin]] father named Bhagwan.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=227}} The poem claims that the couple had seven children, including three sons (Valluvar, Kapilar, and Atikaman) and four sisters (Avvai, Uppai, Uruvai, and Velli).{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1991|p=25}} However, this legendary account is spurious.{{sfn|Shuddhananda A. Sarma|2007|p=76}}{{sfn|Ir\u0101maccantiran\u0332 N\u0101kac\u0101mi|1997|p=202}} [[Kamil Zvelebil]] dates ''Kapilar Agaval'' to 15th century CE, based on its language.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=227}} Various biographies mention the name of Valluvar's wife as [[Vasuki (wife of Valluvar)|Vasuki]],{{sfn|Pavanar, 2017|pp=32\u201333}} but such details are of doubtful historicity.{{sfn|Mohan Lal|1992|p=4341}}\n\nThe traditional biographies are not only inconsistent, they contain incredulous claims about Thiruvalluvar. Along with various versions of his birth circumstances, many state he went to a mountain and met the legendary [[Agastya]] and other sages.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=460-464}} During his return journey, he sits under a tree whose shadow sits still over Thiruvalluvar and does not move the entire day, he kills a demon, performs miracles such as causing floods and making them retreat, he touches a grounded ship which miraculously then floats and sails off, his bride Vasuki cooks sand which comes out as boiled rice, and many more.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=460-464}} Scholars consider these and all associated aspects of these hagiographic stories to be fiction and ahistorical, a feature common to \"international and Indian folklore\". The alleged low birth, high birth and being a pariah in the traditional accounts are also doubtful.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=459-464}} \n\nBy 1904, Purnalingam Pillai \u2013 an ardent Dravidianist, had analyzed and called these traditional accounts and stories as myths. Pillai's analysis and arguments are robust, according to Blackburn.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=464-465}} These fictional accounts of Thiruvalluvar's life have become popular because aspects of the traditional accounts were selectively accepted by Christian missionaries such as George Pope and other European writers, were widely published and then became a required reading about Tamil history.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=467-469}}\n\n== Date ==\n{{main| Dating the Tirukkural}}\n[[File:Thiruvalluvar 123.jpg|thumb|180px|Statue of Valluvar in the Thiruvalluvar Temple, Mylapore]]\nThe exact date of Thiruvalluvar is unclear. His work ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' has been dated variously from 300 BCE to about the 6th century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam]] and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed).{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124 with footnotes}} The scholars who believe this tradition, such as [[Somasundara Bharathiar]] and M. Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian [[K. K. Pillay]] assigned it to the early 1st-century CE.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124 with footnotes}} These early dates such as 300 BCE to 1 BCE are unacceptable and not supported by evidence within the text, states Zvelebil. The diction and grammar of the ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'', his indebtedness to some earlier Sanskrit sources, suggest that he lived after the \"early Tamil bardic poets\", but before Tamil bhakti poets era.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124 with footnotes}}\n\nIn 1959, [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] assigned the work to around or after the 6th-century CE. His proposal is based on the evidence that the ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' contains a large proportion of Sanskrit loan words, shows awareness and indebtedness to some Sanskrit texts best dated to the first half of the 1st-millennium CE, and the grammatical innovations in the language of ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37''.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124 with footnotes}}{{refn|group=note|For examples of Sanskrit loan words, see Zvelebil's ''The Smile of Murugan''.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=169-171}}}} Pillai published a list of 137 Sanskrit loan words in ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37''.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=170-171}} Later scholars [[Thomas Burrow]] and [[Murray Barnson Emeneau]] show that 35 of these are of Dravidian origin, and not Sanskrit loan words. Zvelebil states that an additional few have uncertain etymology and future studies may prove those to be Dravidian.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=170-171}} The 102 remaining loan words from Sanskrit are \"not negligible\", and some of the teachings in the ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' states Zvelebil are \"undoubtedly\" based on the then extant Sanskrit works such as the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' and ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (also called the ''Manavadharmasastra'').{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=170-171}}\n\nAccording to Kamil Zvelebil, the ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' does not belong to the ([[Sangam literature|Sangam]]) period. In the 1970s, Zvelebil dated the text to somewhere between 450 and 500 CE.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124}}{{refn|group=note|Zvelebil gives several date ranges.

Another example is the frequent use of condition suffix -el, a feature absent in early Tamil literature and common by about the 5th-century.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=169}}}} and by placing it after some of the Tamil and Sanskrit treatises that are evidenced in the ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37''.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} Zvelebil notes that the text features several grammatical innovations, that are absent in the older [[Sangam literature]]. The text also features a higher number of [[Sanskrit]] [[loan word]]s compared with these older texts.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=169}} According to Zvelebil, besides being part of the ancient Tamil literary tradition, the author was also a part of the \"one great Indian ethical, didactic tradition\", as a few of his verses are \"undoubtedly\" translations of the verses in Sanskrit classics.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=171}}\n\nIn the 19th-century and early 20th-century, European writers and missionaries variously dated the text and Thiruvalluvar to between 400 and 1000 CE.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=454 with footnote 7}} According to Blackburn, the \"current scholarly consensus\" dates the text and the author to approximately 500 CE.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=454 with footnote 7}}\n\nIn January 1935, the [[Government of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu government]] officially recognized 31 BCE as the year of Valluvar. As suggested by [[Maraimalai Adigal]], the [[Valluvar Year]] was added to the calendar.{{sfn|''Thiruvalluvar Ninaivu Malar'', 1935|p=117}} Thus, the Valluvar year is calculated by adding 31 to any year of the common era.{{sfn|Arumugam, 2014|pp=5, 15}}\n\n== Birthplace ==\n[[File:Thiruvalluvar Temple.JPG|thumb|180px|A temple for Thiruvalluvar in [[Mylapore]]]]\nAs with most other details about Valluvar, the exact place of his birth remains uncertain.

The 1819 translation by Ellis mentions that the Tamil community debates whether Thiruvalluvar was a Jain or Hindu.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=463-464}} If Thiruvalluvar was indeed a Jain, it raises questions about the source of the traditional Thiruvalluvar legends and the mainstream colonial debate about his birth.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=463-464}} \n\n[[Kamil Zvelebil]] believes that the ethics of the Tirukkural reflects the [[Jainism|Jain]] moral code, particularly [[vegetarianism]] (TK 251-260), and [[ahimsa]], i.e. \"abstention from killing\" (TK 321-333). Zvelebil states that the text contains epithets for God that reflect Jain ideology:{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}}\n* ''Malarmicaiyekinan'' (Couplet 3), \"he who walked upon the [lotus] flower\"\n* ''Aravaliyantanan'' (Couplet 8), \"the Brahmin [who had] the wheel of dharma\"\n* ''Enkunattan'' (Couplet 9), \"one of the eight-fold qualities\"\n\nThese, according to Zvelebil, are \"very much Jaina-like\" because the arhat is seen as \"standing on the lotus\",{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} or where the ''arhat'' in the Jain conception is the god with the lotus as his vehicle.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155 with footnotes}} There are exceptions, adds Zvelebil, when Thiruvalluvar treats this God with epithets found in the Hindu text ''Manusmriti'' (1.6), i.e. \"the Primeval Lord\" and \"the King, the Monarch\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} Zvelebil states that his proposal is supported by the 13th-century Hindu scholar [[Parimelalhagar]] (Parimelalakar), who wrote a commentary on the Kural text, who admitted that these epithets are \"very well applicable\" to a Jain [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arhat]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} However, according to P.S. Sundaram \u2013 a scholar who has translated the text for Penguin Classics, Parimelalhagar's commentary explicitly states that there are no [Jaina] heretical beliefs in the texts either.{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=xiii-xiv}}\n\nSome other epithets mentioned in the text also reflect a \"strong ascetic flavour\" of Jainism in Zvelebil's view:{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}}\n\n* ''Ventutal ventamai ilan'' (Couplet 4), \"he who has neither desire nor aversion\"\n* ''Porivayil aintavittan'' (Couplet 6), \"he who has destroyed the gates of the five senses\"\n\nZvelebil further states that Valluvar seems to have been \"cognizant of the latest developments\" in Jainism.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} Zvelebil theorizes that he was probably \"a learned Jain with eclectic leanings\", who was well-acquainted with the earlier Tamil literature and also had knowledge of the Sanskrit texts.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155}} Early Digambara or Svetambara Jaina texts do not mention Thiruvalluvar. The first claim of Thiruvalluvar as an authority appears in a 16th-century Jain text, about 1,100 years after his life.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1974|p=119 with footnote 10}}\n\n=== Hinduism ===\nAccording to other scholars, Thiruvalluvar's writings suggest that he belonged to [[Hinduism]]. Hindu teachers have mapped his teachings in ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' to the teachings found in Hindu texts.{{sfn|Swamiji Iraianban|1997|p=13}} Valluvar's treatment of the concept of [[ahimsa]] or [[non-violence]], which is the principal concept in both Jainism and Hinduism, bolsters this argument.{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=xiii-xvii, Appendix note on verse 1103}} While the text extols the virtue of non-violence, it also dedicates many of 700 ''porul'' couplets to various aspects of statecraft and warfare in a manner similar to ''Arthasastra'':<ref name=Roy152/> \"An army has a duty to kill in battle, and a king must execute criminals for justice.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=A.K.

The text, however, does cover ''turavaram'' (renunciation) \u2013 the means to attain spiritual release. Thus, ''vitu'' is indirectly discussed.{{sfn|Norman Cutler|1992|pp=554-555}}\n\nAccording to Tamil Hindu scholars such as Parimelalakar, other concepts and teachings found in Thriuvalluvar's text and also found in Hindu texts include Vedas,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=A.K.

R. Natarajan|2008|pp=1\u20136}} [[Shaivite]]s have characterised Valluvar as a devotee of [[Shiva]] and have installed his images in their temples.{{sfn|Raj Pruthi|Bela Rani Sharma|1995|p=113}} According to Zvelebil, Thiruvalluvar sometimes uses epithets for God that are found in Hindu ''Dharmasastras'' and not in Jaina texts.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} Further, in some teachings about politics, economics, and love, Thiruvalluvar undoubtedly has translated into Tamil the verses found in Hindu texts such as ''Arthasastra''.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=170-171}}\n\nAccording to Stuart Blackburn, the ''Thirukurral'' is not a [[Bhakti movement|bhakti]] text, it neither satirizes nor eulogizes Brahmins or ritualism. It is a practical, pragmatic text and \"certainly not a Shaivite or Vaishnavite\" text.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|p=454}} According to Norman Cutler, Thirukkural is an aphoristic text and the influential Parimelalakar's commentary interprets it within his own context, grounded in Hindu concepts and theological agenda. His elegantly written interpretations have made his commentary a Tamil classic and maneuvered Thiruvalluvar as consistent within the framework of Parimelalakar's Hinduism. His commentary on Thiruvalluvar's teachings reflect both the cultural values and textual values in the 13th to 14th-century Tamil Nadu. Thiruvalluvar's text can be interpreted and maneuvered in other ways.{{sfn|Norman Cutler|1992|pp=558-561, 563}}\n\n===Buddhism===\nThe [[Dalit]] activist [[Iyothee Thass]], who converted to [[Buddhism]], claimed that Valluvar was originally called \"Tiruvalla Nayanar\", and was a Buddhist.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=49}} Thass further contended that the name \"Tirukkural\" is a reference to the Buddhist ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka]]''.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=50}} He claims that Valluvar's book was originally called ''Tirikural'' (\"Three Kurals\"), because it adhered to the three Buddhist scriptures ''[[Abhidhamma Pitaka|Dhamma Pitaka]]'', ''[[Sutta Pitaka]]'', and ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]''.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=49}} According to Thass, the legend that presents Valluvar as the son of a [[Brahmin]] father and a Paraiyar mother was invented by Brahmins in 1825, who wanted to Hinduise a Buddhist text.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=49}} According to Geetha, the deconstruction and reinterpetation of the history of Thiruvalluvar into a Buddhist framework by Thass shows the significance and appropriation of Thiruvalluvar's text by all sections of Tamil society.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=49}}\n\n===Christianity===\nThe 19th-century Christian missionary [[George Uglow Pope]] claimed that Thiruvalluvar must have come in contact with Christian teachers such as [[Pantaenus]] of Alexandria, imbibed Christian ideas and peculiarities of Alexandrian teachers and then wrote the \"wonderful Kurral\" with an echo of the \"Sermon of the Mount\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125}} According to Pope, Thiruvalluvar must have lived in the 9th century AD because that would fit the historical chronology to his theory.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=156-157}} \n\nSince the 1960s, some South Indian Christians led by M. Deivanayagam at the [[Madras Christian College]], have presented Valluvar as a disciple of [[Thomas the Apostle]].{{sfn|Jan A. B. Jongeneel|2009|p=111}} According to this theory, Thomas visited present-day Chennai, where Valluvar listened to his lectures on the [[Sermon of the Mount]].{{sfn|Mohan Lal|1992|p=4341}}{{sfn|Jan A. B. Jongeneel|2009|p=111}} \n\nAccording to [[John Lazarus (missionary)|John Lazarus]], the Kural\u2019s chapter on \"no killing\" applies to both humans and animals, in stark contrast to the Bible\u2019s concept of killing, which refers only to the taking away of human life.{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=42}} He observes, \u201cNone of the ten epithets by which the Deity is described in the opening chapter of the Kural have the remotest connection with Christ or God, that is to say, as they are designated in the Bible.\u201d{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=42}} He also says that the chapter on love \u201cis quite different from the Apostle\u2019s eulogium in 1 Cor. xiii.\u201d{{sfn|Manavalan, 2009|p=42}}\n\nAccording to Zvelebil, the ethics and ideas in Thiruvalluvar's work are not [[Christian ethics]], but those found in [[Jainism]] doctrine.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=156-171}}\n\n== Literary works ==\n{{Main article|Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37}}\n[[File:Tiruvalluvar statue LIC.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Statue of Valluvar at Kanyakumari]]\n''Tirukkural'' is the primary work credited to Thiruvalluvar.

However, in the Tamil literary tradition, Valluvar is attributed to be the author of many other later-dated texts including two Tamil texts on medicine, ''Gnana Vettiyan'' (1500 verses) and ''Pancharathnam'' (500 verses). Many scholars state that these are much later era texts (16th and 17th centuries), possibly by an author with the same name Valluvar.{{sfn| Cuppirama\u1e47iyan\u0332, 1980}} These books, 'Pancharathnam' and 'Gnana Vettiyan', contribute to Tamil science, literature and other [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]] medicines.{{sfn| Zimmermann, 2007|p=8}} In addition to these, 15 other Tamil texts have been attributed to Valluvar, namely, ''Rathna Sigamani'' (800 verses), ''Karpam'' (300 verses), ''Nadhaantha Thiravukol'' (100 verses), ''Naadhaantha Saaram'' (100 verses), ''Vaithiya Suthram'' (100 verses), ''Karpaguru Nool'' (50 verses), ''Muppu Saathiram'' (30 verses), ''Vaadha Saathiram'' (16 verses), ''Muppu Guru'' (11 verses), ''Kavuna Mani'' (100 verses), ''Aeni Yettram'' (100 verses), ''Guru Nool'' (51 verses), ''Sirppa Chinthamani'' (a text on astrology), ''Tiruvalluvar Gyanam'', and ''Tiruvalluvar Kanda Tirunadanam''.{{sfn| Vedanayagam, 2017|p=108}} Several scholars, such as [[Devaneya Pavanar]], deny that Thiruvalluvar was the author of these texts.{{sfn|Pavanar, 2017|p=35}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Thiruvalluvar 1960 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|right|A 1960 commemorative stamp of Valluvar]]\n[[George Uglow Pope]] called Valluvar \"the greatest poet of South India\", but according to Zvelebil, he does not seem to have been a poet.

He is best known as the author of ''[[Tirukkural|Thirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37]]'', a collection of couplets on ethics, political and economical matters, and love. The text is considered an exceptional and widely cherished work of the [[Tamil literature]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=123-124}}\n\nAlmost no authentic information is available about Thiruvalluvar, states [[Kamil Zvelebil]] \u2013 a scholar of Tamil literature.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124}} His life and likely background are variously inferred from his literary works by different biographers. There are unauthentic hagiographic and legendary accounts of Thiruvalluvar life, and all major Indian religions, as well as Christian missionaries of the 19th-century, have tried to claim him as secretly inspired (''crypto-'') or originally belonging to their tradition.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125}} Little is known with certainty about his family background, religious affiliation, or birthplace. He is believed to have lived at least in the town of [[Mylapore]] (a neighbourhood of the present-day [[Chennai]]), and his [[floruit]] is dated variously from 4th century BCE to early 6th century CE, based on the traditional accounts and the linguistic analyses of his writings. Maraimalai Adigal gives 31 BCE as the birth year of Valluvar, while Kamil Zvelebil infers the ''Thirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' and Thiruvalluvar are best dated to around 500 CE.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|pp=155-156 (c. 450\u2013550 CE)}};<br>{{harvnb|Kamil Zvelebil|1974|p=119 (c. 450\u2013500 CE)}};<br>{{harvnb|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124 (c. 500 CE)}}</ref>{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|p=454}}\n\nValluvar has influenced a wide range of scholars down the ages since his time across the ethical, social, political, economical, religious, philosophical, and spiritual spheres.{{sfn|Velusamy and Faraday, 2017|pp=7\u201313}}{{sfn|Sundaramurthi, 2000|p=624}} He has long been venerated as a great sage, and his literary works a classic of Tamil culture.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=168}}\n\n== Life ==\nThere is negligible authentic information available about Thiruvalluvar's life.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155}} In fact, neither his actual name nor the original title of his work can be determined with certainty.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125}} ''Tirukkural'' itself does not name its author. [[Monsieur Ariel]], a [[French people|French]] translator of his work in the 19th century, famously said it is \"the book without a name by an author without a name\".{{sfn|Pope, 1886|p=i}} The name ''Thiruvalluvar'' (''lit.'' Saint Valluvar) was first mentioned in the later text ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]''.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=449-482}}\n\nThe speculations about Thiruvalluvar's life are largely inferred from his work ''Thirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' and other Tamil literature that quote him. According to Zvelebil, Thiruvalluvar was \"probably a learned Jain with eclectic leanings and intimate acquaintance with the early works of Tamil classical period and some knowledge of the Sanskrit legal and didactic texts (''[[subhashita]]'')\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125 with footnotes)}}{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155 with footnotes)}}\n\n===Traditional biographies===\nThe Shaivite Hindu text ''[[Tiruvalluva Maalai]]'' contains the earliest known textual reference to the legend of Thiruvalluvar, but it remains undated.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=456-457}}{{refn|group=note|Blackburn suggests 10th century, but expresses his doubt with a question mark.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|p=454}}}} This text attracted attention in the colonial era, because an early 19th-century commentary referred to him as \"Valluvan\" (Valluvar) whose text presented the \"esoteric wisdom of the Vedas to the world\".{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=456-457}} The original text relates the Kurral in the context of Sanskrit literature. The commentary includes the gloss that Valluvan was \"born in a low caste\", but the original text does not. According to Stuart Blackburn, this comment appears to be extra-textual and possibly based on the [[oral tradition]]. No other pre-colonial textual sources have been found to support any legends about the life of Thiruvalluvar. Starting around early 19th-century, numerous legends on Thiruvalluvar in Indian languages and English were published.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=456-457}}\n\nVarious claims have been made regarding Valluvar's family background and occupation in the colonial era literature, all inferred from selective sections of his text or hagiographies published since the colonial era started in Tamil Nadu.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=458-464}} One traditional version claims that he was a [[Paraiyar]] weaver.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|pp=124-125}} Another theory is that he must have been from the agricultural caste of [[Vellalar]]s because he extols agriculture in his work.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} Another states he was an outcaste, born to a Pariah woman and Brahmin father.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=458-464}} [[M. Raghava Iyengar|Mu Raghava Iyengar]] speculated that \"valluva\" in his name is a variation of \"vallabha\", the designation of a royal officer.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}} [[S. Vaiyapuri Pillai]] derived his name from \"valluvan\" (a Paraiyar caste of royal drummers) and theorized that he was \"the chief of the proclaiming boys analogous to a trumpet-major of an army\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=156}}{{sfn|Pavanar, 2017|pp=24\u201326}} Thiruvalluvar was likely married to a woman named Vasuki and lived in Mylapore.{{sfn|Periyanna, 1968|p=23}} According to traditional accounts, Valluvar died on the day of [[Anuradha (nakshatra)|Anusham]] in the Tamil month of [[Vaikasi]].{{sfn|Periyanna, 1968|p=227}}\n\nThe poem ''Kapilar Agaval'', purportedly written by [[Kapilar]], describes its author as a brother of Valluvar. It states that they were children of a [[Pulaya]] mother named Adi and a [[Brahmin]] father named Bhagwan.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=227}} The poem claims that the couple had seven children, including three sons (Valluvar, Kapilar, and Atikaman) and four sisters (Avvai, Uppai, Uruvai, and Velli).{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1991|p=25}} However, this legendary account is spurious.{{sfn|Shuddhananda A. Sarma|2007|p=76}}{{sfn|Ir\u0101maccantiran\u0332 N\u0101kac\u0101mi|1997|p=202}} [[Kamil Zvelebil]] dates ''Kapilar Agaval'' to 15th century CE, based on its language.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=227}} Various biographies mention the name of Valluvar's wife as [[Vasuki (wife of Valluvar)|Vasuki]],{{sfn|Pavanar, 2017|pp=32\u201333}} but such details are of doubtful historicity.{{sfn|Mohan Lal|1992|p=4341}}\n\nThe traditional biographies are not only inconsistent, they contain incredulous claims about Thiruvalluvar. Along with various versions of his birth circumstances, many state he went to a mountain and met the legendary [[Agastya]] and other sages.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=460-464}} During his return journey, he sits under a tree whose shadow sits still over Thiruvalluvar and does not move the entire day, he kills a demon, performs miracles such as causing floods and making them retreat, he touches a grounded ship which miraculously then floats and sails off, his bride Vasuki cooks sand which comes out as boiled rice, and many more.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=460-464}} Scholars consider these and all associated aspects of these hagiographic stories to be fiction and ahistorical, a feature common to \"international and Indian folklore\". The alleged low birth, high birth and being a pariah in the traditional accounts are also doubtful.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=459-464}} \n\nBy 1904, Purnalingam Pillai \u2013 an ardent Dravidianist, had analyzed and called these traditional accounts and stories as myths. Pillai's analysis and arguments are robust, according to Blackburn.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=464-465}} These fictional accounts of Thiruvalluvar's life have become popular because aspects of the traditional accounts were selectively accepted by Christian missionaries such as George Pope and other European writers, were widely published and then became a required reading about Tamil history.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=467-469}}\n\n== Date ==\n{{main| Dating the Tirukkural}}\n[[File:Thiruvalluvar 123.jpg|thumb|180px|Statue of Valluvar in the Thiruvalluvar Temple, Mylapore]]\nThe exact date of Thiruvalluvar is unclear. His work ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' has been dated variously from 300 BCE to about the 6th century CE. According to traditional accounts, it was the last work of the third [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam]] and was subjected to a divine test (which it passed).{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124 with footnotes}} The scholars who believe this tradition, such as [[Somasundara Bharathiar]] and M. Rajamanickam, date the text to as early as 300 BCE. Historian [[K. K. Pillay]] assigned it to the early 1st-century CE.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=124 with footnotes}} These early dates such as 300 BCE to 1 BCE are unacceptable and not supported by evidence within the text, states Zvelebil.

The 1819 translation by Ellis mentions that the Tamil community debates whether Thiruvalluvar was a Jain or Hindu.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=463-464}} If Thiruvalluvar was indeed a Jain, it raises questions about the source of the traditional Thiruvalluvar legends and the mainstream colonial debate about his birth.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=463-464}} \n\n[[Kamil Zvelebil]] believes that the ethics of the Tirukkural reflects the [[Jainism|Jain]] moral code, particularly [[vegetarianism]] (TK 251-260), and [[ahimsa]], i.e. \"abstention from killing\" (TK 321-333). Zvelebil states that the text contains epithets for God that reflect Jain ideology:{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}}\n* ''Malarmicaiyekinan'' (Couplet 3), \"he who walked upon the [lotus] flower\"\n* ''Aravaliyantanan'' (Couplet 8), \"the Brahmin [who had] the wheel of dharma\"\n* ''Enkunattan'' (Couplet 9), \"one of the eight-fold qualities\"\n\nThese, according to Zvelebil, are \"very much Jaina-like\" because the arhat is seen as \"standing on the lotus\",{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} or where the ''arhat'' in the Jain conception is the god with the lotus as his vehicle.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1975|p=125 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155 with footnotes}} There are exceptions, adds Zvelebil, when Thiruvalluvar treats this God with epithets found in the Hindu text ''Manusmriti'' (1.6), i.e. \"the Primeval Lord\" and \"the King, the Monarch\".{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} Zvelebil states that his proposal is supported by the 13th-century Hindu scholar [[Parimelalhagar]] (Parimelalakar), who wrote a commentary on the Kural text, who admitted that these epithets are \"very well applicable\" to a Jain [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arhat]].{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} However, according to P.S. Sundaram \u2013 a scholar who has translated the text for Penguin Classics, Parimelalhagar's commentary explicitly states that there are no [Jaina] heretical beliefs in the texts either.{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=xiii-xiv}}\n\nSome other epithets mentioned in the text also reflect a \"strong ascetic flavour\" of Jainism in Zvelebil's view:{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}}\n\n* ''Ventutal ventamai ilan'' (Couplet 4), \"he who has neither desire nor aversion\"\n* ''Porivayil aintavittan'' (Couplet 6), \"he who has destroyed the gates of the five senses\"\n\nZvelebil further states that Valluvar seems to have been \"cognizant of the latest developments\" in Jainism.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=157}} Zvelebil theorizes that he was probably \"a learned Jain with eclectic leanings\", who was well-acquainted with the earlier Tamil literature and also had knowledge of the Sanskrit texts.{{sfn|Kamil Zvelebil|1973|p=155}} Early Digambara or Svetambara Jaina texts do not mention Thiruvalluvar.

Hindu teachers have mapped his teachings in ''Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37'' to the teachings found in Hindu texts.{{sfn|Swamiji Iraianban|1997|p=13}} Valluvar's treatment of the concept of [[ahimsa]] or [[non-violence]], which is the principal concept in both Jainism and Hinduism, bolsters this argument.{{sfn|P.S. Sundaram|1987|pp=xiii-xvii, Appendix note on verse 1103}} While the text extols the virtue of non-violence, it also dedicates many of 700 ''porul'' couplets to various aspects of statecraft and warfare in a manner similar to ''Arthasastra'':<ref name=Roy152/> \"An army has a duty to kill in battle, and a king must execute criminals for justice.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=A.K.

It is a practical, pragmatic text and \"certainly not a Shaivite or Vaishnavite\" text.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|p=454}} According to Norman Cutler, Thirukkural is an aphoristic text and the influential Parimelalakar's commentary interprets it within his own context, grounded in Hindu concepts and theological agenda. His elegantly written interpretations have made his commentary a Tamil classic and maneuvered Thiruvalluvar as consistent within the framework of Parimelalakar's Hinduism. His commentary on Thiruvalluvar's teachings reflect both the cultural values and textual values in the 13th to 14th-century Tamil Nadu. Thiruvalluvar's text can be interpreted and maneuvered in other ways.{{sfn|Norman Cutler|1992|pp=558-561, 563}}\n\n===Buddhism===\nThe [[Dalit]] activist [[Iyothee Thass]], who converted to [[Buddhism]], claimed that Valluvar was originally called \"Tiruvalla Nayanar\", and was a Buddhist.{{sfn|K.

A. Geetha|2015|p=49}} According to Thass, the legend that presents Valluvar as the son of a [[Brahmin]] father and a Paraiyar mother was invented by Brahmins in 1825, who wanted to Hinduise a Buddhist text.{{sfn|K. A. Geetha|2015|p=49}} According to Geetha, the deconstruction and reinterpetation of the history of Thiruvalluvar into a Buddhist framework by Thass shows the significance and appropriation of Thiruvalluvar's text by all sections of Tamil society.{{sfn|K.

However, in the Tamil literary tradition, Valluvar is attributed to be the author of many other later-dated texts including two Tamil texts on medicine, ''Gnana Vettiyan'' (1500 verses) and ''Pancharathnam'' (500 verses). Many scholars state that these are much later era texts (16th and 17th centuries), possibly by an author with the same name Valluvar.{{sfn| Cuppirama\u1e47iyan\u0332, 1980}} These books, 'Pancharathnam' and 'Gnana Vettiyan', contribute to Tamil science, literature and other [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]] medicines.{{sfn| Zimmermann, 2007|p=8}} In addition to these, 15 other Tamil texts have been attributed to Valluvar, namely, ''Rathna Sigamani'' (800 verses), ''Karpam'' (300 verses), ''Nadhaantha Thiravukol'' (100 verses), ''Naadhaantha Saaram'' (100 verses), ''Vaithiya Suthram'' (100 verses), ''Karpaguru Nool'' (50 verses), ''Muppu Saathiram'' (30 verses), ''Vaadha Saathiram'' (16 verses), ''Muppu Guru'' (11 verses), ''Kavuna Mani'' (100 verses), ''Aeni Yettram'' (100 verses), ''Guru Nool'' (51 verses), ''Sirppa Chinthamani'' (a text on astrology), ''Tiruvalluvar Gyanam'', and ''Tiruvalluvar Kanda Tirunadanam''.{{sfn| Vedanayagam, 2017|p=108}} Several scholars, such as [[Devaneya Pavanar]], deny that Thiruvalluvar was the author of these texts.{{sfn|Pavanar, 2017|p=35}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Thiruvalluvar 1960 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|right|A 1960 commemorative stamp of Valluvar]]\n[[George Uglow Pope]] called Valluvar \"the greatest poet of South India\", but according to Zvelebil, he does not seem to have been a poet.

Gover, for example, praised it as \"Tamil Homer, The Ten Commandments and Dante rolled into one\".{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|p=455}} During the colonial era, it was the text the Hindus used to respond to the \"Christian allegations of Hindu superstition and barbarity\".{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|p=459}}\n\n===Temples===\nIn the early 16th century, a [[Thiruvalluvar Temple|temple]] was built within the Ekambareeswara-Kamakshi (Shiva-Parvati) temple complex in [[Mylapore]], [[Chennai]], in honor of Valluvar.<ref name=\"Waghorne2004p120\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHo8DwAAQBAJ |title=Diaspora of the Gods: Modern Hindu Temples in an Urban Middle-Class World |last=Joanne Punzo Waghorne |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-515663-8 |pages=120\u2013125}}</ref> The locals believe that this is where Valluvar was born, underneath a tree within the shrines complex.

Clockwise from top: Ainz, Demiurge, Sebas, Albedo and Cocytus, Shalltear, Mare, and Aura.}}\nThis is a list of characters appearing in the novel series ''[[Overlord (novel series)|Overlord]]'', written by Kugane Maruyama and illustrated by so-bin, and its [[anime]] and [[manga]] adaptations.\n\n==Great Tomb of Nazarick==\nThe {{Nihongo|Great Tomb of Nazarick|\u30ca\u30b6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af \u5730\u4e0b\u5927\u58b3\u5893|Nazarikku Chika Dai Funbo}}, usually referred to as Nazarick, is the guild headquarters of the guild {{Nihongo|Ainz Ooal Gown|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} in YGGDRASIL. Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in Yggdrasil, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in Yggdrasil, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:The overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him and has attempted to seduce and even rape him on multiple occasions. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She also harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving her and the other NPCs. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful vampire girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a demon dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. They also often serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians. While they must follow the commands of their respective floor Guardian while outside their specific area, they answer only to Ainz while within it.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing him to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\". It is a parasitic creature, using humans as a \"House\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neuronist Painkill|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30eb|\nNy\u016bronisuto Peinkiru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] (anime)|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}\n:Nazarick's Special Intelligence Investigator in charge of interrogating and torturing prisoners and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Occupation\". She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the throne room. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World. Also, despite their appearances, they actually have no skills as maids.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's a werewolf in human form and serves as the group's healer. In public, she is a sociable and friendly person who likes to make lewd jokes. However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form. Instead, she is the strongest of the Pleiades, being a magic caster that specializes in lightning spells. She serves as Ainz' companion while under his \"Momon\" identity, going by the alias {{Nihongo|Nabe|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9|N\u0101be}}. However, she despises and looks down on humans, which often causes trouble for him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|CZ2128 Delta|\u30b7\u30ba\u30fb\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf|Shizu Deruta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Seto]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Michelle Rojas]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's an automaton who fights using guns and war knives. While silent and emotionless, she holds no particular dislike towards humans.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Solution Epsilon|\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30fb\u30a4\u30d7\u30b7\u30ed\u30f3|Soryushan Ipushiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayane Sakura]] (drama CD, anime)|Mallorie Rodak}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Slime that takes on a human form. She is an assassin and can absorb people and objects into her body to be stored or devoured. Being a Slime, she preys on humans and generally despises and looks down on them.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Entoma Vasilissa Zeta|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c8\u30de\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30b7\u30ea\u30c3\u30b5\u30fb\u30bc\u30fc\u30bf|Entoma Vuashirissa Z\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kei Shindo]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Tia Ballard]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is an Insectoid who disguises herself as a human by wearing a mask and changing her voice. She is an entomancer, being able to summon fellow Insectoids. Being an Insectoid, she preys on humans when hungry, but otherwise doesn't consider them worth her attention. She harbors a grudge towards Evileye from the Adventurer Group Blue Rose, who defeated and humiliated her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aureole Omega|\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30aa\u30e1\u30ac|\u014cre\u014dru Omega}}\n:The leader of Pleiades and the Area Guardian of the region known as the Cherry Blossom Sanctuary. Due to her dual positions, she is unable to lead the group most of the time, causing Yuri Alpha to serve as leader in her stead. She is in charge of Nazarick's Teleportation Gates. She stated to be to only Human NPC in Nazarick. However, most don't consider her human due to her being immortal. Ainz seems to trust her a great deal, entrusting her with the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown whenever he leaves Nazarick.\n\n===Others===\n;{{nihongo|Pestonya Shortcake Wanko|\u30da\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30fb\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3|Pesut\u014dnya Sh\u014dtok\u0113ki Wanko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]|[[Jamie Marchi]]}}\n:The Head-Maid of Nazarick. She has the body of a human but the head of a Shetland Sheepdog with a vertical scar on her face running down the center of her face. She harbors no dislike towards human and is even willing to rescue them from her fellow NPCs' cruelty.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Eclair Ecleir Eicler|\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fb\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30a8\u30a4\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fc|\nEkurea Ekur\u0113ru Eikure\u0101}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nobuyuki Hiyama]]|Kyle Phillips}}\n:The assistant butler of Nazarick. He takes on the form of an emperor penguin with a superiority complex. He has been programmed with a desire to overthrow Ainz and take over Nazarick as a gag by his creator. The other NPCs are fully aware of this, but they don't care as he poses no threat and they know it is just a part of his settings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nigredo|\u30cb\u30b0\u30ec\u30c9|Niguredo}}\n:The older sister of Albedo, being created by the same creator. She specializes in information gathering. While she bears some similarity to Albedo, her face has no skin, resulting in a twisted appearance. Her mind is similarly broken, unless a baby-doll is given to her. However, while she has a body-doll, is actually one of the few NPCs of Nazarick that is genuinely kind-hearted. Despite being polar opposites in appearance and personality, she and Albedo generally get along just fine.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rubedo|\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|\nRubedo}}\n:The Younger sister of Albedo and Nigredo, being created by the same creator. She is the strongest NPC in Nazarick. Not much is known about her, but Albedo loves her while Nigredo fears her.\n==New World==\nThe New World is the world where Nazarick was transported to. There seems to be some sort of connection between this world and \"YGGDRASIL\", as it is implied that Players from the game are transported to it every couple of centuries. The world once had its own form of magic known as \"Wild Magic\". However, after Players introduced their \"Tier Magic\", it became more and more scarce. This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence. While Ainz obtained the loyalty of the world's inhabitants though mostly peaceful methods, the NPCs violently conquered any territory they laid their eyes on.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hamsuke/The Wise King of the Forest|\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30b1|Hamusuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akeno Watanabe]] (drama CD, anime)|Heather Walker}}\n:A giant female Hamster with a snake-like tail that lived in the forest near Carne Village. She was thought to be the strongest beast among the forest denizens. While publicly known as \"The Wise King of the Forest\", she's actually more-or-less a dense idiot, though she is capable of human speech. Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame. Upon finding her, however, he is extremely disappointed, not understanding what others see in her, and proceeds to easily defeat her. He then promptly tames her and names her \"Hamsuke\". She then joins Ainz's adventurer group as his registered beast and totally devotes herself to him. While initially arrogant due to being strong by the New World's standards, upon meeting Nazarick's NPCs she realizes her weakness and devotes herself to becoming stronger.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tuareninya Veyron|\u30c4\u30a2\u30ec\u30cb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3|Tsuaren\u012bnya Beiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]] (Japanese)|Rachel Glass}}\n:Nazarick's newest apprentice-maid under Sebas Tian's supervision. She was a slave of Eight Fingers until Sebas found and saved her while on a mission. He nursed her back to health and she slowly opened up to him, eventually even developing a crush on him. However, this brought Sebas' loyalty to Ainz in question and they were both forced to appear before him.

He too was eventually killed when he was transported to Kyouhukou's residence, where he is currently being devoured by cockroaches forever (as Kyouhukou said that he will keep healing him once he gets to the brink of death.)\n\n====Tenmu====\n{{Nihongo|Tenmu|\u5929\u6b66|Tenmu}} was a Worker Group based in the Baharuth Empire. While a Group in name, aside from the leader, all other members were his Elven slaves. They were one of four Worker Groups hired to raid Nazarick. The group was disbanded after the leader died.

Not wanting a commoner in such a high position, the Kingdom's nobles try to limit his actions. One such case was by preventing him from being knighted. In response to this, the king created a new title just for him: 'Warrior Captain', and gave him his own 'Warrior Troop' to command. He first met Ainz while investigating the destruction of several villages and came to greatly respect him due to him saving Carne Village. Unfortunately, they later became enemies when the Kingdom and Nazarick went to war with each other. He challenged Ainz to a one-on-one duel where the latter reluctantly killed him. Before his death, he wished not to be resurrected should he lose, so Ainz honored his wish by casting a spell on him that invalidates resurrection.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brain Unglaus|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9|Burein Angurausu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Koji Yusa]] (anime)|Chad Halbrook}}\n:A warrior turned mercenary who sees himself as Gazef's rival.

He barely managed to flee the Vampire. After that his will is shattered, stating how the peak of the strongest cannot be climbed by weak beings like humans. He regains his will, when he sees Climb, withstand the intense killing intent from Sebas, understanding that humans can still change and become stronger. When he re-encounters Shalltear (who does not remember him due to the mind control she faced), he manages to cut the nail on her Pinky finger, which reinforces the belief that he can still try to beat her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Climb|\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0|Climu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]|Coby Lewin}}\n:The Personal Bodyguard of Princess Renner.

However, he remains unaware of Renner's true nature. He is rather disliked due to him having such a position despite not even being a commoner, but an urchin. Despite this position, he holds no talent at fighting, making up for it with sheer effort. He eventually meets Sebas and, after convincing him to teach him some of his skills, they become friends, though he remains unaware of his loyalty towards Ainz.

After the liberation, she became the leader of a cult that worships Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Remedios Custodio|\u30ec\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b9\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Remediosu Kasutodio}}\n:The former bodyguard of the late Holy Queen Calca as well as the elder sister of High-Priestess Kelart and the grandmaster of the Paladin Order. She is also a member of the Nine Colors, holding the title of 'White'. She is highly self-righteous and driven mainly by her emotions, which often prevents her from making tough decisions and makes her a general inconvenience to others. After the fall of the Northern Holy Kingdom, she became a captain in the 'Holy Kingdom Liberation Army'. She holds prejudice towards demi-humans and distrusts Ainz, due to his undead nature, which only grows worse as he earns the citizens' trust. After the liberation, the new Holy King, Caspond, has her demoted.\n\n====Paladin Order====\nThe Paladin Order is the highest knight order in the Holy Kingdom, which its members specializing in both swordsmanship and magic.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gustav Montagn\u00e9s|\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fb\u30e2\u30f3\u30bf\u30cb\u30a7\u30b9|Gusut\u0101bo Montanyesu}}\n:An adjudant of the Paladin Order. Unlike his superior, Remedios, he is a realist who is willing to compromise on his ideals if necessary. Due to this, he often serves as an adviser as well as a voice of reason to her. After the liberation, the new Holy King, Caspond, promotes him to grandmaster of the order, taking Remedios' place\n\n====Hoburns====\n{{Nihongo|Hoburns|\u30db\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9|Hobansu}} is the capital of the Holy Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Calca Bessarez|\u30ab\u30eb\u30ab\u30fb\u30d9\u30b5\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9|Karuka Bes\u0101resu}}\n:The former Holy Queen of the Holy Kingdom as well as the first female monarch in the nation's history. She cared deeply about the well-being of her nation and people and her kindness even extended to non-violent Demi-Humans. She was also a divine-magic prodigy.

Unfortunately, she was taken captive and used as a blunt weapon to, very literally, beat her own soldiers before later dying while in captivity.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Caspond Bessarez|\u30ab\u30b9\u30dd\u30f3\u30c9\u30fb\u30d9\u30b5\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9|Kasupondo Bes\u0101resu}}\n:The current Holy King and the older brother of the Holy Queen Calca. Despite being the elder brother, he gave up his claim to the throne. After Jaldabaoth laid siege to the Northern Holy Kingdom, he was taken prisoner by Demi-Humans until he was rescued by the \"Holy Kingdom Liberation Army\". Afterwards, he took command of the Liberation Army and led it to victory. Unbeknownst to the public, however, the 'real' Caspond is long dead, replaced by a D\u00f6ppelganger serving Demiurge and is currently working to destabilize the Holy Kingdom.\n\n====Temple of the Four Great Gods====\nThe Temple of the Four Great Gods is the primary religious institution of the Holy Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kelart Custodio|\u30b1\u30e9\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Keraruto Kasutodio}}\n:The High Priestess of Holy Kingdom and younger sister of Remedios. She is similar to her sister, but calmer. She is also a powerful magic caster by New World standards. When Jaldabaoth attacked the Holy Kingdom, she was by Holy Queen Calca's side as she faced him, but they were defeated and she was killed. Her head was later taken by a demon and used for magic, before the demon was defeated by Neia and CZ.\n\n====Nine Colors====\nThe {{Nihongo|Nine Colors|\u4e5d\u8272|Ky\u016b-shoku}} is a group of individuals who's skills were recognized by the Holy Kingdom.

At least two of members, including the leader, were Players from YGGDRASIL. Also, despite the name, there were actually more than thirteen members. However, the others were non-humans and thus weren't honored.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rigrit Bers Caurau|\u30ea\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30b9\u30fc\u30fb\u30ab\u30a6\u30e9\u30a6|Riguritto Berus\u016b Kaurau}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Masako Nozawa]]|[[Wendy Powell]]}}\n:A member of the Thirteen Heroes 200 years ago. She is a Necromancer who used her abilities to extend her life beyond natural limits. Despite her age, she maintains a cheerful and mischievous personality. She was also a member of Blue Rose for a while, being the one who transformed it into a top-ranked Adventurer group, but retired and forced Evileye to take her place on the team. She sees Nazarick as a great threat to the New World.\n\n====Dragon Lords====\n{{Nihongo|Dragon Lord|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9|Doragonr\u014ddo}} is a title for the most powerful dragons in the New World. As dragons are the strongest species, Dragon Lords are the strongest beings in the New World. However, around 500 years ago, they went to war with the YGGDRASIL players known as the {{Nihongo|Eight Greed Kings|\u516b\u6b32\u738b|Hachiyoku-o}} and lost, resulting in their kind being reduced to a handful.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tsaindorcus Vaision|\u30c4\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\uff1d\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3|Tsuaindorukusu vuaishion}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Jin Yamanoi]]|[[R.

Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in Yggdrasil, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in Yggdrasil, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:The overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him and has attempted to seduce and even rape him on multiple occasions. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She also harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving her and the other NPCs. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful vampire girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a demon dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. They also often serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians. While they must follow the commands of their respective floor Guardian while outside their specific area, they answer only to Ainz while within it.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing him to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\". It is a parasitic creature, using humans as a \"House\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neuronist Painkill|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30eb|\nNy\u016bronisuto Peinkiru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] (anime)|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}\n:Nazarick's Special Intelligence Investigator in charge of interrogating and torturing prisoners and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Occupation\". She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the throne room. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World. Also, despite their appearances, they actually have no skills as maids.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's a werewolf in human form and serves as the group's healer. In public, she is a sociable and friendly person who likes to make lewd jokes. However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form. Instead, she is the strongest of the Pleiades, being a magic caster that specializes in lightning spells.

This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence.

Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame. Upon finding her, however, he is extremely disappointed, not understanding what others see in her, and proceeds to easily defeat her. He then promptly tames her and names her \"Hamsuke\". She then joins Ainz's adventurer group as his registered beast and totally devotes herself to him. While initially arrogant due to being strong by the New World's standards, upon meeting Nazarick's NPCs she realizes her weakness and devotes herself to becoming stronger.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tuareninya Veyron|\u30c4\u30a2\u30ec\u30cb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3|Tsuaren\u012bnya Beiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]] (Japanese)|Rachel Glass}}\n:Nazarick's newest apprentice-maid under Sebas Tian's supervision.

Learning about Ainz didn't change her feelings towards Sebas, however, as she was willing to let him kill her to prove his loyalty. Luckily, this was merely a test and her life was spared.

He manages to create a Purple potion, out of materials from Nazarick and the new world, which works better than the blue potion but still less than Yggdrasil's Red Potion. Ainz is pleased with this step forward but hopes that he can at least make this kind of potion out of materials from the New World.

She also joins the Villagers in fighting against the Kingdom and for Ainz in the 9th Novel.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lizzie Bareare|\u30ea\u30a3\u30b8\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30a2\u30ec|Ryij\u012b Bareare}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ikuko Tani]] (anime)|[[Juli Erickson]]}}\n:Nfirea's grandmother, considered the best pharmacist in E-Rantel.

In response, the tribes formed an alliance, but were defeated.

They eventually become closer and marry and even have a son, who is an albino. She becomes a representative for the Lizard people, after the fight against Cocytus. She meets Ainz, talking to him in fear and respect, and he offers to bring back Zaryusu in return for her acting as an informant to him, for any sign of rebellion. She is the most powerful magic caster among the lizardmen, but due to her skin, she is extremely vulnerable to the sun, making her wear a ridiculous bush outfit whenever she goes out in the day.

However, his scheme was seen through and he was forced to travel to the tomb to apologize to Ainz. Upon seeing the power of Nazarick, he proposed an alliance to prevent them from attacking the Empire. He planned on forming an alliance with the other human nations against Nazarick, but they abandoned him. Afterwards, the Emperor gave up and submitted to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Fluder Paradyne|\u30d5\u30fc\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30fb\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30f3|F\u016br\u016bda Paradain}}\n:{{voiced by|Takaya Hashi|Kenny Green}}\n:The imperial court wizard of the Empire and one of the strongest Magic casters in the New World.

Unlike most dragons, who are brute and violent, he has a more scholarly in attitude. Due to constant reading, he has weak eyesight, causing him to wear a pair of spectacles. He is also fat and timid to the point of cowardness. When Ainz invaded his family's home, he was sent by his father to stop him. However, he realized that there was no match for the undead and surrendered. He then swore loyalty to him and is given to Aura as a pet.

To this end, he waged war against the Dwarfs and forged an alliance with the Frost Dragons.

When Aura and Shalltear appeared before him and told him to surrender, the king was too stunted by the seemingly ridiculous demand to answer. As a result, he had to watch as the pair massacred his brethren.
