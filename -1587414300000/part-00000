Caramelldansen is known in Japan as \"Uma uma dance\" (\u30a6\u30de\u30a6\u30de\u30c0\u30f3\u30b9), because the chorus's lyrics \"''u-u-ua-ua''\" [[soramimi|were misheard]] as \u30a6\u30c3\u30fc\u30a6\u30c3\u30fc\u30a6\u30de\u30a6\u30de (\"u- u- umauma\"; \"uma\" has been interpreted as {{nihongo|\"yummy\", \"nice\"|\u3046\u307e\u3044|umai|slurred: {{nihongo||\u3046\u3081\u3047|um\u0113}} or {{nihongo|\"horse\"|\u99ac|uma}} in Japanese}}. The Japanese title is sometimes written with the symbol (\uff9f\u2200\uff9f) added to the end. Also, Japanese listeners have interpreted the lyrics, \"''Dansa med oss, klappa era h\u00e4nder''\" (''\"Dance with us, clap your hands\"''), as \"''Barusamiko-su Yappa irahen de''\" (\"(I) don't want any [[Balsamic vinegar]] after all\" in the [[Kansai dialect]]). Thus, the song [[soramimi|has a different interpretation]] in Japan than in Sweden.\n\nIn April 2008, Japanese music distributor [[Quake Inc.]] gained the rights from the original Caramell producers, [[Remixed Records]], to distribute the sped-up version of the original song in Asia, releasing first an album which included Caramelldansen and other popular meme songs at the time, this follows up an album sung by Toromi, the voice actor who played Mii in Popotan who sang her own version of the song,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mise.pupu.jp/torouma/index.htm |title=Toro\u2606Uma Album |publisher=Mise.pupu.jp |accessdate=January 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219044056/http://mise.pupu.jp/torouma/index.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> and follows a single and an album dedicated to the Swedish band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umauma.cd/ |title=Japanese Caramelldansen discography |publisher=Umauma.cd |accessdate=January 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624204428/http://umauma.cd/ |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref> On May 25, 2008, Caramelldansen achieved number one in the international music chart in Japan for two weeks, and on June 2 managed to obtain number sixteen in the Japanese combined chart, beating [[Bon Jovi]] with their song \"[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi song)|Have a Nice Day]]\" the last one who entered that chart three years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://umaumanewsblog.blog21.fc2.com/blog-entry-17.html |title=Caramelldansen at number one on the Japanese International chart |publisher=Umaumanewsblog.blog21.fc2.com |date= |accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://umaumanewsblog.blog21.fc2.com/blog-entry-18.html |title=Caramelldansen at number sixteen on the Japanese combined chart |publisher=Umaumanewsblog.blog21.fc2.com |date= |accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/d/more/2/ |title=music charts rank for Caramelldansen |publisher=Oricon.co.jp |date=December 27, 2011 |accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://zip-fm.co.jp/latest_chart/dance_hits/ |title=music charts rank for Caramelldansen |publisher=Zip-fm.co.jp |date=December 25, 2011 |accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref> One part of the song predicts its worldwide popularity.

To avoid [[backtracking]] or guessing, the LR parser is allowed to peek ahead at ''k'' [[Parsing#Lookahead|lookahead]] input [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s before deciding how to parse earlier symbols. Typically ''k'' is 1 and is not mentioned. The name LR is often preceded by other qualifiers, as in '''SLR''' and '''LALR'''.  The '''LR(''k'')''' condition for a grammar was suggested by Knuth to stand for \"translatable from left to right with bound ''k''.\"<ref name=\"Knuth 1965\"/>\n\nLR parsers are deterministic; they produce a single correct parse without guesswork or backtracking, in linear time.  This is ideal for computer languages, but LR parsers are not suited for human languages which need more flexible but inevitably slower methods.  Some methods which can parse arbitrary context-free languages (e.g., [[CYK algorithm|Cocke\u2013Younger\u2013Kasami]], [[Earley parser|Earley]], [[GLR parser|GLR]]) have worst-case performance of O(''n''<sup>3</sup>) time.  Other methods which backtrack or yield multiple parses may even take exponential time when they guess badly.<ref name=\"AhoUllman 1972\">{{cite book |last1=Aho |first1=Alfred V. |authorlink1=Alfred Aho |last2=Ullman |first2=Jeffrey D. |authorlink2=Jeffrey Ullman |title=The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling (Volume 1: Parsing.) |year=1972 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]] |isbn=978-0139145568 |edition=Repr. |url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofparsingt00ahoa }}</ref>\n\nThe above properties of '''L''', '''R''', and '''k''' are actually shared by all [[shift-reduce parser]]s, including [[simple precedence parser|precedence parser]]s. But by convention, the LR name stands for the form of parsing invented by [[Donald Knuth]], and excludes the earlier, less powerful precedence methods (for example [[Operator-precedence parser]]).<ref name=\"Knuth 1965\"/>\nLR parsers can handle a larger range of languages and grammars than precedence parsers or top-down [[LL parsing]].<ref>[https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/43 Language theoretic comparison of LL and LR grammars]</ref> This is because the LR parser waits until it has seen an entire instance of some grammar pattern before committing to what it has found. An LL parser has to decide or guess what it is seeing much sooner, when it has only seen the leftmost input symbol of that pattern.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Bottom-up parse tree for example {{nowrap | A*2 + 1 }}===\n\n[[File:Shift-Reduce Parse Steps for A*2+1.svg|thumb|x200px|right|Bottom-up parse tree built in numbered steps]]\n\nAn LR parser scans and parses the input text in one forward pass over the text.  The parser builds up the [[parse tree]] incrementally, bottom up, and left to right, without guessing or backtracking.  At every point in this pass, the parser has accumulated a list of subtrees or phrases of the input text that have been already parsed.  Those subtrees are not yet joined together because the parser has not yet reached the right end of the syntax pattern that will combine them.\n\nAt step 6 in an example parse, only \"A*2\" has been parsed, incompletely.  Only the shaded lower-left corner of the parse tree exists.  None of the parse tree nodes numbered 7 and above exist yet.  Nodes 3, 4, and 6 are the roots of isolated subtrees for variable A, operator *, and number 2, respectively.  These three root nodes are temporarily held in a parse stack.  The remaining unparsed portion of the input stream is \"+ 1\".\n\n===Shift and reduce actions===\n\nAs with other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser works by doing some combination of Shift steps and Reduce steps.  \n* A '''Shift''' step advances in the input stream by one symbol.  That shifted symbol becomes a new single-node parse tree.\n* A '''Reduce''' step applies a completed grammar rule to some of the recent parse trees, joining them together as one tree with a new root symbol.\nIf the input has no syntax errors, the parser continues with these steps until all of the input has been consumed and all of the parse trees have been reduced to a single tree representing an entire legal input.\n\nLR parsers differ from other shift-reduce parsers in how they decide when to reduce, and how to pick between rules with similar endings.  But the final decisions and the sequence of shift or reduce steps are the same.\n\nMuch of the LR parser's efficiency is from being deterministic. To avoid guessing, the LR parser often looks ahead (rightwards) at the next scanned symbol, before deciding what to do with previously scanned symbols.  The lexical scanner works one or more symbols ahead of the parser.  The '''lookahead''' symbols are the 'right-hand context' for the parsing decision.<ref>\nEngineering a Compiler (2nd edition), by Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon, [[Morgan Kaufmann]] 2011.</ref>\n\n===Bottom-up parse stack===\n\n[[File:Bottom-Up Parser.svg|thumb|x250px|right|Bottom-Up Parser at step 6]]\n\nLike other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser lazily waits until it has scanned and parsed all parts of some construct before committing to what the combined construct is.  The parser then acts immediately on the combination instead of waiting any further.  In the parse tree example, the phrase A gets reduced to Value and then to Products in steps 1-3 as soon as lookahead * is seen, rather than waiting any later to organize those parts of the parse tree.  The decisions for how to handle A are based only on what the parser and scanner have already seen, without considering things that appear much later to the right.\n\nReductions reorganize the most recently parsed things, immediately to the left of the lookahead symbol.  So the list of already-parsed things acts like a [[stack (abstract data type)|stack]].  This '''parse stack''' grows rightwards.  The base or bottom of the stack is on the left and holds the leftmost, oldest parse fragment.  Every reduction step acts only on the rightmost, newest parse fragments.  (This accumulative parse stack is very unlike the predictive, leftward-growing parse stack used by [[top-down parser]]s.)\n\n===Bottom-up parse steps for example A*2 + 1 ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <small>Step</small> !! <small>Parse Stack</small>  !!  <small>Unparsed</small> !! <small>Shift/Reduce</small>\n|-\n| 0 || ''empty'' || align=\"right\" | A*2 + 1 || shift\n|-\n| 1 || ''id'' || align=\"right\" | *2 + 1 || Value \u2192 ''id''  \n|-\n| 2 || Value || align=\"right\" | *2 + 1 || Products \u2192 Value \n|-\n| 3 || Products || align=\"right\" | *2 + 1 || shift \n|-\n| 4 || Products * || align=\"right\" | 2 + 1 || shift\n|-\n| 5 || Products * ''int'' || align=\"right\" | + 1 || Value \u2192 ''int''\n|-\n| 6 || Products * Value || align=\"right\" | + 1 ||  Products \u2192 Products * Value\n|-\n| 7 || Products || align=\"right\" | + 1 || Sums \u2192 Products \n|-\n| 8 || Sums || align=\"right\" | + 1 || shift  \n|-\n| 9 || Sums + || align=\"right\" | 1 || shift \n|- \n| 10 || Sums + ''int'' || ''eof'' || Value \u2192 ''int'' \n|-\n| 11 || Sums + Value || ''eof'' || Products \u2192 Value\n|-\n| 12 || Sums + Products || ''eof'' ||  Sums \u2192 Sums + Products \n|-\n| 13 || Sums || ''eof'' || done \n|-\n|}\n\nStep 6 applies a grammar rule with multiple parts:\n: Products \u2192 Products * Value\nThis matches the stack top holding the parsed phrases \"... Products * Value\".  The reduce step replaces this instance of the rule's right hand side, \"Products * Value\" by the rule's left hand side symbol, here a larger Products.  If the parser builds complete parse trees, the three trees for inner Products, *, and Value are combined by a new tree root for Products.  Otherwise, [[Semantics#Programming languages|semantic]] details from the inner Products and Value are output to some later compiler pass, or are combined and saved in the new Products symbol.<ref>\nCrafting and Compiler, by Charles Fischer, Ron Cytron, and Richard LeBlanc, Addison Wesley 2009.</ref>\n\n===LR parse steps for example A*2 + 1 ===\n\nIn LR parsers, the shift and reduce decisions are potentially based on the entire stack of everything that has been previously parsed, not just on a single, topmost stack symbol. If done in an unclever way, that could lead to very slow parsers that get slower and slower for longer inputs. LR parsers do this with constant speed, by summarizing all the relevant left context information into a single number called the LR(0) '''parser state'''. For each grammar and LR analysis method, there is a fixed (finite) number of such states. Besides holding the already-parsed symbols, the parse stack also remembers the state numbers reached by everything up to those points.\n\nAt every parse step, the entire input text is divided into a stack of previously parsed phrases, and a current lookahead symbol, and the remaining unscanned text.  The parser's next action is determined by its current LR(0) {{color|#928|state number}} (rightmost on the stack) and the lookahead symbol. In the steps below, all the black details are exactly the same as in other non-LR shift-reduce parsers. LR parser stacks add the state information in purple, summarizing the black phrases to their left on the stack and what syntax possibilities to expect next.  Users of an LR parser can usually ignore state information.  These states are explained in a later section.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <small><br>Step</small> !! <small>Parse Stack<br><sub>{{color|#928|state}}</sub> [Symbol<sub>{{color|#928|state}}</sub>]* </small> !! <small>Look<br>Ahead</small> !! <small><br>Unscanned</small> !! <small>Parser<br>Action</small> !! <small><br>Grammar Rule</small>|| <small>Next<br>State</small>\n|-\n| 0 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub>\n|| ''id'' || align=\"right\" | *2 + 1 || shift ||  || {{color|#928|9}}\n|-\n| 1 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \n''id''<sub>{{color|#928|9}}</sub> \n|| *  ||  align=\"right\" | 2 + 1 || reduce || Value \u2192 ''id'' || {{color|#928|7}}\n|-\n| 2 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nValue<sub>{{color|#928|7}}</sub>\n|| * ||  align=\"right\" | 2 + 1 || reduce || Products \u2192 Value || {{color|#928|4}}\n|-\n| 3 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub>\n|| * ||  align=\"right\" | 2 + 1 || shift || || {{color|#928|5}}\n|-\n| 4 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> *<sub>{{color|#928|5}}</sub> \n|| ''int'' ||  align=\"right\" | + 1 || shift ||  || {{color|#928|8}}\n|-\n| 5 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> *<sub>{{color|#928|5}}</sub>\n''int''<sub>{{color|#928|8}}</sub> \n|| + ||  align=\"right\" | 1 || reduce || Value \u2192 ''int'' || {{color|#928|6}}\n|-\n| 6 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> *<sub>{{color|#928|5}}</sub>\nValue<sub>{{color|#928|6}}</sub>\n|| + ||  align=\"right\" | 1 || reduce || Products \u2192 Products * Value || {{color|#928|4}}\n|-\n| 7 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> \n|| + || align=\"right\" | 1 || reduce || Sums \u2192 Products || {{color|#928|1}}\n|-\n| 8 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n|| + || align=\"right\" | 1 || shift ||  || {{color|#928|2}}\n|-\n| 9 ||\n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n+<sub>{{color|#928|2}}</sub>  \n|| ''int'' || align=\"right\" | ''eof'' || shift ||  || {{color|#928|8}}\n|- \n| 10 ||\n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n+<sub>{{color|#928|2}}</sub> \n''int''<sub>{{color|#928|8}}</sub>\n|| ''eof'' ||  || reduce || Value \u2192 ''int'' || {{color|#928|7}}\n|-\n| 11 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n+<sub>{{color|#928|2}}</sub>  \nValue<sub>{{color|#928|7}}</sub> \n|| ''eof'' ||  || reduce || Products \u2192 Value || {{color|#928|3}}\n|-\n| 12 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n+<sub>{{color|#928|2}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|3}}</sub>\n|| ''eof'' ||  || reduce || Sums \u2192 Sums + Products || {{color|#928|1}}\n|-\n| 13 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n|| ''eof'' ||  || done ||  || \n|-\n|}\n\nAt initial step 0, the input stream \"A*2 + 1\" is divided into\n* an empty section on the parse stack,\n* lookahead text \"A\" scanned as an ''id'' symbol, and\n* the remaining unscanned text \"*2 + 1\".\nThe parse stack begins by holding only initial state 0.  When state 0 sees the lookahead ''id'', it knows to shift that ''id'' onto the stack, and scan the next input symbol '''*''', and advance to state 9.\n\n{{rule}}\n\nAt step 4, the total input stream \"A*2 + 1\" is currently divided into \n* the parsed section \"A&nbsp;*\" with 2 stacked phrases Products and '''*''',\n* lookahead text \"2\" scanned as an ''int'' symbol, and\n* the remaining unscanned text \" + 1\".\nThe states corresponding to the stacked phrases are 0, 4, and 5.  The current, rightmost state on the stack is state 5.  When state 5 sees the lookahead ''int'', it knows to shift that ''int'' onto the stack as its own phrase, and scan the next input symbol '''+''', and advance to state 8.\n\n{{rule}}\n\nAt step 12, all of the input stream has been consumed but only partially organized.  The current state is 3.  When state 3 sees the lookahead ''eof'', it knows to apply the completed grammar rule\n::Sums \u2192 Sums + Products\nby combining the stack's rightmost three phrases for Sums, '''+''', and Products into one thing.  State 3 itself doesn't know what the next state should be.  This is found by going back to state 0, just to the left of the phrase being reduced.  When state 0 sees this new completed instance of a Sums, it advances to state 1 (again).  This consulting of older states is why they are kept on the stack, instead of keeping only the current state.\n\n===Grammar for the example A*2 + 1===\n\nLR parsers are constructed from a grammar that formally defines the syntax of the input language as a set of patterns.  The grammar doesn't cover all language rules, such as the size of numbers, or the consistent use of names and their definitions in the context of the whole program.  LR parsers use a [[context-free grammar]] that deals just with local patterns of symbols.\n\nThe example grammar used here is a tiny subset of the Java or C language:\n\n::r0: Goal \u2192 Sums ''eof''\n::r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + Products\n::r2: Sums \u2192 Products\n::r3: Products \u2192 Products * Value\n::r4: Products \u2192 Value\n::r5: Value \u2192 ''int''\n::r6: Value \u2192 ''id''\n\nThe grammar's [[terminal symbol]]s are the multi-character symbols or 'tokens' found in the input stream by a [[lexical analysis|lexical scanner]].  Here these include '''+''' '''*''' and ''int'' for any integer constant, and ''id'' for any identifier name, and ''eof'' for end of input file.  The grammar doesn't care what the ''int'' values or ''id'' spellings are, nor does it care about blanks or line breaks.  The grammar uses these terminal symbols but does not define them.  They are always leaf nodes (at the bottom bushy end) of the parse tree.\n\nThe capitalized terms like Sums are [[nonterminal symbol]]s.  These are names for concepts or patterns in the language. They are defined in the grammar and never occur themselves in the input stream.  They are always internal nodes (above the bottom) of the parse tree. They only happen as a result of the parser applying some grammar rule.  Some nonterminals are defined with two or more rules; these are alternative patterns.  Rules can refer back to themselves, which are called ''recursive''.  This grammar uses recursive rules to handle repeated math operators.  Grammars for complete languages use recursive rules to handle lists, parenthesized expressions, and nested statements.\n\nAny given computer language can be described by several different grammars.  An LR(1) parser can handle many but not all common grammars.  It is usually possible to manually modify a grammar so that it fits the limitations of LR(1) parsing and the generator tool.\n\nThe grammar for an LR parser must be [[ambiguous grammar|unambiguous]] itself, or must be augmented by tie-breaking precedence rules.  This means there is only one correct way to apply the grammar to a given legal example of the language, resulting in a unique parse tree with just one meaning, and a unique sequence of shift/reduce actions for that example.  LR parsing is not a useful technique for human languages with ambiguous grammars that depend on the interplay of words.  Human languages are better handled by parsers like [[Generalized LR parser]], the [[Earley parser]], or the [[CYK algorithm]] that can simultaneously compute all possible parse trees in one pass.\n\n===Parse table for the example grammar===\n\nMost LR parsers are table driven. The parser's program code is a simple generic loop that is the same for all grammars and languages. The knowledge of the grammar and its syntactic implications are encoded into unchanging data tables called '''parse tables''' (or '''parsing tables'''). Entries in a table show whether to shift or reduce (and by which grammar rule), for every legal combination of parser state and lookahead symbol.  The parse tables also tell how to compute the next state, given just a current state and a next symbol.\n\nThe parse tables are much larger than the grammar.  LR tables are hard to accurately compute by hand for big grammars.  So they are mechanically derived from the grammar by some [[parser generator]] tool like [[GNU Bison|Bison]].<ref>\nFlex & Bison: Text Processing Tools, by John Levine, O'Reilly Media 2009.</ref>\n\nDepending on how the states and parsing table are generated, the resulting parser is called either a [[simple LR parser|'''SLR''' (simple LR) parser]], [[LALR parser|'''LALR''' (look-ahead LR) parser]], or [[canonical LR parser]]. LALR parsers handle more grammars than SLR parsers. Canonical LR parsers handle even more grammars, but use many more states and much larger tables.  The example grammar is SLR.\n\nLR parse tables are two-dimensional.  Each current LR(0) parser state has its own row.  Each possible next symbol has its own column.  Some combinations of state and next symbol are not possible for valid input streams.  These blank cells trigger syntax error messages.\n\nThe '''Action''' left half of the table has columns for lookahead terminal symbols.  These cells determine whether the next parser action is shift (to state ''n''), or reduce (by grammar rule '''r'''<sub>n</sub>).\n\nThe '''Goto''' right half of the table has columns for nonterminal symbols.  These cells show which state to advance to, after some reduction's Left Hand Side has created an expected new instance of that symbol.  This is like a shift action but for nonterminals; the lookahead terminal symbol is unchanged.\n\nThe table column \"Current Rules\" documents the meaning and syntax possibilities for each state, as worked out by the parser generator.  It is not included in the actual tables used at parsing time.  The <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> (pink dot) marker shows where the parser is now, within some partially recognized grammar rules.  The things to the left of <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> have been parsed, and the things to the right are expected soon.  A state has several such current rules if the parser has not yet narrowed possibilities down to a single rule.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Products begins with terminal symbols ''int'' or ''id''.  If the lookahead is either of those, the parser shifts them in and advances to state 8 or 9, respectively.  When a Products has been found, the parser advances to state 3 to accumulate the complete list of summands and find the end of rule r0.  A Products can also begin with nonterminal  Value.  For any other lookahead or nonterminal, the parser announces a syntax error.\n\n{{rule}}\n\nIn state 3, the parser has just found a Products phrase, that could be from two possible grammar rules:\n::r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + Products <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n::r3: Products \u2192 Products <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * Value\nThe choice between r1 and r3 can't be decided just from looking backwards at prior phrases.  The parser has to check the lookahead symbol to tell what to do.  If the lookahead is '''*''', it is in rule 3, so the parser shifts in the '''*''' and advances to state 5.  If the lookahead is ''eof'', it is at the end of rule 1 and rule 0, so the parser is done.\n\n{{rule}}\n\nIn state 9 above, all the non-blank, non-error cells are for the same reduction r6.  Some parsers save time and table space by not checking the lookahead symbol in these simple cases.  Syntax errors are then detected somewhat later, after some harmless reductions, but still before the next shift action or parser decision.\n\nIndividual table cells must not hold multiple, alternative actions, otherwise the parser would be nondeterministic with guesswork and backtracking.  If the grammar is not LR(1), some cells will have shift/reduce conflicts between a possible shift action and reduce action, or reduce/reduce conflicts between multiple grammar rules.  LR(k) parsers resolve these conflicts (where possible) by checking additional lookahead symbols beyond the first.\n\n=== LR parser loop ===\n\nThe LR parser begins with a nearly empty parse stack containing just the start state 0, and with the lookahead holding the input stream's first scanned symbol.  The parser then repeats the following loop step until done, or stuck on a syntax error:\n\nThe topmost state on the parse stack is some state ''s'', and the current lookahead is some terminal symbol ''t''.  Look up the next parser action from row ''s'' and column ''t'' of the Lookahead Action table.  That action is either Shift, Reduce, Done, or Error:\n* Shift ''n'':\n::Shift the matched terminal ''t'' onto the parse stack and scan the next input symbol into the lookahead buffer.\n::Push next state ''n'' onto the parse stack as the new current state.\n* Reduce r<sub>m</sub>:  Apply grammar rule r<sub>m</sub>: Lhs \u2192 S<sub>1</sub> S<sub>2</sub> ... S<sub>L</sub>\n::Remove the matched topmost L symbols (and parse trees and associated state numbers) from the parse stack.\n::This exposes a prior state ''p'' that was expecting an instance of the Lhs symbol.\n::Join the L parse trees together as one parse tree with new root symbol Lhs.\n::Lookup the next state ''n'' from row ''p'' and column ''Lhs'' of the LHS Goto table.\n::Push the symbol and tree for Lhs onto the parse stack.\n::Push next state ''n'' onto the parse stack as the new current state.\n::The lookahead and input stream remain unchanged.\n* Done: Lookahead ''t'' is the ''eof'' marker.  End of parsing. If the state stack contains just the start state report success. Otherwise, report a syntax error.\n* Error: Report a syntax error.  The parser ends, or attempts some recovery.\n\nLR parser stack usually stores just the LR(0) automaton states, as the grammar symbols may be derived from them (in the automaton, all input transitions to some state are marked with the same symbol, which is the symbol associated with this state). Moreover, these symbols are almost never needed as the state is all that matters when making the parsing decision.<ref name=\"Compilers 2006\">Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition), by Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman, Prentice Hall 2006.</ref>\n\n==LR generator analysis==\n\nThis section of the article can be skipped by most users of LR parser generators.\n\n===LR states===\n\nState 2 in the example parse table is for the partially parsed rule \n::r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> Products\nThis shows how the parser got here, by seeing Sums then '''+''' while looking for a larger Sums.  The <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker has advanced beyond the beginning of the rule.  It also shows how the parser expects to eventually complete the rule, by next finding a complete Products.  But more details are needed on how to parse all the parts of that Products.\n\nThe partially parsed rules for a state are called its \"core LR(0) items\".  The parser generator adds additional rules or items for all the possible next steps in building up the expected Products:\n::r3: Products \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> Products * Value\n::r4: Products \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> Value\n::r5: Value \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> ''int''\n::r6: Value \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> ''id''\nThe <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker is at the beginning of each of these added rules; the parser has not yet confirmed and parsed any part of them.  These additional items are called the \"closure\" of the core items. For each nonterminal symbol immediately following a <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>, the generator adds the rules defining that symbol.  This adds more <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> markers, and possibly different follower symbols.  This closure process continues until all follower symbols have been expanded.  The follower nonterminals for state 2 begins with Products.  Value is then added by closure. The follower terminals are ''int'' and ''id''.\n\nThe kernel and closure items together show all possible legal ways to proceed from the current state to future states and complete phrases.  If a follower symbol appears in only one item, it leads to a next state containing only one core item with the <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker advanced.  So ''int'' leads to next state 8 with core\n::r5: Value \u2192 ''int'' <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nIf the same follower symbol appears in several items, the parser cannot yet tell which rule applies here.  So that symbol leads to a next state that shows all remaining possibilities, again with the <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker advanced.  Products appears in both r1 and r3.  So Products leads to next state 3 with core\n::r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + Products <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n::r3: Products \u2192 Products <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * Value\nIn words, that means if the parser has seen a single Products, it might be done, or it might still have even more things to multiply together. All the core items have the same symbol preceding the <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker; all transitions into this state are always with that same symbol.\n\nSome transitions will be to cores and states that have been enumerated already.  Other transitions lead to new states.  The generator starts with the grammar's goal rule.  From there it keeps exploring known states and transitions until all needed states have been found.\n\nThese states are called \"LR(0)\" states because they use a lookahead of ''k''=0, i.e. no lookahead.  The only checking of input symbols occurs when the symbol is shifted in.  Checking of lookaheads for reductions is done separately by the parse table, not by the enumerated states themselves.\n\n===Finite state machine===\n\nThe parse table describes all possible LR(0) states and their transitions.  They form a [[finite state automaton|finite state machine]] (FSM).  An FSM is a simple engine for parsing simple unnested languages, without using a stack.  In this LR application, the FSM's modified \"input language\" has both terminal and nonterminal symbols, and covers any partially parsed stack snapshot of the full LR parse.\n\nRecall step 5 of the Parse Steps Example:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <small><br>Step</small> !! <small>Parse Stack<br><sub>{{color|#928|state}}</sub> Symbol <sub>{{color|#928|state}}</sub> ...</small> !! <small>Look<br>Ahead</small> !! <small><br>Unscanned</small>\n|-\n| 5 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> *<sub>{{color|#928|5}}</sub>\n''int''<sub>{{color|#928|8}}</sub> \n|| + ||  align=\"right\" | 1 \n|-\n|}\n\nThe parse stack shows a series of state transitions, from the start state 0, to state 4 and then on to 5 and current state 8.  The symbols on the parse stack are the shift or goto symbols for those transitions.  Another way to view this, is that the finite state machine can scan the stream \"Products&nbsp;*&nbsp;''int''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1\" (without using yet another stack) and find the leftmost complete phrase that should be reduced next.  And that is indeed its job!\n\nHow can a mere FSM do this when the original unparsed language has nesting and recursion and definitely requires an analyzer with a stack?  The trick is that everything to the left of the stack top has already been fully reduced.  This eliminates all the loops and nesting from those phrases.  The FSM can ignore all the older beginnings of phrases, and track just the newest phrases that might be completed next.  The obscure name for this in LR theory is \"viable prefix.\"\n\n===Lookahead sets===\n\nThe states and transitions give all the needed information for the parse table's shift actions and goto actions.  The generator also needs to calculate the expected lookahead sets for each reduce action.\n\nIn '''SLR''' parsers, these lookahead sets are determined directly from the grammar, without considering the individual states and transitions.  For each nonterminal S, the SLR generator works out Follows(S), the set of all the terminal symbols which can immediately follow some occurrence of S.  In the parse table, each reduction to S uses Follow(S) as its LR(1) lookahead set.  Such follow sets are also used by generators for LL top-down parsers.  A grammar that has no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts when using Follow sets is called an SLR grammar.\n\n'''LALR''' parsers have the same states as SLR parsers, but use a more complicated, more precise way of working out the minimum necessary reduction lookaheads for each individual state.  Depending on the details of the grammar, this may turn out to be the same as the Follow set computed by SLR parser generators, or it may turn out to be a subset of the SLR lookaheads.  Some grammars are okay for LALR parser generators but not for SLR parser generators.  This happens when the grammar has spurious shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts using Follow sets, but no conflicts when using the exact sets computed by the LALR generator.  The grammar is then called LALR(1) but not SLR.\n\nAn SLR or LALR parser avoids having duplicate states.  But this minimization is not necessary, and can sometimes create unnecessary lookahead conflicts.  '''Canonical LR''' parsers use duplicated (or \"split\") states to better remember the left and right context of a nonterminal's use. Each occurrence of a symbol S in the grammar can be treated independently with its own lookahead set, to help resolve reduction conflicts.  This handles a few more grammars.  Unfortunately, this greatly magnifies the size of the parse tables if done for all parts of the grammar.  This splitting of states can also be done manually and selectively with any SLR or LALR parser, by making two or more named copies of some nonterminals.  A grammar that is conflict-free for a canonical LR generator but has conflicts in an LALR generator is called LR(1) but not LALR(1), and not SLR.\n\nSLR, LALR, and canonical LR parsers make exactly the same shift and reduce decisions when the input stream is correct language.  When the input has a syntax error, the LALR parser may do some additional (harmless) reductions before detecting the error than would the canonical LR parser.  And the SLR parser may do even more.  This happens because the SLR and LALR parsers are using a generous superset approximation to the true, minimal lookahead symbols for that particular state.\n\n===Syntax error recovery===\n\nLR parsers can generate somewhat helpful error messages for the first syntax error in a program, by simply enumerating all the terminal symbols that could have appeared next instead of the unexpected bad lookahead symbol.  But this does not help the parser work out how to parse the remainder of the input program to look for further, independent errors.  If the parser recovers badly from the first error, it is very likely to mis-parse everything else and produce a cascade of unhelpful spurious error messages.\n\nIn the [[yacc]] and bison parser generators, the parser has an ad hoc mechanism to abandon the current statement, discard some parsed phrases and lookahead tokens surrounding the error, and resynchronize the parse at some reliable statement-level delimiter like semicolons or braces.  This often works well for allowing the parser and compiler to look over the rest of the program.\n\nMany syntactic coding errors are simple typos or omissions of a trivial symbol.  Some LR parsers attempt to detect and automatically repair these common cases.  The parser enumerates every possible single-symbol insertion, deletion, or substitution at the error point.  The compiler does a trial parse with each change to see if it worked okay.  (This requires backtracking to snapshots of the parse stack and input stream, normally unneeded by the parser.)  Some best repair is picked.  This gives a very helpful error message and resynchronizes the parse well.  However, the repair is not trustworthy enough to permanently modify the input file.  Repair of syntax errors is easiest to do consistently in parsers (like LR) that have parse tables and an explicit data stack.\n\n===Variants of LR parsers===\n\nThe LR parser generator decides what should happen for each combination of parser state and lookahead symbol.  These decisions are usually turned into read-only data tables that drive a generic parser loop that is grammar- and state-independent.  But there are also other ways to turn those decisions into an active parser.\n\nSome LR parser generators create separate tailored program code for each state, rather than a parse table.  These parsers can run several times faster than the generic parser loop in table-driven parsers.  The fastest parsers use generated assembler code.\n\nIn the [[recursive ascent parser]] variation, the explicit parse stack structure is also replaced by the implicit stack used by subroutine calls.  Reductions terminate several levels of subroutine calls, which is clumsy in most languages.  So recursive ascent parsers are generally slower, less obvious, and harder to hand-modify than [[recursive descent parser]]s.\n\nAnother variation replaces the parse table by pattern-matching rules in non-procedural languages such as [[Prolog]].\n\n'''GLR''' [[Generalized LR parser]]s use LR bottom-up techniques to find all possible parses of input text, not just one correct parse.   This is essential for ambiguous grammars such as used for human languages.  The multiple valid parse trees are computed simultaneously, without backtracking.  GLR is sometimes helpful for computer languages that are not easily described by a conflict-free LALR(1) grammar.\n\n'''LC''' [[Left corner parser]]s use LR bottom-up techniques for recognizing the left end of alternative grammar rules.  When the alternatives have been narrowed down to a single possible rule, the parser then switches to top-down LL(1) techniques for parsing the rest of that rule.  LC parsers have smaller parse tables than LALR parsers and better error diagnostics.  There are no widely used generators for deterministic LC parsers.  Multiple-parse LC parsers are helpful with human languages with very large grammars.\n\n===Theory===\n\nLR parsers were invented by [[Donald Knuth]] in 1965 as an efficient generalization of [[simple precedence parser|precedence parser]]s.  Knuth proved that LR parsers were the most general-purpose parsers possible that would still be efficient in the worst cases.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}  \n:\"LR(''k'') grammars can be efficiently parsed with an execution time essentially proportional to the length of the string.\"<ref>Knuth (1965), p.638</ref>\n:For every ''k''\u22651, \"a language can be generated by an LR(''k'') grammar if and only if it is deterministic [and context-free], if and only if it can be generated by an LR(1) grammar.\"<ref>Knuth (1965), p.635. Knuth didn't mention the restriction ''k''\u22651 there, but it is required by his theorems he referred to, viz. on p.629 and p.630. Similarly, the restriction to [[context-free language]]s is tacitly understood from the context.</ref>\n\nIn other words, if a language was reasonable enough to allow an efficient one-pass parser, it could be described by an LR(''k'') grammar.  And that grammar could always be mechanically transformed into an equivalent (but larger) LR(1) grammar.  So an LR(1) parsing method was, in theory, powerful enough to handle any reasonable language.  In practice, the natural grammars for many programming languages are close to being LR(1).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe canonical LR parsers described by Knuth had too many states and very big parse tables that were impractically large for the limited memory of computers of that era.  LR parsing became practical when [[Frank DeRemer]] invented [[Simple LR parser|SLR]] and [[LALR]] parsers with much fewer states.<ref>\nPractical Translators for LR(k) Languages, by Frank DeRemer, MIT PhD dissertation 1969.</ref><ref>\nSimple LR(k) Grammars, by Frank DeRemer, Comm.

This table is important to find out the next state after every reduction. After a reduction, the next state is found by looking up the '''goto table''' entry for top of the stack (i.e. current state) and the reduced rule's LHS (i.e. non-terminal).\n\n=== Parsing steps ===\n\nThe table below illustrates each step in the process. Here the state refers to the element at the top of the stack (the right-most element), and the next action is determined by referring to the action table above. A $ is appended to the input string to denote the end of the stream.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! State\n! Input stream\n! Output stream\n! Stack\n!

To find the next action (shift, reduce, accept or error), the action table is indexed with the current state (the \"current state\" is just whatever is on the top of the stack), which in this case is 0, and the current input symbol, which is '1'. The action table specifies a shift to state 2, and so state 2 is pushed onto the stack (again, all the state information is in the stack, so \"shifting to state 2\" is the same as pushing 2 onto the stack). The resulting stack is\n\n: ['''0''' '1' '''2''']\n\nwhere the top of the stack is 2. For the sake of explanation the symbol (e.g., '1', B) is shown that caused the transition to the next state, although strictly speaking it is not part of the stack.\n\nIn state 2, the action table says to reduce with grammar rule 5 (regardless of what terminal the parser sees on the input stream), which means that the parser has just recognized the right-hand side of rule 5. In this case, the parser writes 5 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has one symbol), and pushes on the stack the state from the cell in the goto table for state 0 and B, i.e., state 4. The resulting stack is:\n\n: ['''0''' B '''4''']\n\nHowever, in state 4, the action table says the parser should now reduce with rule 3. So it writes 3 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack, and finds the new state in the goto table for state 0 and E, which is state 3. The resulting stack:\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''']\n\nThe next terminal that the parser sees is a '+' and according to the action table it should then go to state 6:\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''' '+' '''6''']\n\nThe resulting stack can be interpreted as the history of a [[finite state automaton]] that has just read a nonterminal E followed by a terminal '+'. The transition table of this automaton is defined by the shift actions in the action table and the goto actions in the goto table.\n\nThe next terminal is now '1' and this means that the parser performs a shift and go to state 2:\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''' '+' '''6''' '1' '''2''']\n\nJust as the previous '1' this one is reduced to B giving the following stack:\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''' '+' '''6''' B '''8''']\n\nThe stack corresponds with a list of states of a finite automaton that has read a nonterminal E, followed by a '+' and then a nonterminal B. In state 8 the parser always performs a reduce with rule 2. The top 3 states on the stack correspond with the 3 symbols in the right-hand side of rule 2. This time we pop 3 elements off of the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has 3 symbols) and look up the goto state for E and 0, thus pushing state 3 back onto the stack\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''']\n\nFinally, the parser reads a '$' (end of input symbol) from the input stream, which means that according to the action table (the current state is 3) the parser accepts the input string. The rule numbers that will then have been written to the output stream will be [5, 3, 5, 2] which is indeed a [[rightmost derivation]] of the string \"1 + 1\" in reverse.\n\n== Constructing LR(0) parsing tables ==\n=== Items ===<!-- This section is linked from [[LALR parser]] -->\n\nThe construction of these parsing tables is based on the notion of ''LR(0) items'' (simply called ''items'' here) which are grammar rules with a special dot added somewhere in the right-hand side. For example, the rule E \u2192 E + B has the following four corresponding items:\n: E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E + B\n: E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B\n: E \u2192 E + <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B\n: E \u2192 E + B <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\nRules of the form ''A'' \u2192 \u03b5 have only a single item ''A'' \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>. The item E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B, for example, indicates that the parser has recognized a string corresponding with E on the input stream and now expects to read a '+' followed by another string corresponding with B.\n\n=== Item sets ===\n\nIt is usually not possible to characterize the state of the parser with a single item because it may not know in advance which rule it is going to use for reduction. For example, if there is also a rule E \u2192 E * B then the items E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B and E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * B will both apply after a string corresponding with E has been read. Therefore, it is convenient to characterize the state of the parser by a set of items, in this case the set { E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B, E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * B }.\n\n=== Extension of Item Set by expansion of non-terminals ===\n\nAn item with a dot before a nonterminal, such as E \u2192 E + <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B, indicates that the parser expects to parse the nonterminal B next.  To ensure the item set contains all possible rules the parser may be in the midst of parsing, it must include all items describing how B itself will be parsed.  This means that if there are rules such as B \u2192 1 and B \u2192 0 then the item set must also include the items B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1 and B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 0. In general this can be formulated as follows:\n\n: If there is an item of the form ''A'' \u2192 ''v'' <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> ''Bw'' in an item set and in the grammar there is a rule of the form ''B'' \u2192 ''w' '' then the item ''B'' \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> ''w' '' should also be in the item set.\n\n=== Closure of item sets ===\n\nThus, any set of items can be extended by recursively adding all the appropriate items until all nonterminals preceded by dots are accounted for. The minimal extension is called the ''closure'' of an item set and written as '''clos'''(''I'') where ''I'' is an item set. It is these closed item sets that are taken as the states of the parser, although only the ones that are actually reachable from the begin state will be included in the tables.\n\n=== Augmented grammar ===\n\nBefore the transitions between the different states are determined, the grammar is augmented with an extra rule\n\n: (0) S \u2192 E eof\n\nwhere S is a new start symbol and E the old start symbol. The parser will use this rule for reduction exactly when it has accepted the whole input string.\n\nFor this example, the same grammar as above is augmented thus:\n\n: (0) S \u2192 E eof\n: (1) E \u2192 E * B\n: (2) E \u2192 E + B\n: (3) E \u2192 B\n: (4) B \u2192 0\n: (5) B \u2192 1\n\nIt is for this augmented grammar that the item sets and the transitions between them will be determined.\n\n== Table construction ==\n\n=== Finding the reachable item sets and the transitions between them ===\n\nThe first step of constructing the tables consists of determining the transitions between the closed item sets. These transitions will be determined as if we are considering a finite automaton that can read terminals as well as nonterminals. The begin state of this automaton is always the closure of the first item of the added rule: S \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E:\n\n: '''Item set 0'''\n: S \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E eof\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E * B\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E + B\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 0\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1\n\nThe [[boldface]]d \"'''+'''\" in front of an item indicates the items that were added for the closure (not to be confused with the mathematical '+' operator which is a terminal). The original items without a \"'''+'''\" are called the ''kernel'' of the item set.\n\nStarting at the begin state (S0), all of the states that can be reached from this state are now determined. The possible transitions for an item set can be found by looking at the symbols (terminals and nonterminals) found following the dots; in the case of item set 0 those symbols are the terminals '0' and '1' and the nonterminals E and B. To find the item set that each symbol <math display=\"inline\">x \\in \\{0, 1, E, B\\}</math>leads to,  the following procedure is followed for each of the symbols:\n# Take the subset, ''S'', of all items in the current item set where there is a dot in front of the symbol of interest, ''x''.\n# For each item in ''S'', move the dot to the right of ''x''.\n# Close the resulting set of items.\n\nFor the terminal '0' (i.e. where x = '0') this results in:\n\n: '''Item set 1'''\n: B \u2192 0 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nand for the terminal '1' (i.e. where x = '1') this results in:\n\n: '''Item set 2'''\n: B \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nand for the nonterminal E (i.e. where x = E) this results in:\n\n: '''Item set 3'''\n: S \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> eof\n: E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * B\n: E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B\n\nand for the nonterminal B (i.e. where x = B) this results in:\n\n: '''Item set 4'''\n: E \u2192 B <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nThe closure does not add new items in all cases - in the new sets above, for example, there are no nonterminals following the dot.\n\nAbove procedure is continued until no more new item sets are found. For the item sets 1, 2, and 4 there will be no transitions since the dot is not in front of any symbol. For item set 3 though, we have dots in front of terminals '*' and '+'. For symbol <math display=\"inline\">x = \\texttt{*}</math>the transition goes to:\n\n: '''Item set 5'''\n: E \u2192 E * <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 0\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1\n\nand for  <math display=\"inline\">x = \\texttt{+}</math>the transition goes to:\n\n: '''Item set 6'''\n: E \u2192 E + <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 0\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1\n\nNow, the third iteration begins.\n\nFor item set 5, the terminals '0' and '1' and the nonterminal B must be considered, but the resulting closed item sets are equal to already found item sets 1 and 2, respectively. For the nonterminal B, the transition goes to:\n\n: '''Item set 7'''\n: E \u2192 E * B <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nFor item set 6, the terminal '0' and '1' and the nonterminal B must be considered, but as before, the resulting item sets for the terminals are equal to the already found item sets 1 and 2. For the nonterminal B the transition goes to:\n\n: '''Item set 8'''\n: E \u2192 E + B <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nThese final item sets 7 and 8 have no symbols beyond their dots so no more new item sets are added, so the item generating procedure is complete. The finite automaton, with item sets as its states is shown below.\n\nThe transition table for the automaton now looks as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"background:#e0e0d0;\"\n!  style=\"background:#d0e0ff; width:28%;\"|Item Set\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|*\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|+\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|0\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|1\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|E\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|B\n|-\n!0 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||1      ||2      ||3      ||4\n|-\n!1 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!2 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!3 \n|5      ||6      ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!4 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!5 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||1      ||2      ||&nbsp; ||7\n|-\n!6 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||1      ||2      ||&nbsp; ||8\n|-\n!7 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!8 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|}\n\n=== Constructing the action and goto tables ===\n\nFrom this table and the found item sets, the action and goto table are constructed as follows:\n<!-- Jezhotwells noted that sentences like the above \"are not encyclopaedic, reads like an instruction manual\" --> \n# The columns for nonterminals are copied to the goto table.\n# The columns for the terminals are copied to the action table as shift actions.\n# An extra column for '$' (end of input) is added to the action table that contains ''acc'' for every item set that contains an item of the form S \u2192 w <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> eof.\n# If an item set ''i'' contains an item of the form ''A'' \u2192 ''w'' <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> and ''A'' \u2192 ''w'' is rule ''m'' with ''m'' &gt; 0 then the row for state ''i'' in the action table is completely filled with the reduce action r''m''.\nThe reader may verify that this results indeed in the action and goto table that were presented earlier on.\n\n==== A note about LR(0) versus SLR and LALR parsing ====\n\nOnly step 4 of the above procedure produces reduce actions, and so all reduce actions must occupy an entire table row, causing the reduction to occur regardless of the next symbol in the input stream.  This is why these are LR(0) parse tables: they don't do any lookahead (that is, they look ahead zero symbols) before deciding which reduction to perform.  A grammar that needs lookahead to disambiguate reductions would require a parse table row containing different reduce actions in different columns, and the above procedure is not capable of creating such rows.\n<!-- Jezhotwells noted \"Paragraphs such as this should be rewritten in good plain english, at the moment this is gobbledegook to the average reader.\" -->\n\nRefinements to the '''LR'''(0) table construction procedure (such as [[Simple LR parser|SLR]] and [[LALR parser|LALR]]) are capable of constructing reduce actions that do not occupy entire rows.  Therefore, they are capable of parsing more grammars than LR(0) parsers.\n\n=== Conflicts in the constructed tables ===\n\nThe automaton is constructed in such a way that it is guaranteed to be deterministic. However, when reduce actions are added to the action table it can happen that the same cell is filled with a reduce action and a shift action (a ''shift-reduce conflict'') or with two different reduce actions (a ''reduce-reduce conflict''). However, it  can be shown that when this happens the grammar is not an LR(0) grammar. A classic real-world example of a shift-reduce conflict is the [[dangling else]] problem.\n\nA small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a shift-reduce conflict is:\n\n: (1) E \u2192 1 E\n: (2) E \u2192 1\n\nOne of the item sets found is:\n\n: '''Item set 1'''\n: E \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E\n: E \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1 E\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1\n\nThere is a shift-reduce conflict in this item set: when constructing the action table according to the rules above,  the cell for  [item set 1, terminal '1'] contains '''s1''' (shift to state 1) '''and r2''' (reduce with grammar rule 2).\n\nA small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a reduce-reduce conflict is:\n\n: (1) E \u2192 A 1\n: (2) E \u2192 B 2\n: (3) A \u2192 1\n: (4) B \u2192 1\n\nIn this case the following item set is obtained:\n\n: '''Item set 1'''\n: A \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n: B \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nThere is a reduce-reduce conflict in this item set because in the cells in the action table for this item set there will be both a reduce action for rule 3 and one for rule 4.\n\nBoth examples above can be solved by letting the parser use the follow set (see [[LL parser]]) of a nonterminal ''A'' to decide if it is going to use one of ''A''s rules for a reduction; it will only use the rule ''A'' \u2192 ''w'' for a reduction if the next symbol on the input stream is in the follow set of ''A''. This solution results in so-called [[Simple LR parser]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Canonical LR parser]]\n*[[SLR grammar|Simple LR]]\n*[[LALR parser|Look-Ahead LR]]\n*[[GLR parser|Generalized LR]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Chapman, Nigel P., [https://books.google.com/books?id=nEA9AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover ''LR Parsing: Theory and Practice''], [[Cambridge University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-521-30413-X}}\n* Pager, D., A Practical General Method for Constructing LR(k) Parsers.

LR parsers can be generated by a [[parser generator]] from a [[formal grammar]] defining the syntax of the language to be parsed. They are widely used for the processing of [[computer language]]s.\n\nAn '''LR''' parser ('''L'''eft-to-right, '''R'''ightmost derivation in reverse) reads input text from left to right without backing up (this is true for most parsers), and produces a [[rightmost derivation]] in reverse: it does a [[Bottom-up parsing|bottom-up parse]] - not a [[top-down parsing|top-down LL parse]] or ad-hoc parse. The name LR is often followed by a numeric qualifier, as in '''LR(1)''' or sometimes '''LR(''k'')'''. To avoid [[backtracking]] or guessing, the LR parser is allowed to peek ahead at ''k'' [[Parsing#Lookahead|lookahead]] input [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s before deciding how to parse earlier symbols. Typically ''k'' is 1 and is not mentioned. The name LR is often preceded by other qualifiers, as in '''SLR''' and '''LALR'''.  The '''LR(''k'')''' condition for a grammar was suggested by Knuth to stand for \"translatable from left to right with bound ''k''.\"<ref name=\"Knuth 1965\"/>\n\nLR parsers are deterministic; they produce a single correct parse without guesswork or backtracking, in linear time.  This is ideal for computer languages, but LR parsers are not suited for human languages which need more flexible but inevitably slower methods.  Some methods which can parse arbitrary context-free languages (e.g., [[CYK algorithm|Cocke\u2013Younger\u2013Kasami]], [[Earley parser|Earley]], [[GLR parser|GLR]]) have worst-case performance of O(''n''<sup>3</sup>) time.  Other methods which backtrack or yield multiple parses may even take exponential time when they guess badly.<ref name=\"AhoUllman 1972\">{{cite book |last1=Aho |first1=Alfred V. |authorlink1=Alfred Aho |last2=Ullman |first2=Jeffrey D. |authorlink2=Jeffrey Ullman |title=The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling (Volume 1: Parsing.) |year=1972 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]] |isbn=978-0139145568 |edition=Repr. |url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofparsingt00ahoa }}</ref>\n\nThe above properties of '''L''', '''R''', and '''k''' are actually shared by all [[shift-reduce parser]]s, including [[simple precedence parser|precedence parser]]s. But by convention, the LR name stands for the form of parsing invented by [[Donald Knuth]], and excludes the earlier, less powerful precedence methods (for example [[Operator-precedence parser]]).<ref name=\"Knuth 1965\"/>\nLR parsers can handle a larger range of languages and grammars than precedence parsers or top-down [[LL parsing]].<ref>[https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/43 Language theoretic comparison of LL and LR grammars]</ref> This is because the LR parser waits until it has seen an entire instance of some grammar pattern before committing to what it has found. An LL parser has to decide or guess what it is seeing much sooner, when it has only seen the leftmost input symbol of that pattern.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Bottom-up parse tree for example {{nowrap | A*2 + 1 }}===\n\n[[File:Shift-Reduce Parse Steps for A*2+1.svg|thumb|x200px|right|Bottom-up parse tree built in numbered steps]]\n\nAn LR parser scans and parses the input text in one forward pass over the text.  The parser builds up the [[parse tree]] incrementally, bottom up, and left to right, without guessing or backtracking.  At every point in this pass, the parser has accumulated a list of subtrees or phrases of the input text that have been already parsed.  Those subtrees are not yet joined together because the parser has not yet reached the right end of the syntax pattern that will combine them.\n\nAt step 6 in an example parse, only \"A*2\" has been parsed, incompletely.  Only the shaded lower-left corner of the parse tree exists.  None of the parse tree nodes numbered 7 and above exist yet.  Nodes 3, 4, and 6 are the roots of isolated subtrees for variable A, operator *, and number 2, respectively.  These three root nodes are temporarily held in a parse stack.  The remaining unparsed portion of the input stream is \"+ 1\".\n\n===Shift and reduce actions===\n\nAs with other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser works by doing some combination of Shift steps and Reduce steps.  \n* A '''Shift''' step advances in the input stream by one symbol.  That shifted symbol becomes a new single-node parse tree.\n* A '''Reduce''' step applies a completed grammar rule to some of the recent parse trees, joining them together as one tree with a new root symbol.\nIf the input has no syntax errors, the parser continues with these steps until all of the input has been consumed and all of the parse trees have been reduced to a single tree representing an entire legal input.\n\nLR parsers differ from other shift-reduce parsers in how they decide when to reduce, and how to pick between rules with similar endings.  But the final decisions and the sequence of shift or reduce steps are the same.\n\nMuch of the LR parser's efficiency is from being deterministic. To avoid guessing, the LR parser often looks ahead (rightwards) at the next scanned symbol, before deciding what to do with previously scanned symbols.  The lexical scanner works one or more symbols ahead of the parser.  The '''lookahead''' symbols are the 'right-hand context' for the parsing decision.<ref>\nEngineering a Compiler (2nd edition), by Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon, [[Morgan Kaufmann]] 2011.</ref>\n\n===Bottom-up parse stack===\n\n[[File:Bottom-Up Parser.svg|thumb|x250px|right|Bottom-Up Parser at step 6]]\n\nLike other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser lazily waits until it has scanned and parsed all parts of some construct before committing to what the combined construct is.  The parser then acts immediately on the combination instead of waiting any further.  In the parse tree example, the phrase A gets reduced to Value and then to Products in steps 1-3 as soon as lookahead * is seen, rather than waiting any later to organize those parts of the parse tree.  The decisions for how to handle A are based only on what the parser and scanner have already seen, without considering things that appear much later to the right.\n\nReductions reorganize the most recently parsed things, immediately to the left of the lookahead symbol.  So the list of already-parsed things acts like a [[stack (abstract data type)|stack]].  This '''parse stack''' grows rightwards.  The base or bottom of the stack is on the left and holds the leftmost, oldest parse fragment.  Every reduction step acts only on the rightmost, newest parse fragments.  (This accumulative parse stack is very unlike the predictive, leftward-growing parse stack used by [[top-down parser]]s.)\n\n===Bottom-up parse steps for example A*2 + 1 ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <small>Step</small> !! <small>Parse Stack</small>  !!  <small>Unparsed</small> !! <small>Shift/Reduce</small>\n|-\n| 0 || ''empty'' || align=\"right\" | A*2 + 1 || shift\n|-\n| 1 || ''id'' || align=\"right\" | *2 + 1 || Value \u2192 ''id''  \n|-\n| 2 || Value || align=\"right\" | *2 + 1 || Products \u2192 Value \n|-\n| 3 || Products || align=\"right\" | *2 + 1 || shift \n|-\n| 4 || Products * || align=\"right\" | 2 + 1 || shift\n|-\n| 5 || Products * ''int'' || align=\"right\" | + 1 || Value \u2192 ''int''\n|-\n| 6 || Products * Value || align=\"right\" | + 1 ||  Products \u2192 Products * Value\n|-\n| 7 || Products || align=\"right\" | + 1 || Sums \u2192 Products \n|-\n| 8 || Sums || align=\"right\" | + 1 || shift  \n|-\n| 9 || Sums + || align=\"right\" | 1 || shift \n|- \n| 10 || Sums + ''int'' || ''eof'' || Value \u2192 ''int'' \n|-\n| 11 || Sums + Value || ''eof'' || Products \u2192 Value\n|-\n| 12 || Sums + Products || ''eof'' ||  Sums \u2192 Sums + Products \n|-\n| 13 || Sums || ''eof'' || done \n|-\n|}\n\nStep 6 applies a grammar rule with multiple parts:\n: Products \u2192 Products * Value\nThis matches the stack top holding the parsed phrases \"... Products * Value\".  The reduce step replaces this instance of the rule's right hand side, \"Products * Value\" by the rule's left hand side symbol, here a larger Products.  If the parser builds complete parse trees, the three trees for inner Products, *, and Value are combined by a new tree root for Products.  Otherwise, [[Semantics#Programming languages|semantic]] details from the inner Products and Value are output to some later compiler pass, or are combined and saved in the new Products symbol.<ref>\nCrafting and Compiler, by Charles Fischer, Ron Cytron, and Richard LeBlanc, Addison Wesley 2009.</ref>\n\n===LR parse steps for example A*2 + 1 ===\n\nIn LR parsers, the shift and reduce decisions are potentially based on the entire stack of everything that has been previously parsed, not just on a single, topmost stack symbol. If done in an unclever way, that could lead to very slow parsers that get slower and slower for longer inputs. LR parsers do this with constant speed, by summarizing all the relevant left context information into a single number called the LR(0) '''parser state'''. For each grammar and LR analysis method, there is a fixed (finite) number of such states. Besides holding the already-parsed symbols, the parse stack also remembers the state numbers reached by everything up to those points.\n\nAt every parse step, the entire input text is divided into a stack of previously parsed phrases, and a current lookahead symbol, and the remaining unscanned text.  The parser's next action is determined by its current LR(0) {{color|#928|state number}} (rightmost on the stack) and the lookahead symbol. In the steps below, all the black details are exactly the same as in other non-LR shift-reduce parsers. LR parser stacks add the state information in purple, summarizing the black phrases to their left on the stack and what syntax possibilities to expect next.  Users of an LR parser can usually ignore state information.  These states are explained in a later section.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <small><br>Step</small> !! <small>Parse Stack<br><sub>{{color|#928|state}}</sub> [Symbol<sub>{{color|#928|state}}</sub>]* </small> !! <small>Look<br>Ahead</small> !! <small><br>Unscanned</small> !! <small>Parser<br>Action</small> !! <small><br>Grammar Rule</small>|| <small>Next<br>State</small>\n|-\n| 0 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub>\n|| ''id'' || align=\"right\" | *2 + 1 || shift ||  || {{color|#928|9}}\n|-\n| 1 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \n''id''<sub>{{color|#928|9}}</sub> \n|| *  ||  align=\"right\" | 2 + 1 || reduce || Value \u2192 ''id'' || {{color|#928|7}}\n|-\n| 2 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nValue<sub>{{color|#928|7}}</sub>\n|| * ||  align=\"right\" | 2 + 1 || reduce || Products \u2192 Value || {{color|#928|4}}\n|-\n| 3 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub>\n|| * ||  align=\"right\" | 2 + 1 || shift || || {{color|#928|5}}\n|-\n| 4 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> *<sub>{{color|#928|5}}</sub> \n|| ''int'' ||  align=\"right\" | + 1 || shift ||  || {{color|#928|8}}\n|-\n| 5 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> *<sub>{{color|#928|5}}</sub>\n''int''<sub>{{color|#928|8}}</sub> \n|| + ||  align=\"right\" | 1 || reduce || Value \u2192 ''int'' || {{color|#928|6}}\n|-\n| 6 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> *<sub>{{color|#928|5}}</sub>\nValue<sub>{{color|#928|6}}</sub>\n|| + ||  align=\"right\" | 1 || reduce || Products \u2192 Products * Value || {{color|#928|4}}\n|-\n| 7 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> \n|| + || align=\"right\" | 1 || reduce || Sums \u2192 Products || {{color|#928|1}}\n|-\n| 8 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n|| + || align=\"right\" | 1 || shift ||  || {{color|#928|2}}\n|-\n| 9 ||\n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n+<sub>{{color|#928|2}}</sub>  \n|| ''int'' || align=\"right\" | ''eof'' || shift ||  || {{color|#928|8}}\n|- \n| 10 ||\n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n+<sub>{{color|#928|2}}</sub> \n''int''<sub>{{color|#928|8}}</sub>\n|| ''eof'' ||  || reduce || Value \u2192 ''int'' || {{color|#928|7}}\n|-\n| 11 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n+<sub>{{color|#928|2}}</sub>  \nValue<sub>{{color|#928|7}}</sub> \n|| ''eof'' ||  || reduce || Products \u2192 Value || {{color|#928|3}}\n|-\n| 12 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n+<sub>{{color|#928|2}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|3}}</sub>\n|| ''eof'' ||  || reduce || Sums \u2192 Sums + Products || {{color|#928|1}}\n|-\n| 13 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nSums<sub>{{color|#928|1}}</sub> \n|| ''eof'' ||  || done ||  || \n|-\n|}\n\nAt initial step 0, the input stream \"A*2 + 1\" is divided into\n* an empty section on the parse stack,\n* lookahead text \"A\" scanned as an ''id'' symbol, and\n* the remaining unscanned text \"*2 + 1\".\nThe parse stack begins by holding only initial state 0.

When state 3 sees the lookahead ''eof'', it knows to apply the completed grammar rule\n::Sums \u2192 Sums + Products\nby combining the stack's rightmost three phrases for Sums, '''+''', and Products into one thing.  State 3 itself doesn't know what the next state should be.  This is found by going back to state 0, just to the left of the phrase being reduced.  When state 0 sees this new completed instance of a Sums, it advances to state 1 (again).  This consulting of older states is why they are kept on the stack, instead of keeping only the current state.\n\n===Grammar for the example A*2 + 1===\n\nLR parsers are constructed from a grammar that formally defines the syntax of the input language as a set of patterns.  The grammar doesn't cover all language rules, such as the size of numbers, or the consistent use of names and their definitions in the context of the whole program.  LR parsers use a [[context-free grammar]] that deals just with local patterns of symbols.\n\nThe example grammar used here is a tiny subset of the Java or C language:\n\n::r0: Goal \u2192 Sums ''eof''\n::r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + Products\n::r2: Sums \u2192 Products\n::r3: Products \u2192 Products * Value\n::r4: Products \u2192 Value\n::r5: Value \u2192 ''int''\n::r6: Value \u2192 ''id''\n\nThe grammar's [[terminal symbol]]s are the multi-character symbols or 'tokens' found in the input stream by a [[lexical analysis|lexical scanner]].  Here these include '''+''' '''*''' and ''int'' for any integer constant, and ''id'' for any identifier name, and ''eof'' for end of input file.  The grammar doesn't care what the ''int'' values or ''id'' spellings are, nor does it care about blanks or line breaks.  The grammar uses these terminal symbols but does not define them.  They are always leaf nodes (at the bottom bushy end) of the parse tree.\n\nThe capitalized terms like Sums are [[nonterminal symbol]]s.  These are names for concepts or patterns in the language. They are defined in the grammar and never occur themselves in the input stream.  They are always internal nodes (above the bottom) of the parse tree. They only happen as a result of the parser applying some grammar rule.  Some nonterminals are defined with two or more rules; these are alternative patterns.  Rules can refer back to themselves, which are called ''recursive''.  This grammar uses recursive rules to handle repeated math operators.  Grammars for complete languages use recursive rules to handle lists, parenthesized expressions, and nested statements.\n\nAny given computer language can be described by several different grammars.  An LR(1) parser can handle many but not all common grammars.  It is usually possible to manually modify a grammar so that it fits the limitations of LR(1) parsing and the generator tool.\n\nThe grammar for an LR parser must be [[ambiguous grammar|unambiguous]] itself, or must be augmented by tie-breaking precedence rules.  This means there is only one correct way to apply the grammar to a given legal example of the language, resulting in a unique parse tree with just one meaning, and a unique sequence of shift/reduce actions for that example.  LR parsing is not a useful technique for human languages with ambiguous grammars that depend on the interplay of words.  Human languages are better handled by parsers like [[Generalized LR parser]], the [[Earley parser]], or the [[CYK algorithm]] that can simultaneously compute all possible parse trees in one pass.\n\n===Parse table for the example grammar===\n\nMost LR parsers are table driven. The parser's program code is a simple generic loop that is the same for all grammars and languages. The knowledge of the grammar and its syntactic implications are encoded into unchanging data tables called '''parse tables''' (or '''parsing tables'''). Entries in a table show whether to shift or reduce (and by which grammar rule), for every legal combination of parser state and lookahead symbol.  The parse tables also tell how to compute the next state, given just a current state and a next symbol.\n\nThe parse tables are much larger than the grammar.  LR tables are hard to accurately compute by hand for big grammars.  So they are mechanically derived from the grammar by some [[parser generator]] tool like [[GNU Bison|Bison]].<ref>\nFlex & Bison: Text Processing Tools, by John Levine, O'Reilly Media 2009.</ref>\n\nDepending on how the states and parsing table are generated, the resulting parser is called either a [[simple LR parser|'''SLR''' (simple LR) parser]], [[LALR parser|'''LALR''' (look-ahead LR) parser]], or [[canonical LR parser]]. LALR parsers handle more grammars than SLR parsers. Canonical LR parsers handle even more grammars, but use many more states and much larger tables.  The example grammar is SLR.\n\nLR parse tables are two-dimensional.  Each current LR(0) parser state has its own row.  Each possible next symbol has its own column.  Some combinations of state and next symbol are not possible for valid input streams.  These blank cells trigger syntax error messages.\n\nThe '''Action''' left half of the table has columns for lookahead terminal symbols.  These cells determine whether the next parser action is shift (to state ''n''), or reduce (by grammar rule '''r'''<sub>n</sub>).\n\nThe '''Goto''' right half of the table has columns for nonterminal symbols.  These cells show which state to advance to, after some reduction's Left Hand Side has created an expected new instance of that symbol.  This is like a shift action but for nonterminals; the lookahead terminal symbol is unchanged.\n\nThe table column \"Current Rules\" documents the meaning and syntax possibilities for each state, as worked out by the parser generator.  It is not included in the actual tables used at parsing time.  The <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> (pink dot) marker shows where the parser is now, within some partially recognized grammar rules.  The things to the left of <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> have been parsed, and the things to the right are expected soon.  A state has several such current rules if the parser has not yet narrowed possibilities down to a single rule.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Products begins with terminal symbols ''int'' or ''id''.  If the lookahead is either of those, the parser shifts them in and advances to state 8 or 9, respectively.  When a Products has been found, the parser advances to state 3 to accumulate the complete list of summands and find the end of rule r0.  A Products can also begin with nonterminal  Value.  For any other lookahead or nonterminal, the parser announces a syntax error.\n\n{{rule}}\n\nIn state 3, the parser has just found a Products phrase, that could be from two possible grammar rules:\n::r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + Products <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n::r3: Products \u2192 Products <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * Value\nThe choice between r1 and r3 can't be decided just from looking backwards at prior phrases.  The parser has to check the lookahead symbol to tell what to do.  If the lookahead is '''*''', it is in rule 3, so the parser shifts in the '''*''' and advances to state 5.  If the lookahead is ''eof'', it is at the end of rule 1 and rule 0, so the parser is done.\n\n{{rule}}\n\nIn state 9 above, all the non-blank, non-error cells are for the same reduction r6.  Some parsers save time and table space by not checking the lookahead symbol in these simple cases.  Syntax errors are then detected somewhat later, after some harmless reductions, but still before the next shift action or parser decision.\n\nIndividual table cells must not hold multiple, alternative actions, otherwise the parser would be nondeterministic with guesswork and backtracking.  If the grammar is not LR(1), some cells will have shift/reduce conflicts between a possible shift action and reduce action, or reduce/reduce conflicts between multiple grammar rules.  LR(k) parsers resolve these conflicts (where possible) by checking additional lookahead symbols beyond the first.\n\n=== LR parser loop ===\n\nThe LR parser begins with a nearly empty parse stack containing just the start state 0, and with the lookahead holding the input stream's first scanned symbol.  The parser then repeats the following loop step until done, or stuck on a syntax error:\n\nThe topmost state on the parse stack is some state ''s'', and the current lookahead is some terminal symbol ''t''.  Look up the next parser action from row ''s'' and column ''t'' of the Lookahead Action table.  That action is either Shift, Reduce, Done, or Error:\n* Shift ''n'':\n::Shift the matched terminal ''t'' onto the parse stack and scan the next input symbol into the lookahead buffer.\n::Push next state ''n'' onto the parse stack as the new current state.\n* Reduce r<sub>m</sub>:  Apply grammar rule r<sub>m</sub>: Lhs \u2192 S<sub>1</sub> S<sub>2</sub> ... S<sub>L</sub>\n::Remove the matched topmost L symbols (and parse trees and associated state numbers) from the parse stack.\n::This exposes a prior state ''p'' that was expecting an instance of the Lhs symbol.\n::Join the L parse trees together as one parse tree with new root symbol Lhs.\n::Lookup the next state ''n'' from row ''p'' and column ''Lhs'' of the LHS Goto table.\n::Push the symbol and tree for Lhs onto the parse stack.\n::Push next state ''n'' onto the parse stack as the new current state.\n::The lookahead and input stream remain unchanged.\n* Done: Lookahead ''t'' is the ''eof'' marker.  End of parsing. If the state stack contains just the start state report success. Otherwise, report a syntax error.\n* Error: Report a syntax error.  The parser ends, or attempts some recovery.\n\nLR parser stack usually stores just the LR(0) automaton states, as the grammar symbols may be derived from them (in the automaton, all input transitions to some state are marked with the same symbol, which is the symbol associated with this state). Moreover, these symbols are almost never needed as the state is all that matters when making the parsing decision.<ref name=\"Compilers 2006\">Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition), by Alfred Aho, Monica Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey Ullman, Prentice Hall 2006.</ref>\n\n==LR generator analysis==\n\nThis section of the article can be skipped by most users of LR parser generators.\n\n===LR states===\n\nState 2 in the example parse table is for the partially parsed rule \n::r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> Products\nThis shows how the parser got here, by seeing Sums then '''+''' while looking for a larger Sums.  The <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker has advanced beyond the beginning of the rule.  It also shows how the parser expects to eventually complete the rule, by next finding a complete Products.  But more details are needed on how to parse all the parts of that Products.\n\nThe partially parsed rules for a state are called its \"core LR(0) items\".  The parser generator adds additional rules or items for all the possible next steps in building up the expected Products:\n::r3: Products \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> Products * Value\n::r4: Products \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> Value\n::r5: Value \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> ''int''\n::r6: Value \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> ''id''\nThe <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker is at the beginning of each of these added rules; the parser has not yet confirmed and parsed any part of them.  These additional items are called the \"closure\" of the core items. For each nonterminal symbol immediately following a <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>, the generator adds the rules defining that symbol.  This adds more <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> markers, and possibly different follower symbols.  This closure process continues until all follower symbols have been expanded.  The follower nonterminals for state 2 begins with Products.  Value is then added by closure. The follower terminals are ''int'' and ''id''.\n\nThe kernel and closure items together show all possible legal ways to proceed from the current state to future states and complete phrases.  If a follower symbol appears in only one item, it leads to a next state containing only one core item with the <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker advanced.  So ''int'' leads to next state 8 with core\n::r5: Value \u2192 ''int'' <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nIf the same follower symbol appears in several items, the parser cannot yet tell which rule applies here.  So that symbol leads to a next state that shows all remaining possibilities, again with the <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker advanced.  Products appears in both r1 and r3.  So Products leads to next state 4 with core\n::r1: Sums \u2192 Sums + Products <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n::r3: Products \u2192 Products <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * Value\nIn words, that means if the parser has seen a single Products, it might be done, or it might still have even more things to multiply together. All the core items have the same symbol preceding the <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> marker; all transitions into this state are always with that same symbol.\n\nSome transitions will be to cores and states that have been enumerated already.  Other transitions lead to new states.  The generator starts with the grammar's goal rule.  From there it keeps exploring known states and transitions until all needed states have been found.\n\nThese states are called \"LR(0)\" states because they use a lookahead of ''k''=0, i.e. no lookahead.  The only checking of input symbols occurs when the symbol is shifted in.  Checking of lookaheads for reductions is done separately by the parse table, not by the enumerated states themselves.\n\n===Finite state machine===\n\nThe parse table describes all possible LR(0) states and their transitions.  They form a [[finite state automaton|finite state machine]] (FSM).  An FSM is a simple engine for parsing simple unnested languages, without using a stack.  In this LR application, the FSM's modified \"input language\" has both terminal and nonterminal symbols, and covers any partially parsed stack snapshot of the full LR parse.\n\nRecall step 5 of the Parse Steps Example:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! <small><br>Step</small> !! <small>Parse Stack<br><sub>{{color|#928|state}}</sub> Symbol <sub>{{color|#928|state}}</sub> ...</small> !! <small>Look<br>Ahead</small> !! <small><br>Unscanned</small>\n|-\n| 5 || \n<sub>{{color|#928|0}}</sub> \nProducts<sub>{{color|#928|4}}</sub> *<sub>{{color|#928|5}}</sub>\n''int''<sub>{{color|#928|8}}</sub> \n|| + ||  align=\"right\" | 1 \n|-\n|}\n\nThe parse stack shows a series of state transitions, from the start state 0, to state 4 and then on to 5 and current state 8.  The symbols on the parse stack are the shift or goto symbols for those transitions.  Another way to view this, is that the finite state machine can scan the stream \"Products&nbsp;*&nbsp;''int''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1\" (without using yet another stack) and find the leftmost complete phrase that should be reduced next.  And that is indeed its job!\n\nHow can a mere FSM do this when the original unparsed language has nesting and recursion and definitely requires an analyzer with a stack?  The trick is that everything to the left of the stack top has already been fully reduced.  This eliminates all the loops and nesting from those phrases.  The FSM can ignore all the older beginnings of phrases, and track just the newest phrases that might be completed next.  The obscure name for this in LR theory is \"viable prefix.\"\n\n===Lookahead sets===\n\nThe states and transitions give all the needed information for the parse table's shift actions and goto actions.  The generator also needs to calculate the expected lookahead sets for each reduce action.\n\nIn '''SLR''' parsers, these lookahead sets are determined directly from the grammar, without considering the individual states and transitions.  For each nonterminal S, the SLR generator works out Follows(S), the set of all the terminal symbols which can immediately follow some occurrence of S.  In the parse table, each reduction to S uses Follow(S) as its LR(1) lookahead set.  Such follow sets are also used by generators for LL top-down parsers.  A grammar that has no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts when using Follow sets is called an SLR grammar.\n\n'''LALR''' parsers have the same states as SLR parsers, but use a more complicated, more precise way of working out the minimum necessary reduction lookaheads for each individual state.  Depending on the details of the grammar, this may turn out to be the same as the Follow set computed by SLR parser generators, or it may turn out to be a subset of the SLR lookaheads.  Some grammars are okay for LALR parser generators but not for SLR parser generators.  This happens when the grammar has spurious shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts using Follow sets, but no conflicts when using the exact sets computed by the LALR generator.  The grammar is then called LALR(1) but not SLR.\n\nAn SLR or LALR parser avoids having duplicate states.  But this minimization is not necessary, and can sometimes create unnecessary lookahead conflicts.  '''Canonical LR''' parsers use duplicated (or \"split\") states to better remember the left and right context of a nonterminal's use. Each occurrence of a symbol S in the grammar can be treated independently with its own lookahead set, to help resolve reduction conflicts.  This handles a few more grammars.  Unfortunately, this greatly magnifies the size of the parse tables if done for all parts of the grammar.  This splitting of states can also be done manually and selectively with any SLR or LALR parser, by making two or more named copies of some nonterminals.  A grammar that is conflict-free for a canonical LR generator but has conflicts in an LALR generator is called LR(1) but not LALR(1), and not SLR.\n\nSLR, LALR, and canonical LR parsers make exactly the same shift and reduce decisions when the input stream is correct language.  When the input has a syntax error, the LALR parser may do some additional (harmless) reductions before detecting the error than would the canonical LR parser.  And the SLR parser may do even more.  This happens because the SLR and LALR parsers are using a generous superset approximation to the true, minimal lookahead symbols for that particular state.\n\n===Syntax error recovery===\n\nLR parsers can generate somewhat helpful error messages for the first syntax error in a program, by simply enumerating all the terminal symbols that could have appeared next instead of the unexpected bad lookahead symbol.  But this does not help the parser work out how to parse the remainder of the input program to look for further, independent errors.  If the parser recovers badly from the first error, it is very likely to mis-parse everything else and produce a cascade of unhelpful spurious error messages.\n\nIn the [[yacc]] and bison parser generators, the parser has an ad hoc mechanism to abandon the current statement, discard some parsed phrases and lookahead tokens surrounding the error, and resynchronize the parse at some reliable statement-level delimiter like semicolons or braces.  This often works well for allowing the parser and compiler to look over the rest of the program.\n\nMany syntactic coding errors are simple typos or omissions of a trivial symbol.  Some LR parsers attempt to detect and automatically repair these common cases.  The parser enumerates every possible single-symbol insertion, deletion, or substitution at the error point.  The compiler does a trial parse with each change to see if it worked okay.  (This requires backtracking to snapshots of the parse stack and input stream, normally unneeded by the parser.)  Some best repair is picked.  This gives a very helpful error message and resynchronizes the parse well.  However, the repair is not trustworthy enough to permanently modify the input file.  Repair of syntax errors is easiest to do consistently in parsers (like LR) that have parse tables and an explicit data stack.\n\n===Variants of LR parsers===\n\nThe LR parser generator decides what should happen for each combination of parser state and lookahead symbol.  These decisions are usually turned into read-only data tables that drive a generic parser loop that is grammar- and state-independent.  But there are also other ways to turn those decisions into an active parser.\n\nSome LR parser generators create separate tailored program code for each state, rather than a parse table.  These parsers can run several times faster than the generic parser loop in table-driven parsers.  The fastest parsers use generated assembler code.\n\nIn the [[recursive ascent parser]] variation, the explicit parse stack structure is also replaced by the implicit stack used by subroutine calls.  Reductions terminate several levels of subroutine calls, which is clumsy in most languages.  So recursive ascent parsers are generally slower, less obvious, and harder to hand-modify than [[recursive descent parser]]s.\n\nAnother variation replaces the parse table by pattern-matching rules in non-procedural languages such as [[Prolog]].\n\n'''GLR''' [[Generalized LR parser]]s use LR bottom-up techniques to find all possible parses of input text, not just one correct parse.   This is essential for ambiguous grammars such as used for human languages.  The multiple valid parse trees are computed simultaneously, without backtracking.  GLR is sometimes helpful for computer languages that are not easily described by a conflict-free LALR(1) grammar.\n\n'''LC''' [[Left corner parser]]s use LR bottom-up techniques for recognizing the left end of alternative grammar rules.  When the alternatives have been narrowed down to a single possible rule, the parser then switches to top-down LL(1) techniques for parsing the rest of that rule.  LC parsers have smaller parse tables than LALR parsers and better error diagnostics.  There are no widely used generators for deterministic LC parsers.  Multiple-parse LC parsers are helpful with human languages with very large grammars.\n\n===Theory===\n\nLR parsers were invented by [[Donald Knuth]] in 1965 as an efficient generalization of [[simple precedence parser|precedence parser]]s.  Knuth proved that LR parsers were the most general-purpose parsers possible that would still be efficient in the worst cases.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}  \n:\"LR(''k'') grammars can be efficiently parsed with an execution time essentially proportional to the length of the string.\"<ref>Knuth (1965), p.638</ref>\n:For every ''k''\u22651, \"a language can be generated by an LR(''k'') grammar if and only if it is deterministic [and context-free], if and only if it can be generated by an LR(1) grammar.\"<ref>Knuth (1965), p.635. Knuth didn't mention the restriction ''k''\u22651 there, but it is required by his theorems he referred to, viz. on p.629 and p.630. Similarly, the restriction to [[context-free language]]s is tacitly understood from the context.</ref>\n\nIn other words, if a language was reasonable enough to allow an efficient one-pass parser, it could be described by an LR(''k'') grammar.  And that grammar could always be mechanically transformed into an equivalent (but larger) LR(1) grammar.  So an LR(1) parsing method was, in theory, powerful enough to handle any reasonable language.  In practice, the natural grammars for many programming languages are close to being LR(1).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe canonical LR parsers described by Knuth had too many states and very big parse tables that were impractically large for the limited memory of computers of that era.  LR parsing became practical when [[Frank DeRemer]] invented [[Simple LR parser|SLR]] and [[LALR]] parsers with much fewer states.<ref>\nPractical Translators for LR(k) Languages, by Frank DeRemer, MIT PhD dissertation 1969.</ref><ref>\nSimple LR(k) Grammars, by Frank DeRemer, Comm.

This table is important to find out the next state after every reduction. After a reduction, the next state is found by looking up the '''goto table''' entry for top of the stack (i.e. current state) and the reduced rule's LHS (i.e. non-terminal).\n\n=== Parsing steps ===\n\nThe table below illustrates each step in the process. Here the state refers to the element at the top of the stack (the right-most element), and the next action is determined by referring to the action table above. A $ is appended to the input string to denote the end of the stream.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! State\n! Input stream\n! Output stream\n! Stack\n!

To find the next action (shift, reduce, accept or error), the action table is indexed with the current state (the \"current state\" is just whatever is on the top of the stack), which in this case is 0, and the current input symbol, which is '1'. The action table specifies a shift to state 2, and so state 2 is pushed onto the stack (again, all the state information is in the stack, so \"shifting to state 2\" is the same as pushing 2 onto the stack). The resulting stack is\n\n: ['''0''' '1' '''2''']\n\nwhere the top of the stack is 2. For the sake of explanation the symbol (e.g., '1', B) is shown that caused the transition to the next state, although strictly speaking it is not part of the stack.\n\nIn state 2, the action table says to reduce with grammar rule 5 (regardless of what terminal the parser sees on the input stream), which means that the parser has just recognized the right-hand side of rule 5. In this case, the parser writes 5 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has one symbol), and pushes on the stack the state from the cell in the goto table for state 0 and B, i.e., state 4. The resulting stack is:\n\n: ['''0''' B '''4''']\n\nHowever, in state 4, the action table says the parser should now reduce with rule 3. So it writes 3 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack, and finds the new state in the goto table for state 0 and E, which is state 3. The resulting stack:\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''']\n\nThe next terminal that the parser sees is a '+' and according to the action table it should then go to state 6:\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''' '+' '''6''']\n\nThe resulting stack can be interpreted as the history of a [[finite state automaton]] that has just read a nonterminal E followed by a terminal '+'. The transition table of this automaton is defined by the shift actions in the action table and the goto actions in the goto table.\n\nThe next terminal is now '1' and this means that the parser performs a shift and go to state 2:\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''' '+' '''6''' '1' '''2''']\n\nJust as the previous '1' this one is reduced to B giving the following stack:\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''' '+' '''6''' B '''8''']\n\nThe stack corresponds with a list of states of a finite automaton that has read a nonterminal E, followed by a '+' and then a nonterminal B. In state 8 the parser always performs a reduce with rule 2. The top 3 states on the stack correspond with the 3 symbols in the right-hand side of rule 2. This time we pop 3 elements off of the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has 3 symbols) and look up the goto state for E and 0, thus pushing state 3 back onto the stack\n\n: ['''0''' E '''3''']\n\nFinally, the parser reads a '$' (end of input symbol) from the input stream, which means that according to the action table (the current state is 3) the parser accepts the input string. The rule numbers that will then have been written to the output stream will be [5, 3, 5, 2] which is indeed a [[rightmost derivation]] of the string \"1 + 1\" in reverse.\n\n== Constructing LR(0) parsing tables ==\n=== Items ===<!-- This section is linked from [[LALR parser]] -->\n\nThe construction of these parsing tables is based on the notion of ''LR(0) items'' (simply called ''items'' here) which are grammar rules with a special dot added somewhere in the right-hand side. For example, the rule E \u2192 E + B has the following four corresponding items:\n: E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E + B\n: E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B\n: E \u2192 E + <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B\n: E \u2192 E + B <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\nRules of the form ''A'' \u2192 \u03b5 have only a single item ''A'' \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>. The item E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B, for example, indicates that the parser has recognized a string corresponding with E on the input stream and now expects to read a '+' followed by another string corresponding with B.\n\n=== Item sets ===\n\nIt is usually not possible to characterize the state of the parser with a single item because it may not know in advance which rule it is going to use for reduction. For example, if there is also a rule E \u2192 E * B then the items E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B and E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * B will both apply after a string corresponding with E has been read. Therefore, it is convenient to characterize the state of the parser by a set of items, in this case the set { E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B, E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * B }.\n\n=== Extension of Item Set by expansion of non-terminals ===\n\nAn item with a dot before a nonterminal, such as E \u2192 E + <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B, indicates that the parser expects to parse the nonterminal B next.  To ensure the item set contains all possible rules the parser may be in the midst of parsing, it must include all items describing how B itself will be parsed.  This means that if there are rules such as B \u2192 1 and B \u2192 0 then the item set must also include the items B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1 and B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 0. In general this can be formulated as follows:\n\n: If there is an item of the form ''A'' \u2192 ''v'' <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> ''Bw'' in an item set and in the grammar there is a rule of the form ''B'' \u2192 ''w' '' then the item ''B'' \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> ''w' '' should also be in the item set.\n\n=== Closure of item sets ===\n\nThus, any set of items can be extended by recursively adding all the appropriate items until all nonterminals preceded by dots are accounted for. The minimal extension is called the ''closure'' of an item set and written as '''clos'''(''I'') where ''I'' is an item set. It is these closed item sets that are taken as the states of the parser, although only the ones that are actually reachable from the begin state will be included in the tables.\n\n=== Augmented grammar ===\n\nBefore the transitions between the different states are determined, the grammar is augmented with an extra rule\n\n: (0) S \u2192 E eof\n\nwhere S is a new start symbol and E the old start symbol. The parser will use this rule for reduction exactly when it has accepted the whole input string.\n\nFor this example, the same grammar as above is augmented thus:\n\n: (0) S \u2192 E eof\n: (1) E \u2192 E * B\n: (2) E \u2192 E + B\n: (3) E \u2192 B\n: (4) B \u2192 0\n: (5) B \u2192 1\n\nIt is for this augmented grammar that the item sets and the transitions between them will be determined.\n\n== Table construction ==\n\n=== Finding the reachable item sets and the transitions between them ===\n\nThe first step of constructing the tables consists of determining the transitions between the closed item sets. These transitions will be determined as if we are considering a finite automaton that can read terminals as well as nonterminals. The begin state of this automaton is always the closure of the first item of the added rule: S \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E:\n\n: '''Item set 0'''\n: S \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E eof\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E * B\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E + B\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 0\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1\n\nThe [[boldface]]d \"'''+'''\" in front of an item indicates the items that were added for the closure (not to be confused with the mathematical '+' operator which is a terminal). The original items without a \"'''+'''\" are called the ''kernel'' of the item set.\n\nStarting at the begin state (S0), all of the states that can be reached from this state are now determined. The possible transitions for an item set can be found by looking at the symbols (terminals and nonterminals) found following the dots; in the case of item set 0 those symbols are the terminals '0' and '1' and the nonterminals E and B. To find the item set that each symbol <math display=\"inline\">x \\in \\{0, 1, E, B\\}</math>leads to,  the following procedure is followed for each of the symbols:\n# Take the subset, ''S'', of all items in the current item set where there is a dot in front of the symbol of interest, ''x''.\n# For each item in ''S'', move the dot to the right of ''x''.\n# Close the resulting set of items.\n\nFor the terminal '0' (i.e. where x = '0') this results in:\n\n: '''Item set 1'''\n: B \u2192 0 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nand for the terminal '1' (i.e. where x = '1') this results in:\n\n: '''Item set 2'''\n: B \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nand for the nonterminal E (i.e. where x = E) this results in:\n\n: '''Item set 3'''\n: S \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> eof\n: E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> * B\n: E \u2192 E <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> + B\n\nand for the nonterminal B (i.e. where x = B) this results in:\n\n: '''Item set 4'''\n: E \u2192 B <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nThe closure does not add new items in all cases - in the new sets above, for example, there are no nonterminals following the dot.\n\nAbove procedure is continued until no more new item sets are found. For the item sets 1, 2, and 4 there will be no transitions since the dot is not in front of any symbol. For item set 3 though, we have dots in front of terminals '*' and '+'. For symbol <math display=\"inline\">x = \\texttt{*}</math>the transition goes to:\n\n: '''Item set 5'''\n: E \u2192 E * <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 0\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1\n\nand for  <math display=\"inline\">x = \\texttt{+}</math>the transition goes to:\n\n: '''Item set 6'''\n: E \u2192 E + <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> B\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 0\n: '''+''' B \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1\n\nNow, the third iteration begins.\n\nFor item set 5, the terminals '0' and '1' and the nonterminal B must be considered, but the resulting closed item sets are equal to already found item sets 1 and 2, respectively. For the nonterminal B, the transition goes to:\n\n: '''Item set 7'''\n: E \u2192 E * B <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nFor item set 6, the terminal '0' and '1' and the nonterminal B must be considered, but as before, the resulting item sets for the terminals are equal to the already found item sets 1 and 2. For the nonterminal B the transition goes to:\n\n: '''Item set 8'''\n: E \u2192 E + B <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nThese final item sets 7 and 8 have no symbols beyond their dots so no more new item sets are added, so the item generating procedure is complete. The finite automaton, with item sets as its states is shown below.\n\nThe transition table for the automaton now looks as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"background:#e0e0d0;\"\n!  style=\"background:#d0e0ff; width:28%;\"|Item Set\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|*\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|+\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|0\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|1\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|E\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|B\n|-\n!0 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||1      ||2      ||3      ||4\n|-\n!1 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!2 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!3 \n|5      ||6      ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!4 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!5 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||1      ||2      ||&nbsp; ||7\n|-\n!6 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||1      ||2      ||&nbsp; ||8\n|-\n!7 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|-\n!8 \n|&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp; ||&nbsp;\n|}\n\n=== Constructing the action and goto tables ===\n\nFrom this table and the found item sets, the action and goto table are constructed as follows:\n<!-- Jezhotwells noted that sentences like the above \"are not encyclopaedic, reads like an instruction manual\" --> \n# The columns for nonterminals are copied to the goto table.\n# The columns for the terminals are copied to the action table as shift actions.\n# An extra column for '$' (end of input) is added to the action table that contains ''acc'' for every item set that contains an item of the form S \u2192 w <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> eof.\n# If an item set ''i'' contains an item of the form ''A'' \u2192 ''w'' <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> and ''A'' \u2192 ''w'' is rule ''m'' with ''m'' &gt; 0 then the row for state ''i'' in the action table is completely filled with the reduce action r''m''.\nThe reader may verify that this results indeed in the action and goto table that were presented earlier on.\n\n==== A note about LR(0) versus SLR and LALR parsing ====\n\nOnly step 4 of the above procedure produces reduce actions, and so all reduce actions must occupy an entire table row, causing the reduction to occur regardless of the next symbol in the input stream.  This is why these are LR(0) parse tables: they don't do any lookahead (that is, they look ahead zero symbols) before deciding which reduction to perform.  A grammar that needs lookahead to disambiguate reductions would require a parse table row containing different reduce actions in different columns, and the above procedure is not capable of creating such rows.\n<!-- Jezhotwells noted \"Paragraphs such as this should be rewritten in good plain english, at the moment this is gobbledegook to the average reader.\" -->\n\nRefinements to the '''LR'''(0) table construction procedure (such as [[Simple LR parser|SLR]] and [[LALR parser|LALR]]) are capable of constructing reduce actions that do not occupy entire rows.  Therefore, they are capable of parsing more grammars than LR(0) parsers.\n\n=== Conflicts in the constructed tables ===\n\nThe automaton is constructed in such a way that it is guaranteed to be deterministic. However, when reduce actions are added to the action table it can happen that the same cell is filled with a reduce action and a shift action (a ''shift-reduce conflict'') or with two different reduce actions (a ''reduce-reduce conflict''). However, it  can be shown that when this happens the grammar is not an LR(0) grammar. A classic real-world example of a shift-reduce conflict is the [[dangling else]] problem.\n\nA small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a shift-reduce conflict is:\n\n: (1) E \u2192 1 E\n: (2) E \u2192 1\n\nOne of the item sets found is:\n\n: '''Item set 1'''\n: E \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> E\n: E \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1 E\n: '''+''' E \u2192 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big> 1\n\nThere is a shift-reduce conflict in this item set: when constructing the action table according to the rules above,  the cell for  [item set 1, terminal '1'] contains '''s1''' (shift to state 1) '''and r2''' (reduce with grammar rule 2).\n\nA small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a reduce-reduce conflict is:\n\n: (1) E \u2192 A 1\n: (2) E \u2192 B 2\n: (3) A \u2192 1\n: (4) B \u2192 1\n\nIn this case the following item set is obtained:\n\n: '''Item set 1'''\n: A \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n: B \u2192 1 <big>{{color|#f7f|\u2022}}</big>\n\nThere is a reduce-reduce conflict in this item set because in the cells in the action table for this item set there will be both a reduce action for rule 3 and one for rule 4.\n\nBoth examples above can be solved by letting the parser use the follow set (see [[LL parser]]) of a nonterminal ''A'' to decide if it is going to use one of ''A''s rules for a reduction; it will only use the rule ''A'' \u2192 ''w'' for a reduction if the next symbol on the input stream is in the follow set of ''A''.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar'' format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]  format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following enhancement tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n\n* all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special {{code|x}}-type files under a {{code|PaxHeaders.XXXX}} directory.<ref>{{man|1|pax|SUS}}</ref>{{rp=exthdr.name}} A Pax-supporting implementation would make use of the info, while non supporting ones like [[7-Zip]] would show them as extra files, but hopefully not refusing to extract the file data.<ref>{{cite web |title=#2116 Tars with pax headers not parsed |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2116/ |website=7-Zip / Bugs | SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own extensions.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes,<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14  | df = dmy-all }} </ref> reimplementing star extensions. Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar''-format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]-format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following enhancement tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n* all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. GNU tar will extract additional information as a plain text file along with the file it refers to.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own extensions.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes,<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14  | df = dmy-all }} </ref> reimplementing star extensions. Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.
