In that year, Wanklyn and Chapman speculated on the adverse effects of the heavy metals \"arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, [[iron]] and [[manganese]]\" in [[drinking water]]. They noted an \"absence of investigation\" and were reduced to \"the necessity of pleading for the collection of data\".<ref>[[#Wanklyn|Wanklyn & Chapman 1868, pp.&nbsp;73\u20138]]; [[#Cameron|Cameron 1871, p.&nbsp;484]]</ref> In 1884, Blake described an apparent connection between toxicity and the atomic weight of an element.<ref>[[#Blake|Blake 1884]]</ref> The following sections provide historical thumbnails for the \"classical\" toxic heavy metals (arsenic, mercury and lead) and some more recent examples (chromium and cadmium).\n\n[[File:Orpiment mineral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Orpiment]], a toxic arsenic mineral used in the tanning industry to remove hair from hides.]]\n\n=== Arsenic ===\n\n[[Arsenic]], as [[realgar]] ({{chem|As|4|S|4}}) and [[orpiment]] ({{chem|As|2|S|3}}), was known in ancient times.

In Japan in 1910, the [[Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company]] began discharging cadmium into the Jinzugawa river, as a byproduct of mining operations. Residents in the surrounding area subsequently consumed rice grown in cadmium-contaminated irrigation water. They experienced softening of the bones and kidney failure.

''Isolation'' involves the use of caps, membranes or below-ground barriers in an attempt to quarantine the contaminated soil. ''Immobilization'' aims to alter the properties of the soil so as to hinder the mobility of the heavy contaminants. ''Toxicity reduction'' attempts to oxidise or reduce the toxic heavy metal ions, via chemical or [[Phytoremediation|biological means]] into less toxic or mobile forms. ''Physical separation'' involves the removal of the contaminated soil and the separation of the metal contaminants by mechanical means. ''Extraction'' is an on or off-site process that uses chemicals, high-temperature volatization, or electrolysis to extract contaminants from soils. The process or processes used will vary according to contaminant and the characteristics of the site.<ref>[[#Evanko|Evanko & Dzombak 1997, pp.&nbsp;1, 14\u201340]]</ref>\n\n== Benefits ==\n\nSome elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are [[dietary element|essential]], in small quantities, for human health.

In that year, Wanklyn and Chapman speculated on the adverse effects of the heavy metals \"arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, [[iron]] and [[manganese]]\" in [[drinking water]]. They noted an \"absence of investigation\" and were reduced to \"the necessity of pleading for the collection of data\".<ref>[[#Wanklyn|Wanklyn & Chapman 1868, pp.&nbsp;73\u20138]]; [[#Cameron|Cameron 1871, p.&nbsp;484]]</ref> In 1884, Blake described an apparent connection between toxicity and the atomic weight of an element.<ref>[[#Blake|Blake 1884]]</ref> The following sections provide historical thumbnails for the \"classical\" toxic heavy metals (arsenic, mercury and lead) and some more recent examples (chromium and cadmium).\n\n[[File:Orpiment mineral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Orpiment]], a toxic arsenic mineral used in the tanning industry to remove hair from hides.]]\n\n=== Arsenic ===\n\n[[Arsenic]], as [[realgar]] ({{chem|As|4|S|4}}) and [[orpiment]] ({{chem|As|2|S|3}}), was known in ancient times.

More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease.

In Japan in 1910, the [[Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company]] began discharging cadmium into the Jinzugawa river, as a byproduct of mining operations. Residents in the surrounding area subsequently consumed rice grown in cadmium-contaminated irrigation water. They experienced softening of the bones and kidney failure. The origin of these symptoms was not clear; possibilities raised at the time included \"a regional or bacterial disease or lead poisoning\".<ref>[[#Vallero|Vallero & Letcher 2013, p.&nbsp;240]]</ref> In 1955, cadmium was identified as the likely cause and in 1961 the source was directly linked to mining operations in the area.<ref>[[#Vallero|Vallero & Letcher 2013, pp.&nbsp;239\u2013241]]</ref> In February 2010, cadmium was found in [[Walmart]] exclusive [[Miley Cyrus]] jewelry.

Chelates are not without side effects and can also remove beneficial metals from the body. Vitamin and mineral supplements are sometimes co-administered for this reason.<ref>[[#ACS|American Cancer Society 2008]]; [[#NCPC|National Capital Poison Center 2010]]</ref>\n\nSoils contaminated by heavy metals can be remediated by one or more of the following technologies: isolation; immobilization; toxicity reduction; physical separation; or extraction. ''Isolation'' involves the use of caps, membranes or below-ground barriers in an attempt to quarantine the contaminated soil. ''Immobilization'' aims to alter the properties of the soil so as to hinder the mobility of the heavy contaminants. ''Toxicity reduction'' attempts to oxidise or reduce the toxic heavy metal ions, via chemical or [[Phytoremediation|biological means]] into less toxic or mobile forms. ''Physical separation'' involves the removal of the contaminated soil and the separation of the metal contaminants by mechanical means. ''Extraction'' is an on or off-site process that uses chemicals, high-temperature volatization, or electrolysis to extract contaminants from soils. The process or processes used will vary according to contaminant and the characteristics of the site.<ref>[[#Evanko|Evanko & Dzombak 1997, pp.&nbsp;1, 14\u201340]]</ref>\n\n== Benefits ==\n\nSome elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are [[dietary element|essential]], in small quantities, for human health.
