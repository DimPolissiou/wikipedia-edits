The blue area shows the Dacian lands conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. The orange area was inhabited by Free Dacian tribes and others.]]\n\nInhabited by the ancient [[Dacians]], part of today's territory of [[Romania]] was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106,<ref>Rita J. Markel, The Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 17, Twenty-First Century Books, 2007</ref> when [[Trajan]]'s army defeated the army of [[Dacia]]'s ruler [[Decebalus]] (''see [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]''). The [[Roman Dacia|Roman administration]] withdrew two centuries later, under the pressure of the [[Goths]] and [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpi]].\n\nTwo theories account for the origin of the Romanian people. One, known as the Daco-Roman continuity theory, posits that they are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous peoples living in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Province of [[Dacia]], while the other posits that the Romanians are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous populations of the former Roman provinces of [[Illyria]], [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]], and [[Macedon]], and the ancestors of Romanians later migrated from these Roman provinces south of the [[Danube]] into the area which they inhabit today.\n\nAccording to the first theory, the Romanians are descended from indigenous populations that inhabited what is now Romania and its immediate environs: [[Thracians]] ([[Dacians]], [[Getae]])  and Roman legionnaires and colonists. In the course of the two wars with the Roman legions, between AD 101\u2013102 and AD 105\u2013106 respectively, the emperor [[Trajan]] succeeded in defeating the Dacians and the greatest part of Dacia became a Roman province.\n\n[[File:Vatra.jpg|upright=1|right|thumb|Map showing the area where [[Latin language]] was spoken in pink during the Roman Empire in the 4\u20137th century.]]\n\nThe colonisation with Roman or Romanized elements, the use of the [[Latin]] language and the assimilation of Roman civilisation as well as the intense development of urban centres led to the Romanization of part of the autochthonous population in Dacia. This process was probably concluded by the 10th century when the assimilation of the [[Slavs]] by the Daco-Romanians was completed.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2009, O.Ed. \"The ethnogenesis of the Romanian people was probably completed by the 10th century. The first stage, the Romanization of the Geto-Dacians, had now been followed by the second, the assimilation of the Slavs by the Daco-Romans\".</ref>\n\nAccording to the south-of-the-Danube origin theory, the Romanians' ancestors, a combination of Romans and Romanized peoples of Illyria, Moesia and Thrace, moved northward across the Danube river into modern-day Romania. Small population groups speaking several versions of Romanian (Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, and Aromanian) still exist south of the Danube in Greece, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Serbia, but it is not known whether they themselves migrated from more northern parts of the Balkans, including Dacia. The south-of-the Danube theory usually favours northern [[Albania]] and/or [[Moesia]] (modern day Serbia and Northern Bulgaria) as the more specific places of Romanian [[ethnogenesis]].\n\nSmall genetic differences were reportedly<ref name = \"Varzari2006\">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1007/s10038-007-0113-x|pmid= 17387576|title= Population history of the Dniester\u2013Carpathians: Evidence from Alu markers|journal= Journal of Human Genetics|volume= 52|issue= 4|pages= 308\u201316|year= 2007|last1= Varzari|first1= Alexander|last2= Stephan|first2= Wolfgang|last3= Stepanov|first3= Vadim|last4= Raicu|first4= Florina|last5= Cojocaru|first5= Radu|last6= Roschin|first6= Yuri|last7= Glavce|first7= Cristiana|last8= Dergachev|first8= Valentin|last9= Spiridonova|first9= Maria|last10= Schmidt|first10= Horst D.|last11= Weiss|first11= Elisabeth}}</ref> found among [[Southeastern Europe]]an (Greece, Albania) populations and especially those of the [[Dniester]]\u2013[[Carpathian]] (Romania, Moldova, Ukraine) region.

The genetic affinities among Dniester\u2013Carpathian and southeastern European populations do not reflect their linguistic relationships.

However, Moldavia and Wallachia (extending to Dobruja and Bulgaria) were not entirely subdued by the Ottomans as both principalities became autonomous (which was not the case of other Ottoman territorial possessions in Europe). Transylvania, a third region inhabited by an important majority of Romanian speakers, was a vassal state of the Ottomans until 1687, when the principality became part of the Habsburg possessions. The three principalities were united for several months in 1600 under the authority of Wallachian [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]].<ref name=Stoica1>{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=18|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/18/}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Transhumance ways of the Vlachs.jpeg|thumb|right|Map depicting Romanian and Vlach [[transhumance]] in Eastern and Southeastern Europe.]]\n\nAdditionally, in medieval times there were other lands known by the name 'Vlach' (such as [[Great Vlachia]], situated between [[Thessaly]] and the western [[Pindus]] mountains, originally within the [[Byzantine Empire]], but after the 13th century autonomous or semi-independent; [[White Wallachia]], a Byzantine denomination for the region between the Danube River and the Balkans; [[Moravian Wallachia]], a region in south-eastern Czech Republic).\n\nUp until 1541, Transylvania was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], later (due to the conquest of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire) was a self-governed Principality governed by the Hungarian nobility. In 1699 it became a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg lands]]. By the 19th century, the [[Austrian Empire]] was awarded by the Ottomans with the region of [[Bukovina]] and, in 1812, the Russians occupied the eastern half of Moldavia, known as [[Bessarabia]].\n\n=== Late Modern Age to Contemporary Era ===\n[[File:RomaniaBorderHistoryAnnimation 1859-2010.gif|thumb|right|Animated history of Romania's borders (mid 19th century\u2013present).]]\n[[File:Romania 1859-1878.png|thumb|right|Map depicting the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia between 1859\u20131878.]]\n\nIn the context of the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848]] [[Romantic nationalism|Romanticist]] and [[national liberalism|liberal]] revolutions across Europe, the events that took place in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Grand Principality of Transylvania]] were the first of their kind to unfold in the Romanian-speaking territories. On the one hand, the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and the Transylvanian Romanians (with consistent support on behalf of the [[Austrian Empire]]) successfully managed to oppose the goals of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], with the two noteworthy historical figures leading the common Romanian-Saxon side at the time being [[Avram Iancu]] and [[Stephan Ludwig Roth]].\n\nOn the other hand, the Wallachian revolutions of [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|1821]] and [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848]] as well as the [[Moldavian Revolution of 1848]], which aimed for independence from Ottoman and Russian foreign rulership, represented important impacts in the process of spreading the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal ideology]] in the eastern and southern Romanian lands, in spite of the fact that all three eventually failed. Nonetheless, in 1859, [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] elected the same ruler, namely [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza|Alexander John Cuza]] (who reigned as ''[[Domnitor]]'') and were thus unified ''de facto'', resulting in the [[United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia|United Romanian Principalities]] for the period between 1859 and 1881.\n\nDuring the 1870s, the United Romanian Principalities (then led by [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] Domnitor [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]]) fought a [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|War of Independence]] against the Ottomans, with Romania's independence being formally recognised in 1878 at the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. Although the newly founded [[Kingdom of Romania]] initially allied with [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Romania]] refused to enter [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]], because it was obliged to wage war only if Austria-Hungary was attacked. In 1916, Romania joined the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]].\n\nAs a result, at the end of the war, Transylvania, Bessarabia, and Bukovina were awarded to Romania, through a series of international peace treaties, resulting in an enlarged and far more powerful kingdom under King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]]. As of 1920, the Romanian people was believed to number over 15 million solely in the region of the Romanian kingdom, a figure larger than the populations of [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], and the [[Netherlands]] combined.<ref name=Stoica2>{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=50|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/50/}}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar period, two additional monarchs came to the Romanian throne, namely [[King Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] and [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]]. This short-lived period was marked, at times, by political instabilities and efforts of maintaining a [[constitutional monarchy]] in favour of other, totalitarian regimes such as an [[absolute monarchy]] or a [[military dictatorship]].\n\n[[Romania during World War II|During World War II]], the Kingdom of Romania lost territory both to the east and west, as [[Northern Transylvania]] became part of [[Hungary]] through the [[Second Vienna Award]], while Bessarabia and northern Bukovina were taken by the Soviets and included in the [[Moldavian SSR]], respectively [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The eastern territory losses were facilitated by the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact]].\n\nAfter the end of the war, the Romanian Kingdom managed to regain territories lost westward but was nonetheless not given Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, the aforementioned regions being forcefully incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. Subsequently, the Soviet Union imposed a Communist government and [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] was forced to abdicate and leave for exile. [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] became the head of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] in 1965 and his draconian rule of the 1980s was ended by the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].\n\nThe 1989 revolution brought to power the dissident communist [[Ion Iliescu]]. He remained in power as head of state until 1996, when he was defeated by [[Romanian Democratic Convention|CDR]]-supported [[Emil Constantinescu]] at the [[1996 Romanian general election|1996 general elections]], the first in post-Communist Romania that saw a peaceful transition of power. Following Constantinescu's only term as president from 1996 to 2000, Iliescu was re-elected in late 2000 for another term of four years. In 2004, [[Traian B\u0103sescu]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]-[[Democratic Party (Romania)|PD]] candidate, was elected president. Five years later, B\u0103sescu was narrowly re-elected for a second term at the [[2009 Romanian presidential election|2009 presidential elections]].\n\nIn 2014, the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]-[[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|PDL]] candidate [[Klaus Iohannis|Klaus Johannis]] won a surprise victory over former prime minister and [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]]-supported contender [[Victor Ponta]] in the second round of the [[2014 Romanian presidential election|2014 presidential elections]]. Thus, Johannis became the first Romanian president stemming from an ethnic minority (as he belongs to the [[Germans of Romania|Romanian-German community]], being a [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]]). In 2019, the PNL-supported Johannis was re-elected to a second term as president at the [[2019 Romanian presidential election]].\n\nIn the meantime, Romania's major foreign policy achievements were the alignment with [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States of America|United States]] by joining the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] in 2004 and the [[European Union]] three years later, in 2007.\n\n==Genetics==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=March 2020}}\n{{Technical|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Haplogroups europe.png|thumb|Frequencies of Y Haplogroups in Europe]]\n\nThe prevailing element in [[Wallachia]] ([[Ploie\u0219ti]], [[Dolj County|Dolj]]), [[Moldavia]] ([[Piatra Neam\u021b]], [[Buhu\u0219i]]), [[Dobruja]] ([[Constan\u021ba]]), and northern Republic of Moldova is recorded to be [[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup I]],<ref>Bosch2006, Varzari2006, Varzari 2013, Martinez-Cruz 2012</ref> while the gene pool of [[Transylvania]] is often untypical and diverse.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez-Cruz B, Ioana M, Calafell F, Arauna LR, Sanz P, Ionescu R, Boengiu S, Kalaydjieva L, Pamjav H, Makukh H, Plantinga T, van der Meer JW, Comas D, Netea MG | title = Y-chromosome analysis in individuals bearing the Basarab name of the first dynasty of Wallachian kings | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = e41803 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22848614 | pmc = 3404992 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0041803 | editor1-last = Kivisild | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...741803M | editor1-first = Toomas }}</ref>{{clarify|date=March 2020}}\n\nOn the basis of 361 samples, Haplogroup I occurs at 32% in Romanians.<ref>Rootsi, Siiri (2004).

The basic vocabulary is of Latin origin,<ref name=Stoica2/> although there are some [[substratum]] words that are sometimes assumed to be of [[Dacian language|Dacian]] origin.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Romanian was isolated from the other Romance languages, and borrowed words from the nearby [[Slavic languages]] (see [[Slavic influence on Romanian]]). Later on, it borrowed a number of words from [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].<ref>Dr. Ayfer AKTA\u015e, T\u00fcrk Dili, TDK, 9/2007, s. 484\u2013495, Online: [http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/YENI%20TURK%20DILI/ayfer_aktas_gunumuz_rumence_turkce_kaynakli_sozler.pdf turkoloji.cu.edu.tr]</ref> During the modern era, most neologisms were borrowed from [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], though the language has increasingly begun to adopt [[English language|English]] borrowings.\n\nThe [[Moldovan language]], in its official form, is practically identical to Romanian, although there are some differences in colloquial speech. In the de facto independent (but internationally unrecognised) region of [[Transnistria]], the official script used to write Moldovan is Cyrillic.\n\nAs of 2017, an [[Ethnologue]] estimation puts the (worldwide) number of Romanian speakers at approximately 24.15 million.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ron Romanian language] on [[Ethnologue]].</ref> The 24.15 million, however, represent only speakers of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], not all of whom are necessarily ethnic Romanians. Also, this number does not include ethnic-Romanians who no longer speak the Romanian language.\n\n=== Surnames ===\nMany Romanian [[surname]]s have the suffix ''-escu'' or (less commonly) ''-a\u0219cu'' or ''-\u0103scu'' which corresponds to the Latin suffix ''-iscus'' and means \"belonging to the people\". For example, ''Petrescu'' used to be ''Petre's kin''.  Similar suffixes such as ''-asco'', ''-asgo'', ''-esque'', ''-ez'', etc. are present in other Latin-derived languages. Many Romanians in France changed this ending of their surnames to ''-esco'', because the way it is pronounced in French better approximates the Romanian pronunciation of ''-escu''.\n\nAnother widespread suffix of Romanian surnames is ''-eanu'' (or ''-an'', ''-anu''), which indicates the geographical origin. Here some examples: Moldoveanu/Moldovan/Moldovanu, from the region of [[Moldavia]] or from [[Moldova River|river Moldova]], Munteanu \"from mountains\", Jianu \"from Jiu river region\", Prut''eanu'', meaning from the [[Prut]] river, Mure\u0219''anu'', meaning from the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] river, Petr''eanu'' (meaning the son of Petre) etc..\n\nOther suffixes are ''-aru'' (or ''-oru'', ''-ar'', ''-or''), which indicates an occupation (like Feraru \"smith\", Morar \"miller\"), and ''-ei'', usually preceded by ''A-'' in front of a female name, which is a Latin inherited female genitive, like in '' Amariei'' ''\"of Maria\"'', ''Aelenei'' ''\"of Elena\"''. These matrilineal-rooted surnames are common in the historical region of Moldavia.\n\n*The most common surnames are ''Pop'' / ''Popa'' (\"the priest\")\u2014almost 200,000 Romanians have this surname<ref name=name-freq>{{cite news |url=http://www.ziua.ro/news.php?data=2007-12-05&id=1946 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106020531/http://www.ziua.ro/news.php?data=2007-12-05&id=1946 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2017-01-06 |title=Romanii au nume \"trasnite\" |date=December 2007|newspaper=Ziua|accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref>\n*\u2014''Popescu'' (\"son of the priest\") \u2014almost 150,000 have this name<ref name=name-freq/>\n*\u2014 and ''Ionescu'' (\"John's (Ion's) son\").\n\n== Names for Romanians ==\nIn English, Romanians are usually called Romanians, Rumanians, or Roumanians except in some historical texts, where they are called Roumans or [[Vlachs]].\n\n=== Etymology of the name Romanian (rom\u00e2n) ===\n{{Main|Name of Romania}}\n[[File:Tricolore1848.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Romanian revolutionaries of 1848 waving the tricolor flag]]\n\nFrom the Middle Ages, Romanians bore two names, the [[exonym]] (one given to them by foreigners) ''Wallachians'' or ''Vlachs'', under its various forms (vlah, valah, valach, voloh, blac, ol\u0103h, vlas, ilac, ulah, etc.), and the [[endonym]] (the name they used for themselves) ''Romanians'' (Rum\u00e2ni/Rom\u00e2ni).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/48209/1/Pop%2bIoan%2bAurel-Despre%2bsemnificatia%2bunor%2bnume-2009.pdf|title=On the Significance of Certain Names: Romanian/Wallachian and Romania/Wallachia|author=Pop, Ioan-Aurel|accessdate=18 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe name \"Romanian\" is derived from Latin \"''Romanus''\". Under regular phonetical changes that are typical to the Romanian languages, the name ''romanus'' over the centuries transformed into \"rum\u00e2n\" {{IPA-ro|ru\u02c8m\u0268n|}}. An older form of \"rom\u00e2n\" was still in use in some regions. Socio-linguistic evolutions in the late 18th century led to a gradual preponderance of the \"rom\u00e2n\" spelling form, which was then generalised during the [[National awakening of Romania]] of early 19th century.\n\nUntil the 19th century, the term Romanian denoted the speakers of the Daco-Romanian dialect of the Romanian language, thus being a much more distinct concept than that of Romania, the country of the Romanians. Prior to 1867, the (Daco-)Romanians were part of different state entities: with the Moldavians and the Wallachians being split off and having shaped separate political identities, possessing states of their own, while the rest of the Romanians were part of other states. However, eventually they retained their Romanian cultural and ethnic identity up today.\n\n==== Daco-Romanian ====\nTo distinguish Romanians from the other Romanic peoples of the Balkans (Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians), the term [[Daco-Romanian]] is sometimes used to refer to those who speak the standard [[Romanian language]] and live in the territory of ancient [[Dacia]] (today comprising mostly Romania and Moldova), although some Daco-Romanians can be found in [[Vlachs of Serbia|the eastern part of Central Serbia]] (which was part of ancient [[Moesia]]).\n\n=== Etymology of the term Vlach ===\n{{Main|Vlachs}}\n\nThe name of \"[[Vlachs]]\" is an [[exonym]] that was used by Slavs to refer to all Romanized natives of the Balkans. It holds its origin from ancient Germanic\u2014being a cognate to \"Welsh\" and \"Walloon\"\u2014and perhaps even further back in time, from the [[Latin|Roman]] name Volcae, which was originally a [[Celt]]ic tribe. From the Slavs, it was passed on to other peoples, such as the [[Hungarians]] (''Ol\u00e1h'') and [[Greeks]] (''Vlachoi'') (see the Etymology section of [[Vlachs]]). [[Wallachia]], the Southern region of Romania, takes its name from the same source.\n\nNowadays, the term Vlach is more often used to refer to the Romanized populations of the Balkans who speak [[Romanian language|Daco-Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]].\n\n=== Anthroponyms ===\nThese are family names that have been derived from either ''Vlach'' or ''Romanian''. Most of these names have been given when a Romanian settled in a non-Romanian region. Examples: Ol\u00e1h (37,147 Hungarians have this name), Vlach, Vlahuta, Vlasa, Vlasi, Vla\u0161ic, Vlasceanu, Vlachopoulos, Voloh, Volyh, Vlack, Flack, and Vlax.\n\n== Romanians outside Romania ==\n{{Main|Romanian diaspora}}\n\n[[File:2015-04-08 09.26.08 pm.png|thumb|right|350px|Charts depicting share of Romanians living abroad within other states of the European Union]]\n\nMost Romanians live in [[Romania]], where they constitute a majority; Romanians also constitute a minority in the countries that neighbour Romania. Romanians can also be found in many countries, notably in the other EU countries, particularly in [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]; in [[North America]] in the  [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; in [[Israel]]; as well as in [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], and [[New Zealand]] among many other countries. Italy and Spain have been popular emigration destinations, due to a relatively low [[language barrier]], and both are each now home to about a million Romanians. With respect to geopolitical identity, many individuals of Romanian ethnicity in Moldova prefer to identify themselves as [[Moldovans]].<ref name=\"davidlevinson\"/><ref name=\"coutryst\"/>\n\nThe contemporary total population of ethnic Romanians cannot be stated with any degree of certainty. A disparity can be observed between official sources (such as [[census]] counts) where they exist, and estimates which come from non-official sources and interested groups. Several inhibiting factors (not unique to this particular case) contribute towards this uncertainty, which may include:\n\n*A degree of overlap may exist or be shared between Romanian and other ethnic identities in certain situations, and census or survey respondents may elect to identify with one particular ancestry but not another, or instead identify with multiple ancestries;<ref name=\"refcitizenship\">In an ever more globalized world the incredibly diverse and widespread phenomenon of migration has played a significant role in the ways in which notions such as \"home,\" \"membership\" or \"national belonging\" have constantly been disputed and negotiated in both sending and receiving societies. \u2013 ''Rogers Brubaker, Citizenship and Nationhood '' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1994).</ref>\n*Counts and estimates may inconsistently distinguish between Romanian nationality and Romanian ethnicity (i.e. not all Romanian nationals identify with Romanian ethnicity, and vice versa);<ref name=\"refcitizenship\"/>\n*The measurements and methodologies employed by governments to enumerate and describe the ethnicity and ancestry of their citizens vary from country to country. Thus the census definition of \"Romanian\" might variously mean Romanian-born, of Romanian parentage, or also include other ethnic identities as Romanian which otherwise are identified separately in other contexts;<ref name=\"refcitizenship\"/>\n\nFor example, the decennial [[US Census]] of 2000 calculated (based on a [[statistical sampling]] of household data) that there were 367,310 respondents indicating Romanian ancestry (roughly 0.1% of the total population).<ref name=\"USCensus\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-_sse=on|title=2000 U.S. Census, ancestry responses|work=US Census Bureau|accessdate=13 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125030840/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-_sse=on|archivedate=25 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe actual total recorded number of foreign-born Romanians was only 136,000 [http://www.migrationinformation.org/ Migration Information Source] However, some non-specialist organisations have produced estimates which are considerably higher: a 2002 study by the Romanian-American Network Inc. mentions an estimated figure of 1,200,000<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211190118/http://www.ro-am.net/index.php?page=ro-am-communities Romanian Communities Allocation in United States: Study of Romanian-American population (2002)], Romanian-American Network, Inc.

Which makes the United States home to the largest Romanian community outside Romania.\n\nThis estimate notes however that \"...other immigrants of Romanian national minority groups have been included such as: [[Armenians of Romania|Armenians]], [[Germans of Romania|Germans]], [[Romani people in Romania|Gypsies]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]], [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews]], and [[Ukrainians of Romania|Ukrainians]]\". It also includes an unspecified allowance for second- and third-generation Romanians, and an indeterminate number living in Canada. An error range for the estimate is not provided. For the [[United States 2000 Census]] figures, almost 20% of the total population did not classify or report an ancestry, and the census is also subject to undercounting, an incomplete (67%) response rate, and sampling error in general.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of Romania}}\n\n=== Contributions to humanity ===\n{{Main|List of Romanians}}\n\nRomanians have played and contributed a major role in the advancement of the [[arts]], culture, [[sciences]], technology and [[engineering]].\n\nIn the history of aviation, [[Traian Vuia]] and [[Aurel Vlaicu]] built and tested some of the earliest aircraft designs, while [[Henri Coand\u0103]] discovered the [[Coand\u0103 effect]] of fluidics. [[Victor Babe\u0219]] discovered more than 50 germs and a cure for a disease named after him, [[babesiosis]]; biologist [[Nicolae Paulescu]] discovered [[insulin]]. Another biologist, [[Emil Palade]], received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to [[cell biology]]. [[George Constantinescu]] created the [[theory of sonics]], while mathematician [[\u0218tefan Odobleja]] is regarded as the ideological father behind [[cybernetics]] \u2013 his work ''The Consonantist Psychology'' (Paris, 1938) was the main source of inspiration for [[N. Wiener]]'s ''Cybernetics'' (Paris, 1948).

Based on linguistic and archaeological findings, historians suggest that the Romanians' ancestors acquired polytheistic religions in the Roman era, later adopting Christianity, certainly by the 4th century CE when decreed by Emperor Constantine as the official religion of the Roman Empire. Like in all other Romance languages, the basic Romanian words related to Christianity are inherited from Latin, such as ''[[God]]'' (\"[[Dumnezeu]]\" < Domine Deus), ''church'' (\"biseric\u0103\" < basilica), ''[[cross]]'' (\"cruce\" < crux, -cis), ''angel'' (\"\u00eenger\" < angelus), ''saint'' (regional: \"sf\u00e2n(t)\" < sanctus), ''Christmas'' (\"Cr\u0103ciun\" < creatio, -onis), ''[[Christians|Christian]]'' (\"cre\u0219tin\" < christianus), ''Easter'' (\"pa\u0219te\" < paschae), ''sin'' (\"p\u0103cat\" < peccatum), ''to baptise'' (\"a boteza\" < batizare), ''priest'' (\"preot\" < presbiterum), ''to pray'' (\"a ruga\" < rogare), ''faith'' ( \"credin\u021b\u0103\" < credentia ), and so on.\n\nAfter the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]], there existed a Catholic Bishopric of [[Cumania]] (later, separate bishoprics in both [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]). However, this seems to be the exception, rather than the rule, as in both [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] the state religion was Eastern Orthodox. Until the 17th century, the official language of the liturgy was [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Then, it gradually changed to Romanian.\n\nAccording to a survey that took place in 2011, despite 94% of respondents answered positively for believing in God, 42% support the vision of Christian dogma that there is a God incarnated into a human being. While 34% of respondents said that there is only one true religion, 38% believe that there is one true religion and that other religions contain some basic truths, according to 18% there is one true religion and all major world religions contain some fundamental truths. 88% of Romanians believe in the existence of a [[soul]], 87% believe in [[sin]] and the existence of [[heaven]], 60% believe in an \"[[evil eye]]\", 25% believe in [[horoscopes]] and 23% in [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundatia.ro/dumnezeu-nu-%C3%AEnseamn%C4%83-acela%C8%99i-lucru-pentru-toti-rom%C3%A2nii|title=Dumnezeu nu \u00eenseamn\u0103 acela\u0219i lucru pentru to\u021bi rom\u00e2nii|publisher=Soros.ro|language=Romanian|accessdate=10 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713050024/http://www.fundatia.ro/dumnezeu-nu-%C3%AEnseamn%C4%83-acela%C8%99i-lucru-pentru-toti-rom%C3%A2nii|archive-date=13 July 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to a 2004 survey, 80% consider themselves not superstitious and the same amount believe in [[angels]], about 40% believe they have had dreams that became [[deja vu]] and 19% believe in [[ghosts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romania-insider.com/romanians-not-superstitious-but-believe-in-miracles/|title=Romanians, not superstitious, but believe in miracles|date=3 November 2014|website=Romania-insider.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Flag of Romania.svg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Coat of arms of Romania.svg\n| width2 = 95\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = National symbols of Romania: the [[Flag of Romania|flag]] ''(left)'' and the [[Coat of arms of Romania|coat of arms]] ''(right)''.\n}}\n\nIn addition to the colours of the [[History of Romania|Romanian flag]], each historical province of Romania has its own characteristic symbol:\n* [[Banat]]: [[Trajan's Bridge]]\n* [[Dobruja]]: [[Dolphin]]\n* [[Moldavia]] <small>(including [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]])</small>: [[Aurochs]]/[[Wisent]]\n* [[Oltenia]]: [[Lion]]\n* [[Transylvania]]: [[Black eagle]] or [[Turul]]\n* [[Wallachia]]: [[Eagle]]\nThe [[Coat of Arms of Romania]] combines these together.\n\n=== Customs ===\n{{Main|Romanian folklore}}\n\n== Relationship to other ethnic groups ==\nThe closest ethnic groups to the Romanians are the other Romanic peoples of Southeastern Europe: the [[Aromanians]] ([[Macedonia (region)|Macedo]]-Romanians), the [[Megleno-Romanians]], and the [[Istro-Romanians]].

The blue area shows the Dacian lands conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. The orange area was inhabited by Free Dacian tribes and others.]]\n\nInhabited by the ancient [[Dacians]], part of today's territory of [[Romania]] was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]] in 106,<ref>Rita J. Markel, The Fall of the Roman Empire, p. 17, Twenty-First Century Books, 2007</ref> when [[Trajan]]'s army defeated the army of [[Dacia]]'s ruler [[Decebalus]] (''see [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]''). The [[Roman Dacia|Roman administration]] withdrew two centuries later, under the pressure of the [[Goths]] and [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)|Carpi]].\n\nTwo theories account for the origin of the Romanian people. One, known as the Daco-Roman continuity theory, posits that they are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous peoples living in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Province of [[Dacia]], while the other posits that the Romanians are descendants of Romans and Romanized indigenous populations of the former Roman provinces of [[Illyria]], [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]], and [[Macedon]], and the ancestors of Romanians later migrated from these Roman provinces south of the [[Danube]] into the area which they inhabit today.\n\nAccording to the first theory, the Romanians are descended from indigenous populations that inhabited what is now Romania and its immediate environs: [[Thracians]] ([[Dacians]], [[Getae]])  and Roman legionnaires and colonists. In the course of the two wars with the Roman legions, between AD 101\u2013102 and AD 105\u2013106 respectively, the emperor [[Trajan]] succeeded in defeating the Dacians and the greatest part of Dacia became a Roman province.\n\n[[File:Vatra.jpg|upright=1|right|thumb|Map showing the area where [[Latin language]] was spoken in pink during the Roman Empire in the 4\u20137th century.]]\n\nThe colonisation with Roman or Romanized elements, the use of the [[Latin]] language and the assimilation of Roman civilisation as well as the intense development of urban centres led to the Romanization of part of the autochthonous population in Dacia. This process was probably concluded by the 10th century when the assimilation of the [[Slavs]] by the Daco-Romanians was completed.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2009, O.Ed. \"The ethnogenesis of the Romanian people was probably completed by the 10th century. The first stage, the Romanization of the Geto-Dacians, had now been followed by the second, the assimilation of the Slavs by the Daco-Romans\".</ref>\n\nAccording to the south-of-the-Danube origin theory, the Romanians' ancestors, a combination of Romans and Romanized peoples of Illyria, Moesia and Thrace, moved northward across the Danube river into modern-day Romania. Small population groups speaking several versions of Romanian (Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian, and Aromanian) still exist south of the Danube in Greece, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Serbia, but it is not known whether they themselves migrated from more northern parts of the Balkans, including Dacia. The south-of-the Danube theory usually favours northern [[Albania]] and/or [[Moesia]] (modern day Serbia and Northern Bulgaria) as the more specific places of Romanian [[ethnogenesis]].\n\nSmall genetic differences were reportedly<ref name = \"Varzari2006\">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1007/s10038-007-0113-x|pmid= 17387576|title= Population history of the Dniester\u2013Carpathians: Evidence from Alu markers|journal= Journal of Human Genetics|volume= 52|issue= 4|pages= 308\u201316|year= 2007|last1= Varzari|first1= Alexander|last2= Stephan|first2= Wolfgang|last3= Stepanov|first3= Vadim|last4= Raicu|first4= Florina|last5= Cojocaru|first5= Radu|last6= Roschin|first6= Yuri|last7= Glavce|first7= Cristiana|last8= Dergachev|first8= Valentin|last9= Spiridonova|first9= Maria|last10= Schmidt|first10= Horst D.|last11= Weiss|first11= Elisabeth}}</ref> found among [[Southeastern Europe]]an (Greece, Albania) populations and especially those of the [[Dniester]]\u2013[[Carpathian]] (Romania, Moldova, Ukraine) region.

The genetic affinities among Dniester\u2013Carpathian and southeastern European populations do not reflect their linguistic relationships.

However, Moldavia and Wallachia (extending to Dobruja and Bulgaria) were not entirely subdued by the Ottomans as both principalities became autonomous (which was not the case of other Ottoman territorial possessions in Europe). Transylvania, a third region inhabited by an important majority of Romanian speakers, was a vassal state of the Ottomans until 1687, when the principality became part of the Habsburg possessions. The three principalities were united for several months in 1600 under the authority of Wallachian [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Michael the Brave]].<ref name=Stoica1>{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=18|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/18/}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Transhumance ways of the Vlachs.jpeg|thumb|right|Map depicting Romanian and Vlach [[transhumance]] in Eastern and Southeastern Europe.]]\n\nAdditionally, in medieval times there were other lands known by the name 'Vlach' (such as [[Great Vlachia]], situated between [[Thessaly]] and the western [[Pindus]] mountains, originally within the [[Byzantine Empire]], but after the 13th century autonomous or semi-independent; [[White Wallachia]], a Byzantine denomination for the region between the Danube River and the Balkans; [[Moravian Wallachia]], a region in south-eastern Czech Republic).\n\nUp until 1541, Transylvania was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], later (due to the conquest of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire) was a self-governed Principality governed by the Hungarian nobility. In 1699 it became a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg lands]]. By the 19th century, the [[Austrian Empire]] was awarded by the Ottomans with the region of [[Bukovina]] and, in 1812, the Russians occupied the eastern half of Moldavia, known as [[Bessarabia]].\n\n=== Late Modern Age to Contemporary Era ===\n[[File:RomaniaBorderHistoryAnnimation 1859-2010.gif|thumb|right|Animated history of Romania's borders (mid 19th century\u2013present).]]\n[[File:Romania 1859-1878.png|thumb|right|Map depicting the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia between 1859\u20131878.]]\n\nIn the context of the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848]] [[Romantic nationalism|Romanticist]] and [[national liberalism|liberal]] revolutions across Europe, the events that took place in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711\u20131867)|Grand Principality of Transylvania]] were the first of their kind to unfold in the Romanian-speaking territories. On the one hand, the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and the Transylvanian Romanians (with consistent support on behalf of the [[Austrian Empire]]) successfully managed to oppose the goals of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], with the two noteworthy historical figures leading the common Romanian-Saxon side at the time being [[Avram Iancu]] and [[Stephan Ludwig Roth]].\n\nOn the other hand, the Wallachian revolutions of [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|1821]] and [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848]] as well as the [[Moldavian Revolution of 1848]], which aimed for independence from Ottoman and Russian foreign rulership, represented important impacts in the process of spreading the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal ideology]] in the eastern and southern Romanian lands, in spite of the fact that all three eventually failed. Nonetheless, in 1859, [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] elected the same ruler, namely [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza|Alexander John Cuza]] (who reigned as ''[[Domnitor]]'') and were thus unified ''de facto'', resulting in the [[United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia|United Romanian Principalities]] for the period between 1859 and 1881.\n\nDuring the 1870s, the United Romanian Principalities (then led by [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] Domnitor [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]]) fought a [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|War of Independence]] against the Ottomans, with Romania's independence being formally recognised in 1878 at the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. Although the newly founded [[Kingdom of Romania]] initially allied with [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Romania]] refused to enter [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]], because it was obliged to wage war only if Austria-Hungary was attacked. In 1916, Romania joined the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]].\n\nAs a result, at the end of the war, Transylvania, Bessarabia, and Bukovina were awarded to Romania, through a series of international peace treaties, resulting in an enlarged and far more powerful kingdom under King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]]. As of 1920, the Romanian people was believed to number over 15 million solely in the region of the Romanian kingdom, a figure larger than the populations of [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], and the [[Netherlands]] combined.<ref name=Stoica2>{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=50|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/50/}}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar period, two additional monarchs came to the Romanian throne, namely [[King Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] and [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]]. This short-lived period was marked, at times, by political instabilities and efforts of maintaining a [[constitutional monarchy]] in favour of other, totalitarian regimes such as an [[absolute monarchy]] or a [[military dictatorship]].\n\n[[Romania during World War II|During World War II]], the Kingdom of Romania lost territory both to the east and west, as [[Northern Transylvania]] became part of [[Hungary]] through the [[Second Vienna Award]], while Bessarabia and northern Bukovina were taken by the Soviets and included in the [[Moldavian SSR]], respectively [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The eastern territory losses were facilitated by the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact]].\n\nAfter the end of the war, the Romanian Kingdom managed to regain territories lost westward but was nonetheless not given Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, the aforementioned regions being forcefully incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. Subsequently, the Soviet Union imposed a Communist government and [[King of Romania|King]] [[Michael of Romania|Michael]] was forced to abdicate and leave for exile. [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] became the head of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] in 1965 and his draconian rule of the 1980s was ended by the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].\n\nThe 1989 revolution brought to power the dissident communist [[Ion Iliescu]]. He remained in power as head of state until 1996, when he was defeated by [[Romanian Democratic Convention|CDR]]-supported [[Emil Constantinescu]] at the [[1996 Romanian general election|1996 general elections]], the first in post-Communist Romania that saw a peaceful transition of power. Following Constantinescu's only term as president from 1996 to 2000, Iliescu was re-elected in late 2000 for another term of four years. In 2004, [[Traian B\u0103sescu]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]-[[Democratic Party (Romania)|PD]] candidate, was elected president. Five years later, B\u0103sescu was narrowly re-elected for a second term at the [[2009 Romanian presidential election|2009 presidential elections]].\n\nIn 2014, the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|PNL]]-[[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|PDL]] candidate [[Klaus Iohannis|Klaus Johannis]] won a surprise victory over former prime minister and [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|PSD]]-supported contender [[Victor Ponta]] in the second round of the [[2014 Romanian presidential election|2014 presidential elections]]. Thus, Johannis became the first Romanian president stemming from an ethnic minority (as he belongs to the [[Germans of Romania|Romanian-German community]], being a [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]]). In 2019, the PNL-supported Johannis was re-elected to a second term as president at the [[2019 Romanian presidential election]].\n\nIn the meantime, Romania's major foreign policy achievements were the alignment with [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States of America|United States]] by joining the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] in 2004 and the [[European Union]] three years later, in 2007.\n\n==Genetics==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=March 2020}}\n{{Technical|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Haplogroups europe.png|thumb|Frequencies of Y Haplogroups in Europe]]\n\nThe prevailing element in [[Wallachia]] ([[Ploie\u0219ti]], [[Dolj County|Dolj]]), [[Moldavia]] ([[Piatra Neam\u021b]], [[Buhu\u0219i]]), [[Dobruja]] ([[Constan\u021ba]]), and northern Republic of Moldova is recorded to be [[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup I]],<ref>Bosch2006, Varzari2006, Varzari 2013, Martinez-Cruz 2012</ref> while the gene pool of [[Transylvania]] is often untypical and diverse.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez-Cruz B, Ioana M, Calafell F, Arauna LR, Sanz P, Ionescu R, Boengiu S, Kalaydjieva L, Pamjav H, Makukh H, Plantinga T, van der Meer JW, Comas D, Netea MG | title = Y-chromosome analysis in individuals bearing the Basarab name of the first dynasty of Wallachian kings | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = e41803 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22848614 | pmc = 3404992 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0041803 | editor1-last = Kivisild | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...741803M | editor1-first = Toomas }}</ref>{{clarify|date=March 2020}}\n\nOn the basis of 361 samples, Haplogroup I occurs at 32% in Romanians.<ref>Rootsi, Siiri (2004).

The basic vocabulary is of Latin origin,<ref name=Stoica2/> although there are some [[substratum]] words that are sometimes assumed to be of [[Dacian language|Dacian]] origin.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Romanian was isolated from the other Romance languages, and borrowed words from the nearby [[Slavic languages]] (see [[Slavic influence on Romanian]]). Later on, it borrowed a number of words from [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].<ref>Dr. Ayfer AKTA\u015e, T\u00fcrk Dili, TDK, 9/2007, s. 484\u2013495, Online: [http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/YENI%20TURK%20DILI/ayfer_aktas_gunumuz_rumence_turkce_kaynakli_sozler.pdf turkoloji.cu.edu.tr]</ref> During the modern era, most neologisms were borrowed from [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], though the language has increasingly begun to adopt [[English language|English]] borrowings.\n\nThe [[Moldovan language]], in its official form, is practically identical to Romanian, although there are some differences in colloquial speech. In the de facto independent (but internationally unrecognised) region of [[Transnistria]], the official script used to write Moldovan is Cyrillic.\n\nAs of 2017, an [[Ethnologue]] estimation puts the (worldwide) number of Romanian speakers at approximately 24.15 million.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ron Romanian language] on [[Ethnologue]].</ref> The 24.15 million, however, represent only speakers of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], not all of whom are necessarily ethnic Romanians. Also, this number does not include ethnic-Romanians who no longer speak the Romanian language.\n\n=== Surnames ===\nMany Romanian [[surname]]s have the suffix ''-escu'' or (less commonly) ''-a\u0219cu'' or ''-\u0103scu'' which corresponds to the Latin suffix ''-iscus'' and means \"belonging to the people\". For example, ''Petrescu'' used to be ''Petre's kin''.  Similar suffixes such as ''-asco'', ''-asgo'', ''-esque'', ''-ez'', etc. are present in other Latin-derived languages. Many Romanians in France changed this ending of their surnames to ''-esco'', because the way it is pronounced in French better approximates the Romanian pronunciation of ''-escu''.\n\nAnother widespread suffix of Romanian surnames is ''-eanu'' (or ''-an'', ''-anu''), which indicates the geographical origin. Here some examples: Moldoveanu/Moldovan/Moldovanu, from the region of [[Moldavia]] or from [[Moldova River|river Moldova]], Munteanu \"from mountains\", Jianu \"from Jiu river region\", Prut''eanu'', meaning from the [[Prut]] river, Mure\u0219''anu'', meaning from the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] river, Petr''eanu'' (meaning the son of Petre) etc..\n\nOther suffixes are ''-aru'' (or ''-oru'', ''-ar'', ''-or''), which indicates an occupation (like Feraru \"smith\", Morar \"miller\"), and ''-ei'', usually preceded by ''A-'' in front of a female name, which is a Latin inherited female genitive, like in '' Amariei'' ''\"of Maria\"'', ''Aelenei'' ''\"of Elena\"''. These matrilineal-rooted surnames are common in the historical region of Moldavia.\n\n*The most common surnames are ''Pop'' / ''Popa'' (\"the priest\")\u2014almost 200,000 Romanians have this surname<ref name=name-freq>{{cite news |url=http://www.ziua.ro/news.php?data=2007-12-05&id=1946 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106020531/http://www.ziua.ro/news.php?data=2007-12-05&id=1946 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2017-01-06 |title=Romanii au nume \"trasnite\" |date=December 2007|newspaper=Ziua|accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref>\n*\u2014''Popescu'' (\"son of the priest\") \u2014almost 150,000 have this name<ref name=name-freq/>\n*\u2014 and ''Ionescu'' (\"John's (Ion's) son\").\n\n== Names for Romanians ==\nIn English, Romanians are usually called Romanians, Rumanians, or Roumanians except in some historical texts, where they are called Roumans or [[Vlachs]].\n\n=== Etymology of the name Romanian (rom\u00e2n) ===\n{{Main|Name of Romania}}\n[[File:Tricolore1848.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Romanian revolutionaries of 1848 waving the tricolor flag]]\n\nFrom the Middle Ages, Romanians bore two names, the [[exonym]] (one given to them by foreigners) ''Wallachians'' or ''Vlachs'', under its various forms (vlah, valah, valach, voloh, blac, ol\u0103h, vlas, ilac, ulah, etc.), and the [[endonym]] (the name they used for themselves) ''Romanians'' (Rum\u00e2ni/Rom\u00e2ni).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/48209/1/Pop%2bIoan%2bAurel-Despre%2bsemnificatia%2bunor%2bnume-2009.pdf|title=On the Significance of Certain Names: Romanian/Wallachian and Romania/Wallachia|author=Pop, Ioan-Aurel|accessdate=18 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe name \"Romanian\" is derived from Latin \"''Romanus''\". Under regular phonetical changes that are typical to the Romanian languages, the name ''romanus'' over the centuries transformed into \"rum\u00e2n\" {{IPA-ro|ru\u02c8m\u0268n|}}. An older form of \"rom\u00e2n\" was still in use in some regions. Socio-linguistic evolutions in the late 18th century led to a gradual preponderance of the \"rom\u00e2n\" spelling form, which was then generalised during the [[National awakening of Romania]] of early 19th century.\n\nUntil the 19th century, the term Romanian denoted the speakers of the Daco-Romanian dialect of the Romanian language, thus being a much more distinct concept than that of Romania, the country of the Romanians. Prior to 1867, the (Daco-)Romanians were part of different state entities: with the Moldavians and the Wallachians being split off and having shaped separate political identities, possessing states of their own, while the rest of the Romanians were part of other states. However, eventually they retained their Romanian cultural and ethnic identity up today.\n\n==== Daco-Romanian ====\nTo distinguish Romanians from the other Romanic peoples of the Balkans (Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians), the term [[Daco-Romanian]] is sometimes used to refer to those who speak the standard [[Romanian language]] and live in the territory of ancient [[Dacia]] (today comprising mostly Romania and Moldova), although some Daco-Romanians can be found in [[Vlachs of Serbia|the eastern part of Central Serbia]] (which was part of ancient [[Moesia]]).\n\n=== Etymology of the term Vlach ===\n{{Main|Vlachs}}\n\nThe name of \"[[Vlachs]]\" is an [[exonym]] that was used by Slavs to refer to all Romanized natives of the Balkans. It holds its origin from ancient Germanic\u2014being a cognate to \"Welsh\" and \"Walloon\"\u2014and perhaps even further back in time, from the [[Latin|Roman]] name Volcae, which was originally a [[Celt]]ic tribe. From the Slavs, it was passed on to other peoples, such as the [[Hungarians]] (''Ol\u00e1h'') and [[Greeks]] (''Vlachoi'') (see the Etymology section of [[Vlachs]]). [[Wallachia]], the Southern region of Romania, takes its name from the same source.\n\nNowadays, the term Vlach is more often used to refer to the Romanized populations of the Balkans who speak [[Romanian language|Daco-Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]].\n\n=== Anthroponyms ===\nThese are family names that have been derived from either ''Vlach'' or ''Romanian''. Most of these names have been given when a Romanian settled in a non-Romanian region. Examples: Ol\u00e1h (37,147 Hungarians have this name), Vlach, Vlahuta, Vlasa, Vlasi, Vla\u0161ic, Vlasceanu, Vlachopoulos, Voloh, Volyh, Vlack, Flack, and Vlax.\n\n== Romanians outside Romania ==\n{{Main|Romanian diaspora}}\n\n[[File:2015-04-08 09.26.08 pm.png|thumb|right|350px|Charts depicting share of Romanians living abroad within other states of the European Union]]\n\nMost Romanians live in [[Romania]], where they constitute a majority; Romanians also constitute a minority in the countries that neighbour Romania. Romanians can also be found in many countries, notably in the other EU countries, particularly in [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]; in [[North America]] in the  [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; in [[Israel]]; as well as in [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], and [[New Zealand]] among many other countries. Italy and Spain have been popular emigration destinations, due to a relatively low [[language barrier]], and both are each now home to about a million Romanians. With respect to geopolitical identity, many individuals of Romanian ethnicity in Moldova prefer to identify themselves as [[Moldovans]].<ref name=\"davidlevinson\"/><ref name=\"coutryst\"/>\n\nThe contemporary total population of ethnic Romanians cannot be stated with any degree of certainty. A disparity can be observed between official sources (such as [[census]] counts) where they exist, and estimates which come from non-official sources and interested groups. Several inhibiting factors (not unique to this particular case) contribute towards this uncertainty, which may include:\n\n*A degree of overlap may exist or be shared between Romanian and other ethnic identities in certain situations, and census or survey respondents may elect to identify with one particular ancestry but not another, or instead identify with multiple ancestries;<ref name=\"refcitizenship\">In an ever more globalized world the incredibly diverse and widespread phenomenon of migration has played a significant role in the ways in which notions such as \"home,\" \"membership\" or \"national belonging\" have constantly been disputed and negotiated in both sending and receiving societies. \u2013 ''Rogers Brubaker, Citizenship and Nationhood '' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1994).</ref>\n*Counts and estimates may inconsistently distinguish between Romanian nationality and Romanian ethnicity (i.e. not all Romanian nationals identify with Romanian ethnicity, and vice versa);<ref name=\"refcitizenship\"/>\n*The measurements and methodologies employed by governments to enumerate and describe the ethnicity and ancestry of their citizens vary from country to country. Thus the census definition of \"Romanian\" might variously mean Romanian-born, of Romanian parentage, or also include other ethnic identities as Romanian which otherwise are identified separately in other contexts;<ref name=\"refcitizenship\"/>\n\nFor example, the decennial [[US Census]] of 2000 calculated (based on a [[statistical sampling]] of household data) that there were 367,310 respondents indicating Romanian ancestry (roughly 0.1% of the total population).<ref name=\"USCensus\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-_sse=on|title=2000 U.S. Census, ancestry responses|work=US Census Bureau|accessdate=13 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125030840/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-_sse=on|archivedate=25 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe actual total recorded number of foreign-born Romanians was only 136,000 [http://www.migrationinformation.org/ Migration Information Source] However, some non-specialist organisations have produced estimates which are considerably higher: a 2002 study by the Romanian-American Network Inc. mentions an estimated figure of 1,200,000<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211190118/http://www.ro-am.net/index.php?page=ro-am-communities Romanian Communities Allocation in United States: Study of Romanian-American population (2002)], Romanian-American Network, Inc.

Which makes the United States home to the largest Romanian community outside Romania.\n\nThis estimate notes however that \"...other immigrants of Romanian national minority groups have been included such as: [[Armenians of Romania|Armenians]], [[Germans of Romania|Germans]], [[Romani people in Romania|Gypsies]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]], [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews]], and [[Ukrainians of Romania|Ukrainians]]\". It also includes an unspecified allowance for second- and third-generation Romanians, and an indeterminate number living in Canada. An error range for the estimate is not provided. For the [[United States 2000 Census]] figures, almost 20% of the total population did not classify or report an ancestry, and the census is also subject to undercounting, an incomplete (67%) response rate, and sampling error in general.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of Romania}}\n\n=== Contributions to humanity ===\n{{Main|List of Romanians}}\n\nRomanians have played and contributed a major role in the advancement of the [[arts]], culture, [[sciences]], technology and [[engineering]].\n\nIn the history of aviation, [[Traian Vuia]] and [[Aurel Vlaicu]] built and tested some of the earliest aircraft designs, while [[Henri Coand\u0103]] discovered the [[Coand\u0103 effect]] of fluidics.

[[George Constantinescu]] created the [[theory of sonics]], while mathematician [[\u0218tefan Odobleja]] is regarded as the ideological father behind [[cybernetics]] \u2013 his work ''The Consonantist Psychology'' (Paris, 1938) was the main source of inspiration for [[N.

Based on linguistic and archaeological findings, historians suggest that the Romanians' ancestors acquired polytheistic religions in the Roman era, later adopting Christianity, certainly by the 4th century CE when decreed by Emperor Constantine as the official religion of the Roman Empire. Like in all other Romance languages, the basic Romanian words related to Christianity are inherited from Latin, such as ''[[God]]'' (\"[[Dumnezeu]]\" < Domine Deus), ''church'' (\"biseric\u0103\" < basilica), ''[[cross]]'' (\"cruce\" < crux, -cis), ''angel'' (\"\u00eenger\" < angelus), ''saint'' (regional: \"sf\u00e2n(t)\" < sanctus), ''Christmas'' (\"Cr\u0103ciun\" < creatio, -onis), ''[[Christians|Christian]]'' (\"cre\u0219tin\" < christianus), ''Easter'' (\"pa\u0219te\" < paschae), ''sin'' (\"p\u0103cat\" < peccatum), ''to baptise'' (\"a boteza\" < batizare), ''priest'' (\"preot\" < presbiterum), ''to pray'' (\"a ruga\" < rogare), ''faith'' ( \"credin\u021b\u0103\" < credentia ), and so on.\n\nAfter the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]], there existed a Catholic Bishopric of [[Cumania]] (later, separate bishoprics in both [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]). However, this seems to be the exception, rather than the rule, as in both [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] the state religion was Eastern Orthodox. Until the 17th century, the official language of the liturgy was [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Then, it gradually changed to Romanian.\n\nAccording to a survey that took place in 2011, despite 94% of respondents answered positively for believing in God, 42% support the vision of Christian dogma that there is a God incarnated into a human being.

The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]] Will Ferrell.\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]] was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, followed by an hour-long series retrospective.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|title='The Office' finale draws season high of 5.7 million viewers|date=May 17, 2013|work=Reuters|access-date=February 17, 2019|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217201113/https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|archive-date=February 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Crew ===\n\n<div class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:40em; font-size:85%; padding-left:5px; width:360px;\">\n'''List of showrunners throughout the series' run:'''\n\n* Season 1\u20134: [[Greg Daniels]]\n* Season 5\u20136: [[Paul Lieberstein]] & [[Jennifer Celotta]]\n* Season 7\u20138: Paul Lieberstein\n* Season 9: Greg Daniels\n\n</div>\n[[Greg Daniels]] served as the senior series [[showrunner]] for the first four seasons of the series and developed [[The Office (British TV series)|the British ''Office'' series]] for American television.

It was co-produced by Daniels' [[Deedle-Dee Productions]], and [[Reveille Productions]] (later [[Endemol Shine North America|Shine America]]), in association with [[Universal Television]]. The original [[Executive producer|executive producers]] were Daniels, [[Howard Klein (television producer)|Howard Klein]], [[Ben Silverman]], [[Ricky Gervais]], and [[Stephen Merchant]], with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.\n\nTo [[Mockumentary|simulate the look of an actual documentary]] it was filmed in a [[single-camera setup]] without a [[studio audience]] or a [[laugh track]]. The series debuted on NBC as a [[mid-season replacement]] and aired [[List of The Office (American TV series) episodes|201 episodes]] over the course of its run. ''The Office'' originally featured [[Steve Carell]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Jenna Fischer]], and [[B. J.

Notable stars outside the original main cast include [[Ed Helms]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[James Spader]], and [[Ellie Kemper]].\n\n''The Office'' was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, especially those featuring Carell, received considerable acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006, two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Carell's [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|performance]], and four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], including one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor; however, the final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response. The [[Finale (The Office)|series finale]] was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, followed by an hour-long series retrospective.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|title='The Office' finale draws season high of 5.7 million viewers|date=May 17, 2013|work=Reuters|access-date=February 17, 2019|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217201113/https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-theoffice-ratings-idUSBRE94G0UJ20130517|archive-date=February 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Crew ===\n\n<div class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:40em; font-size:85%; padding-left:5px; width:360px;\">\n'''List of showrunners throughout the series' run:'''\n\n* Season 1\u20134: [[Greg Daniels]]\n* Season 5\u20136: [[Paul Lieberstein]] & [[Jennifer Celotta]]\n* Season 7\u20138: Paul Lieberstein\n* Season 9: Greg Daniels\n\n</div>\n[[Greg Daniels]] served as the senior series [[showrunner]] for the first four seasons of the series and developed [[The Office (British TV series)|the British ''Office'' series]] for American television.
