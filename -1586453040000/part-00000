Cambridge led the longstanding rivalry 84\u201380 and 44\u201330 in the men's and women's races, respectively.  The races were cancelled on 16 March 2020 as a result of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom]].

In spite of the threat of disruption from [[Storm Dennis]], the weather was mild.  The umpire for the races was Richard Phelps, who issued several warnings to Cambridge during the first piece, where there was little to choose between the crews. By the town buoy, Cambridge held a quarter-length lead which they extended to three-quarters by [[Craven Cottage]], and were two lengths clear by the end of the race.  The second piece commenced with a rolling start at [[Harrods Furniture Depository]].  Once again CUWBC were warned several times by the umpire but despite the bend in the river being in Nereus' favour, they only commanded a brief lead, before Cambridge drew back to lead by half a length at [[Chiswick Eyot]], the finish for the second piece.  The third race was abandoned due to injury in the Nereus crew.<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.theboatrace.org/cuwbc-news/cuwbc-vs-nereus-fixture-report| title = CUWBC vs Nereus fixture report| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 27 February 2020| date = 17 February 2020| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200227150233/https://www.theboatrace.org/cuwbc-news/cuwbc-vs-nereus-fixture-report| archive-date = 27 February 2020| url-status = live}}</ref>  Cambridge's women were in action again the following week, this time a two-piece race in rough conditions against [[Oxford Brookes University Boat Club]] (OBUBC), umpired by Judith Packer.  The first piece was from the finishing line to Chiswick Steps and saw OBUBC take a one-length lead early on, which they extended to a clear water advantage by [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]].  They pressed on to record a four-length victory over Cambridge in the first piece.  The formula was repeated in the second race, with Brookes taking an early lead and extending it throughout to win by five lengths.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theboatrace.org/cuwbc-news/cuwbc-vs-brookes-report | title = CUWBC vs Brookes report | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 27 February 2020 | date = 25 February 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200225175808/https://www.theboatrace.org/cuwbc-news/cuwbc-vs-brookes-report | archive-date = 25 February 2020 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nOn 8 March, OUWBC faced Nereus in three pieces in rainy conditions, umpired by Claire Briegal.  The first section, from Chiswick Steps to Hammersmith Bridge, saw Nereus take an early lead, but following a [[oar (sport rowing)|blade]] clash, Oxford took the lead to win by a length.  In the second race, from Chiswick Steps to the Mile Post, Nereus once again made the early running  but as Oxford took advantage of the bend in the river, they held a quarter-length lead over their Dutch opponents before pushing away from them to win by clear water.  The third piece was raced from Hammersmith Bridge to Putney, and commenced with a rolling start.  Nereus held an early lead though Oxford fought back to reduce the deficit to just a [[canvas (rowing)|canvas]] by the end of the race.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theboatrace.org/news/ouwbc-vs-nereus-fixture-report | title = OUWBC vs Nereus fixture report| accessdate = 9 March 2020 | date = 8 March 2020 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}</ref>  A week later, OUWBC faced a crew from the [[University of London Boat Club]] (ULBC) in a single piece along the Championship Course.  To avoid extraneous contact between the crews in light of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], the umpire Judith Packer held a \"virtual\" coin toss and briefing before the race commenced with ULBC taking the Surrey side of the river.  OUWBC were half a length ahead by the Town Buoy and extended that to a length by Craven Cottage.  As the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge, OUWBC were a length of clear water ahead but some off-course steering gave ULBC an advantage and saw Oxford's lead cut.  OWUBC passed the finishing line at Chiswick Steps with just under a half-length lead.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theboatrace.org/news/ouwbc-vs-ul-fixture-report | title = OUWBC vs UL fixture report | accessdate = 21 March 2020 | date = 16 March 2020 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}</ref>\n\n===Men===\nOUBC commenced their buildup with a race in two pieces against OBUBC on 23 February 2020.  As a result of high winds, the races were limited to a subsection of the Championship Course and were umpired by Sarah Winckless.  OUBC took a three-quarter length lead by the Town Buoy over OBUBC who had hit rough water.  Brookes reduced the deficit to a quarter of a length by Barn Elms, maintained to the Mile Post.  At Harrods the crews were level and a push just before Hammersmith Bridg saw OUBC take a small lead which they extended until passing the finish line at St Paul's, more than a length ahead, the first defeat for OBUBC in British waters for three years.  The second piece started at the [[London Rowing Club]] with Oxford Brookes a canvas ahead by the Town Buoy.  Aggressive steering from OUBC and a mistake from OBUBC led to the crews becoming level.  A wave partially filled the OUBC boat allowing Brookes to take advantage and pull away to win the second piece by two lengths.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theboatrace.org/homepage-news/oubc-vs-brookes-fixture-report | title = OUBC vs Brookes fixture report | accessdate = 27 February 2020 | date = 23 February 2020 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200225175804/https://www.theboatrace.org/homepage-news/oubc-vs-brookes-fixture-report | archive-date = 25 February 2020 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nCUBC's first outing in the buildup to the main race was a two-piece fixture against OBUBC on 1 March, umpired by Winckless.  The first race started from the University Stone and early on both crews were warned following a series of blade clashes.  Brookes held a one-third length lead by the Town Buoy but Cambridge pulled back onto level terms by Craven Cottage.  A further blade clash before the Mile Post saw OBUBC take a half-length lead which they extended to two lengths by the time they finished the first piece at Chiswick Steps.  The second race was held on the same stretch of the Thames, in reverse, and aggressive steering from OBUBC saw them holding a half-length on the approach to Barnes Bridge before CUBC restored parity under the bridge.  OBUBC reduced the CUBC lead to a canvas by Dukes Meadow and made a final push to take a quarter-length victory over the Light Blues.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theboatrace.org/news/cubc-vs-brookes-report | title = CUBC vs Brookes report| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | date = 2 March 2020 | accessdate = 9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cancellation==\nOn 16 March 2020, it was announced that the event was cancelled as a result of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2020-03-16/the-boat-race-has-been-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus/ | publisher = ITV | title = The Boat Race has been cancelled due to Coronavirus | date = 16 March 2020 | accessdate = 16 March 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200317184823/https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2020-03-16/the-boat-race-has-been-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus/ | archive-date = 17 March 2020 | url-status = live }}</ref>  Other than as a result of war, it was the first time the men's race has been cancelled since it has taken place annually from [[The Boat Race 1845|1845]].

In spite of the threat of disruption from [[Storm Dennis]], the weather was mild.  The umpire for the races was Richard Phelps, who issued several warnings to Cambridge during the first piece, where there was little to choose between the crews. By the town buoy, Cambridge held a quarter-length lead which they extended to three-quarters by [[Craven Cottage]], and were two lengths clear by the end of the race.  The second piece commenced with a rolling start at [[Harrods Furniture Depository]].  Once again CUWBC were warned several times by the umpire but despite the bend in the river being in Nereus' favour, they only commanded a brief lead, before Cambridge drew back to lead by half a length at [[Chiswick Eyot]], the finish for the second piece.  The third race was abandoned due to injury in the Nereus crew.<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.theboatrace.org/cuwbc-news/cuwbc-vs-nereus-fixture-report| title = CUWBC vs Nereus fixture report| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 27 February 2020| date = 17 February 2020| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200227150233/https://www.theboatrace.org/cuwbc-news/cuwbc-vs-nereus-fixture-report| archive-date = 27 February 2020| url-status = live}}</ref>  Cambridge's women were in action again the following week, this time a two-piece race in rough conditions against [[Oxford Brookes University Boat Club]] (OBUBC), umpired by Judith Packer.  The first piece was from the finishing line to Chiswick Steps and saw OBUBC take a one-length lead early on, which they extended to a clear water advantage by [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]].  They pressed on to record a four-length victory over Cambridge in the first piece.

The first section, from Chiswick Steps to Hammersmith Bridge, saw Nereus take an early lead, but following a [[oar (sport rowing)|blade]] clash, Oxford took the lead to win by a length.  In the second race, from Chiswick Steps to the Mile Post, Nereus once again made the early running  but as Oxford took advantage of the bend in the river, they held a quarter-length lead over their Dutch opponents before pushing away from them to win by clear water.  The third piece was raced from Hammersmith Bridge to Putney, and commenced with a rolling start.

To avoid extraneous contact between the crews in light of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], the umpire Judith Packer held a \"virtual\" coin toss and briefing before the race commenced with ULBC taking the Surrey side of the river.  OUWBC were half a length ahead by the Town Buoy and extended that to a length by Craven Cottage.  As the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge, OUWBC were a length of clear water ahead but some off-course steering gave ULBC an advantage and saw Oxford's lead cut.  OWUBC passed the finishing line at Chiswick Steps with just under a half-length lead.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theboatrace.org/news/ouwbc-vs-ul-fixture-report | title = OUWBC vs UL fixture report | accessdate = 21 March 2020 | date = 16 March 2020 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}</ref>\n\n===Men===\nOUBC commenced their buildup with a race in two pieces against OBUBC on 23 February 2020.  As a result of high winds, the races were limited to a subsection of the Championship Course and were umpired by Sarah Winckless.  OUBC took a three-quarter length lead by the Town Buoy over OBUBC who had hit rough water.  Brookes reduced the deficit to a quarter of a length by Barn Elms, maintained to the Mile Post.  At Harrods the crews were level and a push just before Hammersmith Bridg saw OUBC take a small lead which they extended until passing the finish line at St Paul's, more than a length ahead, the first defeat for OBUBC in British waters for three years.  The second piece started at the [[London Rowing Club]] with Oxford Brookes a canvas ahead by the Town Buoy.  Aggressive steering from OUBC and a mistake from OBUBC led to the crews becoming level.  A wave partially filled the OUBC boat allowing Brookes to take advantage and pull away to win the second piece by two lengths.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theboatrace.org/homepage-news/oubc-vs-brookes-fixture-report | title = OUBC vs Brookes fixture report | accessdate = 27 February 2020 | date = 23 February 2020 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200225175804/https://www.theboatrace.org/homepage-news/oubc-vs-brookes-fixture-report | archive-date = 25 February 2020 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nCUBC's first outing in the buildup to the main race was a two-piece fixture against OBUBC on 1 March, umpired by Winckless.  The first race started from the University Stone and early on both crews were warned following a series of blade clashes.  Brookes held a one-third length lead by the Town Buoy but Cambridge pulled back onto level terms by Craven Cottage.  A further blade clash before the Mile Post saw OBUBC take a half-length lead which they extended to two lengths by the time they finished the first piece at Chiswick Steps.  The second race was held on the same stretch of the Thames, in reverse, and aggressive steering from OBUBC saw them holding a half-length on the approach to Barnes Bridge before CUBC restored parity under the bridge.  OBUBC reduced the CUBC lead to a canvas by Dukes Meadow and made a final push to take a quarter-length victory over the Light Blues.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theboatrace.org/news/cubc-vs-brookes-report | title = CUBC vs Brookes report| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | date = 2 March 2020 | accessdate = 9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cancellation==\nOn 16 March 2020, it was announced that the event was cancelled as a result of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2020-03-16/the-boat-race-has-been-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus/ | publisher = ITV | title = The Boat Race has been cancelled due to Coronavirus | date = 16 March 2020 | accessdate = 16 March 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200317184823/https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2020-03-16/the-boat-race-has-been-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus/ | archive-date = 17 March 2020 | url-status = live }}</ref>  Other than as a result of war, it was the first time the men's race has been cancelled since it has taken place annually from [[The Boat Race 1845|1845]].
