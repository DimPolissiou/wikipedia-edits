He mistakenly sets camp in the neighborhood of Bugs' rabbit hole, and Bugs (and a neighboring bear) don't have much leisure in mind. It was the first Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd cartoon directed by [[Bob Clampett|Robert Clampett]], with a story by Dave Monahan and musical direction by [[Carl Stalling]]. [[Sidney Sutherland|Sid Sutherland]] is the only credited animator, although [[Virgil Ross]], [[Rod Scribner]], and [[Robert McKimson]] also animated the short. [[Mel Blanc]] provided the voices for Bugs and the [[bear]], and [[Arthur Q. Bryan]] provided the voice for Elmer.\n\n==Plot==\nElmer, driving his [[Ford Model T]] [[jalopy]] to a [[Conga (music)|Conga]] beat, makes his way to Jellostone National Park (a pun on [[Yellowstone National Park]]) while looking forward to getting some rest. Elmer sets up his campsite by setting a camp fire, an hanging mirror on a tree and, beneath it, a wash basin on a table, hanging a hammock, and pitching his tent. The tent is positioned directly over Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole (just as Elmer had arrived, Bugs had posted a sign next to his hole saying 'Camp Here', then had retreated into the lair, covering it with grass as he went). From down there, Bugs breaks down the tent and drags it inside. Elmer reaches in and, in spite of resistance from below, retrieves the tent which is tied in knots. Bugs pops up, welcomes Elmer to Jellostone (\"a restful retreat. Oh brudda!\") and pulls Elmer's hat over his eyes. Elmer reaches in again and tries to yank Bugs out. After several attempts, Elmer pulls his hands out to find that his fingers are tied together. He nails a board over the hole (\"that'll hold 'em alwhight, heh-heh-heh-heh-heh\"). However, Bugs simply pushes it open, steps out and mimics Elmer. Bugs balloons up to Elmer's size and repeats what Elmer had said, labeling it \"phooey\". Elmer then settles into his hammock and quickly falls fast asleep, muttering to himself.\n\nBugs places a pair of glasses on Elmer's face, paints the lenses black and sets the alarm clock to go off at noon. When it wakes Elmer, he thinks it is nighttime because everything seems dark. He goes to his tent, takes off his day clothes to reveal night clothes underneath, and goes to bed. Bugs then removes the glasses from Elmer and crows like a rooster, awakening Elmer who believes it is the next morning.\n\nElmer washes his face but cannot reach his towel because it is hanging on a branch that Bugs keeps at a steady, short distance from him. Elmer blindly follows the towel (\"I do this kind of stuff to him all through the picture\", Bugs [[Breaking the fourth wall|confides to the audience]]). He causes Elmer to step off a cliff edge. Elmer looks at the miraculous view of the [[Grand Canyon]], but suddenly realizes he is in midair. He runs back to safety and holds on to Bugs for dear life. Bugs then admits he is the one pulling these gags and runs off, with a furious Elmer giving chase after retrieving a gun from his tent. However, he runs into a [[American black bear|black bear]]. The bear starts growling, and so Elmer turns to a wildlife handbook for advice, which directs him to play dead.\n\nThe bear soon gives up (after sniffing Elmer's \"[[Body odor|B.O.]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 his feet), but Bugs climbs onto Elmer and starts growling exactly like the bear. He misbehaves in various ways to keep Elmer on the ground with his eyes shut, but just as he starts biting Elmer's foot, Elmer sees what is going on and grabs his shotgun. The bear returns and Bugs runs away just as Elmer swings the gun, clobbering the bear rather than the rabbit.  A chase ensues with Elmer and the bear running through the trees to the tune of the \"[[William Tell Overture]].\" Finally, the bear freaks Elmer out by riding on top of him.\n\nWhen the bear is knocked off him after hitting a tree branch, Elmer gives up and packs everything into his car (almost including a huge tree). He passes the welcome sign at the gate on his way out, backs up and reads it again. He declares its promise of \"a restful retreat\" to be \"bawogney!\" and, to teach the park not to give false advertisement, he chops the sign to bits with an ax and stomps on the pieces while calling the park's \"peace and wewaxation\" promises \"wubbish!\" A ranger (along with Bugs) appears, and has an angry expression on his face. Elmer is arrested for the destruction of government property, and from his jail cell window he tells us that \"anyway\" he is \"wid of that gwizzwy bear and scwewy wabbit! West and wewaxation at wast!\" Unfortunately, he turns to find out that somehow he is sharing his cell with both Bugs ''and'' the black bear. They both ask how long he has in jail (\"Pardon me but, how long ya in for, doc?\" they ask).\n\n==Production==\nFor the cartoon, Elmer was redesigned as a fat man (based on voice actor [[Arthur Q. Bryan]]'s own physique) in an attempt to make him funnier. The \"fat Elmer\" would only make three more appearances in the ''Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies'' canon&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Wabbit Who Came to Supper]]'', ''[[The Wacky Wabbit]]'' and ''[[Fresh Hare]]'', in addition to a [[cameo appearance]] in the non-canon war bond advertisement ''[[Any Bonds Today?]]''&nbsp;\u2013 before returning to the slimmer form by which he is better known, for ''[[The Hare-Brained Hypnotist]]''. This cartoon was the only time, though, that the Fat Elmer also had a red nose. This is the only cartoon with the \"fat\" version of Elmer to remain under copyright; the other \"fat Elmer\" cartoons are in the public domain.\n\nBugs would show up in a prison two more times: in ''[[Rebel Rabbit]]'' (1949) and ''[[Big House Bunny]]'' (1950). At the ends of ''[[Rabbit Transit (cartoon)|Rabbit Transit]]'' (1947) and ''[[Hare Brush]]'' (1955) he is arrested, but not actually shown in prison therein.\n\nThe lobby card where Bugs paints Elmer's glasses black is also done in the film.\n\n==Availability==\n* DVD - ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'', Volume 1\n* Blu-ray - ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection]]'', Volume 2\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Big Chungus.png|200px|thumb|The still frame from the short that has come to be known as \"Big Chungus\".]]\nIn December 2018, a still from the short depicting Bugs mocking Elmer by imitating his weight became an [[Internet meme]].

Cartoons |date=1989 |publisher=Henry Holt and Co |isbn=0-8050-0894-2 |page=123}}</ref> This is the first of several [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon titles that refers to [[Elmer Fudd]]'s speech impediment, making the names of [[Bob Clampett|Robert Clampett]], [[Sidney Sutherland|Sid Sutherland]], and [[Carl Stalling]] as well as the roles of Story, Supervision, and Musical Direction intentionally misspelled in the credits to receive the perfect match for Elmer's speech impediment.\n\nIn the cartoon, Elmer expects to find rest and relaxation at Jellostone National Park. He mistakenly sets camp in the neighborhood of Bugs' rabbit hole, and Bugs (and a neighboring bear) don't have much leisure in mind. It was the first Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd cartoon directed by [[Bob Clampett|Robert Clampett]], with a story by Dave Monahan and musical direction by [[Carl Stalling]]. [[Sidney Sutherland|Sid Sutherland]] is the only credited animator, although [[Virgil Ross]], [[Rod Scribner]], and [[Robert McKimson]] also animated the short. [[Mel Blanc]] provided the voices for Bugs and the [[bear]], and [[Arthur Q. Bryan]] provided the voice for Elmer.\n\n==Plot==\nElmer, driving his [[Ford Model T]] [[jalopy]] to a [[Conga (music)|Conga]] beat, makes his way to Jellostone National Park (a pun on [[Yellowstone National Park]]) while looking forward to getting some rest. Elmer sets up his campsite by setting a camp fire, an hanging mirror on a tree and, beneath it, a wash basin on a table, hanging a hammock, and pitching his tent. The tent is positioned directly over Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole (just as Elmer had arrived, Bugs had posted a sign next to his hole saying 'Camp Here', then had retreated into the lair, covering it with grass as he went). From down there, Bugs breaks down the tent and drags it inside. Elmer reaches in and, in spite of resistance from below, retrieves the tent which is tied in knots. Bugs pops up, welcomes Elmer to Jellostone (\"a restful retreat. Oh brudda!\") and pulls Elmer's hat over his eyes. Elmer reaches in again and tries to yank Bugs out. After several attempts, Elmer pulls his hands out to find that his fingers are tied together. He nails a board over the hole (\"that'll hold 'em alwhight, heh-heh-heh-heh-heh\"). However, Bugs simply pushes it open, steps out and mimics Elmer. Bugs balloons up to Elmer's size and repeats what Elmer had said, labeling it \"phooey\". Elmer then settles into his hammock and quickly falls fast asleep, muttering to himself.\n\nBugs places a pair of glasses on Elmer's face, paints the lenses black and sets the alarm clock to go off at noon. When it wakes Elmer, he thinks it is nighttime because everything seems dark. He goes to his tent, takes off his day clothes to reveal night clothes underneath, and goes to bed. Bugs then removes the glasses from Elmer and crows like a rooster, awakening Elmer who believes it is the next morning.\n\nElmer washes his face but cannot reach his towel because it is hanging on a branch that Bugs keeps at a steady, short distance from him. Elmer blindly follows the towel (\"I do this kind of stuff to him all through the picture\", Bugs [[Breaking the fourth wall|confides to the audience]]). He causes Elmer to step off a cliff edge. Elmer looks at the miraculous view of the [[Grand Canyon]], but suddenly realizes he is in midair. He runs back to safety and holds on to Bugs for dear life. Bugs then admits he is the one pulling these gags and runs off, with a furious Elmer giving chase after retrieving a gun from his tent. However, he runs into a [[American black bear|black bear]]. The bear starts growling, and so Elmer turns to a wildlife handbook for advice, which directs him to play dead.\n\nThe bear soon gives up (after sniffing Elmer's \"[[Body odor|B.O.]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 his feet), but Bugs climbs onto Elmer and starts growling exactly like the bear. He misbehaves in various ways to keep Elmer on the ground with his eyes shut, but just as he starts biting Elmer's foot, Elmer sees what is going on and grabs his shotgun. The bear returns and Bugs runs away just as Elmer swings the gun, clobbering the bear rather than the rabbit.  A chase ensues with Elmer and the bear running through the trees to the tune of the \"[[William Tell Overture]].\" Finally, the bear freaks Elmer out by riding on top of him.\n\nWhen the bear is knocked off him after hitting a tree branch, Elmer gives up and packs everything into his car (almost including a huge tree). He passes the welcome sign at the gate on his way out, backs up and reads it again. He declares its promise of \"a restful retreat\" to be \"bawogney!\" and, to teach the park not to give false advertisement, he chops the sign to bits with an ax and stomps on the pieces while calling the park's \"peace and wewaxation\" promises \"wubbish!\" A ranger (along with Bugs) appears, and has an angry expression on his face. Elmer is arrested for the destruction of government property, and from his jail cell window he tells us that \"anyway\" he is \"wid of that gwizzwy bear and scwewy wabbit! West and wewaxation at wast!\" Unfortunately, he turns to find out that somehow he is sharing his cell with both Bugs ''and'' the black bear. They both ask how long he has in jail (\"Pardon me but, how long ya in for, doc?\" they ask).\n\n==Production==\nFor the cartoon, Elmer was redesigned as a fat man (based on voice actor [[Arthur Q. Bryan]]'s own physique) in an attempt to make him funnier. The \"fat Elmer\" would only make three more appearances in the ''Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies'' canon&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Wabbit Who Came to Supper]]'', ''[[The Wacky Wabbit]]'' and ''[[Fresh Hare]]'', in addition to a [[cameo appearance]] in the non-canon war bond advertisement ''[[Any Bonds Today?]]''&nbsp;\u2013 before returning to the slimmer form by which he is better known, for ''[[The Hare-Brained Hypnotist]]''. This cartoon was the only time, though, that the Fat Elmer also had a red nose. This is the only cartoon with the \"fat\" version of Elmer to remain under copyright; the other \"fat Elmer\" cartoons are in the public domain.\n\nBugs would show up in a prison two more times: in ''[[Rebel Rabbit]]'' (1949) and ''[[Big House Bunny]]'' (1950). At the ends of ''[[Rabbit Transit (cartoon)|Rabbit Transit]]'' (1947) and ''[[Hare Brush]]'' (1955) he is arrested, but not actually shown in prison therein.\n\nThe lobby card where Bugs paints Elmer's glasses black is also done in the film.\n\n==Availability==\n* DVD - ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]'', Volume 1\n* Blu-ray - ''[[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection]]'', Volume 2\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Big Chungus.png|200px|thumb|The still frame from the short that has come to be known as \"Big Chungus\".]]\nIn December 2018, a still from the short depicting Bugs mocking Elmer by imitating his weight became an [[Internet meme]]. The meme originated from fictitious cover art for a video game titled ''Big Chungus'' (with \"chungus\" being a neologism associated with video game commentator [[Jim Sterling]]) which featured the still and was popularized by a [[Facebook]] post by a [[GameStop]] manager, who alleged that a colleague's mother had inquired about purchasing the fictional game as a gift for her son.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/magazine/all-the-presidents-memes.html|title=All the President's Memes|last=Staley|first=Willy|date=2019-01-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-25|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/big-chungus-memes/|title=Big Chungus Is The Last Great Meme Of 2018|date=2018-12-28|website=The Daily Dot|language=en|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|34368}}\n* {{bcdb title|5268}}\n* [https://archive.org/download/ClassicRareAndCensoredCartoons/122041dvdWabbitTwoubleMm.mp4 ''Wabbit Twouble'' on the Internet Archive]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box\n|before = [[All This and Rabbit Stew]]\n|title  = [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny Cartoons]]\n|years  = 1941\n|after  = [[The Wabbit Who Came to Supper]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n[[Category:1941 films]]\n[[Category:1941 short films]]\n[[Category:1941 animated films]]\n[[Category:1940s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1940s animated short films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bob Clampett]]\n[[Category:Merrie Melodies shorts]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in national parks]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling]]\n[[Category:Animated films about rabbits and hares]]\n[[Category:Animated films about bears]]\n[[Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Leon Schlesinger]]\n", "name_user": "Greenboy210", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabbit_Twouble"}
