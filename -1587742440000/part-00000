Directed by Greg Colton and co-written by [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]] and [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], the episode originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2010. In \"Road to the North Pole\", [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] go on an adventure to the [[North Pole]] so that Stewie can kill [[Santa Claus]]. They discover a dreary, [[pollution|polluting]] factory full of disease-ridden [[elf|elves]] and [[carnivorous]], [[feral]] [[reindeer]], along with a sickly, exhausted and suicidal Santa. Stewie and Brian take pity on him and decide to fulfill Christmas by delivering gifts to the entire globe, albeit unsuccessfully.\n\nThe \"[[Road to... (Family Guy)|Road to]]\" episodes which have aired throughout various seasons of ''Family Guy'' were inspired by the ''[[Road to...]]'' comedy films starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]], though this episode was not originally conceived as a \"Road to\" show. The episode is the second ''Family Guy'' [[Christmas by medium|Christmas special]] after the [[Family Guy (season 3)|season three]] episode, \"[[A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas]]\", also written by Danny Smith. It was first announced at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].\n\nCritical responses to the episode were mostly positive; critics praised its storyline and its numerous cultural references, although it also received [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]]. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 8.03&nbsp;million homes during its original airing in the United States. The episode featured guest performances by [[Drew Barrymore]], [[H. Jon Benjamin]], [[David Boreanaz]], [[Carrie Fisher]], and [[Karley Scott Collins]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It is narrated by Ron MacFarlane, Seth MacFarlane's father. It was nominated for 3 [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]]: [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series|Outstanding Music Composition for a Series]], Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation. It later won for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation. The song \"Christmastime Is Killing Us\" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]].\n\n==Plot==\nBrian takes Stewie to the mall, only to get a rude brush-off from the Santa who works there when he leaves for the night. As a result, Stewie vows to kill Santa for blowing him off and forces Brian to take him to the North Pole. Attempting to trick Stewie, he brings him to a Santa's Village amusement park. Soon discovering the charade, Stewie threatens to shoot Brian if he does not take him to the real North Pole.\n\nStewie hitches a ride with a trucker and so Brian follows him all the way to [[Canada]]. On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic pileup by discharging a flare pistol in the cab of the truck, which catches fire and explodes. Crashing his car in a chain reaction, Brian becomes angry and tells Stewie that Santa does not exist. Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to hitchhike, coercing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his snowmobile.\n\nContinuing north, they soon run out of gas, but receive help from the [[David Boreanaz|Aurora Boreanaz]], who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive the night in the cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy [[factory]] in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and depressed old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts to keep up with the increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer are carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after their presence is discovered by a family whom they attack, bind and gag with duct tape, upon discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.\n\nOn Christmas morning, everybody wakes up without any presents under their trees. They turn on the news, which is broadcasting the same story. Brian and Stewie appear on the broadcast and bring the dying Santa out in a wheelchair, explaining that humanity's greed is killing him and if they don't shorten their demands to one Christmas present a year, they may have to give up Christmas altogether. Chastened, everyone agrees and by one year later, Santa has recovered, the workshop is once again a lively, colorful cottage and the elves and reindeer are all rejuvenated.\n\n==Production and development==\n\"Road to the North Pole\" is the sixth episode of the \"[[Road to... (Family Guy)|Road to]]\" episodes of the series which air through various seasons of the show. It was directed by ''Family Guy'' veteran Greg Colton, this being the first episode he has directed since the eighth season episode \"[[Go Stewie, Go]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/episode/232273/castcrew |title= Family Guy: Go Stewie Go \u2013 Cast |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615054537/http://tv.yahoo.com/episode/232273/castcrew |archivedate=2011-06-15}}</ref> This is also Colton's third \"Road to\" episode, the first being \"[[Road to Germany]]\" and the second being \"[[Road to the Multiverse]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/episode/217820/castcrew |title= Family Guy&nbsp;\u2013 Road to the Multiverse&nbsp;\u2013 Cast and Crew |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"episode\">{{cite episode |title=Road to the Multiverse |series=Family Guy |serieslink=Family Guy |credits=Colton, Greg; Wild, Wellesley; MacFarlane, Seth|network=Fox |airdate=2009-09-27 |season=08 |number=01}}</ref> The episode was written by [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]] and [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], this being the first Smith wrote since \"[[Partial Terms of Endearment]],\"<ref name=\"abortion\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006945.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&ref=bd_tv |title='Family Guy' to table read abortion ep|magazine=Variety |last=Schneider |first=Michael|date=August 5, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}</ref> and his first \"Road to\" episode.

Stewie and Brian take pity on him and decide to fulfill Christmas by delivering gifts to the entire globe, albeit unsuccessfully.\n\nThe \"[[Road to... (Family Guy)|Road to]]\" episodes which have aired throughout various seasons of ''Family Guy'' were inspired by the ''[[Road to...]]'' comedy films starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]], though this episode was not originally conceived as a \"Road to\" show.

As a result, Stewie vows to kill Santa for blowing him off and forces Brian to take him to the North Pole. Attempting to trick Stewie, he brings him to a Santa's Village amusement park. Soon discovering the charade, Stewie threatens to shoot Brian if he does not take him to the real North Pole.\n\nStewie hitches a ride with a trucker and so Brian follows him all the way to [[Canada]]. On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic pileup by discharging a flare pistol in the cab of the truck, which catches fire and explodes. Crashing his car in a chain reaction, Brian becomes angry and tells Stewie that Santa does not exist. Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to hitchhike, coercing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his snowmobile.\n\nContinuing north, they soon run out of gas, but receive help from the [[David Boreanaz|Aurora Boreanaz]], who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive the night in the cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy [[factory]] in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and depressed old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts to keep up with the increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer are carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after their presence is discovered by a family whom they attack, bind and gag with duct tape, upon discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.\n\nOn Christmas morning, everybody wakes up without any presents under their trees. They turn on the news, which is broadcasting the same story. Brian and Stewie appear on the broadcast and bring the dying Santa out in a wheelchair, explaining that humanity's greed is killing him and if they don't shorten their demands to one Christmas present a year, they may have to give up Christmas altogether. Chastened, everyone agrees and by one year later, Santa has recovered, the workshop is once again a lively, colorful cottage and the elves and reindeer are all rejuvenated.\n\n==Production and development==\n\"Road to the North Pole\" is the sixth episode of the \"[[Road to... (Family Guy)|Road to]]\" episodes of the series which air through various seasons of the show.

Directed by Greg Colton and written by [[Wellesley Wild]], the episode originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 27, 2009, along with the [[Pilot (The Cleveland Show)|series premiere]] of ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''. In \"Road to the Multiverse\", two of the show's main characters, baby genius [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], both voiced by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], use an \"out-of-this-world\" [[remote control]] to travel through a series of various [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]]. They eventually end up in a world where dogs rule and humans obey. Brian becomes reluctant to return to his own universe, and he ultimately ends up breaking the remote, much to the dismay of Stewie, who soon seeks a replacement. The \"[[Road to... (Family Guy)|Road to]]\" episodes which have aired throughout various seasons of ''Family Guy'' were inspired by the ''[[Road to ...]]'' comedy films starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]], though this episode was not originally conceived as a \"Road to\" show.\n\nDuring the [[Family Guy (season 6)|sixth season]], episodes of ''Family Guy'' were delayed from regular broadcast due to the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike]]. MacFarlane, the series creator and executive producer, sided with the Writers Guild and participated in the strike until its conclusion. As a result, the [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh season]] consisted entirely of hold-overs. \"Road to the Multiverse\" was the first episode to be produced and aired after the strike ended. It was first announced at the 2008 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].\n\nResponses to the episode were highly positive; critics praised its storyline, numerous cultural references, and use of various animation styles. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was watched by 10.17&nbsp;million people during its original airing in the United States. The episode featured guest performances by Kei Ogawa, Kotaro Watanabe and Jamison Yang, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Greg Colton won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Individual Achievement in Animation, for storyboarding the episode, at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]]. \"Road to the Multiverse\" was released on DVD along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nAs the [[Griffin family]] attend the county fair, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] announces that he has bred a winning pedigree pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] that he got the pig from a farm in a [[Multiverse|parallel universe]], he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog in the same time and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed, so the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] never occurred and thus humanity is 1000 years more technologically advanced (despite the existence of the [[Sistine Chapel]] in that universe). This leads an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the [[Griffin family]]. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home.\n\nContinuing their explorations, they reach a universe where humans are subservient to dogs. Stewie finally figures out how to modify the remote device so that they can return home; but Brian, overwhelmed by the thought of a world run by dogs like himself, is reluctant to leave and steals the remote. Stewie and Brian fight over the device, ultimately breaking it, which traps them in the alternative universe. In desperation, the two go to the universe's version of the Griffin family&nbsp;\u2013 who are all dogs except for their pet Brian, who is human&nbsp;\u2013 hoping to find a solution. The dog version of Stewie quickly confronts the two, revealing that he has also developed a universe-traveling device that would allow them to return to their own universe. Before Dog Stewie can fetch them his remote control, Human Stewie bites the dog version of his father, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], out of anger for being treated like an animal and is sent to the pound where he is to be [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] later that day. The two Brians and Dog Stewie go to the human pound to free him, and both Stewie and Brian are sent back to their original universe. As they are being transported, human Brian, dreaming of a better life in a world of intelligent inhabitants, leaps into the inter-universe portal at the last moment and successfully makes it to the original universe with the other two. Excited about his new prospects in life, human Brian begins his optimistic adventure in a brand new universe but is quickly struck by a car.\n\n==Production and development==\n{{further|Road to...

Directed by Greg Colton and written by [[Wellesley Wild]], the episode originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 27, 2009, along with the [[Pilot (The Cleveland Show)|series premiere]] of ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''. In \"Road to the Multiverse\", two of the show's main characters, baby genius [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], both voiced by series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], use an \"out-of-this-world\" [[remote control]] to travel through a series of various [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]]. They eventually end up in a world where dogs rule and humans obey. Brian becomes reluctant to return to his own universe, and he ultimately ends up breaking the remote, much to the dismay of Stewie, who soon seeks a replacement. The \"[[Road to... (Family Guy)|Road to]]\" episodes which have aired throughout various seasons of ''Family Guy'' were inspired by the ''[[Road to ...]]'' comedy films starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]], though this episode was not originally conceived as a \"Road to\" show.\n\nDuring the [[Family Guy (season 6)|sixth season]], episodes of ''Family Guy'' were delayed from regular broadcast due to the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike]]. MacFarlane, the series creator and executive producer, sided with the Writers Guild and participated in the strike until its conclusion. As a result, the [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh season]] consisted entirely of hold-overs. \"Road to the Multiverse\" was the first episode to be produced and aired after the strike ended. It was first announced at the 2008 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].\n\nResponses to the episode were highly positive; critics praised its storyline, numerous cultural references, and use of various animation styles. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was watched by 10.17&nbsp;million people during its original airing in the United States. The episode featured guest performances by Kei Ogawa, Kotaro Watanabe and Jamison Yang, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Greg Colton won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Individual Achievement in Animation, for storyboarding the episode, at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]]. \"Road to the Multiverse\" was released on DVD along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nAs the [[Griffin family]] attend the county fair, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] announces that he has bred a winning pedigree pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] that he got the pig from a farm in a [[Multiverse|parallel universe]], he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog in the same time and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed, so the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] never occurred and thus humanity is 1000 years more technologically advanced (despite the existence of the [[Sistine Chapel]] in that universe). This leads an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the [[Griffin family]]. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home.\n\nContinuing their explorations, they reach a universe where humans are subservient to dogs. Stewie finally figures out how to modify the remote device so that they can return home; but Brian, overwhelmed by the thought of a world run by dogs like himself, is reluctant to leave and steals the remote. Stewie and Brian fight over the device, ultimately breaking it, which traps them in the alternative universe. In desperation, the two go to the universe's version of the Griffin family&nbsp;\u2013 who are all dogs except for their pet Brian, who is human&nbsp;\u2013 hoping to find a solution. The dog version of Stewie quickly confronts the two, revealing that he has also developed a universe-traveling device that would allow them to return to their own universe. Before Dog Stewie can fetch them his remote control, Human Stewie bites the dog version of his father, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], out of anger for being treated like an animal and is sent to the pound where he is to be [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] later that day. The two Brians and Dog Stewie go to the human pound to free him, and both Stewie and Brian are sent back to their original universe. As they are being transported, human Brian, dreaming of a better life in a world of intelligent inhabitants, leaps into the inter-universe portal at the last moment and successfully makes it to the original universe with the other two. Excited about his new prospects in life, human Brian begins his optimistic adventure in a brand new universe but is quickly struck by a car.\n\n==Production and development==\n{{further|Road to...

During their investigation, they have a run-in with Bonnie Belski, a persistent FBI agent looking for a logical explanation for the happenings. It seems the bank robbers are using a device that creates a sound resonance so severe, it somewhat hypnotizes all who hear it and leaves them in a state of euphoria for minutes after. It's up to Myka and Pete to figure out where the robbers will strike next and retrieve whatever bizarre object they are employing. Meanwhile, Artie examines a possible security breach back at the warehouse. Guest starring [[Tricia Helfer]].\n\n==Artifacts==\n* [[Lewis Carroll]]'s Mirror - Pete plays ping pong with himself using this mirror and half a ping pong table. Its exact nature is made clear in a later episode.\n* [[Euphoria]] Record - a vinyl record, recorded by composer Eric Marsden. The tonality of the music, combined with the right resonance, causes intense feelings of joy and euphoria in the listener, so extreme that they are briefly incapacitated.

During their investigation, they have a run-in with Bonnie Belski, a persistent FBI agent looking for a logical explanation for the happenings. It seems the bank robbers are using a device that creates a sound resonance so severe, it somewhat hypnotizes all who hear it and leaves them in a state of euphoria for minutes after. It's up to Myka and Pete to figure out where the robbers will strike next and retrieve whatever bizarre object they are employing. Meanwhile, Artie examines a possible security breach back at the warehouse.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May 9, 2010. The episode features [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] after his father, Dan Quagmire, returns to Quahog and states he is \"[[Transsexualism|a woman trapped in a man's body]]\". Dan has decided to have [[sex reassignment surgery]] to become physically female. Meanwhile, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] travels to a seminar and, upon returning, has a sexual affair with \"Ida,\" who he does not realize is Quagmire's post-operative father.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Tom Devanney]] and directed by [[Pete Michels]]. It received generally mixed reviews, in addition to receiving some criticism  for its portrayal of [[transgender|transgender identity]], including from the [[GLAAD|Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) and the [[Parents Television Council]]. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 7.22 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured a guest performance by [[Wally Wingert]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Quagmire's Dad\" was released on [[DVD]] along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] visit [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] and are introduced to his father, Lieutenant Commander Dan Quagmire. Expecting to see the inspiration for Quagmire's sexual behavior, they are surprised by Dan's [[LGBT stereotypes#Male homosexuality|stereotypically gay mannerisms]].\n\nThe following morning, Quagmire invites Peter and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] to the Naval Ball being held to honor his father, but soon begins arguing with Peter about his father's sexuality. At the ball that night, members of the Navy bombard Quagmire with compliments about his war-hero father, most of which can be taken as [[double entendre]]s about Dan's alleged [[homosexuality]]. Concerned that his dad might actually be gay, Quagmire confronts him and Dan states that he is not gay, but is instead \"[[Transsexualism|a woman trapped in a man's body]]\" and that he plans to have a [[sex reassignment surgery|sex change operation]] during his stay in Quahog. The surgery is a success, with Quagmire's dad emerging as \"Ida\".\n\nThat night, Ida and Quagmire join the Griffins for dinner. As the dinner begins, however, Quagmire becomes frustrated when the Griffins turn the conversation towards Ida's operation, and storms out of the room. At Quagmire's home, Quagmire tells Ida that he is not sure he can deal with her new gender identity. Saddened, Ida leaves Quagmire's home and decides to stay at a nearby [[Marriott Hotels & Resorts|Marriott Hotel]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] has been out of town attending a seminar on creating a [[web series]] and is unaware of what has happened. On his way home, Brian stops at the Marriott, meets Ida, and has a few drinks with her. Quickly bonding, they retire to Ida's room for [[sexual intercourse|sex]].\n\nThe next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cell phone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] tells him that Quagmire's father has had a sex change and reveals that Dan is now called Ida, Brian realizes that he has had sex with Quagmire's [[transsexual]] father. He vomits profusely for thirty uninterrupted seconds, and then he and Stewie begin panicking.\n\nIda returns to Quagmire's home and apologizes, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she met someone, and he is initially excited to know who it was. However, when she reveals that it was Brian, [[Jerome Is the New Black|whom Quagmire despises]], he becomes furious.\n\nBrian is [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him and brutally beats him up, ordering him to stay away from him and his family. As Quagmire leaves, Brian retaliates by telling him \"Hey, I fucked your dad\", before slamming the door shut.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|right|thumb|140px|alt=A man with short, black hair, wearing a black shirt, with slight stubble, leaning forward slightly while speaking into a microphone.|[[Seth MacFarlane]] provided the voice of Dan Quagmire and Ida Davis.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Tom Devanney]] and directed by series regular [[Pete Michels]].

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May 9, 2010. The episode features [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] after his father, Dan Quagmire, returns to Quahog and states he is \"[[Transsexualism|a woman trapped in a man's body]]\". Dan has decided to have [[sex reassignment surgery]] to become physically female. Meanwhile, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] travels to a seminar and, upon returning, has a sexual affair with \"Ida,\" who he does not realize is Quagmire's post-operative father.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Tom Devanney]] and directed by [[Pete Michels]]. It received generally mixed reviews, in addition to receiving some criticism  for its portrayal of [[transgender|transgender identity]], including from the [[GLAAD|Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) and the [[Parents Television Council]]. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 7.22 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured a guest performance by [[Wally Wingert]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Quagmire's Dad\" was released on [[DVD]] along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] visit [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] and are introduced to his father, Lieutenant Commander Dan Quagmire. Expecting to see the inspiration for Quagmire's sexual behavior, they are surprised by Dan's [[LGBT stereotypes#Male homosexuality|stereotypically gay mannerisms]].\n\nThe following morning, Quagmire invites Peter and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] to the Naval Ball being held to honor his father, but soon begins arguing with Peter about his father's sexuality. At the ball that night, members of the Navy bombard Quagmire with compliments about his war-hero father, most of which can be taken as [[double entendre]]s about Dan's alleged [[homosexuality]]. Concerned that his dad might actually be gay, Quagmire confronts him and Dan states that he is not gay, but is instead \"[[Transsexualism|a woman trapped in a man's body]]\" and that he plans to have a [[sex reassignment surgery|sex change operation]] during his stay in Quahog. The surgery is a success, with Quagmire's dad emerging as \"Ida\".\n\nThat night, Ida and Quagmire join the Griffins for dinner. As the dinner begins, however, Quagmire becomes frustrated when the Griffins turn the conversation towards Ida's operation, and storms out of the room. At Quagmire's home, Quagmire tells Ida that he is not sure he can deal with her new gender identity. Saddened, Ida leaves Quagmire's home and decides to stay at a nearby [[Marriott Hotels & Resorts|Marriott Hotel]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] has been out of town attending a seminar on creating a [[web series]] and is unaware of what has happened. On his way home, Brian stops at the Marriott, meets Ida, and has a few drinks with her. Quickly bonding, they retire to Ida's room for [[sexual intercourse|sex]].\n\nThe next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cell phone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] tells him that Quagmire's father has had a sex change and reveals that Dan is now called Ida, Brian realizes that he has had sex with Quagmire's [[transsexual]] father. He vomits profusely for thirty uninterrupted seconds, and then he and Stewie begin panicking.\n\nIda returns to Quagmire's home and apologizes, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she met someone, and he is initially excited to know who it was. However, when she reveals that it was Brian, [[Jerome Is the New Black|whom Quagmire despises]], he becomes furious.\n\nBrian is [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him and brutally beats him up, ordering him to stay away from him and his family. As Quagmire leaves, Brian retaliates by telling him \"Hey, I fucked your dad\", before slamming the door shut.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|right|thumb|140px|alt=A man with short, black hair, wearing a black shirt, with slight stubble, leaning forward slightly while speaking into a microphone.|[[Seth MacFarlane]] provided the voice of Dan Quagmire and Ida Davis.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Tom Devanney]] and directed by series regular [[Pete Michels]].
