He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]].

Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties.

The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Award]]s and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for Worst Film, in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced a musical version of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon.

Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later).

Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.

Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.  The director of ''The Fabulous Allan Carr'' [[Jeffrey Schwarz]] said, \"Although it was no secret that Allan Carr was gay, he never formally acknowledged it publicly.

The event has been held annually since [[ARIA Music Awards of 1987|1987]] and encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards (these are what is usually being referred to as \"the ARIA awards\") as well as Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from [[ARIA Music Awards of 2004|2004]]), [[ARIA Achievement Awards|Achievement Awards]] and [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] \u2013 the latter were held separately from [[ARIA Music Awards of 2005|2005]] to [[ARIA Music Awards of 2010|2010]] but returned to the general ceremony in [[ARIA Music Awards of 2011|2011]]. For 2010, ARIA introduced public voted awards for the first time.\n\nWinning, or even being nominated for, an ARIA award results in a lot of media attention and publicity on an artist, and usually increases recording sales several-fold, as well as chart significance \u2013 in [[ARIA Music Awards of 2005|2005]], for example, after [[Ben Lee]] won three awards, his album ''[[Awake Is the New Sleep]]'' jumped from No.&nbsp;31 to No.&nbsp;5 in the [[ARIA Charts]], its highest position.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1983, the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) was established by the six major record companies then operating in Australia, [[EMI]], [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], CBS (now known as [[Sony Music]]), RCA (now known as [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]), WEA (now known as [[Warner Music]]) and [[Polygram]] (now known as Universal) replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956.<ref name=\"AARM\">{{cite book|title=The Book of Australia : Almanac 1997\u201398|editor=Siobhan O'Connor|page=515|year=1997|origyear=1990|location=[[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain, NSW]]|publisher=Ken Fin: Watermark Press for Social Club Books|isbn=1-875973-71-0}}</ref> It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members.<ref name=\"AARM\"/>\n\nAustralian TV [[pop music]] show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' presented its own annual awards ceremony, [[Australian pop music awards#1981\u20131986: Countdown Music and Video Awards|''Countdown'' Music and Video Awards]], which were co-produced by Carolyn James (a.k.a.

Material must be previously unrecorded, thus ruling out most live albums. A recording can be nominated within multiple categories, but only one genre category (for example, an album could not be simultaneously nominated for Best Pop Release and Best Dance Release). Re-released recordings are not eligible and compilations are not eligible.\n\nArtists must either be Australian [[citizen]]s, or have applied for or attained [[permanent resident]] status and have resided in Australia for at least six months within the specified period. For bands, at least half the members of the group must meet this requirement. If a recording refers to both an individual and a band (for example, [[Dan Kelly (musician)|Dan Kelly]] & the Alpha Males), it must be nominated only the basis of the individual or the band, not mixed or both.\n\nSome categories have further requirements as specified below:\n\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Album of the Year|Album]]/[[ARIA Award for Single of the Year|Single of the Year]]''': Recording must appear in the ARIA Top 100 Albums or Singles chart respectively during the specified period.\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist - Release|Breakthrough Artist]] ([[ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist - Album|Album]]/Single):''' Artist must not have previously reached the final five nominations in any ARIA awards category for any release, or have been in a group that has done so, or have a previous release in the Top 50 release charts.\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]''': \"Recording must be directed toward Contemporary Rock, Modern Rock and Active Rock formats.\"\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album|Best Adult Contemporary Album]]:''' \"Recording must be directed toward Adult Contemporary formats.\"\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Pop Release|Best Pop Release]]:''' \"Recording must be directed toward CHR/Top 40 formats.\"\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Independent Release|Best Independent Release]]:''' Recording must be released and funded by an ARIA member that is not a member of a multinational corporation.\n* '''Best Music DVD''': Compilations may enter this category. Content must be at least 60% original. The release must be eligible to appear on the ARIA Music DVD chart (this means most \"bonus disc\" releases are unlikely to be eligible).\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release|Best Comedy Release]]''': Compilations are acceptable. Album, single and DVD releases are all eligible. Content must be 100% original.\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Children's Album|Best Children's Album]]''': Compilations are acceptable (but content must be 100% original, having been recorded specifically for that album). Form and content must be aimed at a [[pre-teen]] audience.\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Dance Release|Best Dance Release]]:''' Compilations are acceptable. \"Artists working primarily within the dance genre, e.g.: House, Techno, Trance, Hardcore, Garage, Breakbeat, Drum & Bass, Disco and Electronica are eligible. In the case of a remixed album or single, the production team(s) and the original recording artist(s) must both meet the artist eligibility criteria, and the release must qualify for inclusion in either the ARIA Album or Single chart.\"\n*''' [[ARIA Award for Best Urban Album|Best Urban Release]]''': \"Artists working primarily within the urban genre, e.g.: r\u2019n\u2019b, hip-hop, soul,  funk, reggae and dancehall, are eligible. In the case of a remixed album or single, the production team(s) and the original recording artist(s) must both meet the artist eligibility criteria, and the release must qualify for inclusion in either the ARIA Album or Single chart. The ARIA member must also nominate whether the production team or the original recording artist would be the recipient of the award.\"\n* '''Sales awards:''' A company may enter up to five recordings in a category. For these categories, the recording does not have to be first released during the specified period, so these categories are two of the few where recordings can be nominated more than once. These categories were discontinued in 2010.<ref name=\"ArtsHub2012\"/>\n\n==Judging process==\n[[Image:ARIA 2009 Judging academy pie chart.png|thumb|right|A breakdown of the 2009 judging academy.]]\nSales awards are judged by an independent [[audit]]. The Hall of Fame and Lifetime Achievement awards are awarded at the discretion of the ARIA Board. Genre categories are judged by \"voting schools\" that consist of 40\u2013100 representatives from that genre. The remaining generalist categories are the \"voting academy\", which, in 2009, consisted of 1106 representatives from across the music industry.<ref name=\"ARIAJudge\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100719020831/http://www.ariaawards.com.au/about-judges.php | url = http://www.ariaawards.com.au/about-judges.php | title = Judging Academy Policy | publisher = Australian Recording Industry Association | archivedate = 19 July 2010 | accessdate = 12 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMembers of the academy are kept secret.

For 2010, ARIA introduced public voted awards for the first time.\n\nWinning, or even being nominated for, an ARIA award results in a lot of media attention and publicity on an artist, and usually increases recording sales several-fold, as well as chart significance \u2013 in [[ARIA Music Awards of 2005|2005]], for example, after [[Ben Lee]] won three awards, his album ''[[Awake Is the New Sleep]]'' jumped from No.&nbsp;31 to No.&nbsp;5 in the [[ARIA Charts]], its highest position.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1983, the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) was established by the six major record companies then operating in Australia, [[EMI]], [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], CBS (now known as [[Sony Music]]), RCA (now known as [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]), WEA (now known as [[Warner Music]]) and [[Polygram]] (now known as Universal) replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956.<ref name=\"AARM\">{{cite book|title=The Book of Australia : Almanac 1997\u201398|editor=Siobhan O'Connor|page=515|year=1997|origyear=1990|location=[[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain, NSW]]|publisher=Ken Fin: Watermark Press for Social Club Books|isbn=1-875973-71-0}}</ref> It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members.<ref name=\"AARM\"/>\n\nAustralian TV [[pop music]] show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' presented its own annual awards ceremony, [[Australian pop music awards#1981\u20131986: Countdown Music and Video Awards|''Countdown'' Music and Video Awards]], which were co-produced by Carolyn James (a.k.a.

Material must be previously unrecorded, thus ruling out most live albums. A recording can be nominated within multiple categories, but only one genre category (for example, an album could not be simultaneously nominated for Best Pop Release and Best Dance Release). Re-released recordings are not eligible and compilations are not eligible.\n\nArtists must either be Australian [[citizen]]s, or have applied for or attained [[permanent resident]] status and have resided in Australia for at least six months within the specified period. For bands, at least half the members of the group must meet this requirement. If a recording refers to both an individual and a band (for example, [[Dan Kelly (musician)|Dan Kelly]] & the Alpha Males), it must be nominated only the basis of the individual or the band, not mixed or both.\n\nSome categories have further requirements as specified below:\n\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Album of the Year|Album]]/[[ARIA Award for Single of the Year|Single of the Year]]''': Recording must appear in the ARIA Top 100 Albums or Singles chart respectively during the specified period.\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist - Release|Breakthrough Artist]] ([[ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist - Album|Album]]/Single):''' Artist must not have previously reached the final five nominations in any ARIA awards category for any release, or have been in a group that has done so, or have a previous release in the Top 50 release charts.\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]''': \"Recording must be directed toward Contemporary Rock, Modern Rock and Active Rock formats.\"\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Adult Contemporary Album|Best Adult Contemporary Album]]:''' \"Recording must be directed toward Adult Contemporary formats.\"\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Pop Release|Best Pop Release]]:''' \"Recording must be directed toward CHR/Top 40 formats.\"\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Independent Release|Best Independent Release]]:''' Recording must be released and funded by an ARIA member that is not a member of a multinational corporation.\n* '''Best Music DVD''': Compilations may enter this category. Content must be at least 60% original. The release must be eligible to appear on the ARIA Music DVD chart (this means most \"bonus disc\" releases are unlikely to be eligible).\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release|Best Comedy Release]]''': Compilations are acceptable. Album, single and DVD releases are all eligible. Content must be 100% original.\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Children's Album|Best Children's Album]]''': Compilations are acceptable (but content must be 100% original, having been recorded specifically for that album). Form and content must be aimed at a [[pre-teen]] audience.\n* '''[[ARIA Award for Best Dance Release|Best Dance Release]]:''' Compilations are acceptable. \"Artists working primarily within the dance genre, e.g.: House, Techno, Trance, Hardcore, Garage, Breakbeat, Drum & Bass, Disco and Electronica are eligible. In the case of a remixed album or single, the production team(s) and the original recording artist(s) must both meet the artist eligibility criteria, and the release must qualify for inclusion in either the ARIA Album or Single chart.\"\n*''' [[ARIA Award for Best Urban Album|Best Urban Release]]''': \"Artists working primarily within the urban genre, e.g.: r\u2019n\u2019b, hip-hop, soul,  funk, reggae and dancehall, are eligible. In the case of a remixed album or single, the production team(s) and the original recording artist(s) must both meet the artist eligibility criteria, and the release must qualify for inclusion in either the ARIA Album or Single chart. The ARIA member must also nominate whether the production team or the original recording artist would be the recipient of the award.\"\n* '''Sales awards:''' A company may enter up to five recordings in a category. For these categories, the recording does not have to be first released during the specified period, so these categories are two of the few where recordings can be nominated more than once. These categories were discontinued in 2010.<ref name=\"ArtsHub2012\"/>\n\n==Judging process==\n[[Image:ARIA 2009 Judging academy pie chart.png|thumb|right|A breakdown of the 2009 judging academy.]]\nSales awards are judged by an independent [[audit]]. The Hall of Fame and Lifetime Achievement awards are awarded at the discretion of the ARIA Board. Genre categories are judged by \"voting schools\" that consist of 40\u2013100 representatives from that genre. The remaining generalist categories are the \"voting academy\", which, in 2009, consisted of 1106 representatives from across the music industry.<ref name=\"ARIAJudge\">{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100719020831/http://www.ariaawards.com.au/about-judges.php | url = http://www.ariaawards.com.au/about-judges.php | title = Judging Academy Policy | publisher = Australian Recording Industry Association | archivedate = 19 July 2010 | accessdate = 12 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMembers of the academy are kept secret.
