He later served a year in prison on charges stemming from the theft, which prosecutors argued was made possible by lax security under his watch.<ref>{{cite web |title=Egypt court jails officials over Van Gogh theft |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/10541/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-court-jails-officials-over-Van-Gogh-theft.aspx |website=Ahram Online |publisher=Ahram Online |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\nShaalan was born in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] in 1951. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Art and Education in 1974. He held several positions within Egypt's [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Ministry of Culture]] before eventually being appointed the Head of the Fine Arts Sector in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mohsen Shaalan |url=http://arttalks.com/artist/mohsen-shaalan/ |website=Art Talks |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> In this position, Shaalan was responsible for overseeing various museums and art institutions throughout Egypt, including the [[Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum]], which houses one of the largest collections of 18th and 19th century European art in the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Egyptian artist Mohsen Shaalan dies at 63 |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/93859.aspx |website=Ahram Online |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> While in the position, he worked to restore various cultural institutions in Egypt, including the Aisha Fahmy Palace, the Rateb Sedeek Art Gallery, and the 1952 Revolution Heroes Museum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Egyptian artist Mohsen Shaalan dies at 63 |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/93859.aspx |website=Ahram Online |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Trial and imprisonment ==\n\nIn August of 2010, [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh's]] ''[[Poppy Flowers]]'' was stolen from the [[Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum]], one of the museums under Shaalan's oversight. At the time of the theft, the painting was appraised at $55 million.

Shaalan stated that despite these warnings, he was not given the resources necessary to improve security.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Elkamel |first1=Sara |title=Egypt's jailed culture ministry official creates art behind bars |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/0/64971/Arts--Culture/0/Egypts-jailed-culture-ministry-official-creates-ar.aspx |website=Ahram Online |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Michael |first1=Maggie |title=Stolen Van Gogh still missing, Egypt deputy minister detained |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/From-the-news-wires/2010/0824/Stolen-Van-Gogh-still-missing-Egypt-deputy-minister-detained |website=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> According to him, a $7 million budget was necessary to repair museum security, but only $88,000 was approved.<ref>{{cite web |title=Egyptian ministry officials jailed over Van Gogh theft |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11529187 |website=BBC News |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAt trial, Shaalan and 10 other Ministry of Culture employees were found guilty of negligence and sentenced to three years in prison, but were released on bail of about $1,750 pending appeal.<ref>{{cite web |title=Egyptian ministry officials jailed over Van Gogh theft |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11529187 |website=BBC News |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Upon appeal, Shaalan's convictions for negligence and professional delinquency were upheld, but his sentence was reduced to a year in jail.\n\nWhile in jail, Shaalan created many artworks and channeled his experiences of being imprisoned into his work.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Elkamel |first1=Sara |title=Egypt's jailed culture ministry official creates art behind bars |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/0/64971/Arts--Culture/0/Egypts-jailed-culture-ministry-official-creates-ar.aspx |website=Ahram Online |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Later life ==\n\nAfter being release from jail, Shaalan put on many exhibitions of his work, focusing on those he created while incarcerated.
