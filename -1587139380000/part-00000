During a 60-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include ''[[Fa\u00e7ade (entertainment)|Fa\u00e7ade]]'', the [[cantata]] ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', the [[Viola Concerto (Walton)|Viola Concerto]], the [[Symphony No. 1 (Walton)|First Symphony]], and the [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation anthems]] [[Crown Imperial (march)|''Crown Imperial'']] and ''[[Orb and Sceptre]]''.\n\nBorn in [[Oldham]], [[Lancashire]], the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary [[The Sitwells|Sitwell]] siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with [[Edith Sitwell]], ''Fa\u00e7ade'', which at first brought him notoriety as a [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], but later became a popular ballet score.\n\nIn middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his wife [[Susana, Lady Walton|Susana]] on the Italian island of [[Ischia]]. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, ''[[Troilus and Cressida (opera)|Troilus and Cressida]]'', was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.\n\nWalton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Christ Church (Oxford).jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Exterior of large neo-classical building with extensive lawns in front of it|[[Christ Church, Oxford]], where Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate]]\nWalton was born into a musical family in [[Oldham]], [[Lancashire]], the second son of three boys and a girl of Louisa Maria (''n\u00e9e'' Turner), a singer before her marriage,<ref>Kennedy, p. 5</ref> and Charles Alexander Walton, a musician who had trained at the [[Royal Northern College of Music|Royal Manchester College of Music]] under [[Charles Hall\u00e9]], and made a living as a singing teacher and church organist.\n\nWalton's musical talents were spotted when he was still a young boy and he took piano and violin lessons, though he never mastered either instrument. He was more successful as a singer:<ref name=\"greenfield\">Greenfield, Edward. \"Behind the Fa\u00e7ade \u2013 Walton on Walton\", ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', February 2002, p. 93</ref> he and his elder brother sang in their father's choir, taking part in performances of large-scale works by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and others.<ref name=\"k6\">Kennedy, p. 6</ref>\n\nWalton attended a local school, however in 1912 his father saw a newspaper advertisement for probationer choristers at [[Christ Church Cathedral School]] in [[Oxford]] and applied for his son to be admitted.

It was first heard as an entr'acte at a performance in [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev's]] 1926 ballet season, where ''[[The Times]]'' complained, \"It is a little difficult to make much of new music when it is heard through the hum of conversation.\"<ref>\"The Russian Ballet\", ''The Times'', 29 June 1926, p. 14</ref> [[Henry J.

It was written at the suggestion of [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]] for the viola virtuoso [[Lionel Tertis]]. When Tertis received the manuscript, he rejected it immediately. The composer and violist [[Paul Hindemith]] stepped into the breach and gave the first performance.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 47\u201350</ref> The work was greeted with enthusiasm.

He had composed the first three of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor [[Hamilton Harty]]. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work.

His most important work of the 1930s, alongside the symphony, was the [[Violin Concerto (Walton)|Violin Concerto]] (1939), commissioned by [[Jascha Heifetz]]. The concerto, Walton later revealed, expressed his love for Alice Wimborne.<ref>Kennedy, p. 104</ref> Its strong [[Romantic music|romantic]] style caused some critics to label it retrogressive,<ref>Mason, pp. 147\u2013148</ref> and Walton said in a newspaper interview, \"Today's white hope is tomorrow's black sheep.

As with his film music, the composer was inclined to dismiss the musical importance of his work on the programme.<ref>Kennedy, p. 120</ref>\n\nApart from these commissions, Walton's wartime works of any magnitude comprised incidental music for [[John Gielgud]]'s 1942 production of ''[[Macbeth]]''; two scores for the [[Royal Ballet|Sadler's Wells Ballet]], ''[[The Wise Virgins]]'', based on the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S.

While there, Walton worked on projects that had been in his mind for some time. In 1939 he had been planning a substantial chamber work, a string quartet, but he set it aside while composing his wartime film scores. In early 1945 he turned again to the quartet. Walton was conscious that Britten, with ''[[Les Illuminations]]'' (1940), the ''[[Sinfonia da Requiem]]'' (1942), and ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' in 1945, had produced a series of substantial works, while Walton had produced no major composition since the Violin Concerto in 1939.<ref>Kennedy, p. 130</ref> Among English critics and audiences, the Violin Concerto was not at first rated one of Walton's finest works. Because Heifetz had bought the exclusive rights to play the concerto for two years, it was not heard in Britain until 1941. The London premiere, with a less famous soloist, and in the unflattering acoustics of the [[Royal Albert Hall]], did not immediately reveal the work as a masterpiece.<ref>\"The New Concerto\", ''The Times'', 7 November 1941, p. 6</ref> The String Quartet in A minor, premiered in May 1947, was Walton's most substantial work of the 1940s.

To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in [[Buenos Aires]] later that year.{{refn|\n\nOther British delegates were [[Eric Coates]] and [[A. P. Herbert]].<ref>Kennedy, p. 143</ref> |group= n}} While there, Walton met [[Susana, Lady Walton|Susana Gil Passo]] (1926\u20132010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding took place in [[Buenos Aires]] in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of [[Ischia]], and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 75, 140, 143, 144 and 208</ref>\n\nWalton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera ''[[Troilus and Cressida (opera)|Troilus and Cressida]]''. On the advice of the BBC, he invited [[Christopher Hassall]] to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist.<ref>Kennedy, p. 145</ref> Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was [[knight]]ed. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of ''Fa\u00e7ade'', which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of [[Elizabeth II]] he was again called on to write a coronation march, ''[[Orb and Sceptre]]''; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the ''[[Te Deum]]'' for the occasion.<ref>Wilkinson, pp. 27\u201328</ref>\n\n''Troilus and Cressida'' was presented at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did [[Henry Moore]] who had agreed to design the production; [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], for whom the role of Cressida had been written, refused to perform it; her replacement, [[Magda L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], had difficulty mastering the English words; and Sargent, the conductor, \"did not seem well acquainted with the score\".<ref>Kennedy, pp. 174\u2013180</ref><ref>Reid, p. 383</ref> The premiere had a friendly reception, but there was a general feeling that Hassall and Walton had written an old-fashioned opera in an outmoded tradition.<ref>Kennedy, p. 181</ref> The piece was subsequently staged in [[San Francisco]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Milan]] during the next year, but failed to make a positive impression, and did not enter the regular operatic repertory.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 181\u201382</ref>\n\n[[File:Veduta di Forio.JPG|thumb|left|300px|alt=view from hilltop garden across small town to the sea|The view from the Waltons' house on [[Ischia]]]]\nIn 1956 Walton sold his London house and took up full-time residence on Ischia.

Each opens reflectively, is in three movements, and contrasts agitated and jagged passages with warmer romantic sections.<ref name=grove/> The Cello Concerto is more introspective than the two earlier concertos, with a ticking rhythm throughout the work suggesting the inexorable passage of time.<ref name=grove/>\n\nThe two symphonies are strongly contrasted with one another. The First is on a large scale, reminiscent at times of Sibelius.<ref>Cardus, Neville. \"William Walton's First Symphony\". ''The Manchester Guardian'', 7 November 1935, p. 10</ref> Grove says of the work that its \"orgiastic power, coruscating malice, sensuous desolation and extroverted swagger\" make the symphony a tribute to Walton's tenacity and inventive facility.<ref name=grove/> Critics have always differed on whether the finale lives up to the rest of the work.<ref name=evans/><ref>Cox, p. 193</ref> In comparison with the First, the Second Symphony struck many reviewers as lightweight, and, as with many of Walton's works of the 1950s, it was regarded as old fashioned. It is a very different kind of work from the First Symphony. David Cox describes it as \"more a ''[[divertimento]]'' than a symphony ... highly personal, unmistakably Walton throughout\",<ref>Cox, p. 195</ref> and Kennedy calls it \"somewhat enigmatic in mood, and a superb example of Walton's more mature, concise, and mellow post-1945 style.\"<ref name=dnb/>\n\n====Music for ballets, plays and films====\nAlthough generally a slow and perfectionist composer, Walton was capable of working quickly when necessary. Some of his stage and screen music was written to tight deadlines. He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced.\n\nOf his ballets for Sadler's Wells, ''The Wise Virgins'' (1940) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral and instrumental music by Bach.{{refn|Later in 1940 Walton further arranged the music into a six-movement suite.<ref>[[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|Lloyd-Jones, David]] (2002), liner notes to Naxos CD 8.555868.</ref>|group= n}} ''The Quest'' (1943), written in great haste, is, according to Grove, oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams.<ref name=grove/> Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire, unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of ''Fa\u00e7ade'', the music for which was expanded for full orchestra, still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original.<ref name=ocm/> Music from ''The Quest'' and the whole of the Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler's Wells ballet, ''O.W.'', in 1972.<ref>Percival, John. \"Finding the paradox of Oscar Wilde\", ''The Times'', 23 February 1972, p. 11</ref>\n\nWalton wrote little incidental music for the theatre, his music for ''Macbeth'' (1942) being one of his most notable contributions to the genre.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1969 he wrote the music for 13 films. He arranged the ''Spitfire Prelude and Fugue'' from his own score for ''The First of the Few'' (1942). He allowed suites to be arranged from his Shakespeare film scores of the 1940s and 1950s; in these films, he mixed Elizabethan pastiche with wholly characteristic Waltonian music. Kennedy singles out for praise the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] battle sequence in ''Henry V'', where the music makes the charge of the French knights \"fearsomely real.\"<ref name=dnb/> Despite Walton's view that film music is ineffective when performed out of context, suites from several more of his film scores have been assembled since his death.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===Opera===\n[[File:Troilus-and-crysede.jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=painting of scene from classical mythology with a young woman, veiled, to the left and three men in military dress on the right|''The First Meeting of Troilus and Cressida'', by [[Warwick Goble]], 1912]]\nWalton worked for many years on his only full-length opera, ''[[Troilus and Cressida (opera)|Troilus and Cressida]]'', both before its premiere and afterwards. It has never been regarded as a success. The libretto is generally considered weak, and Walton's music, despite many passages that have won critical praise, is not dramatic enough to sustain interest.<ref name=dnb/> Grove calls the work a partially successful attempt to revivify the traditions of 19th century Italian opera in a post-war era wary of heroic Romanticism.<ref name=grove/>\n\nWalton's only other opera, ''[[The Bear (opera)|The Bear]]'', based on a comic vaudeville by [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]], is judged by critics as much more successful. It is, however, a one-act piece, a genre not regularly staged at most opera houses,<ref>White, p. 306</ref> and so is infrequently seen. [[Operabase]] records four productions of the piece worldwide between 2013 and 2015.<ref>[http://www.operabase.com/oplist.cgi?id=none&lang=en&is=&by=Walton&loc=&stype=abs&sd=4&sm=4&sy=2013&etype=abs&ed=&em=&ey= \"William Walton\"], Operabase, retrieved 4 April 2015</ref>\n\n===Chamber works===\nApart from an early experiment in [[atonal]]ism in his String Quartet (1919\u201322), which he later described as \"full of undigested [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] and Schoenberg\", Walton's major essays in chamber music are his String Quartet in A Minor (1945\u201346) and the Sonata for Violin and Piano (1947\u201349). In the opinion of Adams in ''Grove's Dictionary'', the quartet is one of Walton's supreme achievements. Earlier critics did not always share this view. In 1956 ''The Record Guide'' said, \"[T]he material is not first class and the composition as a whole seems laboured.\"<ref>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 851</ref>\n\nThe work exists also in its later expanded form as the Sonata for Strings (1971), which, the critic Trevor Harvey wrote, combines Walton in his most energetically rhythmic mood with a \"vein of lyrical tenderness which is equally characteristic and is so rewarding to listen to\".<ref>Harvey, Trevor. \"Walton, Sonata for Strings\", ''The Gramophone'', October 1973, p. 69</ref> The Violin Sonata is in two closely related movements, with strong thematic material in common.

During a 60-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include ''[[Fa\u00e7ade (entertainment)|Fa\u00e7ade]]'', the [[cantata]] ''[[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|Belshazzar's Feast]]'', the [[Viola Concerto (Walton)|Viola Concerto]], the [[Symphony No. 1 (Walton)|First Symphony]], and the [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation anthems]] [[Crown Imperial (march)|''Crown Imperial'']] and ''[[Orb and Sceptre]]''.\n\nBorn in [[Oldham]], [[Lancashire]], the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary [[The Sitwells|Sitwell]] siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with [[Edith Sitwell]], ''Fa\u00e7ade'', which at first brought him notoriety as a [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], but later became a popular ballet score.\n\nIn middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his wife [[Susana, Lady Walton|Susana]] on the Italian island of [[Ischia]]. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, ''[[Troilus and Cressida (opera)|Troilus and Cressida]]'', was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.\n\nWalton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Christ Church (Oxford).jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Exterior of large neo-classical building with extensive lawns in front of it|[[Christ Church, Oxford]], where Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate]]\nWalton was born into a musical family in [[Oldham]], [[Lancashire]], the second son of three boys and a girl of Louisa Maria (''n\u00e9e'' Turner), a singer before her marriage,<ref>Kennedy, p. 5</ref> and Charles Alexander Walton, a musician who had trained at the [[Royal Northern College of Music|Royal Manchester College of Music]] under [[Charles Hall\u00e9]], and made a living as a singing teacher and church organist.\n\nWalton's musical talents were spotted when he was still a young boy and he took piano and violin lessons, though he never mastered either instrument.

He had composed the first three of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor [[Hamilton Harty]]. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work.

As with his film music, the composer was inclined to dismiss the musical importance of his work on the programme.<ref>Kennedy, p. 120</ref>\n\nApart from these commissions, Walton's wartime works of any magnitude comprised incidental music for [[John Gielgud]]'s 1942 production of ''[[Macbeth]]''; two scores for the [[Royal Ballet|Sadler's Wells Ballet]], ''[[The Wise Virgins]]'', based on the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.

While there, Walton worked on projects that had been in his mind for some time. In 1939 he had been planning a substantial chamber work, a string quartet, but he set it aside while composing his wartime film scores. In early 1945 he turned again to the quartet. Walton was conscious that Britten, with ''[[Les Illuminations]]'' (1940), the ''[[Sinfonia da Requiem]]'' (1942), and ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' in 1945, had produced a series of substantial works, while Walton had produced no major composition since the Violin Concerto in 1939.<ref>Kennedy, p. 130</ref> Among English critics and audiences, the Violin Concerto was not at first rated one of Walton's finest works. Because Heifetz had bought the exclusive rights to play the concerto for two years, it was not heard in Britain until 1941. The London premiere, with a less famous soloist, and in the unflattering acoustics of the [[Royal Albert Hall]], did not immediately reveal the work as a masterpiece.<ref>\"The New Concerto\", ''The Times'', 7 November 1941, p. 6</ref> The String Quartet in A minor, premiered in May 1947, was Walton's most substantial work of the 1940s.

To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in [[Buenos Aires]] later that year.{{refn|\n\nOther British delegates were [[Eric Coates]] and [[A.

At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding took place in [[Buenos Aires]] in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of [[Ischia]], and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 75, 140, 143, 144 and 208</ref>\n\nWalton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera ''[[Troilus and Cressida (opera)|Troilus and Cressida]]''. On the advice of the BBC, he invited [[Christopher Hassall]] to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist.<ref>Kennedy, p. 145</ref> Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was [[knight]]ed. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of ''Fa\u00e7ade'', which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of [[Elizabeth II]] he was again called on to write a coronation march, ''[[Orb and Sceptre]]''; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the ''[[Te Deum]]'' for the occasion.<ref>Wilkinson, pp. 27\u201328</ref>\n\n''Troilus and Cressida'' was presented at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did [[Henry Moore]] who had agreed to design the production; [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], for whom the role of Cressida had been written, refused to perform it; her replacement, [[Magda L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], had difficulty mastering the English words; and Sargent, the conductor, \"did not seem well acquainted with the score\".<ref>Kennedy, pp. 174\u2013180</ref><ref>Reid, p. 383</ref> The premiere had a friendly reception, but there was a general feeling that Hassall and Walton had written an old-fashioned opera in an outmoded tradition.<ref>Kennedy, p. 181</ref> The piece was subsequently staged in [[San Francisco]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Milan]] during the next year, but failed to make a positive impression, and did not enter the regular operatic repertory.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 181\u201382</ref>\n\n[[File:Veduta di Forio.JPG|thumb|left|300px|alt=view from hilltop garden across small town to the sea|The view from the Waltons' house on [[Ischia]]]]\nIn 1956 Walton sold his London house and took up full-time residence on Ischia.

Such convenient categorizations ignore the expressive variety of his music and slight his determination to deepen his technical and expressive resources as he grew older. His early discovery of the basic elements of his style allowed him to assimilate successfully an astonishing number of disparate and apparently contradictory influences, such as [[Anglican]] anthems, jazz, and the music of Stravinsky, Sibelius, [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] and Elgar.<ref name=grove/>}}\n\nThe writer adds that Walton's allegiance to his basic style never wavered and that this loyalty to his own vision, together with his rhythmic vitality, sensuous melancholy, sly charm and orchestral flair, gives Walton's finest music \"an imperishable glamour\".<ref name=grove/> Another biographer of Walton, Neil Tierney, writes that although contemporary critics felt that the post-war music did not match Walton's pre-war compositions, it has become clear that the later works are \"if emotionally less direct, more profound.\"<ref name=dnba/>\n\n===Orchestral music===\n\n====Overtures and short orchestral pieces====\n[[File:Scapino-balli-di-sfessani.jpg|thumb|150px|right|alt=caricature of seventeen century man in full length right profile|[[Jacques Callot]]'s etching inspired Walton's ''Scapino'' overture]]\n[[File:Paul Hindemith 1923.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Paul Hindemith]], who premiered Walton's Viola Concerto]]\nWalton's first work for full orchestra, ''Portsmouth Point'' (1925), inspired by a Rowlandson print of the same name, depicts a rumbustious dockside scene (in Kennedy's phrase, \"the sailors of [[H.M.S.

Each opens reflectively, is in three movements, and contrasts agitated and jagged passages with warmer romantic sections.<ref name=grove/> The Cello Concerto is more introspective than the two earlier concertos, with a ticking rhythm throughout the work suggesting the inexorable passage of time.<ref name=grove/>\n\nThe two symphonies are strongly contrasted with one another. The First is on a large scale, reminiscent at times of Sibelius.<ref>Cardus, Neville. \"William Walton's First Symphony\". ''The Manchester Guardian'', 7 November 1935, p. 10</ref> Grove says of the work that its \"orgiastic power, coruscating malice, sensuous desolation and extroverted swagger\" make the symphony a tribute to Walton's tenacity and inventive facility.<ref name=grove/> Critics have always differed on whether the finale lives up to the rest of the work.<ref name=evans/><ref>Cox, p. 193</ref> In comparison with the First, the Second Symphony struck many reviewers as lightweight, and, as with many of Walton's works of the 1950s, it was regarded as old fashioned. It is a very different kind of work from the First Symphony. David Cox describes it as \"more a ''[[divertimento]]'' than a symphony ... highly personal, unmistakably Walton throughout\",<ref>Cox, p. 195</ref> and Kennedy calls it \"somewhat enigmatic in mood, and a superb example of Walton's more mature, concise, and mellow post-1945 style.\"<ref name=dnb/>\n\n====Music for ballets, plays and films====\nAlthough generally a slow and perfectionist composer, Walton was capable of working quickly when necessary. Some of his stage and screen music was written to tight deadlines. He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced.\n\nOf his ballets for Sadler's Wells, ''The Wise Virgins'' (1940) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral and instrumental music by Bach.{{refn|Later in 1940 Walton further arranged the music into a six-movement suite.<ref>[[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|Lloyd-Jones, David]] (2002), liner notes to Naxos CD 8.555868.</ref>|group= n}} ''The Quest'' (1943), written in great haste, is, according to Grove, oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams.<ref name=grove/> Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire, unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of ''Fa\u00e7ade'', the music for which was expanded for full orchestra, still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original.<ref name=ocm/> Music from ''The Quest'' and the whole of the Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler's Wells ballet, ''O.W.'', in 1972.<ref>Percival, John. \"Finding the paradox of Oscar Wilde\", ''The Times'', 23 February 1972, p. 11</ref>\n\nWalton wrote little incidental music for the theatre, his music for ''Macbeth'' (1942) being one of his most notable contributions to the genre.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1969 he wrote the music for 13 films. He arranged the ''Spitfire Prelude and Fugue'' from his own score for ''The First of the Few'' (1942). He allowed suites to be arranged from his Shakespeare film scores of the 1940s and 1950s; in these films, he mixed Elizabethan pastiche with wholly characteristic Waltonian music. Kennedy singles out for praise the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] battle sequence in ''Henry V'', where the music makes the charge of the French knights \"fearsomely real.\"<ref name=dnb/> Despite Walton's view that film music is ineffective when performed out of context, suites from several more of his film scores have been assembled since his death.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===Opera===\n[[File:Troilus-and-crysede.jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=painting of scene from classical mythology with a young woman, veiled, to the left and three men in military dress on the right|''The First Meeting of Troilus and Cressida'', by [[Warwick Goble]], 1912]]\nWalton worked for many years on his only full-length opera, ''[[Troilus and Cressida (opera)|Troilus and Cressida]]'', both before its premiere and afterwards. It has never been regarded as a success. The libretto is generally considered weak, and Walton's music, despite many passages that have won critical praise, is not dramatic enough to sustain interest.<ref name=dnb/> Grove calls the work a partially successful attempt to revivify the traditions of 19th century Italian opera in a post-war era wary of heroic Romanticism.<ref name=grove/>\n\nWalton's only other opera, ''[[The Bear (opera)|The Bear]]'', based on a comic vaudeville by [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]], is judged by critics as much more successful.

In the opinion of Adams in ''Grove's Dictionary'', the quartet is one of Walton's supreme achievements. Earlier critics did not always share this view. In 1956 ''The Record Guide'' said, \"[T]he material is not first class and the composition as a whole seems laboured.\"<ref>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 851</ref>\n\nThe work exists also in its later expanded form as the Sonata for Strings (1971), which, the critic Trevor Harvey wrote, combines Walton in his most energetically rhythmic mood with a \"vein of lyrical tenderness which is equally characteristic and is so rewarding to listen to\".<ref>Harvey, Trevor. \"Walton, Sonata for Strings\", ''The Gramophone'', October 1973, p. 69</ref> The Violin Sonata is in two closely related movements, with strong thematic material in common.
