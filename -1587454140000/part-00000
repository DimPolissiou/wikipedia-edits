Major-General Ruak\u2019s first official FALINTIL appointment was at the end of 1976. From 1976 to 1979, he rose through the FALINTIL ranks in the two eastern military sectors, the Central East Sector and the Eastern Point, or the Ponta Leste Sector.  Then he became a company commander.\n\nTaur Matan Ruak and others regrouped the following day at the base of Monte Legumau (''Monte Apara'') and recommenced guerrilla operations after the collapse of the last Timorese resistance base at Matebian Mountain on 22 November 1978.

During a mission to locate survivors of the annihilation campaign, Taur Matan Ruak was captured in the Viqueque area by [[Indonesian Army]] forces on 31 March 1979. After 23 days he managed to escape and rejoin other FALINTIL forces in the mountains.\n\nIn March 1981 he was appointed Assistant Chief-of-Staff of FALINTIL, responsible for the operational command of the Eastern Sectors and later the Central Sector.  Taur Matan Ruak was promoted and made responsible for strategic planning of commando operations in the Eastern sector in March 1983.  Between 1984 and 1986 Brigadier Ruak was transferred and served as military adviser for commando operations in the Western Sector. After nearly 10 years of operational experience he was promoted to Deputy Chief-of-Staff.  After 1986, he was responsible for all commando operations throughout East Timor.\n\nIn November 1992, Commander-in-Chief [[Xanana Gusm\u00e3o]] was captured in [[Dili]]. Taur Matan Ruak was promoted to Chief-of-Staff. Ruak became the Commander of FALINTIL after the death of Commander Konis Santana on 11 March 1998.

Made of [[calcite]], with painted wooden heads. Circa 990\u2013969 BC. On display at the [[British Museum]].]]\n'''Canopic jars''' were used by the [[ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptians]] during the mummification process to store and preserve the [[organ (anatomy)|viscera]] of their owner for the [[afterlife]]. They were commonly either carved from [[limestone]] or were made of pottery.<ref name=s59>Shaw and Nicholson, p. 59</ref> These jars were used by the ancient Egyptians from the time of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] until the time of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] or the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Period]], by which time the viscera were simply wrapped and placed with the body.<ref>Spencer, p. 115</ref> The viscera were not kept in a single canopic jar: each jar was reserved for specific organs. The name \"canopic\" reflects the mistaken association by early Egyptologists with the Greek legend of [[Canopus (mythology)|Canopus]] - the boat captain of Menelaus on the [[Trojan_War|voyage to Troy]] - \"who was buried at Canopus in the Delta where he was worshiped in the form of a jar\".<ref>David, p. 152</ref>\n\nCanopic jars of the Old Kingdom were rarely inscribed and had a plain lid. In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] inscriptions became more usual, and the lids were often in the form of  human heads. By the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth dynasty]] each of the four lids depicted one of the four sons of [[Horus]], as guardians of the organs.\n\n==Use and design==\n[[Image:Egyptian - A Complete Set of Canopic Jars - Walters 41171, 41172, 41173, 41174 - Group.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Complete set of canopic jars, {{circa}} 900 and {{circa}} 800 BC<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= https://art.thewalters.org/detail/77403\n |title= A Complete Set of Canopic Jars}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]]\nThe canopic jars were four in number, each for the safekeeping of particular human organs: the stomach, intestines, lungs, and liver, all of which, it was believed, would be needed in the afterlife. There was no jar for the heart: the Egyptians believed it to be the seat of the soul, and so it was left inside the body.{{refn|In the afterlife, it was believed, the heart would be weighed against the feather of Ma'at (truth) by the god [[Anubis]].<ref>[https://www.egypt.swansea.ac.uk/index.php/collection/139-w1982-weighing.htm Weighing Of The Heart Scene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221752/https://www.egypt.swansea.ac.uk/index.php/collection/139-w1982-weighing.htm |date=2013-12-17 }}, Swansea University: W1912, accessed 18 November 2011</ref> If it was too heavy from bad deeds it would be fed to a monster that was believed to be part lion, part hippopotamus, and part crocodile [[Ammit]].|group= n}}\n\nMany Old Kingdom canopic jars were found empty and damaged, even in undisturbed tombs. Therefore it seems that they were never used as containers. Instead, it seems that they were part of burial rituals and were placed after these rituals, empty.<ref>Lucie Jir\u00e1skov\u00e1: ''Damage and repairs of the Old Kingdom canopic jars \u2013 the case at Abusir.''

In the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] the jars had plain lids, though by the [[First Intermediate Period]] jars with human heads (assumed to represent the dead) began to appear.<ref name=s59/> Sometimes the covers of the jars were modeled after (or painted to resemble) the head of [[Anubis]], the god of death and embalming. By the late [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]] canopic jars had come to feature the [[four sons of Horus]].<ref>Shaw and Nicholson, p. 60</ref> Many sets of jars survive from this period, in alabaster, aragonite, calcareous stone, and blue or green glazed porcelain.<ref name=b240/> The sons of Horus were also the gods of the cardinal compass points.<ref>Murray, p. 123</ref> Each god was responsible for protecting a particular organ and was himself protected by a companion goddess. They were:\n* Hapi, the baboon-headed god representing the North, whose jar contained the lungs and was protected by the goddess [[Nephthys]]. Hapi is often used interchangeably with the Nile god [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]], though they are actually different gods.\n* [[Duamutef]], the jackal-headed god representing the East, whose jar contained the stomach and was protected by the goddess [[Neith]]\n* [[Imsety]], the human-headed god representing the South, whose jar contained the liver and was protected by the goddess [[Isis]]\n* [[Qebehsenuef]], the falcon-headed god representing the West, whose jar contained the intestines and was protected by the goddess [[Serqet]].<ref>Gadalla, p. 78</ref>\n\nEarly canopic jars were placed inside a [[canopic chest]] and buried in tombs together with the sarcophagus of the dead.<ref name=b240/>  Later, they were sometimes arranged in rows beneath the bier, or at the four corners of the chamber.<ref name=b240/> After the early periods there were usually inscriptions on the outsides of the jars, sometimes quite long and complex.<ref name=b242>Budge, p. 242</ref> The scholar [[E. A. Wallis Budge|Sir Ernest Budge]] quoted an inscription from the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sa\u00efte]] or [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] period that begins: \"Thy bread is to thee. Thy beer is to thee. Thou livest upon that on which [[Ra]] lives.\" Other inscriptions tell of purification in the afterlife.<ref>Budge, p. 245</ref>\n\nIn the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] and later, dummy canopic jars were introduced. Improved embalming techniques allowed the viscera to remain in the body; the traditional jars remained a feature of tombs, but were no longer hollowed out for storage of the organs.<ref>[https://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/canopic.html \"Canopic Jars\"], {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118054218/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/canopic.html |date=2013-01-18 }} ''Digital Egypt for Universities'', [[University College London]], accessed 18 November 2011</ref>\n\nCopious numbers of the jars were produced, and surviving examples of them can be seen in museums around the world.\n\n[[File:Canopic Jar Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|Canopic jar, {{circa}} 1353\u20131336 BC]]\n[[File:Museo etrusco chianciano urne.jpg|thumb|right|Etruscan canopic jars]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Jar burial]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=24em}}\n===References===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | last= Budge | first= Sir Edward Wallis | year= 2010| origyear=1925| title= The mummy; a handbook of Egyptian funerary archaeology | location= New York | publisher= Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-1-108-01825-8}}\n* {{cite book | last= David | first= A.
