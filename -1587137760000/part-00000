''The Power of Blast'' closed in fall 2002 to make room for ''[[Disney's Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular]]''. Inspired by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] 1992 animated film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', the show premiered in January 2003.\n\nIn spring 2010 it was initially announced that ''Disney's Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular'' would close and be replaced by ''[[Toy Story: The Musical]]''.

The [[Federal government of the United States|American]] colonial government and subsequently the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government]] pursued a policy of migration by resettling significant numbers of Christian Filipino settlers from the [[Visayas]] and [[Luzon]] onto tracts of land in Mindanao, beginning in the 1920s. This policy allowed Christian Filipinos to outnumber both the Moro and [[Lumad]] populations by the 1970s, which was a contributing factor in aggravating grievances between the Moro and Filipino Christian settlers as disputes over land increased. Another grievance by the Moro people is the extraction of Mindanao's natural resources by the [[Government of the Philippines|central government]] whilst many Moros continued to live in poverty.<ref name=Case>[http://manoa.hawaii.edu/ccpv/assets/docs/CCPV%20-%20The%20Bangsamoro%20Struggle%20for%20Self-Determination%20-%20A%20Case%20Study%20-%20By%20Caecilia%20Noble.pdf The Bangsamoro Struggle for Self-Determintation: A Case Study]</ref>\n\nThe Philippine government under [[Ferdinand Marcos]] encouraged [[Hiligaynon people|Ilonggo]] settlers who had emigrated to Mindanao to form a militia, which was eventually called the Ilaga. There is anecdotal evidence that the Ilaga often committed human rights abuses by targeting the Moro and Lumad peoples, as well as attempting to seize additional territory. The end result of Ilaga extremism is the lingering animosity between Moro and Christian communities. Mistrust and a cycle of violence are still felt today due to the creation of the Ilaga.<ref name=Case/>\n\n==History==\n\nFrom March 1970 to January 1972, the Ilaga committed 22 massacres resulting in the deaths of hundreds of [[Muslim]] civilians. The group is guilty of \"mutilat[ing] bodies of victims\" and \"marking bodies with a [[Christian cross|cross]].\" The group also burned down and looted many houses and properties.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Majul|first1=Cesar Adib|title=The Contemporary Muslim Movement in the Philippines|date=2015|publisher=BookBaby|isbn=9781483555584|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0d5eDQAAQBAJ|accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Manili massacre===\n{{main|Manili massacre}}\nViolence attributed to the Ilaga reached its climax on June 19, 1971 with the Manili massacre of 70<ref name=\"pcijMindanaoMemoryOfMassacres\" />-79<ref name=Arguillas>{{cite news | last = Arguillas | first =Carolyn O. | title =De Lima: \"Oooops, sorry, it's Ampatuan Massacre not Maguindanao Massacre | publisher =MindaNews | date = 28 January 2010 | url =http://minda2010.timonera.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7546:-de-lima-oooops-sorry-its-ampatuan-massacre-not-maguindanao-massacre&catid=3:news&Itemid=50 | accessdate = 23 May 2016}}</ref> [[Moro people|Moro Muslims]] in a [[mosque]] in Manili, [[Carmen, Cotabato|Carmen]], [[North Cotabato]].<ref name=\"lar\">{{cite book | last =Larousse | first =William  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=qyo-Hti0-KAC&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=manili+massacre&source=bl&ots=s7kDGRWP_S&sig=07Hv__FHewh5pCDBc2_82lNF0pU&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=manili%20massacre&f=false | title = A Local Church Living for Dialogue: Muslim-Christian Relations in Mindanao-Sulu, Philippines 1965-2000| publisher =Gregorian Biblical BookShop | year =2001 | pages =136 | isbn =8876528792 }}</ref> The Muslim residents of the town had gathered in their mosque to participate in a supposed peace talk with [[Christians|Christian]] groups when a group of armed men dressed in uniforms similar to those worn by members of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] opened fire on them.<ref name=\"lar\"/>\n\n===1971 Battle of Lanao del Norte===\n\nFollowing the massacre at Manili, many [[Maranao people|Maranao]] Muslims fled to take shelter in the [[Lanao del Norte]].

The Ilagas also clashed with the Philippine Constabulary.

The [[Federal government of the United States|American]] colonial government and subsequently the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government]] pursued a policy of migration by resettling significant numbers of Christian Filipino settlers from the [[Visayas]] and [[Luzon]] onto tracts of land in Mindanao, beginning in the 1920s. This policy allowed Christian Filipinos to outnumber both the Moro and [[Lumad]] populations by the 1970s, which was a contributing factor in aggravating grievances between the Moro and Filipino Christian settlers as disputes over land increased. Another grievance by the Moro people is the extraction of Mindanao's natural resources by the [[Government of the Philippines|central government]] whilst many Moros continued to live in poverty.<ref name=Case>[http://manoa.hawaii.edu/ccpv/assets/docs/CCPV%20-%20The%20Bangsamoro%20Struggle%20for%20Self-Determination%20-%20A%20Case%20Study%20-%20By%20Caecilia%20Noble.pdf The Bangsamoro Struggle for Self-Determintation: A Case Study]</ref>\n\nThe Philippine government under [[Ferdinand Marcos]] encouraged [[Hiligaynon people|Ilonggo]] settlers who had emigrated to Mindanao to form a militia, which was eventually called the Ilaga. There is anecdotal evidence that the Ilaga often committed human rights abuses by targeting the Moro and Lumad peoples, as well as attempting to seize additional territory. The end result of Ilaga extremism is the lingering animosity between Moro and Christian communities. Mistrust and a cycle of violence are still felt today due to the creation of the Ilaga.<ref name=Case/>\n\n==History==\n\nFrom March 1970 to January 1972, the Ilaga committed 22 massacres resulting in the deaths of hundreds of [[Muslim]] civilians.
