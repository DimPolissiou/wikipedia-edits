He departed in 1973 to record a number of solo albums, coining the term \"ambient music\" to describe his work on releases such as ''[[Another Green World]]'' (1975) and ''[[Music for Airports]]'' (1978). He also collaborated with artists such as [[Robert Fripp]], [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], [[Harold Budd]], [[David Bowie]], and [[David Byrne]], and [[music producer|produced]] albums by artists including [[John Cale]], [[Jon Hassell]], [[Laraaji]], [[Talking Heads]] and [[Devo]], and the [[no wave]] compilation ''[[No New York]]'' (1978).

Initially Eno did not appear on stage at their live shows, but operated the [[mixing console|mixing desk]], processing the band's sound with a [[VCS3]] synthesiser and tape recorders, and singing [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]]. He did, however, eventually appear on stage as a performing member of the group, usually flamboyantly costumed.

''Tiger Mountain'' contains the galloping \"Third Uncle\", one of Eno's best-known songs, owing in part to its later being covered by [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[801 (band)|801]]. Critic [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] writes that the song is \"a near punk attack of riffing guitars and clattering percussion, 'Third Uncle' could, in other hands, be a heavy metal anthem, albeit one whose lyrical content would tongue-tie the most slavish air guitarist.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t821132|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music review |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThese four albums were remastered and reissued in 2004 by [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]'s [[Astralwerks]] label. Due to Eno's decision not to add any extra tracks of the original material, a handful of tracks originally issued as singles have not been reissued, including the single mix of \"King's Lead Hat\", the title of which is an [[anagram]] of \"[[Talking Heads]]\", whilst \"Seven Deadly Finns\" and \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" were included on the [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] ''Eno Box II: Vocal''.\n\nDuring this period, Eno also played three dates with [[Phil Manzanera]] in the band [[801 (band)|801]], a \"[[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]\" that performed more or less reworked selections from albums by Eno, Manzanera, and [[Quiet Sun (band)|Quiet Sun]], as well as covers of songs by [[The Beatles]] (\"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\") and [[The Kinks]] (\"[[You Really Got Me]]\").\n\nIn 1967, Eno developed a [[delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] system. The technique involved two [[Revox]] tape recorders set up side by side, with the tape unspooling from the first deck being carried over to the second deck to be spooled.  This enabled sound recorded on the first deck to be played back by the second deck at a time delay that varied with the distance between the two decks and the speed of the tape (typically a few seconds). Working with [[Robert Fripp]] (from [[King Crimson]]) the pair used this system in their collaboration ''[[(No Pussyfooting)]]'' (1973).<ref name=\"BBCEquatorialStars\">{{cite web|title = BBC \u2013 Experimental Review \u2013 Fripp Eno, The Equatorial Stars | publisher = BBC| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/qqzf/ |date=5 July 2004|author=Marsh, Peter|accessdate = 8 June 2008 }}</ref> Subsequently, Fripp referred to this method as \"[[Frippertronics]]\". In 1975, Fripp and Eno released a second album, ''[[Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)|Evening Star]]'', and played several live shows in Europe.\n\nEno was a prominent member of the performance art-classical orchestra the [[Portsmouth Sinfonia]]&nbsp;\u2013 having started playing clarinet with them in 1972. In 1973, he produced the orchestra's first album ''The Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics'' (released in March 1974) and in 1974, he produced the live album ''Hallelujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall'', a recording of their infamous May 1974 concert (released in October 1974). In addition to producing both albums, Eno performed in the orchestra on both recordings playing the clarinet. Eno also deployed the orchestra's famously dissonant string section on his second solo album ''Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)''. The orchestra at this time included other musicians whose solo work he would subsequently release on his Obscure label including [[Gavin Bryars]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. That year he also composed music for the album ''[[Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy]]'', with [[Kevin Ayers]], to accompany the poet [[Lady June|June Campbell Cramer]].\n\n==== Ambient music ====\n{{Main|Ambient music}}\nEno's continuing solo career saw the release of a number of highly eclectic and increasingly [[ambient music|ambient]] [[electronic music|electronic]] and acoustic albums. He coined the term \"ambient music\",<ref>{Prendergast, ''The Ambient Century'': p.93}</ref> which is designed to modify the listener's perception of the surrounding environment. In the liner notes accompanying [[Ambient 1: Music for Airports]] Eno explains: \"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\"<ref>{(PVC7908(AMB001)}</ref>\n\nIn January 1975, Eno was hit by a taxi while crossing the street and spent several weeks recuperating at home. His girlfriend brought him an old record of harp music, which he lay down to listen to. He realised he had set the amplifier to a very low volume and one channel of the stereo was not working, but lacked the energy to correct it. \"This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music \u2013 as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and sound of the rain were parts of the ambience.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/how-brian-eno-created-a-quiet-revolution-in-music/|title=How Brian Eno created a quiet revolution in music|work=The Telegraph|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nEno's first work of ambient music, 1975's ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (again created via an elaborate tape-delay methodology, that Eno diagrammed on the back cover of the LP), is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his ''Ambient'' series: (''[[Music for Airports]] (Ambient 1);'' ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]] (Ambient 2)'' featuring Harold Budd on Keyboards, ''[[Day of Radiance]] (Ambient 3)'' with the American composer [[Laraaji]] playing [[zither]] and [[hammered dulcimer]], and ''[[On Land]] (Ambient 4)'').\n\nIn 1975, Eno appeared as the Wolf in a rock version of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s classic ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''. Produced by [[Robin Lumley]] and [[Jack Lancaster]], the album featured [[Gary Moore]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Stephane Grapelli]], [[Chris Spedding]], [[Cozy Powell]], [[Jon Hiseman]], [[Bill Bruford]], and [[Alvin Lee]]. Also in 1975, Eno provided synthesisers and treatments on [[Quiet Sun]]'s album ''Mainstream'' alongside [[Phil Manzanera]], [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]], Dave Jarrett, and [[Bill MacCormick]], and he performed on and contributed songs and vocals to Manzanera's ''[[Diamond Head (Phil Manzanera album)|Diamond Head]]'' album.\n\nIn September 1976, Eno recorded with the [[Krautrock|Krautrock/Kosmische Musik]] group [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]] at their studio in [[Forst, Lower Saxony|Forst]], Germany. This material was not released until 1997 as ''[[Tracks and Traces]]'' by Harmonia '76. It was again reissued in 2009 with additional tracks and credited to Harmonia & Eno '76. Further collaborations with 'Krautrock' musicians including Hans Roedelius and Dieter Moebius saw the release of [[Cluster & Eno]] (1977) and [[After the Heat]] (1978).\n\nFrom 1977 to 1979, Eno collaborated with David Bowie on Bowie's \"Berlin Trilogy\" (''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'', and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''), and from 1978 to 1980 with Talking Heads (''[[More Songs About Buildings and Food]]'', ''[[Fear of Music]]'', and ''[[Remain in Light]]'').\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1980, Eno provided a film score for [[Herbert Vesely]]'s ''[[Egon Schiele \u2013 Exzess und Bestrafung]]'', also known as ''Egon Schiele \u2013 Excess and Punishment''. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for an historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death.\n\nBefore Eno made ''On Land,'' [[Robert Quine]] played him [[Miles Davis]]' \"[[Get Up With It|He Loved Him Madly]]\" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for ''On Land,'' \"Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the \"spacious\" quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film ''Amarcord'', it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/onland-txt.html |title=''Ambient 4: On Land'' 1986 release notes |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980 to 1981, during which time Eno travelled to [[Ghana]] for a festival of West African music, he was collaborating with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] of [[Talking Heads]]. Their album [[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'']], was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected whilst living in the [[United States]], along with sampled music recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and [[Middle East]]ern rhythms.\n\nIn 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, [[Roger Eno]], and [[Daniel Lanois]] on the album ''[[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks]]'' that had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film ''[[For All Mankind]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite news|first1=John L.|last1=Walters|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Pop review: Brian Eno's Apollo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/22/brian-eno-apollo-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Brian Eno explains Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/08/apollo-11-moon-brian-eno|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/soundtrack|title=Trainspotting (1996)|accessdate=16 January 2018|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nIn September 1992, Eno released ''[[Nerve Net]]'', an album utilising heavily syncopated rhythms with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, [[Benmont Tench]], [[Robert Quine]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]. This album was a last-minute substitution for ''My Squelchy Life'', which contained more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20032-brian-eno-nerve-netthe-shutov-assemblynerolithe-drop/|title=Brian Eno: Nerve Net/The Shutov Assembly/Neroli/The Drop Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> Several tracks from ''My Squelchy Life'' later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set ''Eno Box II: Vocals,'' and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded re-release of ''Nerve Net.'' Eno also released ''[[The Shutov Assembly]]'' in 1992, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces [[atonality]] and abandons most conventional concepts of [[Mode (music)|modes]], [[Scale (music)|scales]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Emancipated from the constant attraction towards the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] that underpins the Western [[tonal music|tonal tradition]], the gradually shifting music originally eschewed any conventional instrumentation, save for treated keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/me_intr3.html#q2|title=Brian Eno interviewed by Michael Engelbrecht|website=Music.hyperreal.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, Eno worked increasingly with self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called [[generative music]]. This allows the listener to hear music that slowly unfolds in almost infinite non-repeating combinations of sound.<ref>The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music pp118-119 Ed. Nick Collins ({{ISBN|9780521688659}})</ref> In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including ''[[I Dormienti]] (The Sleepers)'', ''[[Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace \u2013 The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg|Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace]],'' ''[[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]],'' ''[[The Quiet Room]],'' and ''Music for Prague.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/music-time-and-long-term-thinking-brian-eno-expands-the-vocabulary-of-human-feeling-98e0fbad5950|title=Brian Eno Expands the Vocabulary of Human Feeling|first=The Long Now|last=Foundation|date=30 November 2017|website=Medium.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of [[U2]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and several other artists in a group called Passengers. They produced the 1995 album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]],'' which reached No. 76 on the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and No. 12 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It featured a single, \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", which reached number 6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/miss%20sarajevo/|title=miss+sarajevo {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book ''[[A Year with Swollen Appendices]],'' a diary published in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115288/fullcredits|title=Neverwhere (TV Mini-Series 1996\u2013 )|accessdate=8 December 2017|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2004, Fripp and Eno recorded another ambient music collaboration album, ''[[The Equatorial Stars]]''.\n\nEno returned in June 2005 with ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'', his first major album since ''[[Wrong Way Up]]'' (with [[John Cale]]) to prominently feature vocals (a trend he continued with ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]''). The album differs from his 1970s solo work due to the impact technological advances on musical production, evident in its semi-electronic production.\n\nIn early 2006, Eno collaborated with David Byrne again, for the reissue of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6382-david-byrne/\n| title = Interview: David Byrne\n| last = Dahlen\n| first = Chris\n| date = 17 July 2006\n| work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>\nAn unusual interactive marketing strategy was employed for its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the [[multitrack recording|multi-tracks]] of two songs from the album, \"A Secret Life\" and \"Help Me Somebody\". This allowed listeners to [[remix]] and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website for others to listen and rate them.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno Profile Long Now Foundation 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Eno at the [[Long Now Foundation]], 26 June 2006]]\nIn late 2006, Eno released ''[[77 Million Paintings]]'', a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77 million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of \"77 Million Paintings\" featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]], San Francisco, California, [[Annabeth Robinson]] (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated ''77 Million Paintings'' in [[Second Life]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Author|first=Unknown|title=77-million-paintings-brian-eno|url=http://longnow.org/events/02007/jun/29/77-million-paintings-brian-eno/|work=77 Million Paintings|publisher=The Long Now Foundation|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Eno's music was featured in a [[Ecstasy (2007 film)|movie adaption]] of [[Irvine Welsh]]'s best-selling collection ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''. He also appeared playing keyboards in ''[[Voila (album)|Voila]]'', [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s solo album sung entirely in French.\n\nAlso in 2007, Eno contributed a composition titled \"Grafton Street\" to [[Dido (singer)|Dido's]] third album, ''[[Safe Trip Home]]'', released in November 2008.<ref name=\"qmag\">Aizlewood, John.

He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 [[BRIT Awards]].\n\nEno describes himself as a \"non-musician\", using the term \"treatments\" to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist.

His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on [[Genesis (band)|Genesis's]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', he is credited with 'Enossification'; on [[Robert Wyatt]]'s ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'' with a ''Direct inject anti-jazz raygun'' and on [[John Cale]]'s [[Island Records|Island]] albums as simply being \"Eno\".\n\nEno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as [[Nico]], Robert Calvert, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Zvuki Mu]], in various capacities such as use of his studio/synthesiser/electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and as just being 'Eno'. In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the \"Prophecy Theme\" for the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''; the rest of the [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was composed and performed by the group [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. Eno produced performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]]'s ''[[Bright Red]]'' album, and also composed for it.

In 1995, U2 and Eno joined forces to create the album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]'' under the group name Passengers; songs from which included \"[[Your Blue Room]]\" and \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\".  Even though films are listed and described for each song, all but three are bogus.

It was recorded in Morocco, the South of France and [[Dublin]] and released in Europe on 27 February 2009.\n\nIn 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed \"enoxification\" and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'', released on 24 October of that year.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno's musical web.jpg|thumb|Eno's connections to other progressive rock music artists]]\n\n===The Microsoft Sound===\nIn 1994, [[Microsoft]] designers [[Mark Malamud]] and Erik Gavriluk approached Eno to compose music for the [[Windows 95]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/intel-microsoft-research-in-motion-apple/5/25/2010/id/28465?refresh=1|title=Who Created The Windows Start-Up Sound?|last=Rohrlich|first=Justin|date=25 May 2010|work=[[Minyanville]]'s Wall Street|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> The result was the six-second [[Booting|start-up]] music-sound of the Windows 95 [[operating system]], \"The Microsoft Sound\".

He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, that would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:\n\n\"One afternoon while I was working in the studio with [[Talking Heads]], the roadie from [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic.\"<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). ''77 Million Paintings'' \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref>\n\nThe [[Panasonic]] industrial camera Eno received had significant [[design flaws]] preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref> The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as ''Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan'' (1980) and ''[[Thursday Afternoon]]'' (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained the genre title in the music magazine NME:\n\n\"I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting... I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/nme85.html#Thursday |title=NME: Proxy Music |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |date=9 November 1985 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThese works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 5.</ref>\n\nEno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and informing his generative works such as [[77 Million Paintings]] in 2006.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 6\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Generative music===\nEno gives the example of [[wind chime]]s. He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: \"I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like [[Terry Riley]], and when I first started playing with tape recorders.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/appsblog/2012/sep/26/brian-eno-scape-ipad-apps|title=Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers talk Scape, iPad apps and generative music|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=3 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nInitially Eno began to experiment with tape loops to create [[generative music]] systems. With the advent of CDs he developed systems to make music of indeterminate duration using several discs of material that he'd specifically recorded so that they would work together musically when driven by random playback.\n\nIn 1995, he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music through utilising programmed algorithms. The collaboration with Intermorphic led Eno to release ''Generative Music 1'' - which requires Intermorphic's ''Koan Player'' software for PC. The Koan software made it possible for generative music to be experienced in the domestic environment for the first time.\n\n====Generative Music 1====\nIn 1996, Eno collaborated in developing the SSEYO [[Koan (program)|Koan]] generative music software system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing ''Generative Music 1''\u2014only playable on the Koan generative music system. Further music releases using Koan software include: ''Wander'' (2001) and ''Dark Symphony'' (2007)\u2014both include works by Eno, and those of other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole).\n\n====Released excerpts====\nEno started to release excerpts of results from his 'generative music' systems as early as 1975 with the album ''Discreet Music''. Then again in 1978 with ''Music for Airports'':\n\n{{Quote|text=Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable \u2013 they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system. |author=Brian Eno |source=Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html|title=Generative Music \u2013 Brian Eno \u2013 In Motion Magazine|website=Inmotionmagazine.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe list below consists of albums, soundtracks and downloadable files that contain excerpts from some of Eno's generative music explorations:\n{{div col}}\n\n* 1970 \u2013 Berlin Horse [Film Short]\n* 1975 \u2013 Discreet Music\n* 1975 \u2013 Evening Star (Fripp & Eno)\n* 1978 \u2013 Ambient 1: Music For Airports\n* 1981 \u2013 Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan [Installation Video]\n* 1982 \u2013 Ambient 4: On Land\n* 1983 \u2013 Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1983 \u2013 Music For Films II (Eno, Lanois & R Eno) [exclusive to 'Working Backwards' Box Set]\n* 1984 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon [Installation Video]\n* 1985 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon\n* 1988 \u2013 Music For Films III (Various Artists)\n* 1989 \u2013 Textures (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1989 \u2013 For All Mankind [Documentary Soundtrack]\n* 1992 \u2013 The Shutov Assembly\n* 1993 \u2013 Neroli (Thinking Music Part IV)\n* 1994 \u2013 Glitterbug [Original Soundtrack]\n* 1996 \u2013 Neverwhere [BBC TV Mini-Series Soundtrack]\n* 1997 \u2013 Contra 1.2\n* 1997 \u2013 Lightness\n* 1998 \u2013 Music for Prague\n* 1999 \u2013 I Dormienti\n* 1999 \u2013 Kite Stories\n* 2000 \u2013 Music For Civic Recovery Centre\n* 2001 \u2013 Compact Forest Proposal\n* 2003 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume I\n* 2004 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume II\n* 2012 \u2013 Lux\n* 2013 \u2013 CAM [Web \u2013 the book 'Brian Eno: Visual Music' includes a Download Code]\n* 2014 \u2013 The Shutov Bonus Material ['Shutov Assembly' Bonus CD]\n* 2014 \u2013 New Space Music ['Neroli' Bonus CD]\n* 2016 \u2013 The Ship\n* 2016 \u2013 Reflection\n* 2017 \u2013 Sisters [Web Download]\n* 2018 \u2013 Music for Installations [Box Set]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.enoshop.co.uk/BrianEnoMusicForInstallations | title=Brian Eno Releases 'Music for Installations' on May 4th (2018)|website=Enoshop.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeveral of the released excerpts (listed above) originated as, or are derivative of, soundtracks Eno created for art installations.

Ross writes in the programme notes to Matrix 44 in 1981: \"In a series of painterly video installations first shown in 1979, Eno explored the notion of environmental ambiance. Eno proposes a use for music and video that is antithetical to behavior control-oriented \"Muzak\" in that it induces and invites the viewer to enter a meditative, detached state, rather than serve as an operant conditioner for work-force efficiency. His underlying strategy is to create works which provide natural levels of variety and redundancy which bring attention to, rather than mimic, essential characteristics of the natural environment. Eno echoes Matisse's stated desire that his art serve as an armchair for the weary businessman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/44|title=BAMPFA - Art Exhibitions - Brian Eno / MATRIX 44|website=Archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired Eno to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. \"2 Fifth Avenue\", (\"a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports\") resulted from Eno shooting \"the view from his apartment window: without\u2026(any) intervention,\" recording \"what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time\u2026 In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas. \u2026 Eno manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music. Christopher Scoates pp.116-117 {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}</ref>\n\nFrom the outset, Eno's video works, were \"more in the sphere of paintings than of cinema\".<ref name=\"auto1\">My Light Years Brian Eno accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref> The author/artist [[John Coulthart]] called Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan, (1980\u201381) (which incorporated music from [[Ambient 4: On Land]]) \"The first ambient film.\" He explains: \"Eno filmed several static views of New York and its drifting cloudscape from his thirteenth-floor apartment in 1980\u201381.

The fact that this prodigious possibility had almost exclusively been used to reproduce figurative images in the service of narratives pointed to evolution of the medium from the theatre and cinema. What I thought was that this machine, which pumped out highly controllable light, was actually the first synthesizer, and that its use as an imager-retailer represented a subset of its possible range.\" <ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P121. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nTurning the TV on its back, Eno played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. \"The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence.\"<ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P122. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nCalling these light sculptures Crystals (first shown in Boston in 1983), Eno further developed them for the Pictures of Venice exhibition at Gabriella Cardazzo's Cavallino Gallery (Venice,1985). Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.<ref>My Light Years Brian Eno np accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nBy positioning sound sources in different places and different heights in the exhibition room Eno intended that the music would be something listened to from the inside rather than the outside. For the [[I Dormienti]] show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by [[Mimmo Paladino]] in the middle of the circular room, Eno placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it.\n\nEnvisioning the speakers themselves as instruments, led to Eno's 'speaker flowers' becoming a feature of many installations, including at the Museo dell' Ara Pacis (Rome, 2008), again with Mimmo Paladino and 'Speaker Flowers and Lightboxes' at [[Castello Svevo]] in Trani (Italy 2017). Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, \"sculptural objects (that) ...consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106131601/http://www.jamesputnam.org.uk/httpwww.jamesputnam.org.ukinv_exhibition_26.html] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The first version of these were shown at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]](1984).\n\nSince ''[[On Land]]'' (1982), Eno has sought to blur the boundaries between music and non-music and incorporates environmental sounds into his work. He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.<ref>''Brian Eno : Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time'',  Christopher Scoates, pp. 135-137, {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the antithesis of 20th century [[shock art]], Eno's works create environments that are: \"Envisioned as extensions of everyday life while offering a refuge from its stresses.\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music p.132 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref> Creating a space to reflect was a stated aim in Eno's Quiet Club series of installations that have shown across the world, and include [[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]] at the [[David Toop]] curated Sonic Boom festival at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2000.\n\nThe Quiet Club series (1986-2001) grew from Eno's site-specific installations that included the Place series (1985-1989). These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as \"tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks\". Eno used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.<ref>Brian Eno: Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time: Christopher Scoates pp132/136 {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nThe continually flowing non-repeating music and art of Eno's installations mitigate against [[habituation]] to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. \"One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less \"dramatic\" and more sensual.\" <ref>{Brian Eno Visual Music p.135 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}}</ref> Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. \"Compact Forest Proposal\" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: \"During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/publication/soundtracks/brian-eno/|title=Brian Eno|website=SFMOMA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Eno's work, both art and music are released from their normal constraints. The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions.<ref>The Dynamics of Harmony: Pratt. {{ISBN|9780198790204}}</ref> The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77 Million Paintings image re-configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light.\n\n====77 Million Paintings====\nDevelopments in computer technology meant that the experience of Eno's unending non-repeatable generative art and music was no longer only possible in the public spaces of his exhibitions. With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, Eno created a generative art/music installation '[[77 Million Paintings]]' for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. \"One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined\u2026\" <ref name=\"auto2\">Painting By Numbers, Nick Robertson, 77 Million Paintings HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nMost (nearly all) of the visual 'elements' were hand-painted by Eno onto glass slides, creating an organic heart to the work. Some of the slides had formed his earlier 'Natural Selections' exhibition projected onto the windows of the [[Triennale]] in Milan. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of Eno's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music The Aesthetics of Time. Christopher Scoates. ISBN P. 124</ref>\n\nFor the Triennale exhibition, Eno with Rolf Engel and Roland Blum at Atelier Marktgraph, used new 'dataton' technology that could be programmed to control the fade up and out times of the light sources.<ref>My Light Years by Brian Eno. 77 Million Paintings (accompanying booklet)HNDVD 1521</ref> But, unlike the software developed for '77 Million', this was clumsy and limited the practical realisation of Eno's vision.\n\nWith the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. Eno likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners|title=Composers as Gardeners|website=Edge.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: \"Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. \u2026The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows.\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAlthough designed for the domestic environment, 77 million paintings has been (and continues to be) exhibited in multi-screen installations across the world. It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the [[Sydney Opera House]] (2009), [[Carioca Aqueduct]] (The Arcos Di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant [[Lovell Telescope]] at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Turner asked Eno to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove. Since then 77 Million and Eno's latest \"Light Boxes\" have been commissioned for use in hospitals.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Montefiore Hospital Installations====\nIn 2013, Eno created two permanent light and sound installations at Montefiore Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-22189774|title=Brian Eno branches out into hospital work|first=Jane|last=Dreaper|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=3 May 2017|website=Bbc.com}}</ref> In the hospital's reception area \"77 Million Paintings for Montefiore\" consists of eight plasma monitors mounted on the wall in a diagonally radiating flower-like pattern. They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst Eno's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named \"Quiet Room for Montefiore\" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax.\n\n====Spore====\nEno composed most of the music for the [[Electronic Arts]] video game [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]] (2008), assisted by his long-term collaborator, the musician and programmer [[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]]. Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game.\n\n====iOS apps====\nInspired by possibilities presented to Eno and Peter Chilvers whilst working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game ''Spore'' (2008), the two began to release generative music in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App]] format. They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[iPad]]:\n\n* 2008 \u2013 [[Bloom (software)|''Bloom'']]\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Trope''\n* 2012 \u2013 ''Scape''\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Reflection''\n\nIn 2009, Peter Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill also created an App entitled ''Air'' (released through generativemusic.com as well) \u2013 based on concepts developed by Eno in his ''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'' album.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/review-brian-en.html |title=Eno and Chilvers Release Sweet Music App for iPhone &#124, Listening Post |journal=Wired |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Reflection====\nThe generative version of ''Reflection'' is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike other Apps they released ''Reflection'' provides no real options other than Play/Pause \u2013 later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price. For those who'd bought the app at a higher price, Eno and Chilvers provided links to a free download of a four track album called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration). The following appears on the app's Apple iTunes page:\n\n{{Quote|text=As a result of the Brexit-related fall in value of the British pound Apple have increased the prices of all apps sold in the UK by 25%. While we always intended REFLECTION to be a premium priced app, we feel this increase makes it too expensive, so we will take the hit in order to keep the British price to the consumer at its original level.\n\nIn other territories this decision will translate into a reduced price for the app.\n\nAs a thank you to everyone who has supported the REFLECTION app, we are adding a free surprise downloadable gift to it for a limited time. To access it, simply update REFLECTION in the App Store and follow the instructions when you open the app on your device. The download will be available until 28th February [2017].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1580788841935301|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> and the App's Apples iTunes page<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brian-eno-reflection/id1180524479?mt=8|title=Brian Eno : Reflection on the App Store|website=App Store|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nPrevious to the updates for the App, the iTunes page used the following from Eno. \n{{Quote|text=Reflection is the most recent of my Ambient experiments and represents the most sophisticated of them so far.\n\nMy original intention with Ambient music was to make endless music, music that would be there as long as you wanted it to be. I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time \u2013 'like sitting by a river': it's always the same river, but it's always changing. But recordings \u2013 whether vinyl, cassette or CD \u2013 are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. Reflection in its album form \u2013 on vinyl or CD \u2013 is like this. But the app by which Reflection is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.\n\nThe creation of a piece of music like this falls into three stages: the first is the selection of sonic materials and a musical mode \u2013 a constellation of musical relationships. These are then patterned and explored by a system of algorithms which vary and permutate the initial elements I feed into them, resulting in a constantly morphing stream (or river) of music. The third stage is listening. Once I have the system up and running I spend a long time \u2013 many days and weeks in fact \u2013 seeing what it does and fine-tuning the materials and sets of rules that run the algorithms. It's a lot like gardening: you plant the seeds and then you keep tending to them until you get a garden you like.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1516385288375657|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe version of ''Reflection'' available on the fixed formats (CD, Vinyl and download File) consists of two (joined) excerpts from the ''Reflection'' app. This was revealed in Brian's interview with Philip Sherburne:\n\n{{Quote|text=[Philip Sherburne] Given the infinite nature of the Reflection project, was it difficult to select the 54-minute chunk that became the album?\n\n[Brian Eno] Yes, it was quite interesting doing that. When you're running it as an ephemeral piece, you have quite different considerations. If there is something that is a bit doubtful or odd, you think, OK, that's just in the nature of the piece and now it's passed and we're somewhere else. Whereas if you're thinking of it as a record that people are going to listen to again and again, what philosophy do you take? Choose just a random amount of time? Could have done that. Just do several of them and fix them together? Is that faking it? These are very interesting philosophical questions.\n\n[Philip Sherburne] Which approach did you follow?\n\n[Brian Eno] A hybrid approach. I generated 11 pieces of the length I'd set the piece to be and I had them all in my iTunes on random shuffle, so I would be listening at night, doing other things, and as one ran through, I would think, That was a nice one, I particularly like the second half. So then I would make a note. I did this for quite a few evenings. There were two that I really liked. On one, the last 40 minutes of it were lovely, and on another, the first 25 minutes of it were really nice. So I thought, This is a studio, I'm making a record. I'll edit them together! It was like the birth of rock'n'roll. I'm allowed to do that! It's not cheating. It was quite a bit of jiggery-pokery to find a place I could do it, but the result is two pieces stuck together. |author=Philip Sherburne / Brian Eno |source=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/10023-a-conversation-with-brian-eno-about-ambient-music/|title=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music \u2013 Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n===Artworks: Light Boxes===\nEno's \"light boxes\" utilise advances in LED technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in [[Kite Stories]] (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist Michael Bracewell writes that the viewer \"is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever-changing moods and randomness of life itself\". He likens Eno's art to \"Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding.\" <ref>Brian Eno - Light Music: Shedding Light. Michael Bracewell.

They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, Eno's 'light paintings' have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton.\n\n===Obscure Records===\nEno started the Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, ''[[Discreet Music]]'', and the now-famous ''The Sinking of the Titanic'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet]]'' (1971) by [[Gavin Bryars]]. The second side of ''Discreet Music'' consisted of several versions of [[Canon in D|Pachelbel's Canon]], the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a [[tape loop]] system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Fripp, most notably on ''Evening Star''. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[John Cage]].\n\n===Other work===\n[[File:Nigel_Osborne_&_Brian_Eno_at_Mostar_1994-95.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Professor [[Nigel Osborne]] and Brian Eno leading music workshops, Pavarotti centre, Bosnia 1995.<ref name = \"foodoflove\">Nickalls, Susan.

''Tiger Mountain'' contains the galloping \"Third Uncle\", one of Eno's best-known songs, owing in part to its later being covered by [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] and [[801 (band)|801]]. Critic [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] writes that the song is \"a near punk attack of riffing guitars and clattering percussion, 'Third Uncle' could, in other hands, be a heavy metal anthem, albeit one whose lyrical content would tongue-tie the most slavish air guitarist.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Dave |url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t821132|pure_url=yes}} |title=All Music review |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThese four albums were remastered and reissued in 2004 by [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]'s [[Astralwerks]] label. Due to Eno's decision not to add any extra tracks of the original material, a handful of tracks originally issued as singles have not been reissued, including the single mix of \"King's Lead Hat\", the title of which is an [[anagram]] of \"[[Talking Heads]]\", whilst \"Seven Deadly Finns\" and \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" were included on the [[Deletion (music industry)|deleted]] ''Eno Box II: Vocal''.\n\nDuring this period, Eno also played three dates with [[Phil Manzanera]] in the band [[801 (band)|801]], a \"[[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]\" that performed more or less reworked selections from albums by Eno, Manzanera, and [[Quiet Sun (band)|Quiet Sun]], as well as covers of songs by [[The Beatles]] (\"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\") and [[The Kinks]] (\"[[You Really Got Me]]\").\n\nIn 1967, Eno developed a [[delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] system. The technique involved two [[Revox]] tape recorders set up side by side, with the tape unspooling from the first deck being carried over to the second deck to be spooled.  This enabled sound recorded on the first deck to be played back by the second deck at a time delay that varied with the distance between the two decks and the speed of the tape (typically a few seconds). Working with [[Robert Fripp]] (from [[King Crimson]]) the pair used this system in their collaboration ''[[(No Pussyfooting)]]'' (1973).<ref name=\"BBCEquatorialStars\">{{cite web|title = BBC \u2013 Experimental Review \u2013 Fripp Eno, The Equatorial Stars | publisher = BBC| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/qqzf/ |date=5 July 2004|author=Marsh, Peter|accessdate = 8 June 2008 }}</ref> Subsequently, Fripp referred to this method as \"[[Frippertronics]]\". In 1975, Fripp and Eno released a second album, ''[[Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)|Evening Star]]'', and played several live shows in Europe.\n\nEno was a prominent member of the performance art-classical orchestra the [[Portsmouth Sinfonia]]&nbsp;\u2013 having started playing clarinet with them in 1972. In 1973, he produced the orchestra's first album ''The Portsmouth Sinfonia Plays the Popular Classics'' (released in March 1974) and in 1974, he produced the live album ''Hallelujah! The Portsmouth Sinfonia Live at the Royal Albert Hall'', a recording of their infamous May 1974 concert (released in October 1974). In addition to producing both albums, Eno performed in the orchestra on both recordings playing the clarinet. Eno also deployed the orchestra's famously dissonant string section on his second solo album ''Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)''. The orchestra at this time included other musicians whose solo work he would subsequently release on his Obscure label including [[Gavin Bryars]] and [[Michael Nyman]]. That year he also composed music for the album ''[[Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy]]'', with [[Kevin Ayers]], to accompany the poet [[Lady June|June Campbell Cramer]].\n\n==== Ambient music ====\n{{Main|Ambient music}}\nEno's continuing solo career saw the release of a number of highly eclectic and increasingly [[ambient music|ambient]] [[electronic music|electronic]] and acoustic albums. He coined the term \"ambient music\",<ref>{Prendergast, ''The Ambient Century'': p.93}</ref> which is designed to modify the listener's perception of the surrounding environment. In the liner notes accompanying [[Ambient 1: Music for Airports]] Eno explains: \"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\"<ref>{(PVC7908(AMB001)}</ref>\n\nIn January 1975, Eno was hit by a taxi while crossing the street and spent several weeks recuperating at home. His girlfriend brought him an old record of harp music, which he lay down to listen to. He realised he had set the amplifier to a very low volume and one channel of the stereo was not working, but lacked the energy to correct it. \"This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music \u2013 as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and sound of the rain were parts of the ambience.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/how-brian-eno-created-a-quiet-revolution-in-music/|title=How Brian Eno created a quiet revolution in music|work=The Telegraph|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nEno's first work of ambient music, 1975's ''[[Discreet Music]]'' (again created via an elaborate tape-delay methodology, that Eno diagrammed on the back cover of the LP), is considered the landmark album of the genre. This was followed by his ''Ambient'' series: (''[[Music for Airports]] (Ambient 1);'' ''[[The Plateaux of Mirror]] (Ambient 2)'' featuring Harold Budd on Keyboards, ''[[Day of Radiance]] (Ambient 3)'' with the American composer [[Laraaji]] playing [[zither]] and [[hammered dulcimer]], and ''[[On Land]] (Ambient 4)'').\n\nIn 1975, Eno appeared as the Wolf in a rock version of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s classic ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''. Produced by [[Robin Lumley]] and [[Jack Lancaster]], the album featured [[Gary Moore]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Stephane Grapelli]], [[Chris Spedding]], [[Cozy Powell]], [[Jon Hiseman]], [[Bill Bruford]], and [[Alvin Lee]]. Also in 1975, Eno provided synthesisers and treatments on [[Quiet Sun]]'s album ''Mainstream'' alongside [[Phil Manzanera]], [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]], Dave Jarrett, and [[Bill MacCormick]], and he performed on and contributed songs and vocals to Manzanera's ''[[Diamond Head (Phil Manzanera album)|Diamond Head]]'' album.\n\nIn September 1976, Eno recorded with the [[Krautrock|Krautrock/Kosmische Musik]] group [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]] at their studio in [[Forst, Lower Saxony|Forst]], Germany. This material was not released until 1997 as ''[[Tracks and Traces]]'' by Harmonia '76. It was again reissued in 2009 with additional tracks and credited to Harmonia & Eno '76. Further collaborations with 'Krautrock' musicians including Hans Roedelius and Dieter Moebius saw the release of [[Cluster & Eno]] (1977) and [[After the Heat]] (1978).\n\nFrom 1977 to 1979, Eno collaborated with David Bowie on Bowie's \"Berlin Trilogy\" (''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'', and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''), and from 1978 to 1980 with Talking Heads (''[[More Songs About Buildings and Food]]'', ''[[Fear of Music]]'', and ''[[Remain in Light]]'').\n\n===1980s===\n\nIn 1980, Eno provided a film score for [[Herbert Vesely]]'s ''[[Egon Schiele \u2013 Exzess und Bestrafung]]'', also known as ''Egon Schiele \u2013 Excess and Punishment''. The ambient-style score was an unusual choice for an historical piece, but it worked effectively with the film's themes of sexual obsession and death.\n\nBefore Eno made ''On Land,'' [[Robert Quine]] played him [[Miles Davis]]' \"[[Get Up With It|He Loved Him Madly]]\" (1974). Eno stated in the liner notes for ''On Land,'' \"Teo Macero's revolutionary production on that piece seemed to me to have the \"spacious\" quality I was after, and like Federico Fellini's 1973 film ''Amarcord'', it too became a touchstone to which I returned frequently.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/onland-txt.html |title=''Ambient 4: On Land'' 1986 release notes |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980 to 1981, during which time Eno travelled to [[Ghana]] for a festival of West African music, he was collaborating with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] of [[Talking Heads]]. Their album [[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'']], was built around radio broadcasts Eno collected whilst living in the [[United States]], along with sampled music recordings from around the world transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and [[Middle East]]ern rhythms.\n\nIn 1983, Eno collaborated with his brother, [[Roger Eno]], and [[Daniel Lanois]] on the album ''[[Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks]]'' that had been commissioned by Al Reinert for his film ''[[For All Mankind]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite news|first1=John L.|last1=Walters|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Pop review: Brian Eno's Apollo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/22/brian-eno-apollo-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-08-10|title=Brian Eno explains Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/08/apollo-11-moon-brian-eno|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 July 2009|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Tracks from the album were subsequently used in several other films, including ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/soundtrack|title=Trainspotting (1996)|accessdate=16 January 2018|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nIn September 1992, Eno released ''[[Nerve Net]]'', an album utilising heavily syncopated rhythms with contributions from several former collaborators including Fripp, [[Benmont Tench]], [[Robert Quine]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]. This album was a last-minute substitution for ''My Squelchy Life'', which contained more pop oriented material, with Eno on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20032-brian-eno-nerve-netthe-shutov-assemblynerolithe-drop/|title=Brian Eno: Nerve Net/The Shutov Assembly/Neroli/The Drop Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> Several tracks from ''My Squelchy Life'' later appeared on 1993's retrospective box set ''Eno Box II: Vocals,'' and the entire album was eventually released in 2014 as part of an expanded re-release of ''Nerve Net.'' Eno also released ''[[The Shutov Assembly]]'' in 1992, recorded between 1985 and 1990. This album embraces [[atonality]] and abandons most conventional concepts of [[Mode (music)|modes]], [[Scale (music)|scales]] and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. Emancipated from the constant attraction towards the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] that underpins the Western [[tonal music|tonal tradition]], the gradually shifting music originally eschewed any conventional instrumentation, save for treated keyboards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/me_intr3.html#q2|title=Brian Eno interviewed by Michael Engelbrecht|website=Music.hyperreal.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, Eno worked increasingly with self-generating musical systems, the results of which he called [[generative music]]. This allows the listener to hear music that slowly unfolds in almost infinite non-repeating combinations of sound.<ref>The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music pp118-119 Ed. Nick Collins ({{ISBN|9780521688659}})</ref> In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated that it would take almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. Eno achieves this through the blending of several independent musical tracks of varying length. Each track features different musical elements and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again re-configuring differently with the other tracks. He has presented this music in his own art and sound installations and those in collaboration with other artists, including ''[[I Dormienti]] (The Sleepers)'', ''[[Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace \u2013 The State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg|Lightness: Music for the Marble Palace]],'' ''[[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]],'' ''[[The Quiet Room]],'' and ''Music for Prague.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/music-time-and-long-term-thinking-brian-eno-expands-the-vocabulary-of-human-feeling-98e0fbad5950|title=Brian Eno Expands the Vocabulary of Human Feeling|first=The Long Now|last=Foundation|date=30 November 2017|website=Medium.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of Eno's better-known collaborations was with the members of [[U2]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and several other artists in a group called Passengers. They produced the 1995 album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]],'' which reached No. 76 on the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] and No. 12 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It featured a single, \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", which reached number 6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/miss%20sarajevo/|title=miss+sarajevo {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> This collaboration is chronicled in Eno's book ''[[A Year with Swollen Appendices]],'' a diary published in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Eno scored the six-part fantasy television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115288/fullcredits|title=Neverwhere (TV Mini-Series 1996\u2013 )|accessdate=8 December 2017|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2004, Fripp and Eno recorded another ambient music collaboration album, ''[[The Equatorial Stars]]''.\n\nEno returned in June 2005 with ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'', his first major album since ''[[Wrong Way Up]]'' (with [[John Cale]]) to prominently feature vocals (a trend he continued with ''[[Everything That Happens Will Happen Today]]''). The album differs from his 1970s solo work due to the impact technological advances on musical production, evident in its semi-electronic production.\n\nIn early 2006, Eno collaborated with David Byrne again, for the reissue of ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' in celebration of the influential album's 25th anniversary. Eight previously unreleased tracks recorded during the initial sessions in 1980/81, were added to the album.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6382-david-byrne/\n| title = Interview: David Byrne\n| last = Dahlen\n| first = Chris\n| date = 17 July 2006\n| work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>\nAn unusual interactive marketing strategy was employed for its re-release, the album's promotional website features the ability for anyone to officially and legally download the [[multitrack recording|multi-tracks]] of two songs from the album, \"A Secret Life\" and \"Help Me Somebody\". This allowed listeners to [[remix]] and upload new mixes of these tracks to the website for others to listen and rate them.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno Profile Long Now Foundation 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Eno at the [[Long Now Foundation]], 26 June 2006]]\nIn late 2006, Eno released ''[[77 Million Paintings]]'', a program of generative video and music specifically for home computers. As its title suggests, there is a possible combination of 77 million paintings where the viewer will see different combinations of video slides prepared by Eno each time the program is launched. Likewise, the accompanying music is generated by the program so that it's almost certain the listener will never hear the same arrangement twice. The second edition of \"77 Million Paintings\" featuring improved morphing and a further two layers of sound was released on 14 January 2008. In June 2007, when commissioned in the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]], San Francisco, California, [[Annabeth Robinson]] (AngryBeth Shortbread) recreated ''77 Million Paintings'' in [[Second Life]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Author|first=Unknown|title=77-million-paintings-brian-eno|url=http://longnow.org/events/02007/jun/29/77-million-paintings-brian-eno/|work=77 Million Paintings|publisher=The Long Now Foundation|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Eno's music was featured in a [[Ecstasy (2007 film)|movie adaption]] of [[Irvine Welsh]]'s best-selling collection ''[[Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance]]''. He also appeared playing keyboards in ''[[Voila (album)|Voila]]'', [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s solo album sung entirely in French.\n\nAlso in 2007, Eno contributed a composition titled \"Grafton Street\" to [[Dido (singer)|Dido's]] third album, ''[[Safe Trip Home]]'', released in November 2008.<ref name=\"qmag\">Aizlewood, John.

Eno's lengthy string of producer credits includes albums for [[Talking Heads]], [[U2]], [[Devo]], [[Ultravox]] and [[James (band)|James]]. He also produced part of the 1993 album ''[[When I Was a Boy]]'' by [[Jane Siberry]]. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 [[BRIT Awards]].\n\nEno describes himself as a \"non-musician\", using the term \"treatments\" to describe his modification of the sound of musical instruments, and to separate his role from that of the traditional instrumentalist. His skill at using \"The Studio as a Compositional Tool\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/downbeat79.htm |title=Pro Session&nbsp;\u2013 The Studio as Compositional Tool |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> (the title of an essay by Eno) led in part to his career as a producer. His methods were recognised at the time (mid-1970s) as unique, so much so that on [[Genesis (band)|Genesis's]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'', he is credited with 'Enossification'; on [[Robert Wyatt]]'s ''[[Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard]]'' with a ''Direct inject anti-jazz raygun'' and on [[John Cale]]'s [[Island Records|Island]] albums as simply being \"Eno\".\n\nEno has contributed to recordings by artists as varied as [[Nico]], Robert Calvert, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Zvuki Mu]], in various capacities such as use of his studio/synthesiser/electronic treatments, vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and as just being 'Eno'. In 1984, he (amongst others) composed and performed the \"Prophecy Theme\" for the [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''; the rest of the [[Dune (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was composed and performed by the group [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. Eno produced performance artist [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]]'s ''[[Bright Red]]'' album, and also composed for it. The work is avant-garde spoken word with haunting and magnifying sounds. Eno played on David Byrne's musical score for ''The Catherine Wheel'', a project commissioned by [[Twyla Tharp]] to accompany her Broadway dance project of the same name.\n\nHe worked with Bowie as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential 1977\u201379 'Berlin Trilogy' of albums, ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]], [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'', on Bowie's later album ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]'', and on the song \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Recorded in France and Germany, the spacey effects on ''Low'' were largely created by Eno, who played a portable [[EMS Synthi A]] synthesizer.

In 1995, U2 and Eno joined forces to create the album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]'' under the group name Passengers; songs from which included \"[[Your Blue Room]]\" and \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\".  Even though films are listed and described for each song, all but three are bogus. Eno also produced ''[[Laid (album)|Laid]]'' (1993), ''[[Wah Wah (album)|Wah Wah]]'' (1994) ''[[Millionaires (album)|Millionaires]]'' (1999) and ''[[Pleased to Meet You (James album)|Pleased to Meet You]]'' (2001) for [[James (band)|James]], performing as an extra musician on all four. He is credited for \"frequent interference and occasional co-production\" on their 1997 album ''[[Whiplash (album)|Whiplash]]''.\n\nEno played on the 1986 album ''[[Measure for Measure (album)|Measure for Measure]]'' by Australian band [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]]. He remixed two tracks for [[Depeche Mode]], \"[[I Feel You]]\" and \"[[In Your Room (Depeche Mode song)|In Your Room]]\", both single releases from the album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' in 1993. In 1995, Eno provided one of several remixes of \"[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]\" by [[Massive Attack]] (originally from their ''[[Protection (Massive Attack album)|Protection]]'' album) for release as a single.\n\nIn 2007, he produced the fourth studio album by [[Coldplay]], ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', released in 2008. Also in 2008, he worked with [[Grace Jones]] on her album ''[[Hurricane (Grace Jones album)|Hurricane]]'', credited for \"production consultation\" and as a member of the band, playing keyboards, treatments and background vocals. He worked on the twelfth studio album by [[U2]], again with Lanois, titled ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''. It was recorded in Morocco, the South of France and [[Dublin]] and released in Europe on 27 February 2009.\n\nIn 2011, Eno and Coldplay reunited and Eno contributed \"enoxification\" and additional composition on Coldplay's fifth studio album ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'', released on 24 October of that year.\n\n[[File:Brian Eno's musical web.jpg|thumb|Eno's connections to other progressive rock music artists]]\n\n===The Microsoft Sound===\nIn 1994, [[Microsoft]] designers [[Mark Malamud]] and Erik Gavriluk approached Eno to compose music for the [[Windows 95]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/intel-microsoft-research-in-motion-apple/5/25/2010/id/28465?refresh=1|title=Who Created The Windows Start-Up Sound?|last=Rohrlich|first=Justin|date=25 May 2010|work=[[Minyanville]]'s Wall Street|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref> The result was the six-second [[Booting|start-up]] music-sound of the Windows 95 [[operating system]], \"The Microsoft Sound\".

It's like making a tiny little jewel.\n\nIn fact, I made eighty-four pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work.

He started experimenting with the medium of video in 1978. Eno describes the first video camera he received, that would initially become his main tool for creating ambient video and light installations:\n\n\"One afternoon while I was working in the studio with [[Talking Heads]], the roadie from [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], working in an adjacent studio, came in and asked whether anyone wanted to buy some video equipment. I'd never really thought much about video, and found most 'video art' completely unmemorable, but the prospect of actually owning a video camera was, at that time, quite exotic.\"<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). ''77 Million Paintings'' \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref>\n\nThe [[Panasonic]] industrial camera Eno received had significant [[design flaws]] preventing the camera from sitting upright without the assistance of a tripod. This led to his works being filmed in vertical format, requiring the television set to be flipped on its side to view it in the proper orientation.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 2.</ref> The pieces Eno produced with this method, such as ''Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan'' (1980) and ''[[Thursday Afternoon]]'' (1984) (accompanied by the album of the same title), were labelled as 'Video Paintings.' He explained the genre title in the music magazine NME:\n\n\"I was delighted to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting... I call them 'video paintings' because if you say to people 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/nme85.html#Thursday |title=NME: Proxy Music |publisher=Music.hyperreal.org |date=9 November 1985 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThese works presented Eno with the opportunity to expand his ambient aesthetic into a visual form, manipulating the medium of video to produce something not present in the normal television experience. His video works were shown around the world in exhibitions in New York and Tokyo, as well as released on the compilation 14 Video Paintings in 2005.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 5.</ref>\n\nEno continued his video experimentation through the 80s, 90s and 2000s, leading to further experimentation with the television as a malleable light source and informing his generative works such as [[77 Million Paintings]] in 2006.<ref>Eno, Brian (2006). \"My Light Years\". pp. 6\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Generative music===\nEno gives the example of [[wind chime]]s. He says that these systems and the creation of them have been a focus of his since he was a student: \"I got interested in the idea of music that could make itself, in a sense, in the mid 1960s really, when I first heard composers like [[Terry Riley]], and when I first started playing with tape recorders.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/appsblog/2012/sep/26/brian-eno-scape-ipad-apps|title=Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers talk Scape, iPad apps and generative music|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=3 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nInitially Eno began to experiment with tape loops to create [[generative music]] systems. With the advent of CDs he developed systems to make music of indeterminate duration using several discs of material that he'd specifically recorded so that they would work together musically when driven by random playback.\n\nIn 1995, he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music through utilising programmed algorithms. The collaboration with Intermorphic led Eno to release ''Generative Music 1'' - which requires Intermorphic's ''Koan Player'' software for PC. The Koan software made it possible for generative music to be experienced in the domestic environment for the first time.\n\n====Generative Music 1====\nIn 1996, Eno collaborated in developing the SSEYO [[Koan (program)|Koan]] generative music software system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing ''Generative Music 1''\u2014only playable on the Koan generative music system. Further music releases using Koan software include: ''Wander'' (2001) and ''Dark Symphony'' (2007)\u2014both include works by Eno, and those of other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole).\n\n====Released excerpts====\nEno started to release excerpts of results from his 'generative music' systems as early as 1975 with the album ''Discreet Music''. Then again in 1978 with ''Music for Airports'':\n\n{{Quote|text=Music for Airports, at least one of the pieces on there, is structurally very, very simple. There are sung notes, sung by three women and my self. One of the notes repeats every 23 1/2 seconds. It is in fact a long [recorded tape] loop running around a series of tubular aluminum chairs in Conny Plank's studio. The next lowest loop repeats every 25 7/8 seconds or something like that. The third one every 29 15/16 seconds or something. What I mean is they all repeat in cycles that are called incommensurable \u2013 they are not likely to come back into sync again. So this is the piece moving along in time. Your experience of the piece of course is a moment in time, there. So as the piece progresses, what you hear are the various clusterings and configurations of these six basic elements. The basic elements in that particular piece never change. They stay the same. But the piece does appear to have quite a lot of variety. In fact it's about eight minutes long on that record, but I did have a thirty minute version which I would bore friends who would listen to it. The thing about pieces like this of course is that they are actually of almost infinite length if the numbers involved are complex enough. They simply don't ever re-configure in the same way again. This is music for free in a sense. The considerations that are important, then, become questions of how the system works and most important of all what you feed into the system. |author=Brian Eno |source=Generative Music: A talk delivered in San Francisco, June 8, 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html|title=Generative Music \u2013 Brian Eno \u2013 In Motion Magazine|website=Inmotionmagazine.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe list below consists of albums, soundtracks and downloadable files that contain excerpts from some of Eno's generative music explorations:\n{{div col}}\n\n* 1970 \u2013 Berlin Horse [Film Short]\n* 1975 \u2013 Discreet Music\n* 1975 \u2013 Evening Star (Fripp & Eno)\n* 1978 \u2013 Ambient 1: Music For Airports\n* 1981 \u2013 Mistaken Memories of Mediaeval Manhattan [Installation Video]\n* 1982 \u2013 Ambient 4: On Land\n* 1983 \u2013 Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1983 \u2013 Music For Films II (Eno, Lanois & R Eno) [exclusive to 'Working Backwards' Box Set]\n* 1984 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon [Installation Video]\n* 1985 \u2013 Thursday Afternoon\n* 1988 \u2013 Music For Films III (Various Artists)\n* 1989 \u2013 Textures (Eno, Lanois & R Eno)\n* 1989 \u2013 For All Mankind [Documentary Soundtrack]\n* 1992 \u2013 The Shutov Assembly\n* 1993 \u2013 Neroli (Thinking Music Part IV)\n* 1994 \u2013 Glitterbug [Original Soundtrack]\n* 1996 \u2013 Neverwhere [BBC TV Mini-Series Soundtrack]\n* 1997 \u2013 Contra 1.2\n* 1997 \u2013 Lightness\n* 1998 \u2013 Music for Prague\n* 1999 \u2013 I Dormienti\n* 1999 \u2013 Kite Stories\n* 2000 \u2013 Music For Civic Recovery Centre\n* 2001 \u2013 Compact Forest Proposal\n* 2003 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume I\n* 2004 \u2013 Curiosities \u2013 Volume II\n* 2012 \u2013 Lux\n* 2013 \u2013 CAM [Web \u2013 the book 'Brian Eno: Visual Music' includes a Download Code]\n* 2014 \u2013 The Shutov Bonus Material ['Shutov Assembly' Bonus CD]\n* 2014 \u2013 New Space Music ['Neroli' Bonus CD]\n* 2016 \u2013 The Ship\n* 2016 \u2013 Reflection\n* 2017 \u2013 Sisters [Web Download]\n* 2018 \u2013 Music for Installations [Box Set]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.enoshop.co.uk/BrianEnoMusicForInstallations | title=Brian Eno Releases 'Music for Installations' on May 4th (2018)|website=Enoshop.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\nSeveral of the released excerpts (listed above) originated as, or are derivative of, soundtracks Eno created for art installations.

Ross writes in the programme notes to Matrix 44 in 1981: \"In a series of painterly video installations first shown in 1979, Eno explored the notion of environmental ambiance. Eno proposes a use for music and video that is antithetical to behavior control-oriented \"Muzak\" in that it induces and invites the viewer to enter a meditative, detached state, rather than serve as an operant conditioner for work-force efficiency. His underlying strategy is to create works which provide natural levels of variety and redundancy which bring attention to, rather than mimic, essential characteristics of the natural environment. Eno echoes Matisse's stated desire that his art serve as an armchair for the weary businessman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/44|title=BAMPFA - Art Exhibitions - Brian Eno / MATRIX 44|website=Archive.bampfa.berkeley.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nEarly installations benefitted from breakthroughs in video technology that inspired Eno to use the TV screen as a monitor and enabled him to experiment with the opposite of the fast-moving narratives typical of TV to create evolving images with an almost imperceptible rate of change. \"2 Fifth Avenue\", (\"a linear four-screen installation with music from Music For Airports\") resulted from Eno shooting \"the view from his apartment window: without\u2026(any) intervention,\" recording \"what was in front of the camera for an unspecified period of time\u2026 In a simple but crude form of experimental post production, the colour controls of the monitors on which the work was shown were adjusted to wash out the picture, producing a high-contrast black and white image in which colour appeared only in the darkest areas. \u2026 Eno manipulated colour as though painting, observing: 'video for me is a way of configuring light, just as painting is a way of configuring paint.'\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music.

The fact that this prodigious possibility had almost exclusively been used to reproduce figurative images in the service of narratives pointed to evolution of the medium from the theatre and cinema. What I thought was that this machine, which pumped out highly controllable light, was actually the first synthesizer, and that its use as an imager-retailer represented a subset of its possible range.\" <ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P121. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nTurning the TV on its back, Eno played video colour fields of differing lengths of time that would slowly re-combine in different configurations. Placing ziggurats (3 dimensional constructions) of different lengths and sizes on top of the screens that defined each separate colour field, these served to project the internal light source upward. \"The light from it was tangible as though caught in a cloud of vapour. Its slowly changing hues and striking colour collisions were addictive. We sat watching for ages, transfixed by this totally new experience of light as a physical presence.\"<ref>Eno: My Light Years. np. Brian Eno: Visual Music. Christopher Scoates. P122. Chronicle Books. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nCalling these light sculptures Crystals (first shown in Boston in 1983), Eno further developed them for the Pictures of Venice exhibition at Gabriella Cardazzo's Cavallino Gallery (Venice,1985). Placing plexiglass on top of the structures he found that these further diffused the light so the shapes outlined through this surface appeared to be described differently in the slowly changing fields of light.<ref>My Light Years Brian Eno np accompanying essay to 77 Million Paintings. 2006 HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nBy positioning sound sources in different places and different heights in the exhibition room Eno intended that the music would be something listened to from the inside rather than the outside. For the [[I Dormienti]] show in 1999 that featured sculptures of sleeping figures by [[Mimmo Paladino]] in the middle of the circular room, Eno placed speakers in each of the 12 tunnels running from it.\n\nEnvisioning the speakers themselves as instruments, led to Eno's 'speaker flowers' becoming a feature of many installations, including at the Museo dell' Ara Pacis (Rome, 2008), again with Mimmo Paladino and 'Speaker Flowers and Lightboxes' at [[Castello Svevo]] in Trani (Italy 2017). Re-imagining the speaker as a flower with a voice that could be heard as it moved in the breeze, he made 'bunches' of them, \"sculptural objects (that) ...consist of tiny chassis speakers attached to tall metal stands that sway in response to the sound they emit.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106131601/http://www.jamesputnam.org.uk/httpwww.jamesputnam.org.ukinv_exhibition_26.html] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The first version of these were shown at the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]](1984).\n\nSince ''[[On Land]]'' (1982), Eno has sought to blur the boundaries between music and non-music and incorporates environmental sounds into his work. He treats synthesised and recorded sounds for specific effects.<ref>''Brian Eno : Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time'',  Christopher Scoates, pp. 135-137, {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the antithesis of 20th century [[shock art]], Eno's works create environments that are: \"Envisioned as extensions of everyday life while offering a refuge from its stresses.\"<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music p.132 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref> Creating a space to reflect was a stated aim in Eno's Quiet Club series of installations that have shown across the world, and include [[Music for Civic Recovery Centre]] at the [[David Toop]] curated Sonic Boom festival at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2000.\n\nThe Quiet Club series (1986-2001) grew from Eno's site-specific installations that included the Place series (1985-1989). These also featured light sculptures and audio with the addition of conventional materials, such as \"tree trunks, fish bowls, ladders, rocks\". Eno used these in unconventional ways to create new and unexpected experiences and modes of engagements, offering an extension of and refuge from, everyday life.<ref>Brian Eno: Visual Music: The Aesthetics of Time: Christopher Scoates pp132/136 {{ISBN|978-1-4521-0849-0}}</ref>\n\nThe continually flowing non-repeating music and art of Eno's installations mitigate against [[habituation]] to the work and maintain the visitors' engagement with it. \"One of the things I enjoy about my shows is...lots of people sitting quietly watching something that has no story, few recognisable images and changes very slowly. It's somewhere between the experience of painting, cinema, music and meditation...I dispute the assumption that everyone's attention span is getting shorter: I find people are begging for experiences that are longer and slower, less \"dramatic\" and more sensual.\" <ref>{Brian Eno Visual Music p.135 Christopher Scoates. {{ISBN|978-1452108490}}}</ref> Tanya Zimbardo writing on New Urban Spaces Series 4. \"Compact Forest Proposal\" for SF MOMA (2001) confirms: \"During the first presentation of this work, as part of the exhibition 010101: Art in Technological Times at SFMOMA in 2001, visitors often spent considerable time in this dreamlike space.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/publication/soundtracks/brian-eno/|title=Brian Eno|website=SFMOMA|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Eno's work, both art and music are released from their normal constraints. The music set up to randomly reconfigure is modal and abstract rather than tonal, and so the listener is freed from expectations set up by Western tonal harmonic conventions.<ref>The Dynamics of Harmony: Pratt. {{ISBN|9780198790204}}</ref> The artworks in their continual slowly shifting combinations of colour (and in the case of 77 Million Paintings image re-configurations) themselves offer a continually engaging immersive experience through their unfolding fields of light.\n\n====77 Million Paintings====\nDevelopments in computer technology meant that the experience of Eno's unending non-repeatable generative art and music was no longer only possible in the public spaces of his exhibitions. With software developer and programmer Jake Dowie, Eno created a generative art/music installation '[[77 Million Paintings]]' for the domestic environment. Developed for both PC and Mac, the process is explained by Nick Robertson in the accompanying booklet. \"One way to approach this idea is to imagine that you have a large box full of painted components and you are allowed to blindly take out between one and four of these at any time and overlay them to make a complete painting. The selection of the elements and their duration in the painting is variable and arbitrarily determined\u2026\" <ref name=\"auto2\">Painting By Numbers, Nick Robertson, 77 Million Paintings HNDVD 1521</ref>\n\nMost (nearly all) of the visual 'elements' were hand-painted by Eno onto glass slides, creating an organic heart to the work. Some of the slides had formed his earlier 'Natural Selections' exhibition projected onto the windows of the [[Triennale]] in Milan. (1990). This exhibition marked the beginning of Eno's site specific installations that re-defined spaces on a large scale.<ref>Brian Eno Visual Music The Aesthetics of Time. Christopher Scoates. ISBN P. 124</ref>\n\nFor the Triennale exhibition, Eno with Rolf Engel and Roland Blum at Atelier Marktgraph, used new 'dataton' technology that could be programmed to control the fade up and out times of the light sources.<ref>My Light Years by Brian Eno. 77 Million Paintings (accompanying booklet)HNDVD 1521</ref> But, unlike the software developed for '77 Million', this was clumsy and limited the practical realisation of Eno's vision.\n\nWith the computer programmed to randomly select a combination of up to four images of different durations, the on screen painting continually reconfigures as each image slowly dissolves whilst another appears. The painting will be different for every viewer in every situation, uniquely defining each moment. Eno likens his role in creating this piece to one of a gardener planting seeds. And like a gardener he watches to see how they grow, waiting to see if further intervention is necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners|title=Composers as Gardeners|website=Edge.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> In the liner notes Nick Robertson explains: \"Every user will buy exactly the same pack of 'seeds' but they will all grow in different ways and into distinct paintings, the vast majority of which, the artist himself has not even seen. \u2026The original in art is no longer solely bound up in the physical object, but rather in the way the piece lives and grows.\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAlthough designed for the domestic environment, 77 million paintings has been (and continues to be) exhibited in multi-screen installations across the world. It has also been projected onto architectural structures, including the sails of the [[Sydney Opera House]] (2009), [[Carioca Aqueduct]] (The Arcos Di Lapa) Brazil (2012) and the giant [[Lovell Telescope]] at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] (2016). During an exhibition at Fabrica Brighton, (2010) the orthopaedic surgeon Robin Turner noticed the calming effect the work had on the visitors.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Turner asked Eno to provide a version for the Montefiore hospital in Hove. Since then 77 Million and Eno's latest \"Light Boxes\" have been commissioned for use in hospitals.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Montefiore Hospital Installations====\nIn 2013, Eno created two permanent light and sound installations at Montefiore Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-22189774|title=Brian Eno branches out into hospital work|first=Jane|last=Dreaper|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=3 May 2017|website=Bbc.com}}</ref> In the hospital's reception area \"77 Million Paintings for Montefiore\" consists of eight plasma monitors mounted on the wall in a diagonally radiating flower-like pattern. They display an evolving collage of coloured patterns and shapes whilst Eno's generative ambient music plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named \"Quiet Room for Montefiore\" (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colours in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music into focus and facilitates the visitors' cognitive drift, freeing them to contemplate or relax.\n\n====Spore====\nEno composed most of the music for the [[Electronic Arts]] video game [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]] (2008), assisted by his long-term collaborator, the musician and programmer [[Peter Chilvers (musician)|Peter Chilvers]]. Much of the music is generative and responsive to the player's position within the game.\n\n====iOS apps====\nInspired by possibilities presented to Eno and Peter Chilvers whilst working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game ''Spore'' (2008), the two began to release generative music in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App]] format. They set up the website generativemusic.com and created generative music applications for the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[iPad]]:\n\n* 2008 \u2013 [[Bloom (software)|''Bloom'']]\n* 2009 \u2013 ''Trope''\n* 2012 \u2013 ''Scape''\n* 2016 \u2013 ''Reflection''\n\nIn 2009, Peter Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill also created an App entitled ''Air'' (released through generativemusic.com as well) \u2013 based on concepts developed by Eno in his ''Ambient 1: Music for Airports'' album.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/10/review-brian-en.html |title=Eno and Chilvers Release Sweet Music App for iPhone &#124, Listening Post |journal=Wired |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Reflection====\nThe generative version of ''Reflection'' is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike other Apps they released ''Reflection'' provides no real options other than Play/Pause \u2013 later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price. For those who'd bought the app at a higher price, Eno and Chilvers provided links to a free download of a four track album called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration). The following appears on the app's Apple iTunes page:\n\n{{Quote|text=As a result of the Brexit-related fall in value of the British pound Apple have increased the prices of all apps sold in the UK by 25%. While we always intended REFLECTION to be a premium priced app, we feel this increase makes it too expensive, so we will take the hit in order to keep the British price to the consumer at its original level.\n\nIn other territories this decision will translate into a reduced price for the app.\n\nAs a thank you to everyone who has supported the REFLECTION app, we are adding a free surprise downloadable gift to it for a limited time.

I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time \u2013 'like sitting by a river': it's always the same river, but it's always changing. But recordings \u2013 whether vinyl, cassette or CD \u2013 are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. Reflection in its album form \u2013 on vinyl or CD \u2013 is like this. But the app by which Reflection is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.\n\nThe creation of a piece of music like this falls into three stages: the first is the selection of sonic materials and a musical mode \u2013 a constellation of musical relationships. These are then patterned and explored by a system of algorithms which vary and permutate the initial elements I feed into them, resulting in a constantly morphing stream (or river) of music. The third stage is listening. Once I have the system up and running I spend a long time \u2013 many days and weeks in fact \u2013 seeing what it does and fine-tuning the materials and sets of rules that run the algorithms. It's a lot like gardening: you plant the seeds and then you keep tending to them until you get a garden you like.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/brianenomusic/posts/1516385288375657|title=Brian Eno|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nThe version of ''Reflection'' available on the fixed formats (CD, Vinyl and download File) consists of two (joined) excerpts from the ''Reflection'' app. This was revealed in Brian's interview with Philip Sherburne:\n\n{{Quote|text=[Philip Sherburne] Given the infinite nature of the Reflection project, was it difficult to select the 54-minute chunk that became the album?\n\n[Brian Eno] Yes, it was quite interesting doing that. When you're running it as an ephemeral piece, you have quite different considerations. If there is something that is a bit doubtful or odd, you think, OK, that's just in the nature of the piece and now it's passed and we're somewhere else. Whereas if you're thinking of it as a record that people are going to listen to again and again, what philosophy do you take? Choose just a random amount of time? Could have done that. Just do several of them and fix them together? Is that faking it? These are very interesting philosophical questions.\n\n[Philip Sherburne] Which approach did you follow?\n\n[Brian Eno] A hybrid approach. I generated 11 pieces of the length I'd set the piece to be and I had them all in my iTunes on random shuffle, so I would be listening at night, doing other things, and as one ran through, I would think, That was a nice one, I particularly like the second half. So then I would make a note. I did this for quite a few evenings. There were two that I really liked. On one, the last 40 minutes of it were lovely, and on another, the first 25 minutes of it were really nice. So I thought, This is a studio, I'm making a record. I'll edit them together! It was like the birth of rock'n'roll. I'm allowed to do that! It's not cheating. It was quite a bit of jiggery-pokery to find a place I could do it, but the result is two pieces stuck together. |author=Philip Sherburne / Brian Eno |source=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/10023-a-conversation-with-brian-eno-about-ambient-music/|title=A Conversation With Brian Eno About Ambient Music \u2013 Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n===Artworks: Light Boxes===\nEno's \"light boxes\" utilise advances in LED technology that has enabled him to re-imagine his ziggurat light paintings - and early light boxes as featured in [[Kite Stories]] (1999) - for the domestic environment. The light boxes feature slowly changing combinations of colour fields that draw attention differently to the shapes outlined by delineating structures within. As the paintings slowly evolve each passing moment is defined differently, drawing the viewer's focus into the present moment. The writer and cultural essayist Michael Bracewell writes that the viewer \"is also encouraged to engage with a generative sensor/aesthetic experience that reflects the ever-changing moods and randomness of life itself\". He likens Eno's art to \"Matisse or Rothko at their most enfolding.\" <ref>Brian Eno - Light Music: Shedding Light. Michael Bracewell.

They remain in permanent display in both private and public spaces. Recognised for their therapeutic contemplative benefits, Eno's 'light paintings' have been commissioned for specially dedicated places of reflection including in Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the Montefiore Hospital in Hove and a three and a half metre lightbox for the sanctuary room in the Macmillan Horizon Centre in Brighton.\n\n===Obscure Records===\nEno started the Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The first group of three releases included his own composition, ''[[Discreet Music]]'', and the now-famous ''The Sinking of the Titanic'' (1969) and ''[[Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet]]'' (1971) by [[Gavin Bryars]]. The second side of ''Discreet Music'' consisted of several versions of [[Canon in D|Pachelbel's Canon]], the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage and to which he applied various algorithmic transformations, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a [[tape loop]] system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds in some of his collaborations with Fripp, most notably on ''Evening Star''. Ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]], [[Michael Nyman]], and [[John Cage]].\n\n===Other work===\n[[File:Nigel_Osborne_&_Brian_Eno_at_Mostar_1994-95.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Professor [[Nigel Osborne]] and Brian Eno leading music workshops, Pavarotti centre, Bosnia 1995.<ref name = \"foodoflove\">Nickalls, Susan.

Therapeutic abortion to save a mother's life was permitted between 1837 and 1936. <ref name=\"c355-06\">{{cite court|court=Constitutional Court|vol=Sentencia C-355/06|date=10 May 2006|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2006/c-355-06.htm}}</ref> As of 2006, only in the following circumstances, which remain in effect to this day. These three exceptions are: The continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the life or health of the mother; The existence of life-threatening fetal malformations; The pregnancy is the result of rape, non-consensual artificial insemination or incest.\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1837 and 1936 penal legislation authorized [[therapeutic abortion]] while banning all other forms of abortion, regardless of whether the abortion consented or not. The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \"generally condemned\" by the [[Catholic Church]], the official religion at the time.<ref name=c355-06 /> In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful).<ref name=abortocolombiabook>{{cite book|last1=Molina Betancur|first1=Carlos Mario|title=El derecho al aborto en Colombia.

The law also provided for reduced sentences, of 3\u20136 months (5\u201310 months if the abortion was successful), in the case of \"honest women of good reputation\" who received an abortion to \"conceal their frailty\" (''aborto honoris causa'').<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nA very conservative 1922 law to reform the penal code would have eliminated therapeutic abortion and punished women who sought an abortion but maintained the ''aborto honoris causa'', but the law never entered into force. The ''aborto honoris causa'', a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour.<ref name=abortocolombiabook /> The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl.<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=abortocolombiabook />\n\nThe 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the ''aborto honoris causa'' and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000.\n\n\n\n'''<big>Decree 100 of 1980.

The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts. Furthermore, it opined that \"the life of the unborn embodies a fundamental value, for the hope of its existence as a person, and its apparent helplessness requires special attention from the State.\"<ref name=c133-94>{{cite court|vol=Sentencia C-133/94|court=Constitutional Court|date=17 March 1994|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm}}</ref> Thus, Colombia's abortion legislation was constitutional under the State's obligation to protect the life of \"all persons\", which, at the time, the Court claimed \"obviously\" protected life during its formation and development given that these stages were condition for the viability of birth, the origin of the [[Legal personality|legal existence of a person]].<ref name=c133-94 /> In addition, the Court said, if the Constitution gives couples the right to decide their number of children, this right could only be exercised prior to conception since conception creates a being which is existentially distinct from the mother.<ref name=c133-94 />\n\n===Legal situation prior to 2006===\n\nAbortion was legally regulated by articles 122 through 124 of the Colombian Penal Code (law 599 of 2000). Article 122 of the Penal Code punished women who self-induced or consented to someone else inducing her abortion to imprisonment for a period of one to three years, increased to a term of 16 to 54 months by law 890 of 2004.<ref name=\"penalcode\" /> Article 123 punished those who practised an abortion without the woman's consent ''or'' on a girl under fourteen years of age to a period of imprisonment of 4 to 10 years, increased to 64 to 180 months by the 2004 law. Article 124, finally, allowed for attenuating circumstances: the prescribed penalty for abortion would be reduced by three quarters when the pregnancy was the result of rape or non-consensual artificial insemination.<ref name=penalcode>{{cite act|title=Ley por la cual se expide el C\u00f3digo Penal|type=Law|number=599|language=Spanish|date=2000|article=122-124|url=http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc/ley_0599_2000_pr004.html#122}}</ref>\n\n==Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez's case==\n\nIn 2006, the case of [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] woman [[Martha Gonzalez|Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez]] brought national attention to the issue of abortion in the country. Martha Sulay, already a mother of three, was diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] while pregnant with her fourth child in 2004 (despite prior [[tubal ligation]]).<ref name=\":0\" /> Her requests for [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] were denied, as they would entail the termination of her pregnancy, which was illegal.

Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.<ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception.<ref name=\":2\" />\n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. <ref name=\":2\" />A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request).<ref>{{cite book|title=Determinantes del aborto inseguro y barreras de acceso para la atenci\u00f3n de la interrupci\u00f3n voluntaria del embarazo en mujeres colombianas|date=2014|publisher=Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social and Fondo de Poblaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA)|location=Bogot\u00e1|isbn=978-958-873-575-7|url=http://profamilia.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Determinantes%20del%20aborto%20inseguro%20y%20barreras%20de%20acceso%20para%20la%20atencio%CC%81n%20de%20la%20IVE%20en%20mujeres%20colombianas.pdf|ref=profamilia publication}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections.<ref name=\":2\" /> The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Center Praises Momentous Decision in Abortion Case in Colombia|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-praises-momentous-decision-in-abortion-case-in-colombia|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\nIn October 2013, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures.<ref name=abortionstats>{{cite web|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Colombia|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Colombia.html|website=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the [[Colombian Ministry of Health|Ministry of Health]], which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012.

The Court concluded that regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution, the phenomenon of constitutional res judicata operated for what was resolved in judgment C-591 of 1995, reiterated in judgment C-327 of 2016.

The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \"generally condemned\" by the [[Catholic Church]], the official religion at the time.<ref name=c355-06 /> In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful).<ref name=abortocolombiabook>{{cite book|last1=Molina Betancur|first1=Carlos Mario|title=El derecho al aborto en Colombia.

The law also provided for reduced sentences, of 3\u20136 months (5\u201310 months if the abortion was successful), in the case of \"honest women of good reputation\" who received an abortion to \"conceal their frailty\" (''aborto honoris causa'').<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nA very conservative 1922 law to reform the penal code would have eliminated therapeutic abortion and punished women who sought an abortion but maintained the ''aborto honoris causa'', but the law never entered into force. The ''aborto honoris causa'', a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour.<ref name=abortocolombiabook /> The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl.<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=abortocolombiabook />\n\nThe 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the ''aborto honoris causa'' and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000.\n\n\n\n'''<big>Decree 100 of 1980.

The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts. Furthermore, it opined that \"the life of the unborn embodies a fundamental value, for the hope of its existence as a person, and its apparent helplessness requires special attention from the State.\"<ref name=c133-94>{{cite court|vol=Sentencia C-133/94|court=Constitutional Court|date=17 March 1994|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm}}</ref> Thus, Colombia's abortion legislation was constitutional under the State's obligation to protect the life of \"all persons\", which, at the time, the Court claimed \"obviously\" protected life during its formation and development given that these stages were condition for the viability of birth, the origin of the [[Legal personality|legal existence of a person]].<ref name=c133-94 /> In addition, the Court said, if the Constitution gives couples the right to decide their number of children, this right could only be exercised prior to conception since conception creates a being which is existentially distinct from the mother.<ref name=c133-94 />\n\n===Legal situation prior to 2006===\n\nAbortion was legally regulated by articles 122 through 124 of the Colombian Penal Code (law 599 of 2000).

Article 124, finally, allowed for attenuating circumstances: the prescribed penalty for abortion would be reduced by three quarters when the pregnancy was the result of rape or non-consensual artificial insemination.<ref name=penalcode>{{cite act|title=Ley por la cual se expide el C\u00f3digo Penal|type=Law|number=599|language=Spanish|date=2000|article=122-124|url=http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc/ley_0599_2000_pr004.html#122}}</ref>\n\n==Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez's case==\n\nIn 2006, the case of [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] woman [[Martha Gonzalez|Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez]] brought national attention to the issue of abortion in the country.

Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.<ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception.\n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration.\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion.

Second. Declare INHIBITED to issue a substantive pronouncement, due to the substantive ineptitude of the lawsuit, regarding the charges made against articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code (for violation of articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95 of the Political Charter, as well as of the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the United Nations Convention against Torture). Summary of the ruling Citizen Natalia Bernal Cano demanded the constitutionality of articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code. In his opinion, limiting the rights of those who are about to be born, does not know that they are \"innocent living beings capable of feeling pain and that they are attacked with abortive methods when they are in the womb because their human person status is not recognized, holder of rights and obligations \u201d3.

The Court concluded that regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution, the phenomenon of constitutional res judicata operated for what was resolved in judgment C-591 of 1995, reiterated in judgment C-327 of 2016. In effect, it found that on that occasion the Court ruled regarding the constitutionality of the same legal provisions, for the same reasons stated in this application. Additionally, it clarified that the reasons stated by the plaintiff are not sufficient to weaken the existence of res judicata. Therefore, it was resolved in that judgment. On the other hand, the Court determined that the charges for ignorance of the Constitution in its articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95, of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the Convention of the United Nations against Torture did not comply with the minimum requirements demanded by constitutional jurisprudence.

Depending on the contract, other events such as [[terminal illness]] or [[critical illness]] can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses, such as funeral expenses, can also be included in the benefits. \n\nLife policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events.

The [[Presbyterianism in the United States|Presbyterian]] Synods in [[Synod of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and [[Synod of New York|New York City]] created the Corporation for Relief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in 1759; [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] priests organized a similar fund in 1769. Between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started, but fewer than half a dozen survived. In the 1870s, military officers banded together to found both the Army ([[AAFMAA]]) and the [[Navy Mutual Aid Association]] (Navy Mutual), inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the West after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Little Big Horn]], and of the families of U.S. sailors who died at sea.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Parties to contract===\nThe person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner, while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit. The owner and insured may or may not be the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and they will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.\n\n[[File:Chart of a life insurance.jpg|thumb|Chart of a life insurance]]\n\nThe beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured person's death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiary.\n\nIn cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the ''celui qui vit'' or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an [[insurable interest]] in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the [[wrongful death]] of the victim (''Liberty National Life v. Weldon'', 267 Ala.171 (1957)).\n\n===Contract terms===\nSpecial exclusions may apply, such as suicide clauses, whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured dies by [[suicide]] within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification. Most US states specify a maximum contestability period, often no more than two years. Only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claim.\n\nThe face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy [[Maturity (finance)|matures]], although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).\n\n===Costs, insurability, and underwriting===\nThe insurance company calculates the policy prices (premiums) at a level sufficient to fund claims, cover administrative costs, and provide a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by [[actuary|actuaries]]. Mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages. Put simply, people are more likely to die as they get older and the mortality tables enable the insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|title=IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Revenue Ruling 2002-62|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808064248/http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|archivedate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|title=IRS Bulletin No. 2002\u201342|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502202442/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select & Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently.

At the end of 10 years, the mortality of that 25-year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25-year-old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year \u00d7 $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy.) Other costs, such as administrative and sales expenses, also need to be considered when setting the premiums. A 10-year policy for a 25-year-old non-smoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.\n\nMost of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums, but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies. [[Group Insurance]] policies are an exception to this.\n\nIn the United States, life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, with the exception of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine insurability, and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.\n\nMany companies separate applicants into four general categories. These categories are ''preferred best'', ''preferred'', ''standard'', and ''tobacco''. Preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population.

If the insured's death is suspicious and the policy amount is large, the insurer may investigate the circumstances surrounding the death before deciding whether it has an obligation to pay the claim.\n\nPayment from the policy may be as a lump sum or as an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]], which is paid in regular installments for either a specified period or [[Life annuity|for the beneficiary's lifetime]].<ref name=\"OECD2016\">{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Life Annuity Products and Their Guarantees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_GmDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|date=5 December 2016|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-26531-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance vs assurance===\nThe specific uses of the terms \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201cassurance\u201d are sometimes confused. In general, in jurisdictions where both terms are used, \u201cinsurance\u201d refers to providing coverage for an event that ''might'' happen (fire, theft, flood, etc.), while \u201cassurance\u201d is the provision of coverage for an event that is ''certain'' to happen. In the United States, both forms of coverage are called \u201cinsurance\u201d for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} By some definitions, \u201cinsurance\u201d is any coverage that determines benefits based on actual losses whereas \u201cassurance\u201d is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurred.\n\nLife insurance may be divided into two basic classes: temporary and permanent; or the following subclasses: term, universal, [[Whole life insurance|whole life]], and endowment life insurance.\n\n===Term insurance===\n{{Main|Term life insurance}}\n\n[[Term assurance]] provides life insurance coverage for a specified term. The policy does not accumulate cash value. Term insurance is significantly less expensive than an equivalent permanent policy but will become higher with age. Policy holders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs (by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needs).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Black |first1=Kenneth, Jr. |last2=Skipper |first2=Harold D., Jr. |title=Life Insurance |edition=4th |year=1994 |page=94 |isbn=0135329957}}</ref>\n\n''[[Mortgage life insurance]]'' insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments. The face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid.\n\n==== Group life insurance ====\n''Group life insurance'' (also known as ''wholesale life insurance'' or ''institutional life insurance'') is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or [[superannuation]] fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of [[adverse selection]]. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage. The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.\n\n===Permanent life insurance===\n''Permanent life insurance'' is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a [[cash value]] up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.\n\nThe three basic types of permanent insurance are ''whole life'', ''universal life'', and ''endowment''.\n\n====Whole life====\n{{Main|Whole life insurance}}\nWhole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount (see main article for a full explanation of the many variations and options).\n\n====Universal life coverage====\n[[Universal life insurance]] (ULl) is a relatively new insurance product, intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments, along with the potential for greater growth of cash values. There are several types of universal life insurance policies, including ''interest-sensitive'' (also known as \u201ctraditional fixed universal life insurance\u201d), ''variable universal life (VUL)'', ''guaranteed death benefit'', and has ''equity-indexed universal life insurance''.\n\nUniversal life insurance policies have cash values. Paid-in premiums increase their cash values; administrative and other costs reduce their cash values.\n\nUniversal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life\u2014namely that premiums and death benefits are fixed. With universal life, both the premiums and death benefit are flexible. With the exception of guaranteed-death-benefit universal life policies, universal life policies trade their greater flexibility off for fewer guarantees.\n\n\u201cFlexible death benefit\u201d means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit. The death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a \"level death benefit\"; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy's cash value\u2014i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.\n\n====Endowments====\n{{main|Endowment policy}}\nThe endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness.\n\nPolicies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds).\n\nEndowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.\n\n====Accidental death====\nAccidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as the result of an accident. \u201cAccidents\u201d run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from non-accident-related health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policies.\n\nSuch insurance can also be ''[[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]]'' or ''AD&D''. In an AD&D policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearing.\n\nAccidental death and AD&D policies ''very rarely pay'' a benefit, either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident, by which time the premiums have gone unpaid. To know what coverage they have, insureds should always review their policies. Risky activities such as parachuting, flying, professional sports, or military service are often omitted from coverage.\n\nAccidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a [[rider (contract)|rider]]. If a rider is purchased, the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident. This was once called ''[[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] insurance''. In some cases, triple indemnity coverage may be available.\n\n==== Senior and pre-need products ====\nInsurance companies have in recent years developed products for niche markets, most notably targeting seniors in an ageing population. These are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies, allowing senior citizens to purchase affordable insurance later in life. This may also be marketed as ''final expense insurance'' and usually have death benefits between $2,000 and $40,000. One reason for their popularity is that they only require answers to simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, while most policies require a medical exam to qualify. As with other policy types, the range of premiums can vary widely and should be scrutinized prior to purchase, as should the reliability of the companies.\n\nHealth questions can vary substantially between exam and no-exam policies. It may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Because seniors sometimes are not fully aware of the policy provisions it is important to make sure that policies last for a lifetime and that premiums do not increase every 5 years as is common in some circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''Pre-need life insurance policies'' are limited premium payment, whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants, though they are available to everyone. This type of insurance is designed to cover specific [[funeral]] expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a [[funeral home]]. The policy's death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the time of prearrangement, and it then typically grows as interest is credited. In exchange for the policy owner's designation, the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral, no matter when death occurs. Excess proceeds may go either to the insured's estate, a designated beneficiary, or the funeral home as set forth in the contract. Purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement, but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years.\n\n==Related products==\n''Riders'' are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner. A common rider is ''accidental death'' (see above). Another common rider is a ''premium waiver'', which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.\n\n''Joint life insurance'' is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons, with proceeds payable on the death of ''either''.\n\n===Unit Linked Insurance Plans===\n{{Main|Unit-linked insurance plan}}\nThese are unique insurance plans which are basically a mutual fund and term insurance plan rolled into one. The investor doesn't participate in the profits of the plan per se, but gets returns based on the returns on the funds he or she had chosen.\n\nSee the main article for a full explanation of the various features and variations.\n\n===With-profits policies===\n{{Main|With-profits policy}}\nSome policies afford the policyholder a share of the profits of the insurance company\u2014these are termed [[with-profits policy|with-profits policies]]. Other policies provide no rights to a share of the profits of the company\u2014these are ''non-profit'' policies.\n\nWith-profits policies are used as a form of [[collective investment scheme]] to achieve capital growth. Other policies offer a guaranteed return not dependent on the company's underlying investment performance; these are often referred to as ''without-profit'' policies, which may be construed as a misnomer.\n\n==Taxation==\n\n=== India ===\nAccording to the section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (of Indian penal code) premiums paid towards a valid life insurance policy can be exempted from the taxable income. Along with life insurance premium, section 80C allows exemption for other financial instruments such as Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), health insurance premium are some of them. The total amount that can be exempted from the taxable income for section 80C is capped at a maximum of INR 150,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section - 80C, Income-tax Act, 1961-2018:B.\u2014Deductions in respect of certain payments |url=https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/acts/income-tax-act.aspx |website=Income Tax India |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> The exemptions are eligible for individuals (Indian citizens) or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).\n\n===Australia===\nWhere the life insurance is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held outside of the superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see \u201cunder what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the definition of substantially self-employed?\u201d. The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |title=ITAA 1936, Section 279 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093936/http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |archivedate=2011-08-28 }}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nPremiums paid by a [[policyholder]] are not deductible from taxable income, although premiums paid via an approved [[pension fund]] registered in terms of the Income Tax Act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax (whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee). The benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries (again in the case of approved benefits, these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]]). Investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of the policyholder (whether natural person, company-owned, untaxed or a retirement fund).\n\n===United States===\nPremiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state [[income tax]] purposes, and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes.<ref>Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 101(a)(1)</ref> However, if the proceeds are included in the \"estate\" of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state [[Estate tax (United States)|estate and inheritance tax]].\n\nCash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate [[tax shelter]] wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. In flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a ''modified endowment contract'' by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premium.\n\nThe tax ramifications of life insurance are complex. The policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them. As always, both the [[United States Congress]] and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time.\n\nIn 2018, a [[fiduciary]] standard rule on retirement products by the [[United States Department of Labor]] posed a possible risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-industry-outlook.html|title=2018 Insurance Industry Outlook {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nPremiums are not usually deductible against income tax or [[corporation tax]], however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR ([[Life Assurance Premium Relief]]) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).\n\nNon-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or [[capital gains tax]] on a claim. If the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.\n\nQualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10+ years) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher-rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called [[top-slicing]] based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes ([[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s and [[Open-ended investment company|OEICs]]). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the \u201c5% cumulative allowance\u201d\u2014the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the [[HMRC]] (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful [[tax planning]] tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.\n\nThe proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for [[death duty]] (in the UK, [[inheritance tax]]) purposes. Policies written in [[Trust law|trust]] may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an [[independent financial adviser]] and/or a [[solicitor]].\n\n====Pension term assurance====\nAlthough available before April 2006, from this date [[pension term assurance]] became widely available in the UK. Most UK insurers adopted the name \"life insurance with tax relief\" for the product. Pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid at a net of basic rate tax at 22%, and higher-rate tax payers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006.\n\n==Stranger originated==\n''Stranger-originated life insurance'' or [[Stranger-originated life insurance|STOLI]] is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person. Generally, the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured person's death. STOLI has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone (usually an elderly person) to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy. This undermines the primary purpose of life insurance, as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die. In some jurisdictions, there are laws to discourage or prevent STOLI.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nAlthough some aspects of the application process (such as [[underwriting]] and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and [[ fraud]]. In the case of life insurance, there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then [[murder]] the insured. Usually, the larger the claim and/or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation by police and insurer investigators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|title=Fraud: why should you worry?|first=dennis jay, jim quiggle, howard goldblatt, kendra smith, jennifer|last=tchinnosian|website=www.insurancefraud.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113034803/http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|archivedate=13 November 2012}}</ref> The [[television series]] ''[[Forensic Files]]'' has included episodes that feature this scenario. There was also a documented case in Los Angeles in 2006 where two elderly women were accused of taking in homeless men and assisting them. As part of their assistance, they took out life insurance for the men. After the contestability period ended on the policies, the women are alleged to have had the men killed via [[hit-and-run]] vehicular homicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two Elderly Women Indicted on Fraud Charges in Deaths of LA Hit-Run |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=June 1, 2006 |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104095818/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRecently, [[viatical settlement]]s have created problems for life insurance providers. A viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder. The policy holder sells the policy (including the right to name the beneficiary) to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value. The seller has cash in hand, and the purchaser will realize a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser. In the meantime, the purchaser continues to pay the premiums. Although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement, insurers are troubled by this trend. Insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death. They also expect that a certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies. However, viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out. Some purchasers, in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits, have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients, and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased. These policies are guaranteed losses from the insurers' perspective.\n\nOn April 17, 2016, a report by [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' claimed that life insurance companies do not pay significant numbers of beneficiaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|title=Life insurance industry under investigation|website=cbsnews.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208180314/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|archivedate=8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Corporate-owned life insurance]]\n* [[Critical illness insurance]]\n* [[Economic capital]]\n* [[Estate planning]]\n* [[False insurance claims]]\n* [[General insurance]]\n* [[Internal Revenue Code section 79]]\n* [[Life expectancy]]\n* [[Pet insurance]]\n* [[Retirement plan]]ning\n* [[Return of premium life insurance]]\n* [[Segregated fund]]s\n* [[Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance]]\n* [[Term life insurance]]\n* [[Tontine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Specific references===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n* {{cite book|author=Kutty, Shashidharan|title=Managing Life Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU58gTDHwoMC&pg=PT545 |date=12 August 2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Depending on the contract, other events such as [[terminal illness]] or [[critical illness]] can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses, such as funeral expenses, can also be included in the benefits. \n\nLife policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; common examples are claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion.\n\nModern life insurance bears some similarity to the [[asset management]] industry<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/features/industryhandbook/insurance.asp|title=The Industry Handbook: The Insurance Industry|date=2004-01-07|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907000042/https://www.investopedia.com/features/industryhandbook/insurance.asp|archive-date=2018-09-07|url-status=live|language=en-US}}</ref> and life insurers have diversified their products into retirement products such as [[Annuity (American)|annuities]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Industries/Industry_Overview__Life_Insurance.aspx#.W_4wr5NKiAx|title=Industry Overview: Life Insurance|website=www.valueline.com|publisher=[[ValueLine]]|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> \n\n<u>Life-based contracts tend to fall into two major categories:</u>\n\n* Protection policies: designed to provide a benefit, typically a lump sum payment, in the event of a specified occurrence.

The [[Presbyterianism in the United States|Presbyterian]] Synods in [[Synod of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and [[Synod of New York|New York City]] created the Corporation for Relief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in 1759; [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] priests organized a similar fund in 1769. Between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started, but fewer than half a dozen survived. In the 1870s, military officers banded together to found both the Army ([[AAFMAA]]) and the [[Navy Mutual Aid Association]] (Navy Mutual), inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the West after the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Battle of the Little Big Horn]], and of the families of U.S. sailors who died at sea.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Parties to contract===\nThe person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner, while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit. The owner and insured may or may not be the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantor and they will be the person to pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.\n\n[[File:Chart of a life insurance.jpg|thumb|Chart of a life insurance]]\n\nThe beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured person's death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiary.\n\nIn cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the ''celui qui vit'' or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an [[insurable interest]] in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the [[wrongful death]] of the victim (''Liberty National Life v. Weldon'', 267 Ala.171 (1957)).\n\n===Contract terms===\nSpecial exclusions may apply, such as suicide clauses, whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured dies by[[suicide]] within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification. Most US states specify a maximum contestability period, often no more than two years. Only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claim.\n\nThe face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy [[Maturity (finance)|matures]], although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).\n\n===Costs, insurability, and underwriting===\nThe insurance company calculates the policy prices (premiums) at a level sufficient to fund claims, cover administrative costs, and provide a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by [[actuary|actuaries]]. Mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages. Put simply, people are more likely to die as they get older and the mortality tables enable the insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|title=IRS Retirement Plans FAQs regarding Revenue Ruling 2002-62|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808064248/http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=103045,00.html#12|archivedate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|title=IRS Bulletin No. 2002\u201342|website=irs.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502202442/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb02-42.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select & Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently. As well as the basic parameters of age and gender, the newer tables include separate mortality tables for [[smoking|smokers]] and non-smokers, and the CSO tables include separate tables for preferred classes.<ref>[http://www.actuary.org/pdf/life/interim_aug06.pdf \"AAA/SOA Review of the Interim Mortality Tables Developed by Tillinghast and Proposed for Use by the ACLI from the Joint American Academy of Actuaries/Society of Actuaries Review Team\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703192521/http://www.actuary.org/pdf/life/interim_aug06.pdf |date=2007-07-03 }} August 29, 2006</ref>\n\nThe mortality tables provide a baseline for the cost of insurance, but the health and family history of the individual applicant is also taken into account (except in the case of Group policies).

At the end of 10 years, the mortality of that 25-year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25-year-old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year \u00d7 $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy.) Other costs, such as administrative and sales expenses, also need to be considered when setting the premiums. A 10-year policy for a 25-year-old non-smoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.\n\nMost of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums, but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies. [[Group Insurance]] policies are an exception to this.\n\nIn the United States, life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone, with the exception of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] compliance requirements. Insurance companies alone determine insurability, and some people are deemed uninsurable. The policy can be declined or rated (increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk), and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policy.\n\nMany companies separate applicants into four general categories. These categories are ''preferred best'', ''preferred'', ''standard'', and ''tobacco''. Preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population. This may mean, that the proposed insured has no adverse medical history, is not under medication, and has no family history of early-onset [[cancer]], [[diabetes]], or other conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=How do Insurance Rating Classifications Work?|url=http://seniorlifepolicies.com/how-do-insurance-rating-classifications-work/|accessdate=4 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Preferred means that the proposed insured is currently under medication and has a family history of particular illnesses. Most people are in the standard category.\n\nPeople in the tobacco category typically have to pay higher premiums due to the higher mortality.

If the insured's death is suspicious and the policy amount is large, the insurer may investigate the circumstances surrounding the death before deciding whether it has an obligation to pay the claim.\n\nPayment from the policy may be as a lump sum or as an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]], which is paid in regular installments for either a specified period or [[Life annuity|for the beneficiary's lifetime]].<ref name=\"OECD2016\">{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Life Annuity Products and Their Guarantees|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_GmDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|date=5 December 2016|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-26531-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance vs assurance===\nThe specific uses of the terms \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201cassurance\u201d are sometimes confused. In general, in jurisdictions where both terms are used, \u201cinsurance\u201d refers to providing coverage for an event that ''might'' happen (fire, theft, flood, etc.), while \u201cassurance\u201d is the provision of coverage for an event that is ''certain'' to happen. In the United States, both forms of coverage are called \u201cinsurance\u201d for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} By some definitions, \u201cinsurance\u201d is any coverage that determines benefits based on actual losses whereas \u201cassurance\u201d is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurred.\n\nLife insurance may be divided into two basic classes: temporary and permanent; or the following subclasses: term, universal, [[Whole life insurance|whole life]], and endowment life insurance.\n\n===Term insurance===\n{{Main|Term life insurance}}\n\n[[Term assurance]] provides life insurance coverage for a specified term. The policy does not accumulate cash value. Term insurance is significantly less expensive than an equivalent permanent policy but will become higher with age. Policy holders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs (by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needs).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Black |first1=Kenneth, Jr. |last2=Skipper |first2=Harold D., Jr. |title=Life Insurance |edition=4th |year=1994 |page=94 |isbn=0135329957}}</ref>\n\n''[[Mortgage life insurance]]'' insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments. The face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid.\n\n==== Group life insurance ====\n''Group life insurance'' (also known as ''wholesale life insurance'' or ''institutional life insurance'') is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company, members of a union or association, or members of a pension or [[superannuation]] fund. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size, turnover, and financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of [[adverse selection]]. Group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage. The underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals.\n\n===Permanent life insurance===\n''Permanent life insurance'' is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a [[cash value]] up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.\n\nThe three basic types of permanent insurance are ''whole life'', ''universal life'', and ''endowment''.\n\n====Whole life====\n{{Main|Whole life insurance}}\nWhole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount (see main article for a full explanation of the many variations and options).\n\n====Universal life coverage====\n[[Universal life insurance]] (ULl) is a relatively new insurance product, intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments, along with the potential for greater growth of cash values. There are several types of universal life insurance policies, including ''interest-sensitive'' (also known as \u201ctraditional fixed universal life insurance\u201d), ''variable universal life (VUL)'', ''guaranteed death benefit'', and has ''equity-indexed universal life insurance''.\n\nUniversal life insurance policies have cash values. Paid-in premiums increase their cash values; administrative and other costs reduce their cash values.\n\nUniversal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life\u2014namely that premiums and death benefits are fixed. With universal life, both the premiums and death benefit are flexible. With the exception of guaranteed-death-benefit universal life policies, universal life policies trade their greater flexibility off for fewer guarantees.\n\n\u201cFlexible death benefit\u201d means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit. The death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a \"level death benefit\"; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy's cash value\u2014i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.\n\n====Endowments====\n{{main|Endowment policy}}\nThe endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness.\n\nPolicies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds).\n\nEndowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.\n\n====Accidental death====\nAccidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as the result of an accident. \u201cAccidents\u201d run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from non-accident-related health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policies.\n\nSuch insurance can also be ''[[accidental death and dismemberment insurance]]'' or ''AD&D''. In an AD&D policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearing.\n\nAccidental death and AD&D policies ''very rarely pay'' a benefit, either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident, by which time the premiums have gone unpaid. To know what coverage they have, insureds should always review their policies. Risky activities such as parachuting, flying, professional sports, or military service are often omitted from coverage.\n\nAccidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a [[rider (contract)|rider]]. If a rider is purchased, the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident. This was once called ''[[double indemnity (insurance)|double indemnity]] insurance''. In some cases, triple indemnity coverage may be available.\n\n==== Senior and pre-need products ====\nInsurance companies have in recent years developed products for niche markets, most notably targeting seniors in an ageing population. These are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies, allowing senior citizens to purchase affordable insurance later in life. This may also be marketed as ''final expense insurance'' and usually have death benefits between $2,000 and $40,000. One reason for their popularity is that they only require answers to simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions, while most policies require a medical exam to qualify. As with other policy types, the range of premiums can vary widely and should be scrutinized prior to purchase, as should the reliability of the companies.\n\nHealth questions can vary substantially between exam and no-exam policies. It may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}  Because seniors sometimes are not fully aware of the policy provisions it is important to make sure that policies last for a lifetime and that premiums do not increase every 5 years as is common in some circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n''Pre-need life insurance policies'' are limited premium payment, whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants, though they are available to everyone. This type of insurance is designed to cover specific [[funeral]] expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a [[funeral home]]. The policy's death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the time of prearrangement, and it then typically grows as interest is credited. In exchange for the policy owner's designation, the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral, no matter when death occurs. Excess proceeds may go either to the insured's estate, a designated beneficiary, or the funeral home as set forth in the contract. Purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement, but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years.\n\n==Related products==\n''Riders'' are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner. A common rider is ''accidental death'' (see above). Another common rider is a ''premium waiver'', which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.\n\n''Joint life insurance'' is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons, with proceeds payable on the death of ''either''.\n\n===Unit Linked Insurance Plans===\n{{Main|Unit-linked insurance plan}}\nThese are unique insurance plans which are basically a mutual fund and term insurance plan rolled into one. The investor doesn't participate in the profits of the plan per se, but gets returns based on the returns on the funds he or she had chosen.\n\nSee the main article for a full explanation of the various features and variations.\n\n===With-profits policies===\n{{Main|With-profits policy}}\nSome policies afford the policyholder a share of the profits of the insurance company\u2014these are termed [[with-profits policy|with-profits policies]]. Other policies provide no rights to a share of the profits of the company\u2014these are ''non-profit'' policies.\n\nWith-profits policies are used as a form of [[collective investment scheme]] to achieve capital growth. Other policies offer a guaranteed return not dependent on the company's underlying investment performance; these are often referred to as ''without-profit'' policies, which may be construed as a misnomer.\n\n==Taxation==\n\n=== India ===\nAccording to the section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (of Indian penal code) premiums paid towards a valid life insurance policy can be exempted from the taxable income. Along with life insurance premium, section 80C allows exemption for other financial instruments such as Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), National Savings Certificate (NSC), health insurance premium are some of them. The total amount that can be exempted from the taxable income for section 80C is capped at a maximum of INR 150,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section - 80C, Income-tax Act, 1961-2018:B.\u2014Deductions in respect of certain payments |url=https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/acts/income-tax-act.aspx |website=Income Tax India |accessdate=6 November 2018}}</ref> The exemptions are eligible for individuals (Indian citizens) or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF).\n\n===Australia===\nWhere the life insurance is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held outside of the superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see \u201cunder what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the definition of substantially self-employed?\u201d. The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |title=ITAA 1936, Section 279 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828093936/http://law.ato.gov.au/atolaw/view.htm?docid=%22AID%2FAID201076%2F00001%22 |archivedate=2011-08-28 }}</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nPremiums paid by a [[policyholder]] are not deductible from taxable income, although premiums paid via an approved [[pension fund]] registered in terms of the Income Tax Act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax (whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee). The benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries (again in the case of approved benefits, these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from [[South African Revenue Service|SARS]]). Investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of the policyholder (whether natural person, company-owned, untaxed or a retirement fund).\n\n===United States===\nPremiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state [[income tax]] purposes, and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes.<ref>Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 101(a)(1)</ref> However, if the proceeds are included in the \"estate\" of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state [[Estate tax (United States)|estate and inheritance tax]].\n\nCash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate [[tax shelter]] wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. In flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a ''modified endowment contract'' by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premium.\n\nThe tax ramifications of life insurance are complex. The policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them. As always, both the [[United States Congress]] and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time.\n\nIn 2018, a [[fiduciary]] standard rule on retirement products by the [[United States Department of Labor]] posed a possible risk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-industry-outlook.html|title=2018 Insurance Industry Outlook {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nPremiums are not usually deductible against income tax or [[corporation tax]], however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR ([[Life Assurance Premium Relief]]) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).\n\nNon-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or [[capital gains tax]] on a claim. If the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.\n\nQualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10+ years) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher-rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called [[top-slicing]] based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes ([[unit trust]]s, [[investment trust]]s and [[Open-ended investment company|OEICs]]). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the \u201c5% cumulative allowance\u201d\u2014the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the [[HMRC]] (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful [[tax planning]] tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.\n\nThe proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for [[death duty]] (in the UK, [[inheritance tax]]) purposes. Policies written in [[Trust law|trust]] may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an [[independent financial adviser]] and/or a [[solicitor]].\n\n====Pension term assurance====\nAlthough available before April 2006, from this date [[pension term assurance]] became widely available in the UK. Most UK insurers adopted the name \"life insurance with tax relief\" for the product. Pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid at a net of basic rate tax at 22%, and higher-rate tax payers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006.\n\n==Stranger originated==\n''Stranger-originated life insurance'' or [[Stranger-originated life insurance|STOLI]] is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person. Generally, the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured person's death. STOLI has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone (usually an elderly person) to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy. This undermines the primary purpose of life insurance, as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die. In some jurisdictions, there are laws to discourage or prevent STOLI.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nAlthough some aspects of the application process (such as [[underwriting]] and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and [[ fraud]]. In the case of life insurance, there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then [[murder]] the insured. Usually, the larger the claim and/or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation by police and insurer investigators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|title=Fraud: why should you worry?|first=dennis jay, jim quiggle, howard goldblatt, kendra smith, jennifer|last=tchinnosian|website=www.insurancefraud.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113034803/http://www.insurancefraud.org/impact_statmnt.htm|archivedate=13 November 2012}}</ref> The [[television series]] ''[[Forensic Files]]'' has included episodes that feature this scenario. There was also a documented case in Los Angeles in 2006 where two elderly women were accused of taking in homeless men and assisting them. As part of their assistance, they took out life insurance for the men. After the contestability period ended on the policies, the women are alleged to have had the men killed via [[hit-and-run]] vehicular homicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Two Elderly Women Indicted on Fraud Charges in Deaths of LA Hit-Run |publisher=Insurance Journal |date=June 1, 2006 |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104095818/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2006/06/01/69022.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nRecently, [[viatical settlement]]s have created problems for life insurance providers. A viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder. The policy holder sells the policy (including the right to name the beneficiary) to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value. The seller has cash in hand, and the purchaser will realize a [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser. In the meantime, the purchaser continues to pay the premiums. Although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement, insurers are troubled by this trend. Insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death. They also expect that a certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies. However, viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out. Some purchasers, in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits, have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients, and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased. These policies are guaranteed losses from the insurers' perspective.\n\nOn April 17, 2016, a report by [[Lesley Stahl]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' claimed that life insurance companies do not pay significant numbers of beneficiaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|title=Life insurance industry under investigation|website=cbsnews.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208180314/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-life-insurance-investigation-lesley-stahl/|archivedate=8 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Corporate-owned life insurance]]\n* [[Critical illness insurance]]\n* [[Economic capital]]\n* [[Estate planning]]\n* [[False insurance claims]]\n* [[General insurance]]\n* [[Internal Revenue Code section 79]]\n* [[Life expectancy]]\n* [[Pet insurance]]\n* [[Retirement plan]]ning\n* [[Return of premium life insurance]]\n* [[Segregated fund]]s\n* [[Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance]]\n* [[Term life insurance]]\n* [[Tontine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Specific references===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n* {{cite book|author=Kutty, Shashidharan|title=Managing Life Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yU58gTDHwoMC&pg=PT545 |date=12 August 2008|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

Broccoli has large [[flower head]]s, usually dark green in color, arranged in a tree-like structure branching out from a thick [[plant stem|stalk]] which is usually light green. The mass of flower heads is surrounded by leaves. Broccoli resembles [[cauliflower]], which is a different cultivar group of the same ''Brassica'' species.
