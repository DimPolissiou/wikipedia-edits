Smith described it as a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]  in which he received instruction from [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus Christ]]. \n\nAccording to the account Smith told in 1838, he went to the woods to pray about which church to join but fell into the grip of an evil power that nearly overcame him. At the last moment, he was rescued by two shining \"Personages\" (implied to be [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus]]) who hovered above him. One of the beings told Smith not to join any existing churches because all taught incorrect doctrines.\n\nSmith wrote several accounts of the vision between 1832 and 1842, two of which were published in his lifetime. <ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/first-vision-accounts |title= First Vision Accounts |work= churchofjesuschrist.org |publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}</ref> Consistency of the accounts is a subject of debate, whether variations are indicators of significant shifts in Smith's theology or are simply changing emphasis of minor details. <ref>James B.

Online at: http://signaturebookslibrary.org/inventing-mormonism-01/</ref>  Manchester land assessment records show an increase in assessed value of the Smith property in 1823. Because the tax assessment of the Smiths' Manchester land rose in 1823, critics argue that the Smiths completed their Manchester cabin in 1822, which suggests an approximate date of 1824 for the First Vision. Joseph Smith, Sr. was first taxed for Manchester land in 1820. In 1821 and 1822, the land was valued at $700, but in 1823, the property was assessed at $1000, which may indicate \"that the Smiths had completed construction of their cabin and cleared a significant portion of their land\".<ref>{{harv|Vogel|2000|pp=443\u201344}}</ref> In response, some Mormon apologists argue that in 1818, the Smiths mistakenly constructed a cabin 59 feet north of the actual property line (which would have been in Palmyra rather than Manchester) and the 1823 increase in the property assessment was related to the completion of a wood frame home on the Manchester side of the Palmyra\u2013Manchester township line. The latter interpretation would lend support for dating the First Vision to 1820.<ref>{{Harv|Ray|2002|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> <ref>For a counter argument\u2014that there was a second cabin on the Smith property in Manchester\u2014see {{harvnb|Vogel|2000|pp=416\u201319}}. Vogel argues that based on archaeological and documentary evidence, the Manchester cabin was constructed prior to the Smiths' building of their frame home. \"To argue for the existence of only the Jennings cabin, which the Smiths inadvertently built on the Palmyra side of the township line, one must assume that the error was perpetuated not only by the Smiths but also by authorities in both counties. However, the existence of the names of Joseph Sr., Alvin, and Hyrum on the Palmyra road lists for 1820\u201322 strongly argues that both the Smiths and village authorities understood that the cabin was in Palmyra township.\"(419)</ref>\n\n====Dating the Revival====\n[[File:Methodist camp meeting (1819 engraving).jpg|250px|thumb|left|Typical scene from a Methodist camp meeting]]\n[[Richard Bushman]] wrote that Smith \"began to be concerned about religion in late 1817 or early 1818, when the aftereffects of the revival of 1816 and 1817 were still being felt.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=37}}</ref> [[Milton V. Backman]] wrote that religious outbreaks occurred in 1819\u201320 within a fifty-mile radius of Smith's home: \"Church records, newspapers, religious journals, and other contemporary sources clearly reveal that great awakenings occurred in more than fifty western New York towns or villages during the revival of 1819\u20131820 .... Primary sources also specify that great multitudes joined the Methodist, Presbyterian, and Calvinist Baptist societies in the region of country where Joseph Smith lived.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Backman|1969|p=11}}</ref> [[Richard Lloyd Anderson]] has pointed out that there was a Methodist Camp Meeting in Palmyra in 1818, with about 400 in attendance, that is verified by a contemporary journal.

However, the [[fair copy]], penned by the same scribe as the draft copy, and which was in the possession of Lucy and on which she registered a copyright, includes in the narrative a copy of the 1838 version of the first vision, beginning with Joseph's words \"I was at this time in my fifteenth year.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=73}}</ref> After the first vision account, Lucy continues with \"From this time until the 21st of Sep. 1823, Joseph continued as usual to labor with his father; and nothing during this interval occured [sic] of very great importance...\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=78}}</ref> At this point Lucy describes the visitations of Moroni and the promise of the golden plates, followed by the death of [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]], in November 1823.\n\nLucy then states that she and some of her children sought comfort in the religious revival after Alvin's death. This statement has been taken to refer to her and three of the children ([[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel]], and Sophronia) joining the Presbyterian church.<ref>\"Lucy said that soon after Alvin's death, Palmyra experienced 'a great revival in religion, and the whole neighborhood was very much aroused to the subject, and we among the rest flocked to meeting house to see if there was a word of comfort for us that might relieve our over charged feelings.' She eventually decided to join the Presbyterian church.\"{{Harv|Vogel|2004|p=58}}.</ref> If so, and if Joseph's statement that they joined this church in the same year as his first vision is accurate, then the first vision would have taken place in 1824.<ref>[[Marvin Hill]] has written, \"I am inclined to agree that the religious turmoil that Smith described which led to some family members joining the Presbyterians and to much sectarian bitterness does not fit well into the 1820 context detailed by Backman. ... Indicating that the angel had told Smith of the plates prior to the revival, Lucy added that for a long time after Alvin's death the family could not bear any talk about the golden plates, for the subject had been one of great interest to him and any reference to the plates stirred sorrowful memories. She said she attended the revival with hope of gaining solace for Alvin's loss. That kind of detail is just the sort that gives validity to Lucy's chronology. She would not have been likely to make up such a reaction for herself or the family nor mistake the time when it happened.

Allen]] notes that:\n\n<blockquote> The fact that none of the available contemporary writings about Joseph Smith in the 1830s, none of the publications of the Church in that decade, and no contemporary journal or correspondence yet discovered mentions the story of the first vision is convincing evidence that at best it received only limited circulation in those early days.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1966}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===1830s reference to early Christian regeneration===\n\nIn June 1830, Smith provided the first clear record of a significant personal religious experience prior to the visit of the [[angel Moroni]].<ref>The account was first published to non-Mormons in 1831. {{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref> At that time, Smith and his associate [[Oliver Cowdery]] were establishing the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], the first [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] church.  In the \"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ,\" Smith recounted his early history, noting\n\n<blockquote>\"For, after that it truly was manifested unto [Smith] that he had received remission of his sins, he was entangled again in the vanities of the world, but after truly repenting, God visited him by an holy angel ... and gave unto him power, by the means which was before prepared that he should translate a book.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNo further explanation of this \"manifestation\" is provided. Although the reference was later linked to the First Vision,<ref>{{Harvtxt|Allen|1980|p=45}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=39, 112}}.</ref> its original hearers would have understood the manifestation as simply another of many revival experiences in which the subject testified that his sins had been forgiven.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}.</ref>\n\n===1832 Smith account===\nThe earliest extant account of the First Vision was handwritten by Smith in 1832 in a letter book, but its existence was not known outside the Church History department until it was published in 1965.<ref>\"One of the most significant documents of that period yet discovered was brought to light in 1965 by [[Paul R. Cheesman]], a graduate student at Brigham Young University. This is a handwritten manuscript apparently composed about 1833 and either written or dictated by Joseph Smith. It contains an account of the early experiences of the Mormon prophet and includes the story of the first vision. While the story varies in some details from the version presently accepted, enough is there to indicate that at least as early as 1833 Joseph Smith contemplated writing and perhaps publishing it. The manuscript has apparently lain in the L.D.S. Church Historian's office for many years, and yet few if any who saw it realized its profound historical significance.\" {{harv|Allen|1966|p=35}}</ref>  Sometime around 1930, the pages on which the account was written were torn from the letter book, removed from the Church Historian's collection and placed into a private safe in the custody of Apostle [[Joseph Fielding Smith]].  In 1952, General Authority [[Levi E. Young]] met with amateur historian LaMar Peterson and told him of a \"strange account\" in Joseph's handwriting that did not mention God the Father.  In 1964, Peterson told [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] about the account, and they subsequently asked permission from Joseph Fielding Smith to see it, but were denied.  In 1964, Smith authorized the showing of the account to Paul R. Cheesman, a BYU student working on his master's thesis.  The Tanner's obtained a copy of the thesis transcript and the account was published for the first time in 1965.<ref>Stan Larson ''Another Look at Joseph Smith's First Vision'' Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol. 47, No. 2 (Summer 2014), pp. 37-62.

In one issue, Cowdery explained that Smith was confused by the different religions and local revivals during his \"15th year\" (1820), leading him to wonder which church was true. In the next issue of the biography, Cowdery explained that reference to Smith's \"15th year\" was a typographical error, and that actually the revivals and religious confusion took place in Smith's \"17th year.\"\n\nTherefore, according to Cowdery, the religious confusion led Smith to pray in his bedroom, late on the night of September 23, 1823, after the others had gone to sleep, to know which of the competing denominations was correct and whether \"a Supreme being did exist.\" In response, an angel appeared and granted him forgiveness of his sins. The remainder of the story roughly parallels Smith's later description of a visit by an angel in 1823 who told him about the [[golden plates]]. Thus, Cowdery's account, containing a single vision, differs from Smith's 1832 account, which contains two separate visions, one in 1821 prompted by religious confusion (the First Vision) and a separate one regarding the plates on September 22, 1822. Cowdery's account also differs from Smith's 1842 account, which includes a First Vision in 1820 and a second vision on September 22, 1823.\n\n===1835 Smith accounts===\nOn November 9, 1835, Smith dictated an account of the First Vision in his diary after telling it to a stranger<ref>The stranger was [[Robert Matthews (religious figure)|Robert Matthias]], a religious con-artist using the alias \"Joshua the Jewish minister\". Bushman, ''Rough Stone Rolling'', 275-76.</ref> who had visited his home earlier that day.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=22\u201324}}.</ref> Smith said that when perplexed about religions matters, he had gone to a grove to pray<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=23}}.</ref> but that his tongue seemed swollen in his mouth and that he had been interrupted twice by the sound of someone walking behind him.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref> Finally, as he prayed, he said his tongue was loosed, and he saw a pillar of fire in which an unidentified \"personage\" appeared.<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\">{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=24}}.</ref> Then another unidentified personage told Smith his sins were forgiven and \"testified unto [Smith] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> An interlineation in the text notes, \"and I saw many angels in this vision.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith said this vision occurred when he was 14 years old and that when he was 17, he \"saw another vision of angels in the night season after I had retired to bed\" (referring to the later visit of the [[angel Moroni]] who showed him the location of the [[golden plates]]).<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith identified none of these personages or angels with \"the Lord\" as he had in 1832.<ref>Abanes,{{specify|date=April 2012}} 16: [http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html the 1835 account] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414033852/http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html |date=April 14, 2005 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}. In 1835, Smith approved the \"[[Lectures on Faith]]\", an orderly presentation of Mormonism (probably written by [[Sidney Rigdon]]) in which it was taught that although Jesus Christ had a tangible body of flesh, God the Father was a spiritual presence\u2014a view not out of harmony with orthodox Christian belief. The \"Lectures on Faith\" were canonized by the LDS Church and included as part of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] until de-canonized after 1921. (Bushman,''Rough Stone Rolling'', 283\u201384.)</ref>\n\nA few days later, on November 14, 1835, Smith told the story to another visitor, Erastus Holmes.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=35}}.</ref> In his journal, Smith said that he had recited his life story \"up to the time I received the first visitation of angels, which was when I was about fourteen years old.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=35\u201336}}. When LDS Church historian [[B. H. Roberts]] included this account into his ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':312, he changed the words \"first visitation of angels\" to \"first vision.\"</ref>\n\n===1838 Smith account===\n\nIn 1838, Smith began dictating a history, introduced as \"I have been induced to write this history ... in relation both to myself and the Church.\"<ref>The original 1838 manuscript has been lost, but the account was copied to manuscripts dating from 1839, which indicates that the year of writing was 1838, a fact also confirmed by Smith's journal entries. See {{Harvtxt|Jessee|1969|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> This history included a new account of the First Vision, later published in three issues of ''[[Times and Seasons]]''.<ref>''[[Times and Seasons]]'', March and April, vol. 3 nos. 9, 11.</ref> This version was later incorporated into the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], which was canonized by the LDS Church in 1880, as [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]]. Thus, it is often called the [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng \"canonized version\"] of the First Vision story.\n\nThis version differs from the 1840 version because it includes the proclamation, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him\" from one of the personages, whereas the 1840 version does not. The canonized version says that in the spring of 1820, during a period of \"confusion and strife among the different denominations\" following an \"unusual excitement on the subject of religion\", Smith had debated which of the various Christian groups he should join. While in turmoil, he read from the [[Epistle of James]]: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"<ref>James 1:5; [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]].</ref>\n\nOne morning, deeply impressed by this scripture, the fourteen-year-old Smith went to the woods near his home, knelt, and began his first vocal prayer. Almost immediately he was confronted by an evil power that prevented speech. A darkness gathered around him, and Smith believed that he would be destroyed. He continued the prayer silently, asking for God's assistance though still resigned to destruction. At this moment a light brighter than the sun descended towards him, and he was delivered from the evil power.\n\nIn the light, Smith \"saw two personages standing in the air\". One pointed to the other and said, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him.\" Smith asked which religious sect he should join and was told to join none of them because all existing religions had corrupted the teachings of Jesus Christ.<ref>''See'' [[Great Apostasy]].</ref>\n\nIn his 1838 account, Smith wrote that he made an oblique reference to the vision to his mother in 1820, telling her the day it happened that he had \"learned for [him]self that [[Presbyterian]]ism is not true.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6}}</ref> Lucy did not mention this conversation in her memoirs in her own words, but included the narrative from Joseph's 1838 account directly.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1853|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= http://woodlandinstitute.com/joseph/first-vision/pubSeerPg5JosephSmith1838.php |title=The First Vision: 1838 Joseph Smith History Account |work=Woodland Institute |publisher=[[Richard N.

Porter, the Methodist minister, George Lane, may have passed very near the Smith home and preached at a camp meeting along the way in July 1820. \"In the pursuit of his ministerial duties Rev. Lane was in the geographical proximity of Joseph Smith on a number of occasions between the years 1819-1825. The nature degree or indeed the actuality of their acquaintanceship during this interval poses a number of interesting possibilities ....

The biggest trap is comparing description in one report with silence in another. By assuming that what is not said is not known, some come up with arbitrary theories of an evolution in the Prophet's story. Yet we often omit parts of an episode because of the chance of the moment, not having time to tell everything, or deliberately stressing only a part of the original event in a particular situation.

Early adherents were unaware of the details of the vision until 1840, when the earliest accounts were published in [[Great Britain]]. An account of the First Vision was not published in the United States until 1842, shortly before [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]]. [[Jan Shipps]] has written that the vision was \"practically unknown\" until an account of it was published in 1842.<ref>{{harvnb|Shipps|1985|p=30}}. The first extant account of the First Vision is the manuscript account in Joseph Smith, \"Manuscript History of the Church\" (1839); the first published account is Orson Pratt, \"An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and of the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records\" (Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840); and the first American publication is Smith's letter to John Wentworth in ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''3''' (March 1842): 706\u201308, only two years before Smith's assassination. (These accounts are available {{harvnb|Vogel|1996}})</ref> LDS historian [[Richard Bushman]] wrote, \"At first, Joseph was reluctant to talk about his vision. Most early converts probably never heard about the 1820 vision.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Interpretation and use by the LDS Church===\nAccording to the LDS Church, the vision teaches that God the Father and Jesus Christ are separate beings with glorified bodies of flesh and bone; that mankind was literally created in the image of God; that Satan is real but God infinitely greater; that God hears and answers prayer; that no other contemporary church had the fullness of Christ's gospel; and that revelation has not ceased.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the 21st century, the vision features prominently in the Church's program of proselytism.<ref>{{harvnb|Widmer|2000|p=92}}</ref>\n\nAn official website of the LDS Church calls the First Vision \"the greatest event in world history since the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://josephsmith.net/article/the-first-vision |title=The First Vision |date=9 September 2013 |work=JosephSmith.net |publisher=LDS Church }}</ref> In 1998, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B.

It was the parting of the curtain to open this, the dispensation of the fullness of times. Nothing on which we base our doctrine, nothing we teach, nothing we live by is of greater importance than this initial declaration. I submit that if Joseph Smith talked with God the Father and His Beloved Son, then all else of which he spoke is true.

And that's exactly where we stand, with a conviction in our hearts that it is true: that Joseph went into the [Sacred] Grove; that he saw the Father and the Son; that he talked with them; that Moroni came; that the Book of Mormon was translated from the plates; that the priesthood was restored by those who held it anciently.

In reading his bible, he was remarkably struck with the passage in James, 1st chapter, 5th verse, 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.' Believing in the word of God, he retired into a grove, and called upon the Lord to give him wisdom in relation to this matter. While he was thus engaged, he was surrounded by a brilliant light, and two glorious personages presented themselves before him, who exactly resembled each other in features, and who gave him information upon the subjects which had previously agitated his mind. He was given to understand that the churches were all of them in error in regard to many things; and he was commanded not to go after them; and he received a promise that the 'fulness' of the gospel should at some future time be unfolded unto him: after which the vision withdrew, leaving his mind in a state of calmness and peace.\"\n\nJohn Taylor, Letter to the Editor of the Interpreter Anglais et Fran\u00e7ais, Boulogne-sur-mer (25 June 1850).{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> and he may have alluded to it in a discourse given in 1859.<ref>\"What could the Lord do with such a pack of ignorant fools as we were?

Backman]] said that although \"the tools of the historian\" could neither verify nor challenge the First Vision, \"records of the past can be examined to determine the reliability of Joseph's description regarding the historical setting.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Backman|1969|p=2}}</ref> [[Grant H. Palmer|Grant Palmer]] and other critics claim that there are serious discrepancies between the various accounts, as well as [[anachronisms]] revealed by lack of contemporary corroboration.<ref>A recent skeptical summary of the First Vision stories is [[Grant H. Palmer|Grant Palmer]], ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 235\u201354. Palmer, a retired LDS religious instructor was [[Excommunication (LDS Church)|disfellowshipped]] by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after publishing this book. Palmer concludes his chapter, \"The 1832 account describes Joseph's experience most accurately. Smith's 1832 description does not forbid him from joining a church, nor does it mention a revival or persecution. Instead, he became convicted of his sins from reading the scriptures and received forgiveness from the Savior in a personal epiphany. He stated that his call to God's work came in 1823 from an angel, later identified as Moroni. When a crisis developed around the Book of Mormon in 1838, he conflated several events into one. Now he was called by God the Father and Jesus Christ in 1820 during an extended revival, was forbidden to join any existing church, and was greatly persecuted by institutions and individuals for sharing his vision of God. This version is not supported by historical evidence.\" (253\u201354)</ref>\n\nLeaders of the LDS Church have acknowledged that the First Vision as well as the [[Book of Mormon]] and Smith himself constitute \"stumbling blocks for many.\" [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Neal A. Maxwell]] wrote:\n<blockquote>In our own time, Joseph Smith, the First Vision, and the Book of Mormon constitute stumbling blocks for many\u2014around which they cannot get\u2014unless they are meek enough to examine all the evidence at hand, not being exclusionary as a result of accumulated attitudes in a secular society. Humbleness of mind is the initiator of expansiveness of mind.<ref>Neal A. Maxwell, ''Meek and Lowly'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987) p. 76.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary, [[Richard Mouw]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Theology|theologian]] and student of Mormonism, summarized his feelings about the First Vision:\n<blockquote>My instinct is to attribute a sincerity to Joseph Smith. And yet at the same time, as an evangelical Christian, I do not believe that the members of the godhead really appeared to him and told him that he should start on a mission of, among other things, denouncing the kinds of things that I believe as a Presbyterian. I can't believe that. And yet at the same time, I really don't believe that he was simply making up a story that he knew to be false in order to manipulate people and to gain power over a religious movement. And so I live with the mystery.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/etc/script.html |contribution=Part One (Night One Transcript) |title=The Mormons |author=''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]'' and ''[[American Experience]]'' |editor=[[Helen Whitney]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|title-link=The Mormons (film) }}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Side by Side Comparison of Joseph Smith Vision Accounts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | Summer 1832 History<ref>\"History, circa Summer 1832,\" p. 1, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/1</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | November 1835 Journal<ref>\"Journal, 1835\u20131836,\" p. 23, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-1835-1836/24</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | 1838 History<ref>\"History, circa June 1839\u2013circa 1841 [Draft 2],\" p. 2, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-june-1839-circa-1841-draft-2/2</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | 1842 Wentworth Letter<ref>\"\u201cChurch History,\u201d 1 March 1842,\" p. 706, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/church-history-1-march-1842/1</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My mind became exceedingly distressed, for I became convicted of my sins, and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith, and there was no society or denomination that was built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God.\n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nBeing wrought up in my mind respecting the subject of religion, and looking at the different systems taught the children of men, I knew not who was right or who was wrong. \n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nMy mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.\n\nIn the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be aright, which is it, and how shall I know it?\n\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | When about fourteen years of age, I began to reflect upon the importance of being prepared for a future state, and upon enquiring about the plan of salvation, I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment; if I went to one society, they referred me to one plan, and another to another, each one pointing to his own particular creed as the summum bonum of perfection. Considering that all could not be right, and that God could not be the author of so much confusion, I determined to investigate the subject more fully, believing that if God had a church it would not be split up into factions, and that if he taught one society to worship one way, and administer in one set of ordinances, he would not teach another principles which were diametrically opposed. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | For I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, and also the moon, rolling in their majesty through the heavens, and also the stars shining in their courses, and the earth also upon which I stood, and the beasts of the \ufb01eld, and the fowls of heaven, and the \ufb01sh of the waters, and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty, whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceedingly great and marvelous, even in the likeness of him who created them. And when I considered upon these things, my heart exclaimed, \u201cWell hath the wise man said, \u2018It is a fool that saith in his heart, there is no God.\u2019\u201d My heart exclaimed, \u201cAll, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power, a being who maketh laws and decreeth and bindeth all things in their bounds, who \ufb01lleth eternity, who was and is and will be from all eternity to eternity.\u201d And I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nAnd considering it of the first importance that I should be right in matters that involve eternal consequences, being thus perplexed in mind I retired to the silent grove and bowed down before the Lord, under a realizing sense that he had said (if the Bible be true), \u201cAsk, and you shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened; seek, and you shall find,\u201d and again, \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\u201d  Information was what I most desired at this time, and with a fixed determination to obtain it, \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nWhile I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\nNever did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.\n\nAt length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to \u201cask of God,\u201d concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nBelieving the word of God, I had confidence in the declaration of James; \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.\u201d\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| Therefore, I cried unto the Lord for mercy, for there was none else to whom I could go and obtain mercy.  And the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness, and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord, in the sixteenth year of my age,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I called upon the Lord for the first time in the place above stated. Or in other words, I made a fruitless attempt to pray; my tongue seemed to be swollen in my mouth, so that I could not utter. I heard a noise behind me, like some person walking towards me. I strove again to pray but could not. The noise of walking seemed to draw nearer. I sprung up on my feet and looked around but saw no person or thing that was calculated to produce the noise of walking.\n\nI kneeled again. My mouth was opened and my tongue liberated, and I called on the Lord in mighty prayer. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nSo, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.\n\nAfter I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.  But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction\u2014not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being\u2014just at this moment of great alarm,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nI retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord.  While fervently engaged in supplication, my mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, \n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun at noonday came down from above and rested upon me. I was \ufb01lled with the spirit of God, and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| A pillar of fire appeared above my head. It presently rested down upon me and filled me with joy unspeakable. A personage appeared in the midst of this pillar of flame, which was spread all around and yet nothing consumed. Another personage soon appeared, like unto the first. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.\n\nIt no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noonday. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | And he spake unto me, saying, \u201cJoseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, and none doeth good, no, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo, I come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father.\u201d\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| He said unto me, \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d He testified unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God. And I saw many angels in this vision.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)\u2014and which I should join.\n\nI was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: \u201cthey draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\u201d\n\nHe again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| They told me that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom. And I was expressly commanded to \u201cgo not after them,\u201d at the same time receiving a promise that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My soul was \ufb01lled with love, and for many days I could rejoice with great joy. The Lord was with me, but I could \ufb01nd none that would believe the heavenly vision. Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I was about fourteen years old when I received this first communication.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, \u201cNever mind, all is well\u2014I am well enough off.\u201d I then said to my mother, \u201cI have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.\u201d It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Allen\n | first = James B.\n | author-link = James B.

Online at: http://signaturebookslibrary.org/inventing-mormonism-01/</ref>  Manchester land assessment records show an increase in assessed value of the Smith property in 1823. Because the tax assessment of the Smiths' Manchester land rose in 1823, critics argue that the Smiths completed their Manchester cabin in 1822, which suggests an approximate date of 1824 for the First Vision. Joseph Smith, Sr. was first taxed for Manchester land in 1820. In 1821 and 1822, the land was valued at $700, but in 1823, the property was assessed at $1000, which may indicate \"that the Smiths had completed construction of their cabin and cleared a significant portion of their land\".<ref>{{harv|Vogel|2000|pp=443\u201344}}</ref> In response, some Mormon apologists argue that in 1818, the Smiths mistakenly constructed a cabin 59 feet north of the actual property line (which would have been in Palmyra rather than Manchester) and the 1823 increase in the property assessment was related to the completion of a wood frame home on the Manchester side of the Palmyra\u2013Manchester township line. The latter interpretation would lend support for dating the First Vision to 1820.<ref>{{Harv|Ray|2002|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> <ref>For a counter argument\u2014that there was a second cabin on the Smith property in Manchester\u2014see {{harvnb|Vogel|2000|pp=416\u201319}}. Vogel argues that based on archaeological and documentary evidence, the Manchester cabin was constructed prior to the Smiths' building of their frame home. \"To argue for the existence of only the Jennings cabin, which the Smiths inadvertently built on the Palmyra side of the township line, one must assume that the error was perpetuated not only by the Smiths but also by authorities in both counties. However, the existence of the names of Joseph Sr., Alvin, and Hyrum on the Palmyra road lists for 1820\u201322 strongly argues that both the Smiths and village authorities understood that the cabin was in Palmyra township.\"(419)</ref>\n\n====Dating the Revival====\n[[File:Methodist camp meeting (1819 engraving).jpg|250px|thumb|left|Typical scene from a Methodist camp meeting]]\n[[Richard Bushman]] wrote that Smith \"began to be concerned about religion in late 1817 or early 1818, when the aftereffects of the revival of 1816 and 1817 were still being felt.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=37}}</ref> [[Milton V.

However, the [[fair copy]], penned by the same scribe as the draft copy, and which was in the possession of Lucy and on which she registered a copyright, includes in the narrative a copy of the 1838 version of the first vision, beginning with Joseph's words \"I was at this time in my fifteenth year.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=73}}</ref> After the first vision account, Lucy continues with \"From this time until the 21st of Sep. 1823, Joseph continued as usual to labor with his father; and nothing during this interval occured [sic] of very great importance...\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=78}}</ref> At this point Lucy describes the visitations of Moroni and the promise of the golden plates, followed by the death of [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]], in November 1823.\n\nLucy then states that she and some of her children sought comfort in the religious revival after Alvin's death. This statement has been taken to refer to her and three of the children ([[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel]], and Sophronia) joining the Presbyterian church.<ref>\"Lucy said that soon after Alvin's death, Palmyra experienced 'a great revival in religion, and the whole neighborhood was very much aroused to the subject, and we among the rest flocked to meeting house to see if there was a word of comfort for us that might relieve our over charged feelings.' She eventually decided to join the Presbyterian church.\"{{Harv|Vogel|2004|p=58}}.</ref> If so, and if Joseph's statement that they joined this church in the same year as his first vision is accurate, then the first vision would have taken place in 1824.<ref>[[Marvin Hill]] has written, \"I am inclined to agree that the religious turmoil that Smith described which led to some family members joining the Presbyterians and to much sectarian bitterness does not fit well into the 1820 context detailed by Backman. ... Indicating that the angel had told Smith of the plates prior to the revival, Lucy added that for a long time after Alvin's death the family could not bear any talk about the golden plates, for the subject had been one of great interest to him and any reference to the plates stirred sorrowful memories. She said she attended the revival with hope of gaining solace for Alvin's loss. That kind of detail is just the sort that gives validity to Lucy's chronology. She would not have been likely to make up such a reaction for herself or the family nor mistake the time when it happened. I am persuaded that it was 1824 when Lucy joined the Presbyterians.\" {{Harv|Hill|1982|p=39}}.</ref> However, this conclusion requires ignoring both Joseph's statement that the first vision occurred during his fifteenth year and Lucy's chronology in the fair copy.

Allen (historian)|James B. Allen]] notes that:\n\n<blockquote> The fact that none of the available contemporary writings about Joseph Smith in the 1830s, none of the publications of the Church in that decade, and no contemporary journal or correspondence yet discovered mentions the story of the first vision is convincing evidence that at best it received only limited circulation in those early days.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1966}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===1830s reference to early Christian regeneration===\n\nIn June 1830, Smith provided the first clear record of a significant personal religious experience prior to the visit of the [[angel Moroni]].<ref>The account was first published to non-Mormons in 1831. {{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref> At that time, Smith and his associate [[Oliver Cowdery]] were establishing the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], the first [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint]] church.  In the \"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ,\" Smith recounted his early history, noting\n\n<blockquote>\"For, after that it truly was manifested unto [Smith] that he had received remission of his sins, he was entangled again in the vanities of the world, but after truly repenting, God visited him by an holy angel ... and gave unto him power, by the means which was before prepared that he should translate a book.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNo further explanation of this \"manifestation\" is provided. Although the reference was later linked to the First Vision,<ref>{{Harvtxt|Allen|1980|p=45}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=39, 112}}.</ref> its original hearers would have understood the manifestation as simply another of many revival experiences in which the subject testified that his sins had been forgiven.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}.</ref>\n\n===1832 Smith account===\nThe earliest extant account of the First Vision was handwritten by Smith in 1832 in a letter book, but its existence was not known outside the Church History department until it was published in 1965.<ref>\"One of the most significant documents of that period yet discovered was brought to light in 1965 by [[Paul R. Cheesman]], a graduate student at Brigham Young University. This is a handwritten manuscript apparently composed about 1833 and either written or dictated by Joseph Smith. It contains an account of the early experiences of the Mormon prophet and includes the story of the first vision. While the story varies in some details from the version presently accepted, enough is there to indicate that at least as early as 1833 Joseph Smith contemplated writing and perhaps publishing it. The manuscript has apparently lain in the L.D.S. Church Historian's office for many years, and yet few if any who saw it realized its profound historical significance.\" {{harv|Allen|1966|p=35}}</ref>  Sometime around 1930, the pages on which the account was written were torn from the letter book, removed from the Church Historian's collection and placed into a private safe in the custody of Apostle [[Joseph Fielding Smith]].  In 1952, General Authority [[Levi E. Young]] met with amateur historian LaMar Peterson and told him of a \"strange account\" in Joseph's handwriting that did not mention God the Father.  In 1964, Peterson told [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] about the account, and they subsequently asked permission from Joseph Fielding Smith to see it, but were denied.  In 1964, Smith authorized the showing of the account to Paul R. Cheesman, a BYU student working on his master's thesis.  The Tanner's obtained a copy of the thesis transcript and the account was published for the first time in 1965.<ref>Stan Larson ''Another Look at Joseph Smith's First Vision'' Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol. 47, No. 2 (Summer 2014), pp. 37-62.

In one issue, Cowdery explained that Smith was confused by the different religions and local revivals during his \"15th year\" (1820), leading him to wonder which church was true. In the next issue of the biography, Cowdery explained that reference to Smith's \"15th year\" was a typographical error, and that actually the revivals and religious confusion took place in Smith's \"17th year.\"\n\nTherefore, according to Cowdery, the religious confusion led Smith to pray in his bedroom, late on the night of September 23, 1823, after the others had gone to sleep, to know which of the competing denominations was correct and whether \"a Supreme being did exist.\" In response, an angel appeared and granted him forgiveness of his sins. The remainder of the story roughly parallels Smith's later description of a visit by an angel in 1823 who told him about the [[golden plates]]. Thus, Cowdery's account, containing a single vision, differs from Smith's 1832 account, which contains two separate visions, one in 1821 prompted by religious confusion (the First Vision) and a separate one regarding the plates on September 22, 1822. Cowdery's account also differs from Smith's 1842 account, which includes a First Vision in 1820 and a second vision on September 22, 1823.\n\n===1835 Smith accounts===\nOn November 9, 1835, Smith dictated an account of the First Vision in his diary after telling it to a stranger<ref>The stranger was [[Robert Matthews (religious figure)|Robert Matthias]], a religious con-artist using the alias \"Joshua the Jewish minister\". Bushman, ''Rough Stone Rolling'', 275-76.</ref> who had visited his home earlier that day.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=22\u201324}}.</ref> Smith said that when perplexed about religions matters, he had gone to a grove to pray<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=23}}.</ref> but that his tongue seemed swollen in his mouth and that he had been interrupted twice by the sound of someone walking behind him.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref> Finally, as he prayed, he said his tongue was loosed, and he saw a pillar of fire in which an unidentified \"personage\" appeared.<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\">{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=24}}.</ref> Then another unidentified personage told Smith his sins were forgiven and \"testified unto [Smith] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> An interlineation in the text notes, \"and I saw many angels in this vision.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith said this vision occurred when he was 14 years old and that when he was 17, he \"saw another vision of angels in the night season after I had retired to bed\" (referring to the later visit of the [[angel Moroni]] who showed him the location of the [[golden plates]]).<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith identified none of these personages or angels with \"the Lord\" as he had in 1832.<ref>Abanes,{{specify|date=April 2012}} 16: [http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html the 1835 account] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414033852/http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html |date=April 14, 2005 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}. In 1835, Smith approved the \"[[Lectures on Faith]]\", an orderly presentation of Mormonism (probably written by [[Sidney Rigdon]]) in which it was taught that although Jesus Christ had a tangible body of flesh, God the Father was a spiritual presence\u2014a view not out of harmony with orthodox Christian belief. The \"Lectures on Faith\" were canonized by the LDS Church and included as part of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] until de-canonized after 1921. (Bushman,''Rough Stone Rolling'', 283\u201384.)</ref>\n\nA few days later, on November 14, 1835, Smith told the story to another visitor, Erastus Holmes.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=35}}.</ref> In his journal, Smith said that he had recited his life story \"up to the time I received the first visitation of angels, which was when I was about fourteen years old.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=35\u201336}}. When LDS Church historian [[B. H. Roberts]] included this account into his ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':312, he changed the words \"first visitation of angels\" to \"first vision.\"</ref>\n\n===1838 Smith account===\n\nIn 1838, Smith began dictating a history, introduced as \"I have been induced to write this history ... in relation both to myself and the Church.\"<ref>The original 1838 manuscript has been lost, but the account was copied to manuscripts dating from 1839, which indicates that the year of writing was 1838, a fact also confirmed by Smith's journal entries. See {{Harvtxt|Jessee|1969|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> This history included a new account of the First Vision, later published in three issues of ''[[Times and Seasons]]''.<ref>''[[Times and Seasons]]'', March and April, vol. 3 nos. 9, 11.</ref> This version was later incorporated into the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], which was canonized by the LDS Church in 1880, as [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]]. Thus, it is often called the [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng \"canonized version\"] of the First Vision story.\n\nThis version differs from the 1840 version because it includes the proclamation, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him\" from one of the personages, whereas the 1840 version does not. The canonized version says that in the spring of 1820, during a period of \"confusion and strife among the different denominations\" following an \"unusual excitement on the subject of religion\", Smith had debated which of the various Christian groups he should join. While in turmoil, he read from the [[Epistle of James]]: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"<ref>James 1:5; [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]].</ref>\n\nOne morning, deeply impressed by this scripture, the fourteen-year-old Smith went to the woods near his home, knelt, and began his first vocal prayer. Almost immediately he was confronted by an evil power that prevented speech. A darkness gathered around him, and Smith believed that he would be destroyed. He continued the prayer silently, asking for God's assistance though still resigned to destruction. At this moment a light brighter than the sun descended towards him, and he was delivered from the evil power.\n\nIn the light, Smith \"saw two personages standing in the air\". One pointed to the other and said, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him.\" Smith asked which religious sect he should join and was told to join none of them because all existing religions had corrupted the teachings of Jesus Christ.<ref>''See'' [[Great Apostasy]].</ref>\n\nIn his 1838 account, Smith wrote that he made an oblique reference to the vision to his mother in 1820, telling her the day it happened that he had \"learned for [him]self that [[Presbyterian]]ism is not true.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6}}</ref> Lucy did not mention this conversation in her memoirs in her own words, but included the narrative from Joseph's 1838 account directly.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1853|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= http://woodlandinstitute.com/joseph/first-vision/pubSeerPg5JosephSmith1838.php |title=The First Vision: 1838 Joseph Smith History Account |work=Woodland Institute |publisher=[[Richard N.

However, [[Stephen Prothero]] argues that any historian should expect to find differences in narratives written many years apart, and that the key elements are present in all the accounts.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Jesus: How the Son of God Became a National Icon Publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux| year=2003 |page=171}} (\"Any good lawyer (or historian) would expect to find contradictions or competing narratives written down years apart and decades after the event.

In each case, God tells him to remain aloof from all Christian denominations, as something better is in store.\")</ref>\n\nSome believers view differences in the accounts as overstated. [[Richard L. Anderson]] wrote, \"What are the main problems of interpreting so many accounts? The first problem is the interpreter. One person perceives harmony and interconnections while another overstates differences.\"<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"One person perceives harmony and interconnections while another overstates differences. Think of how you retell a vivid event in your life\u2014marriage, first day on the job, or an automobile accident. A record of all your comments would include short and long versions, along with many bits and pieces. Only by blending these glimpses can an outsider reconstruct what originally happened. The biggest trap is comparing description in one report with silence in another. By assuming that what is not said is not known, some come up with arbitrary theories of an evolution in the Prophet's story. Yet we often omit parts of an episode because of the chance of the moment, not having time to tell everything, or deliberately stressing only a part of the original event in a particular situation. This means that any First Vision account contains some fraction of the whole experience. Combining all reliable reports will recreate the basics of Joseph Smith's quest and conversation with the Father and Son.\"{{Harv|Anderson|1996}}</ref> Other believers view the differences in the accounts as reflective of Smith's increase in maturity and knowledge over time.<ref>\"I've actually studied the various accounts of Joseph's First Vision, and I'm struck by the difference in his recountings.

Early adherents were unaware of the details of the vision until 1840, when the earliest accounts were published in [[Great Britain]]. An account of the First Vision was not published in the United States until 1842, shortly before [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]]. [[Jan Shipps]] has written that the vision was \"practically unknown\" until an account of it was published in 1842.<ref>{{harvnb|Shipps|1985|p=30}}. The first extant account of the First Vision is the manuscript account in Joseph Smith, \"Manuscript History of the Church\" (1839); the first published account is Orson Pratt, \"An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and of the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records\" (Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840); and the first American publication is Smith's letter to John Wentworth in ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''3''' (March 1842): 706\u201308, only two years before Smith's assassination.

Most early converts probably never heard about the 1820 vision.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Interpretation and use by the LDS Church===\nAccording to the LDS Church, the vision teaches that God the Father and Jesus Christ are separate beings with glorified bodies of flesh and bone; that mankind was literally created in the image of God; that Satan is real but God infinitely greater; that God hears and answers prayer; that no other contemporary church had the fullness of Christ's gospel; and that revelation has not ceased.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the 21st century, the vision features prominently in the Church's program of proselytism.<ref>{{harvnb|Widmer|2000|p=92}}</ref>\n\nAn official website of the LDS Church calls the First Vision \"the greatest event in world history since the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://josephsmith.net/article/the-first-vision |title=The First Vision |date=9 September 2013 |work=JosephSmith.net |publisher=LDS Church }}</ref> In 1998, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B.

Nothing on which we base our doctrine, nothing we teach, nothing we live by is of greater importance than this initial declaration.

In reading his bible, he was remarkably struck with the passage in James, 1st chapter, 5th verse, 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.' Believing in the word of God, he retired into a grove, and called upon the Lord to give him wisdom in relation to this matter. While he was thus engaged, he was surrounded by a brilliant light, and two glorious personages presented themselves before him, who exactly resembled each other in features, and who gave him information upon the subjects which had previously agitated his mind. He was given to understand that the churches were all of them in error in regard to many things; and he was commanded not to go after them; and he received a promise that the 'fulness' of the gospel should at some future time be unfolded unto him: after which the vision withdrew, leaving his mind in a state of calmness and peace.\"\n\nJohn Taylor, Letter to the Editor of the Interpreter Anglais et Fran\u00e7ais, Boulogne-sur-mer (25 June 1850).{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> and he may have alluded to it in a discourse given in 1859.<ref>\"What could the Lord do with such a pack of ignorant fools as we were?

The summary following the excerpt (10) emphasizes the importance of the Book of Mormon, but makes no additional comment about the First Vision.</ref>\n\n===Church of Christ (Temple Lot)===\nThe [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], a branch with 7000 adherents, rejects many of Smith's post-1832 revelations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.churchofchrist-tl.org/history.html |title=History of the Church of Christ |work=churchofchrist-tl.org |publisher=[[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421070901/http://www.churchofchrist-tl.org/history.html |archivedate=2008-04-21}}</ref> Nevertheless, the church uses several elements of the 1842 account of the First Vision, including Smith's desire to know which church he should join, his reading of James 1:5, his prayer in the grove, the appearance of God the Father and Jesus Christ, the statement by Jesus that all existing churches were corrupt, and the instruction that Smith should join none of them.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.churchofchrist-tl.org/mormon.html#how |title=Book of Mormon: How did we get it |work=|publisher=Church of Christ (Temple Lot) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420182348/http://www.churchofchrist-tl.org/mormon.html#how |archivedate=2008-04-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Criticism and response===\nWriting of the \"unusual excitement on the subject of religion\" described in the First Vision story canonized by the LDS Church, [[Milton V.

Palmer|Grant Palmer]], ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 235\u201354. Palmer, a retired LDS religious instructor was [[Excommunication (LDS Church)|disfellowshipped]] by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after publishing this book. Palmer concludes his chapter, \"The 1832 account describes Joseph's experience most accurately. Smith's 1832 description does not forbid him from joining a church, nor does it mention a revival or persecution. Instead, he became convicted of his sins from reading the scriptures and received forgiveness from the Savior in a personal epiphany. He stated that his call to God's work came in 1823 from an angel, later identified as Moroni. When a crisis developed around the Book of Mormon in 1838, he conflated several events into one. Now he was called by God the Father and Jesus Christ in 1820 during an extended revival, was forbidden to join any existing church, and was greatly persecuted by institutions and individuals for sharing his vision of God. This version is not supported by historical evidence.\" (253\u201354)</ref>\n\nLeaders of the LDS Church have acknowledged that the First Vision as well as the [[Book of Mormon]] and Smith himself constitute \"stumbling blocks for many.\" [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Neal A. Maxwell]] wrote:\n<blockquote>In our own time, Joseph Smith, the First Vision, and the Book of Mormon constitute stumbling blocks for many\u2014around which they cannot get\u2014unless they are meek enough to examine all the evidence at hand, not being exclusionary as a result of accumulated attitudes in a secular society. Humbleness of mind is the initiator of expansiveness of mind.<ref>Neal A. Maxwell, ''Meek and Lowly'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987) p. 76.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary, [[Richard Mouw]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Theology|theologian]] and student of Mormonism, summarized his feelings about the First Vision:\n<blockquote>My instinct is to attribute a sincerity to Joseph Smith. And yet at the same time, as an evangelical Christian, I do not believe that the members of the godhead really appeared to him and told him that he should start on a mission of, among other things, denouncing the kinds of things that I believe as a Presbyterian. I can't believe that. And yet at the same time, I really don't believe that he was simply making up a story that he knew to be false in order to manipulate people and to gain power over a religious movement.

I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God.\n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nBeing wrought up in my mind respecting the subject of religion, and looking at the different systems taught the children of men, I knew not who was right or who was wrong. \n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nMy mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.\n\nIn the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be aright, which is it, and how shall I know it?\n\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | When about fourteen years of age, I began to reflect upon the importance of being prepared for a future state, and upon enquiring about the plan of salvation, I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment; if I went to one society, they referred me to one plan, and another to another, each one pointing to his own particular creed as the summum bonum of perfection. Considering that all could not be right, and that God could not be the author of so much confusion, I determined to investigate the subject more fully, believing that if God had a church it would not be split up into factions, and that if he taught one society to worship one way, and administer in one set of ordinances, he would not teach another principles which were diametrically opposed. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | For I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, and also the moon, rolling in their majesty through the heavens, and also the stars shining in their courses, and the earth also upon which I stood, and the beasts of the \ufb01eld, and the fowls of heaven, and the \ufb01sh of the waters, and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty, whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceedingly great and marvelous, even in the likeness of him who created them. And when I considered upon these things, my heart exclaimed, \u201cWell hath the wise man said, \u2018It is a fool that saith in his heart, there is no God.\u2019\u201d My heart exclaimed, \u201cAll, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power, a being who maketh laws and decreeth and bindeth all things in their bounds, who \ufb01lleth eternity, who was and is and will be from all eternity to eternity.\u201d And I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nAnd considering it of the first importance that I should be right in matters that involve eternal consequences, being thus perplexed in mind I retired to the silent grove and bowed down before the Lord, under a realizing sense that he had said (if the Bible be true), \u201cAsk, and you shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened; seek, and you shall find,\u201d and again, \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\u201d  Information was what I most desired at this time, and with a fixed determination to obtain it, \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nWhile I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\nNever did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.\n\nAt length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to \u201cask of God,\u201d concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nBelieving the word of God, I had confidence in the declaration of James; \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.\u201d\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| Therefore, I cried unto the Lord for mercy, for there was none else to whom I could go and obtain mercy.  And the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness, and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord, in the sixteenth year of my age,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I called upon the Lord for the first time in the place above stated. Or in other words, I made a fruitless attempt to pray; my tongue seemed to be swollen in my mouth, so that I could not utter. I heard a noise behind me, like some person walking towards me. I strove again to pray but could not. The noise of walking seemed to draw nearer. I sprung up on my feet and looked around but saw no person or thing that was calculated to produce the noise of walking.\n\nI kneeled again. My mouth was opened and my tongue liberated, and I called on the Lord in mighty prayer. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nSo, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.\n\nAfter I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.  But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction\u2014not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being\u2014just at this moment of great alarm,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nI retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord.  While fervently engaged in supplication, my mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, \n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun at noonday came down from above and rested upon me. I was \ufb01lled with the spirit of God, and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| A pillar of fire appeared above my head. It presently rested down upon me and filled me with joy unspeakable. A personage appeared in the midst of this pillar of flame, which was spread all around and yet nothing consumed. Another personage soon appeared, like unto the first. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.\n\nIt no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noonday. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | And he spake unto me, saying, \u201cJoseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, and none doeth good, no, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo, I come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father.\u201d\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| He said unto me, \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d He testified unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God. And I saw many angels in this vision.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)\u2014and which I should join.\n\nI was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: \u201cthey draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\u201d\n\nHe again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| They told me that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom. And I was expressly commanded to \u201cgo not after them,\u201d at the same time receiving a promise that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My soul was \ufb01lled with love, and for many days I could rejoice with great joy. The Lord was with me, but I could \ufb01nd none that would believe the heavenly vision. Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I was about fourteen years old when I received this first communication.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, \u201cNever mind, all is well\u2014I am well enough off.\u201d I then said to my mother, \u201cI have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.\u201d It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Allen\n | first = James B.\n | author-link = James B.

Health care is delivered in Australia by both government and private companies which are often covered by [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]]. Health care in Australia is largely funded by the government at national, state and local governmental levels, as well as by private [[health insurance]]; but the cost of health care is also borne by not-for-profit organisations, with a significant cost being borne by individual patients or by charity. Some services are provided by volunteers, especially remote and mental health services.\n\nThe federal government-administered [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] insurance scheme covers much of the cost of [[Primary care|primary]] and [[Allied health professions|allied]] health care services. The government provides the majority of spending (67%) through Medicare and other programs.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |author = Australian Institute of Health and Welfare |year=2018 |title = Australia's Health 2018 |url = https://www.aihw.gov.au/getmedia/7c42913d-295f-4bc9-9c24-4e44eff4a04a/aihw-aus-221.pdf.aspx?inline=true |series = Australia's Health |volume = 16 |publisher = AIHW |author-link=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare }}</ref> Individuals contribute more than half of the non-government funding.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMedicare is a [[Single-payer healthcare|single-payer]] [[universal health care]] scheme that covers all Australian citizens and permanent residents, with other programs covering specific groups, such as veterans or Indigenous Australians, and various compulsory insurance schemes cover personal injury resulting from workplace or vehicle incidents. Medicare is funded by a [[Medicare levy]], which currently is a 2% levy on residents\u2019 taxable income over a certain income. Higher income earners pay an additional levy (called a Medicare Levy Surcharge) if they do not have private health insurance. Residents with certain medical conditions, foreign residents, some low-income earners, and those not eligible for Medicare benefits may apply for an exemption from paying the levy, and some low-income earners can apply for reductions to the levy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/Medicare-levy-exemption/?default|title=Medicare levy exemption|last=Office|first=Australian Taxation|website=www.ato.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/medicare-levy/medicare-levy-reduction-for-low-income-earners/?default|title=Medicare levy reduction for low-income earners|last=Office|first=Australian Taxation|website=www.ato.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, the [[Howard Government]] introduced the [[health care in Australia#private health insurance rebate|private health insurance rebate]] scheme, under which the government contributed up to 30% of the private health insurance premium of people covered by Medicare. Including these rebates, Medicare is the major component of the total Commonwealth health budget, taking up about 43% of the total.

Government funding is through the [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] scheme, which subsidises out-of-hospital medical treatment and funds free treatment in a public hospital.\n\nIn Australia, health insurance is provided by a number of health insurance organizations, called health funds. Such insurance is optional, and covers the cost of treatment as a private patient in a hospital, and may provide \u201cextras\u201d cover.\n\n* '''Hospital cover'''. Medicare covers the cost of treatment as a public patient at a public hospital for elective treatments as well as emergency or medically necessary treatments. A public patient is a person whose treatment is covered by Medicare, while a private patient is one whose treatment is covered by a health fund, with no Medicare contribution. There are a number of community objections to being a public patient in a public hospital, including the lack of choice of doctors or carers, long waiting lists, etc., and many people who take out health insurance do so to be treated as a private patient in either a public hospital or a private hospital. A private patient in a public hospital is entitled to a doctor of their choice, and cover for accommodation in a ward, and theatre fees for surgery. A person without insurance cover must resort to being a public patient at a public hospital or else carry the cost alone.\n* '''Extras cover'''. Some non-medical or allied health services are not covered by Medicare or by standard health insurance, such as dentistry, medical devices and alternative medicine. A person may in addition or as an alternative take out \u201cextras\u201d cover for such treatments. What services are covered and how much is reimbursed and caps that apply vary between funds.\n\nHealth funds cannot differentiate in insurance premiums because of individual customers' age, gender, or other underlying risk factors.\n\nThe largest health fund with a 26.9% market share is [[Medibank]]. Medibank was set up to provide competition to private \"for-profit\" health funds. Although formerly government-owned, the fund operated as a [[government business enterprise]] from 2009 until it was privatised in 2014, operating as a fully commercialized business paying tax and dividends under the same regulatory regime as do all other registered private health funds. Medibank was privatised in 2014 and became for-profit. Australian health funds can be either 'for profit' including [[Bupa]] and [[nib Health Funds|nib]]; [[mutual insurance|'mutual']] including [[Australian Unity]]; or [[non-profit organization|'non-profit']] including [[GMHBA Limited|GMHBA]], [[HCF Health Insurance]] and [[CBHS Health Fund]]. Some have membership restricted to particular groups, some focus on specific regions \u2013 like [[HBF Health Fund]] which centres on [[Western Australia]], but the majority have open membership.<ref>{{citation |url=http://phiac.gov.au/resources/file/PHIAC%20Annual%20Report%202009-10%20WEB.pdf|title=Private Health Insurance Administration Council, Annual Report 2009-10|publisher=Private Health Insurance Administration Council|accessdate=18 March 2012|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321173818/http://phiac.gov.au/resources/file/PHIAC%20Annual%20Report%202009-10%20WEB.pdf|archivedate=21 March 2012}}</ref> Membership to most of these funds is also accessible using a comparison websites or the decision assistance sites. These sites operate on a commission-basis agreement with their participating health funds and allow consumers to compare policies before joining online.\n\nMost aspects of health insurance in Australia are regulated by the ''Private Health Insurance Act 2007''. Complaints and reporting of the health industry is carried out by an independent government agency, the [[Private Health Insurance Ombudsman]].<ref>[http://www.phio.org.au Private Health Insurance Ombudsman (PHIO)]</ref> The ombudsman publishes an annual report that outlines the number and nature of complaints per health fund compared to their market share.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.phio.org.au/publications/publications/annual-reports.aspx |title=PHIO's Annual Reports |access-date=3 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106181338/http://www.phio.org.au/publications/publications/annual-reports.aspx |archive-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe private health system in Australia operates on a \"community rating\" basis, whereby premiums do not vary solely because of a person's previous [[medical history]], current state of health, or (generally speaking) their age (but see Lifetime Health Cover Loading below).<ref name=\"health.gov.au\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/Publishing.nsf/Content/health-privatehealth-consumers-glossary.htm |title=Private Health Insurance in Australia |access-date=19 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904020319/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-privatehealth-consumers-glossary.htm |archive-date=4 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Balancing this are waiting periods, in particular for pre-existing conditions (usually referred to within the industry as PEA, which stands for \"pre-existing ailment\"). Funds are entitled to impose a waiting period of up to 12 months on benefits for any medical condition the signs and symptoms of which existed during the six months ending on the day the person first took out insurance.  They are also entitled to impose a 12-month waiting period for benefits for treatment relating to an obstetric condition, and a 2-month waiting period for all other benefits when a person first takes out private insurance.<ref name=\"health.gov.au\"/>\n\nFunds have the discretion to reduce or remove such waiting periods in individual cases. They are also free not to impose them, to begin with, but this would place such a fund at risk of \"[[adverse selection]]\", attracting a disproportionate number of members from other funds, or from the pool of intending members who might otherwise have joined other funds. It would also attract people with existing [[medical conditions]], who might not otherwise have taken out insurance at all because of the denial of benefits for 12 months due to the PEA Rule.  The benefits paid out for these conditions would create pressure on premiums for all the fund's members, causing some to drop their membership, which would lead to further rises, and a vicious cycle would ensue.\n\nHealth funds are not permitted to discriminate between members in terms of premiums, benefits or membership on the basis of racial origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, nature of employment, and leisure activities. Premiums for a fund's product that is sold in more than one state can vary from state to state, but not within the same state.\n\n===Incentives===\nA number of incentives encourage people to take out and maintain private hospital insurance, including:\n\n* '''Lifetime Health Cover Loading''': If a person has not taken out private hospital cover by 1 July after their 31st birthday, then when (and if) they do so after this time, their premiums must include a loading of 2% per annum. Thus, a person taking out private cover for the first time at age 40 will pay a 20% loading. The loading continues for 10 years. The loading applies only to premiums for hospital cover, not to ancillary (extras) cover.\n* '''[[Medicare levy surcharge]]''': People whose \"income for MLS purposes\" is greater than a specified amount and who do not have an \"appropriate level of cover\"<ref name=\"private\"/> pay the MLS in addition to the standard Medicare levy.\n* '''[[Private health insurance rebate]]''':  The government subsidises the premiums for all health insurance cover, including hospital and ancillary (extras), by 10%, 20% or 30%. In May 2009, The Rudd Labor government announced that as of June 2010, the rebate would become means-tested and offered on a sliding scale.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Medicare levy surcharge===\nThe government encourages individuals with income above a set level to privately insure. This is done by charging these (higher income) individuals a [[Medicare Levy Surcharge|surcharge]] of 1% to 1.5% of income if they do not take out [[Health insurance#Australia|health insurance]], and a means-tested rebate. This is to encourage individuals who are perceived as able to afford private insurance not to resort to the public health system,<ref name=\"mls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm |title=Medicare Levy Surcharge |publisher=Private Health Insurance Ombudsman |accessdate=11 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822191713/http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm |archive-date=22 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> even though people with valid private health insurance may still elect to use the public system if they wish.\n\nThe [[Howard Government|Howard Coalition government]] introduced a Medicare levy surcharge (MLS) with effect from 1 July 1997, as an incentive for people on higher incomes to take out and maintain an appropriate level of private [[Health insurance#Australia|health insurance]],<ref name=\"private\">[https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/medicare-levy/private-health-insurance-rebate/?anchor=Appropriatelevelofprivatehospitalinsuran#Appropriatelevelofprivatehospitalinsuran Private health insurance rebate]</ref> as part of an effort to reduce demand pressure on public hospitals by encouraging people to have insurance cover for them to use private hospitals.<ref name=\"ATOMLS\">ATO: [https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/Medicare-levy-surcharge/ Medicare levy surcharge]</ref> Individuals can take out health insurance to cover out-of-pocket costs, with either a plan that covers just selected services, to a full coverage plan. In practice, a person with health insurance may still be left with out-of-pocket payments, as services in private hospitals often cost more than the insurance payment.\n\nInitially, MLS of 1% applied to individuals and families who did not have an \u201cappropriate level of cover\u201c and whose taxable income was above a prescribed threshold. In 1997, the MLS threshold was $90,000 for individuals or $180,000 for families.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicare Levy Surcharge|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/Medicare-levy-surcharge/|website=www.ato.gov.au|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> The threshold increased by $1,500 for each dependent child after the first in the family group.\n\nSince 1 July 2012, the basis of the threshold has been \"income for MLS purposes\", which includes the individual's or family group's taxable income, [[reportable fringe benefit|fringe benefits]], [[reportable superannuation contribution|superannuation contributions]] and net investment losses.\n\nIn 2014, the surcharge rate was increased from 1% to 1.25% for those with MLS income over $105,000, from $97,000, and 1.5% for those on incomes over $140,000, from $130,000; and the threshold amounts are doubled for families.\n\nThe MLS is calculated at the surcharge rate on the whole of an individual's MLS income, and not just the amount above the MLS threshold. The minimum MLS amount is $900.\n\nThe requirement that a higher-income earner have an \u201cappropriate level of private hospital cover\u201d is satisfied under the government's new four-tier hospital insurance structure introduced in 2019 by a basic hospital insurance cover. Extras or add-on insurance alone does not qualify.\n\n===Private health insurance rebate===\nIn 1999, the [[Howard Government]] introduced the private health insurance rebate scheme, under which the government contributed up to 30% of the private health insurance premium of people covered by Medicare. The program was estimated to cost $18.3 billion in 2007\u201308.<ref name=budget07/> In 2009, before means testing was introduced, the private health insurance rebate was estimated to cost $4 billion, around 20% of the total budget.<ref name=\"Metherell\"/> The overall figure was projected to rise by almost 4% annually in real terms in 2007.<ref name = budget07/>\n\nSince 2009, the rebate has been income- and age-tested. For a single person whose \"income for MLS purposes\" is less than $90,000 a year, or $180,000 for a family, the rebate is 25.1% (1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020), covering both hospital and extras cover. The rebate phases down over those amounts and cuts out at $140,000 for a single person, and double for a family.<ref>PrivateHealth.gov.au [http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/insurancerebate.htm Australian Government Private Health Insurance Rebate]</ref> The rebate can be claimed as a premium reduction or as a refundable tax offset.<ref>ATO, [https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Income-and-deductions/Offsets-and-rebates/Health-insurance/ Health insurance]</ref>\n\nDebates regarding Medicare focus on the two-tier system and the role of private health insurance. Controversial issues include:\n\n* whether people with means should take up private health insurance\n* whether rebates/incentives should be given in terms of private health insurance\n* people with health insurance still accessing the tax-payer funded public system rather than relying on their insurance\n* people with private health insurance are not required to pay the Medicare Levy Surcharge.<ref name=\"ATOMLS\"/>\n\nCritics argue that the rebate is an unfair subsidy to those who can afford health insurance, claiming the money would be better spent on public hospitals where it would benefit everyone. Supporters argue that people must be encouraged into the private health care system, claiming the public system is not universally sustainable for the future.

This has led to a number bankruptcies in the Dental field.\n\n'''Corporatisation of the Dental industry'''\n\nThe Australian Dental Association [ADA] set quality and care standards for the industry, but provide no standardised pricing schedule for services and treatment. Large corporate dental practices, which have a wide footprint, often have check-up and service KPIs. As there is no standard pricing schedule, this can quite often leave patients with large expenses, and on occasion unnecessary treatment. It also leads to cases where identical treatment plans can have drastically different pricing. <Ref>https://www.choice.com.au/health-and-body/dentists-and-dental-care/dental-treatment/articles/dental-fees</Ref>\n\n'''Increased Scope of Dental Auxiliaries'''\n\nFurther relaxation of standards has lead to training of Dental Auxiliaries in some dental procedures.

Government funding is through the [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] scheme, which subsidises out-of-hospital medical treatment and funds free treatment in a public hospital.\n\nIn Australia, health insurance is provided by a number of health insurance organizations, called health funds. Such insurance is optional, and covers the cost of treatment as a private patient in a hospital, and may provide \u201cextras\u201d cover.\n\n* '''Hospital cover'''. Medicare covers the cost of treatment as a public patient at a public hospital for elective treatments as well as emergency or medically necessary treatments. A public patient is a person whose treatment is covered by Medicare, while a private patient is one whose treatment is covered by a health fund, with no Medicare contribution. There are a number of community objections to being a public patient in a public hospital, including the lack of choice of doctors or carers, long waiting lists, etc., and many people who take out health insurance do so to be treated as a private patient in either a public hospital or a private hospital. A private patient in a public hospital is entitled to a doctor of their choice, and cover for accommodation in a ward, and theatre fees for surgery. A person without insurance cover must resort to being a public patient at a public hospital or else carry the cost alone.\n* '''Extras cover'''. Some non-medical or allied health services are not covered by Medicare or by standard health insurance, such as dentistry, medical devices and alternative medicine. A person may in addition or as an alternative take out \u201cextras\u201d cover for such treatments. What services are covered and how much is reimbursed and caps that apply vary between funds.\n\nHealth funds cannot differentiate in insurance premiums because of individual customers' age, gender, or other underlying risk factors.\n\nThe largest health fund with a 26.9% market share is [[Medibank]]. Medibank was set up to provide competition to private \"for-profit\" health funds. Although formerly government-owned, the fund operated as a [[government business enterprise]] from 2009 until it was privatised in 2014, operating as a fully commercialized business paying tax and dividends under the same regulatory regime as do all other registered private health funds. Medibank was privatised in 2014 and became for-profit. Australian health funds can be either 'for profit' including [[Bupa]] and [[nib Health Funds|nib]]; [[mutual insurance|'mutual']] including [[Australian Unity]]; or [[non-profit organization|'non-profit']] including [[GMHBA Limited|GMHBA]], [[HCF Health Insurance]] and [[CBHS Health Fund]]. Some have membership restricted to particular groups, some focus on specific regions \u2013 like [[HBF Health Fund]] which centres on [[Western Australia]], but the majority have open membership.<ref>{{citation |url=http://phiac.gov.au/resources/file/PHIAC%20Annual%20Report%202009-10%20WEB.pdf|title=Private Health Insurance Administration Council, Annual Report 2009-10|publisher=Private Health Insurance Administration Council|accessdate=18 March 2012|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321173818/http://phiac.gov.au/resources/file/PHIAC%20Annual%20Report%202009-10%20WEB.pdf|archivedate=21 March 2012}}</ref> Membership to most of these funds is also accessible using a comparison websites or the decision assistance sites. These sites operate on a commission-basis agreement with their participating health funds and allow consumers to compare policies before joining online.\n\nMost aspects of health insurance in Australia are regulated by the ''Private Health Insurance Act 2007''. Complaints and reporting of the health industry is carried out by an independent government agency, the [[Private Health Insurance Ombudsman]].<ref>[http://www.phio.org.au Private Health Insurance Ombudsman (PHIO)]</ref> The ombudsman publishes an annual report that outlines the number and nature of complaints per health fund compared to their market share.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.phio.org.au/publications/publications/annual-reports.aspx |title=PHIO's Annual Reports |access-date=3 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106181338/http://www.phio.org.au/publications/publications/annual-reports.aspx |archive-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe private health system in Australia operates on a \"community rating\" basis, whereby premiums do not vary solely because of a person's previous [[medical history]], current state of health, or (generally speaking) their age (but see Lifetime Health Cover Loading below).<ref name=\"health.gov.au\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/Publishing.nsf/Content/health-privatehealth-consumers-glossary.htm |title=Private Health Insurance in Australia |access-date=19 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904020319/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-privatehealth-consumers-glossary.htm |archive-date=4 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Balancing this are waiting periods, in particular for pre-existing conditions (usually referred to within the industry as PEA, which stands for \"pre-existing ailment\"). Funds are entitled to impose a waiting period of up to 12 months on benefits for any medical condition the signs and symptoms of which existed during the six months ending on the day the person first took out insurance.  They are also entitled to impose a 12-month waiting period for benefits for treatment relating to an obstetric condition, and a 2-month waiting period for all other benefits when a person first takes out private insurance.<ref name=\"health.gov.au\"/>\n\nFunds have the discretion to reduce or remove such waiting periods in individual cases. They are also free not to impose them, to begin with, but this would place such a fund at risk of \"[[adverse selection]]\", attracting a disproportionate number of members from other funds, or from the pool of intending members who might otherwise have joined other funds. It would also attract people with existing [[medical conditions]], who might not otherwise have taken out insurance at all because of the denial of benefits for 12 months due to the PEA Rule.  The benefits paid out for these conditions would create pressure on premiums for all the fund's members, causing some to drop their membership, which would lead to further rises, and a vicious cycle would ensue.\n\nHealth funds are not permitted to discriminate between members in terms of premiums, benefits or membership on the basis of racial origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, nature of employment, and leisure activities. Premiums for a fund's product that is sold in more than one state can vary from state to state, but not within the same state.\n\n===Incentives===\nA number of incentives encourage people to take out and maintain private hospital insurance, including:\n\n* '''Lifetime Health Cover Loading''': If a person has not taken out private hospital cover by 1 July after their 31st birthday, then when (and if) they do so after this time, their premiums must include a loading of 2% per annum. Thus, a person taking out private cover for the first time at age 40 will pay a 20% loading. The loading continues for 10 years. The loading applies only to premiums for hospital cover, not to ancillary (extras) cover.\n* '''[[Medicare levy surcharge]]''': People whose \"income for MLS purposes\" is greater than a specified amount and who do not have an \"appropriate level of cover\"<ref name=\"private\"/> pay the MLS in addition to the standard Medicare levy.\n* '''[[Private health insurance rebate]]''':  The government subsidises the premiums for all health insurance cover, including hospital and ancillary (extras), by 10%, 20% or 30%. In May 2009, The Rudd Labor government announced that as of June 2010, the rebate would become means-tested and offered on a sliding scale.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Medicare levy surcharge===\nThe government encourages individuals with income above a set level to privately insure. This is done by charging these (higher income) individuals a [[Medicare Levy Surcharge|surcharge]] of 1% to 1.5% of income if they do not take out [[Health insurance#Australia|health insurance]], and a means-tested rebate. This is to encourage individuals who are perceived as able to afford private insurance not to resort to the public health system,<ref name=\"mls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm |title=Medicare Levy Surcharge |publisher=Private Health Insurance Ombudsman |accessdate=11 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822191713/http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm |archive-date=22 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> even though people with valid private health insurance may still elect to use the public system if they wish.\n\nThe [[Howard Government|Howard Coalition government]] introduced a Medicare levy surcharge (MLS) with effect from 1 July 1997, as an incentive for people on higher incomes to take out and maintain an appropriate level of private [[Health insurance#Australia|health insurance]],<ref name=\"private\">[https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/medicare-levy/private-health-insurance-rebate/?anchor=Appropriatelevelofprivatehospitalinsuran#Appropriatelevelofprivatehospitalinsuran Private health insurance rebate]</ref> as part of an effort to reduce demand pressure on public hospitals by encouraging people to have insurance cover for them to use private hospitals.<ref name=\"ATOMLS\">ATO: [https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/Medicare-levy-surcharge/ Medicare levy surcharge]</ref> Individuals can take out health insurance to cover out-of-pocket costs, with either a plan that covers just selected services, to a full coverage plan. In practice, a person with health insurance may still be left with out-of-pocket payments, as services in private hospitals often cost more than the insurance payment.\n\nInitially, MLS of 1% applied to individuals and families who did not have an \u201cappropriate level of cover\u201c and whose taxable income was above a prescribed threshold. In 1997, the MLS threshold was $90,000 for individuals or $180,000 for families.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medicare Levy Surcharge|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/Medicare-levy-surcharge/|website=www.ato.gov.au|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> The threshold increased by $1,500 for each dependent child after the first in the family group.\n\nSince 1 July 2012, the basis of the threshold has been \"income for MLS purposes\", which includes the individual's or family group's taxable income, [[reportable fringe benefit|fringe benefits]], [[reportable superannuation contribution|superannuation contributions]] and net investment losses.\n\nIn 2014, the surcharge rate was increased from 1% to 1.25% for those with MLS income over $105,000, from $97,000, and 1.5% for those on incomes over $140,000, from $130,000; and the threshold amounts are doubled for families.\n\nThe MLS is calculated at the surcharge rate on the whole of an individual's MLS income, and not just the amount above the MLS threshold. The minimum MLS amount is $900.\n\nThe requirement that a higher-income earner have an \u201cappropriate level of private hospital cover\u201d is satisfied under the government's new four-tier hospital insurance structure introduced in 2019 by a basic hospital insurance cover. Extras or add-on insurance alone does not qualify.\n\n===Private health insurance rebate===\nIn 1999, the [[Howard Government]] introduced the private health insurance rebate scheme, under which the government contributed up to 30% of the private health insurance premium of people covered by Medicare. The program was estimated to cost $18.3 billion in 2007\u201308.<ref name=budget07/> In 2009, before means testing was introduced, the private health insurance rebate was estimated to cost $4 billion, around 20% of the total budget.<ref name=\"Metherell\"/> The overall figure was projected to rise by almost 4% annually in real terms in 2007.<ref name = budget07/>\n\nSince 2009, the rebate has been income- and age-tested. For a single person whose \"income for MLS purposes\" is less than $90,000 a year, or $180,000 for a family, the rebate is 25.1% (1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020), covering both hospital and extras cover. The rebate phases down over those amounts and cuts out at $140,000 for a single person, and double for a family.<ref>PrivateHealth.gov.au [http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/insurancerebate.htm Australian Government Private Health Insurance Rebate]</ref> The rebate can be claimed as a premium reduction or as a refundable tax offset.<ref>ATO, [https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Income-and-deductions/Offsets-and-rebates/Health-insurance/ Health insurance]</ref>\n\nDebates regarding Medicare focus on the two-tier system and the role of private health insurance. Controversial issues include:\n\n* whether people with means should take up private health insurance\n* whether rebates/incentives should be given in terms of private health insurance\n* people with health insurance still accessing the tax-payer funded public system rather than relying on their insurance\n* people with private health insurance are not required to pay the Medicare Levy Surcharge.<ref name=\"ATOMLS\"/>\n\nCritics argue that the rebate is an unfair subsidy to those who can afford health insurance, claiming the money would be better spent on public hospitals where it would benefit everyone. Supporters argue that people must be encouraged into the private health care system, claiming the public system is not universally sustainable for the future. Similarly, even after the introduction of the rebate, some private health insurance companies have raised their premiums most years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcf.com.au/media_center.asp?ID=17&member_id=Guest |title=HCF records strong revenue and membership growth in 2008-09, reaffirms commitment to not-for-profit model |publisher=The Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304080957/http://www.hcf.com.au/media_center.asp?ID=17&member_id=Guest |archivedate=4 March 2010}}</ref> to an extent negating the benefit of the rebate.\n\nIn 2013/14 Medicare expenditure was $19 billion and expected to reach $23.6 billion in 2016/17.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Britnell |first1=Mark |title=In Search of the Perfect Health System |date=2015 |publisher=Palgrave |location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=53}}</ref> During FY2014, approximately 47.2%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/annual-report-1314-toc~13-14-2~13-14-2-1~13-14-2-1-9|title=Outcome 9: Private Health|first=Australian Government Department of|last=Health}}</ref> of Australians had private health insurance with some form of hospital cover.\n\n===Lifetime Health Cover Loading===\nTo arrest the decline in the number of Australians maintaining private health insurance, the government introduced the '''Lifetime Health Cover Loading''', under which people who take out private hospital insurance later in life pay higher premiums, called a \u201cloading\u201d, compared to those who have held coverage since they were younger, and may also be subject to the [[Medicare (Australia)#Medicare levy surcharge|Medicare levy surcharge]].\n\n===Four tier system ===\nFrom 1 April 2019, the federal government introduced a four tiered system of private hospital insurance, under which health funds will classify hospital policies into four tiers \u2013 basic, bronze, silver and gold.

Whilst seemingly a win win scenario at the start the PHI companies now have a great deal if control over these providers.\nThe introduction of 1- Differential rebating 2- HICAPS and access to members data 3- Patient steering \nhave lead to a high level of discontent amongst healthcare providers.\nThe Senate enquiry into the value and affordability of private health insurance conducted 2017\u201318 lead to a host of recommendations to Parliament to end these practices however as of the time of writing the minister for Greg Hunt has not taken any action. \nThe ACCC have also looked at this matter without recommending any action be taken.\nThe impact of these PHI policies has been overwhelmingly to place financial pressure on healthcare providers and reduce the choice of healthcare provider to the patient as rebate amounts differ depending on which provider the patient attends. This has led to a number bankruptcies in the Dental field.\n\n'''Corporatisation of the Dental industry'''\n\nThe Australian Dental Association [ADA] set quality and care standards for the industry, but provide no standardised pricing schedule for services and treatment. Large corporate dental practices, which have a wide footprint, often have check-up and service KPIs. As there is no standard pricing schedule, this can quite often leave patients with large expenses, and on occasion unnecessary treatment. It also leads to cases where identical treatment plans can have drastically different pricing. <Ref>https://www.choice.com.au/health-and-body/dentists-and-dental-care/dental-treatment/articles/dental-fees</Ref>\n\n'''Increased Scope of Dental Auxiliaries'''\n\nFurther relaxation of standards has lead to training of Dental Auxiliaries in some dental procedures. This \u201c Dentistry by the back door\u201d is due to further disrupt the dental profession and lead to an inevitable lowering of standards\n\n==Other health care programs==\n*[[National Disability Insurance Scheme]] (NDIS) - Australia's national disability-related health care program, managed by the National Disability Insurance Agency\n*[[Healthdirect Australia]] \u2013 Healthdirect provides access to quality health information and is funded by the Australian Government.<ref>[http://www.healthdirect.gov.au/ Healthdirect]</ref>\n*[[DoctorConnect]] \u2013 To encourage overseas doctors to work in Australia.<ref>[http://www.doctorconnect.gov.au/ DoctorConnect]</ref>\n*[[HealthcareLink]] \u2013 Australia's first healthcare and medical job board was created to eliminate the challenges faced by many Australian healthcare employers and employees in both sourcing quality candidates and finding suitable job opportunity.<ref>[http://www.healthcarelink.com.au/ HealthcareLink]</ref>\n*[[Better Access Scheme]] - To provide subsidised mental healthcare to Australian residents.\n\n===Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme===\n{{Main| Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme}}\nThe [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] (PBS) subsidises certain prescribed pharmaceuticals.  The PBS pre-dates Medicare, being established in 1948.  It is generally considered a separate health policy to 'Medicare'.

Libya had been involved in Chad's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat|rise to power]] in Libya in 1969, beginning with the extension of the [[Chadian Civil War (1979-1982)|Chadian Civil War]] to northern Chad in 1968.<ref name=Pollack375>K. Pollack, ''Arabs at War'', p. 375</ref> The conflict was marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980\u20131981 and 1983\u20131987. In all of these occasions Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the [[French government]], which intervened militarily to save the Chadian government in 1978, 1983 and 1986.\n\nThe pattern of the war delineated itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed the bulk of the scouting and fighting.<ref name=Pollack376>K. Pollack, p. 376</ref> This pattern was radically changed in 1986, towards the end of the war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity that had never been seen before in Chad.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, ''Limits of Anarchy'', p. 230</ref> This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now by the [[United States]], [[Zaire]] and [[France]] with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in firepower. What followed was the [[Toyota War]], in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict.\n\nGaddafi initially intended to annex the [[Aouzou Strip]], the northernmost part of Chad, which he claimed as part of Libya on the grounds of an unratified treaty of the colonial period.<ref name=Pollack375/> In 1972 his goals became, in the evaluation of historian Mario Azevedo, the creation of a client state in Libya's \"underbelly\", an Islamic republic modelled after his [[jamahiriya]], that would maintain close ties with Libya, and secure his control over the Aouzou Strip; expulsion of the French from the region; and use of Chad as a base to expand his influence in Central Africa.<ref>M. Azevedo, ''Roots of Violence'', p. 151</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Occupation of the Aouzou Strip ===\nLibyan involvement with Chad can be said to have started in 1968, during the [[Civil war in Chad (1965\u20131979)|Chadian Civil War]], when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad ([[FROLINAT]]) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian [[List of heads of state of Chad|President]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye]] to the northerly [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture]] (BET).<ref>A. Clayton, ''Frontiersmen'', p. 98</ref> Libya's king [[Idris of Libya|Idris I]] felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between the two sides of the Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, [[France]], Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.<ref name=Pollack375/>\n\nAll this changed with the Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought [[Muammar Gaddafi]] to power. Gaddafi claimed the [[Aouzou Strip]] in northern Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by [[Italy]] and [[France]] (then the colonial powers of [[Libya]] and [[Chad]], respectively).<ref name=Pollack375/> Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the [[French Colonial Forces]].<ref>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, ''A Study of Crisis'', p. 84</ref>\n[[File:Map of Aouzou stip chad-svg.svg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Aouzou Strip]], highlighted in red]]\n\nThough initially wary of the [[FROLINAT]], Gaddafi had come to see by 1970 the organization as useful to his needs. With the support of [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]] nations, particularly [[East Germany]], he trained and armed the insurgents, and provided them with weapons and funding.<ref name=Pollack375/><ref>R. Brian Ferguson, ''The State, Identity and Violence'', p. 267</ref> On 27 August 1971 Chad accused [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]] of backing a coup against then-president [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye]] by recently amnestied Chadians.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V6M1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=KbcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1639,5039146|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=28 August 1971|accessdate=21 October 2012|title=Chad Splits with Egypt}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the failed coup, Tombalbaye cut all [[diplomatic relations]] with [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]], and invited all Libyan opposition groups to base themselves in Chad, and started laying claims to [[Fezzan]] on the grounds of \"historical rights\". Gaddafi's answer was to officially recognize on 17 September the [[FROLINAT]] as the sole legitimate government of Chad. In October, Chadian Foreign Minister Baba Hassan denounced Libya's \"expansionist ideas\" at the [[United Nations]].<ref name=Simons56>G. Simons, ''Libya and the West'', p. 56</ref>\n\nThrough French pressure on Libya and the mediation of [[List of heads of state of Niger|Nigerien President]] [[Hamani Diori]], the two countries resumed diplomatic relations on 17 April 1972. Shortly after, [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye|Tombalbaye]] broke diplomatic relations with Israel and is said to have secretly agreed on 28 November to cede the [[Aouzou Strip]] to Libya. In exchange, Gaddafi pledged 40 million pounds to the Chadian President<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 327</ref> and the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship in December 1972. Gaddafi withdrew official support to the FROLINAT and forced its leader [[Abba Siddick]] to move his headquarters from [[Tripoli]] to [[Algiers]].<ref name=Brecher85>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 85</ref><ref name=Wright130>J.

Azevedo, p. 145</ref> in the same month a joint bank was created to provide Chad with investment funds.<ref name=Simons56/>\n\nSix months after the signing of the 1972 treaty, Libyan troops moved into the Strip and established an airbase just north of Aouzou, protected by surface-to-air missiles. A civil administration was set up, attached to [[Kufra]], and Libyan citizenship was extended to the few thousand inhabitants of the area. From that moment, Libyan maps represented the area as part of Libya.<ref name=Wright130/>\n\nThe exact terms by which Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The existence of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have argued that there never was any sort of formal agreement, and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient not to mention the occupation of a part of his country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was brought before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) in 1993.<ref name=Wright130/><ref>{{cite journal| title =Public sitting held on Monday 14 June 1993 in the case concerning Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamayiriya/Chad)| publisher =[[International Court of Justice]]| url =http://www.icj-cij.org/cijwww/ccases/cdt/cDT_cr/cDT_cCR9314_19930614.PDF| format =PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010727103312/http://www.icj-cij.org/cijwww/ccases/cdt/cDT_cr/cDT_cCR9314_19930614.PDF|archivedate=27 July 2001}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion of the insurgency ===\nThe rapprochement was not to last long, as on 13 April 1975 a coup d'\u00e9tat [[Chadian coup of 1975|removed Tombalbaye]] and replaced him with General [[F\u00e9lix Malloum]]. As the coup was partly motivated by opposition to Tombalbaye's appeasement of Libya, Gaddafi considered it a menace to his influence and resumed supplying the FROLINAT.<ref name=Pollack375/> In April 1976, there was a Gaddafi-backed attempted assassination of Malloum,<ref name=Brecher85/> and in the same year Libyan troops started making forays into central Chad in company of FROLINAT forces.<ref name=Pollack376/>\n\nLibyan activism began generating concerns in the strongest faction into which the FROLINAT had split, the [[Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North]] (CCFAN). The insurgents split on the issue of Libyan support in October 1976, with a minority leaving the militia and forming the [[Armed Forces of the North]] (FAN), led by the anti-Libyan [[Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9]]. The majority, willing to accept an alliance with Gaddafi, was commanded by [[Goukouni Oueddei]]. The latter group soon renamed itself [[People's Armed Forces]] (FAP).<ref name=BuijtenhuijsA19>R. Buijtenhuijs, \"Le FROLINAT \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve du pouvoir\", p. 19</ref>\n\nIn those years, Gaddafi's support had been mostly moral, with only a limited supply of weapons. All this started changing in February 1977, when the Libyans provided [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei's]] men with hundreds of [[AK-47|AK-47 assault rifles]], dozens of [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPGs]], 81 and 82mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and recoilless [[cannon]]s. Armed with these weapons, the FAP attacked in June the [[Chadian Armed Forces]]' (FAT) strongholds of [[Barda\u00ef, Chad|Barda\u00ef]] and [[Zouar, Chad|Zouar]] in [[Tibesti Region|Tibesti]] and of [[Ounianga K\u00e9bir (town)|Ounianga K\u00e9bir]] in [[Borkou]]. [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] took full control of the [[Tibesti Mountains|Tibesti]] with this attack after [[Barda\u00ef, Chad|Barda\u00ef]], besieged since 22 June, surrendered on 4 July, while [[Zouar, Chad|Zouar]] was evacuated.

This accord was kept secret until 22 January, when a Fundamental Charter was signed, following which a National Union Government was formed on 29 August 1978 with Habr\u00e9 as Prime Minister.<ref>S.

For the first time with the active participation of Libyan ground units,<ref name=Pollack376/> Goukouni's FAP unleashed the Ibrahim Abatcha offensive on 29 January 1978 against the last outposts held by the government in northern Chad: [[Faya-Largeau]], [[Fada, Chad|Fada]] and [[Ounianga K\u00e9bir (town)|Ounianga K\u00e9bir]]. The attacks were successful, and [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] and the Libyans assumed control of the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region|BET Prefecture]].<ref name=Brecher86>M. Brecher & J.

The city, defended by 5,000 Chadian soldiers, fell on 18 February after sharp fighting to a force of 2,500 rebels, supported by possibly as many as 4,000 Libyan troops. The Libyans do not seem to have directly participated in the fighting; in a pattern that was to repeat itself in the future, the Libyans provided armor, artillery and air support.<ref name=Pollack376/> The rebels also were much better armed than before, displaying [[9K32 Strela-2|Strela-2 surface-to-air missiles]].<ref name=BuijtenhuijsA18>R.

Buijtenhuijs, \"Le FROLINAT \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve du pouvoir\", p. 21</ref>\n\nMalloum's reaction to the Goukouni\u2013Gaddafi offensive was to sever diplomatic relations with [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]] on 6 February and bring before the [[UN Security Council]] the issue of Libyan involvement. He raised again the question of [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya's]] occupation of the [[Aouzou Strip]]; on 19 February, however, after the fall of [[Faya-Largeau]], [[F\u00e9lix Malloum|Malloum]] was forced to accept a ceasefire and withdraw the protest. [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] halted the advance of [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] because of pressure from [[France]], then an important supplier of [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya's]] weapons.<ref name=Brecher86/>\n\nMalloum and Gaddafi restored diplomatic relations on 24 February in [[Sabha, Libya]], where an international peace conference was held which included as mediators Niger's President, [[Seyni Kountch\u00e9]], and Sudan's Vice-President, Abu al-Gasim Mohamed Ibrahim. Under severe pressure from [[France]], [[Sudan]] and [[Zaire]],<ref name=Azevedo146>M. Azevedo, p. 146</ref> [[F\u00e9lix Malloum|Malloum]] was forced to sign the Benghazi Accord, which recognized the [[FROLINAT]] and agreed on a new ceasefire, on 27 March. The agreement called for the creation of a joint [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]\u2013[[Niger]] military committee tasked with implementation; through this committee, [[Chad]] legitimized Libyan intervention in its territory. The accord also contained a condition dear to Libya: the termination of all French military presence in [[Chad]].<ref name=Brecher86/> The stillborn accord was for [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] nothing more than a strategy to strengthen his ''prot\u00e9g\u00e9'' [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]]; it also weakened considerably [[F\u00e9lix Malloum|Malloum's]] prestige among southern Chadians, who saw his concessions as a proof of his weak leadership.<ref name=Azevedo146/>\n\nOn 15 April, only a few days after signing the ceasefire, [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] left [[Faya-Largeau]], leaving there a Libyan garrison of 800 men. Relying on Libyan armor and air power, Goukouni's forces conquered a small FAT garrison and turned towards N'Djamena.<ref name=Pollack376/><ref name=Azevedo146/>\n\nAgainst [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] stood freshly arrived French forces. Already in 1977, after [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] first offensives, [[F\u00e9lix Malloum|Malloum]] had asked for a French military return in [[Chad]], but [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing|President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] was at first reluctant to commit himself before the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative elections]]; also, France was afraid of damaging its profitable commercial and diplomatic relations with [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]. However, the rapid deterioration of the situation in [[Chad]] resolved the President on 20 February 1978 to start [[Op\u00e9ration Tacaud]], which by April brought 2,500 troops to Chad to secure the capital from the rebels.<ref>J. de L\u00e9spin\u00f4is, \"L'emploi de la force aeri\u00e9nne au Tchad\", pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nThe decisive battle took place at [[Ati, Chad|Ati]], a town 430 kilometres northeast of [[N'Djamena]]. The town's garrison of 1,500 soldiers was attacked on 19 May by the [[FROLINAT]] insurgents, equipped with artillery and modern weapons. The garrison was relieved by the arrival of a Chadian task force supported by armor and, more importantly, of the [[French Foreign Legion]] and the 3rd Regiment of Marine Infantry. In a two-day battle, the FROLINAT was repelled with heavy losses, a victory that was confirmed in June by another engagement at [[Djedaa]]. The FROLINAT admitted defeat and fled north, having lost 2,000 men and left the \"ultramodern equipment\" they carried on the ground. Of key importance in these battles was the complete air superiority the French could count on, as the Libyan Air Force pilots refused to fight them.<ref name=Azevedo146/><ref>M. Pollack, pp. 376\u2013377</ref><ref>H. Simpson, ''The Paratroopers of the French Foreign Legion'', p. 55</ref>\n\n=== Libyan difficulties ===\nOnly a few months after the failed offensive against the capital, major dissensions in the FROLINAT shattered all vestiges of unity and badly weakened Libyan power in Chad. On the night of 27 August, [[Ahmat Acyl]], leader of the [[Volcan Army]], attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of Libyan troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by expelling all Libyan military advisors present in Chad, and started searching for a compromise with France.<ref>M. Brandily, \"Le Tchad face nord\", p. 59</ref><ref>N. Mouric, \"La politique tchadienne de la France\", p. 99</ref>\n\nThe reasons for the clash between Gaddafi and Goukouni were both ethnic and political. The FROLINAT was divided between Arabs, like Acyl, and [[Toubou]]s, like Goukouni and Habr\u00e9. These ethnic divisions also reflected a different attitude towards Gaddafi and his ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|Green Book]]''. In particular, Goukouni and his men had shown themselves reluctant to follow Gaddafi's solicitations to make ''The Green Book'' the official policy of the FROLINAT, and had first tried to take time, postponing the question until the complete reunification of the movement. When the unification was accomplished, and Gaddafi pressed again for the adoption of ''The Green Book'', the dissensions in the Revolution's Council became manifest, with many proclaiming their loyalty to the movement's original platform approved in 1966 when [[Ibrahim Abatcha]] was made first secretary-general, while others, including Acyl, fully embraced the Colonel's ideas.<ref>M. Brandily, pp. 58\u201361</ref>\n\nIn N'Djamena, the simultaneous presence of two armies\u2014Prime Minister Habr\u00e9's FAN and President Malloum's FAT\u2014set the stage for the [[battle of N'Djamena (1979)|battle of N'Djamena]], which was to bring about the collapse of the State and the ascent to power of the Northern elite. A minor incident escalated on 12 February 1979 into heavy fighting between Habr\u00e9 and Malloum's forces, and the battle intensified on 19 February when Goukouni's men entered in the capital to fight alongside Habr\u00e9. By 16 March, when the first international peace conference took place, an estimated 2,000\u20135,000 people had been killed and 60,000\u201370,000 forced to flee. The greatly diminished Chadian army left the capital in the rebels' hands and reorganized itself in the south under the leadership of [[Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu\u00e9]]. During the battle, the French garrison stood passively by, even helping Habr\u00e9 in certain circumstances, as when they demanded that the [[Chadian Air Force]] stop its bombings.<ref>M. Azevedo, pp. 104\u2013105, 119, 135</ref>\n\nAn international peace conference was held in [[Kano]] in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habr\u00e9, and Goukouni. The [[Kano Accord]] was signed on 16 March by all those present, and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni.<ref>M. Azevedo, p. 106</ref> This was a result of Nigerian and French pressures on Goukouni and Habr\u00e9 to share power;<ref name=Brecher88>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 88</ref> the French in particular saw this as part of their strategy to cut all ties between Goukouni and Gaddafi.<ref>N. Mouric, p. 100</ref> A few weeks later, the same factions formed the [[Transitional Government of National Unity]] (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.<ref name=Pollack377>K. Pollack, p. 377</ref>\n\nDespite signing the Kano Accord,<ref>T. Mays, ''Africa's First Peacekeeping operation'', p. 43</ref> Libya was incensed that the GUNT did not include any of the leaders of the Volcan Army and had not recognized Libyan claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April there had been some minor Libyan military activity in northern Chad, and support was provided to the secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 Libyan troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The Libyan forces were first stymied by Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with Libyan military support.<ref name=Brecher88/><ref name=Pollack377/><ref>T. Mays, p. 39</ref>\n\nThe fighting with Libya, the imposition by Nigeria of an economic boycott, and international pressure led to a new international peace conference in [[Lagos]] in August, to which all eleven factions present in Chad participated. A [[Lagos Accord|new accord]] was signed on 21 August, under which a new GUNT was to be formed, open to all factions. The French troops were to leave Chad and be replaced by a multinational African peace force.<ref>T. Mays, pp. 45\u201346</ref> The new GUNT took office in November, with Goukouni President, Kamougu\u00e9 Vice-President, Habr\u00e9 Defence Minister<ref name=Nolutshungu133>S. Nolutshungu, p. 133</ref> and Acyl Foreign Minister.<ref name=Azevedo147>M. Azevedo, p. 147</ref> Despite the presence of Habr\u00e9, the new composition of the GUNT had enough pro-Libyans to satisfy Gaddafi.<ref>J. Wright, p. 131</ref>\n\n=== Libyan intervention ===\nFrom the start, Habr\u00e9 isolated himself from the other members of the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habr\u00e9's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habr\u00e9 and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habr\u00e9 and Goukouni.<ref name=Nolutshungu133/>\n\nClashes in the capital between Habr\u00e9's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became progressively more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the [[Battle of N'Djamena (1980)|second battle of N'Djamena]]. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000\u20131,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties and the flight of about half the capital's population. The few remaining French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 135</ref><ref name=Azevedo108>M. Azevedo, p. 108</ref>\n\nWhile the FAN was supplied economically and militarily by Sudan and Egypt, Goukouni received the armed support of Kamougu\u00e9's FAT and Acyl's CDR shortly after the beginning of the battle, and was provided with Libyan artillery. On 6 June, the FAN assumed control of the city of Faya. This alarmed Goukouni, and he signed, on 15 June, a Treaty of Friendship with Libya. The treaty gave Libya a free hand in Chad, legitimising its presence in that country; the treaty's first article committed the two countries to mutual defence, and a threat against one constituted a threat against the other.<ref name=Azevedo108/><ref name=Brecher89>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 89</ref>\n\nBeginning in October, Libyan troops, led by [[Khalifa Haftar]] and [[Ahmed Oun]], airlifted to the Aouzou Strip operated in conjunction with Goukouni's forces to reoccupy Faya. The city was then used as an assembly point for tanks, artillery and armored vehicles that moved south against the capital of N'Djamena.<ref name=Metz261>H. Metz, ''Libya'', p. 261</ref>\n\nAn attack started on 6 December, spearheaded by Soviet T-54 and [[T-55]] tanks and reportedly coordinated by advisors from the [[Soviet Union]] and East Germany, brought the fall of the capital on 16 December. The Libyan force, numbering between 7,000 and 9,000 men of regular units and the paramilitary Pan-African [[Islamic Legion]], 60 tanks, and other armored vehicles, had been ferried across 1,100 kilometers of desert from Libya's southern border, partly by airlift and tank transporters and partly under its own power. The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast.<ref name=Metz261/> Wright states that the Libyan intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first military victory and a substantial political achievement.<ref name=Wright132>J. Wright, p. 132</ref>\n\nWhile forced into exile and with his forces confined to the frontier zones of [[Darfur]], Habr\u00e9 remained defiant. On 31 December he announced in [[Dakar]] he would resume fighting as a guerrilla against the GUNT.<ref name=Azevedo108/><ref name=Wright132/>\n\n=== Libyan withdrawal ===\nOn 6 January 1981, a joint communiqu\u00e9 was issued in Tripoli by Gaddafi and Goukouni that Libya and Chad had decided \"to work to achieve full unity between the two countries\". The merger plan caused strong adverse reaction in Africa, and was immediately condemned by France, which on 11 January offered to strengthen its garrisons in friendly African states and on 15 January placed its Mediterranean fleet on alert. Libya answered by threatening to impose an oil embargo, while France threatened to react if Libya attacked another bordering country. The accord was also opposed by all GUNT ministers present with Goukouni at Tripoli, with the exception of Acyl.<ref name=Azevedo147/><ref>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, pp. 89\u201390</ref>\n\nMost observers believe that the reasons behind Goukouni's accepting the accord may be found in a mix of threats, intense pressure and the financial help promised by Gaddafi. Just before his visit to the Libyan capital, Goukouni had sent two of his commanders to Libya for consultations; at Tripoli, Goukouni learned from Gaddafi that they had been assassinated by \"Libyan dissidents\", and that if Goukouni did not want to risk losing Libyan favour and lose power, he should accept the merger plan.<ref>M. Azevedo, pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nThe level of opposition caused Gaddafi and Goukouni to downplay the importance of the communiqu\u00e9, speaking of a \"union\" of peoples, and not of states, and as a \"first step\" towards closer collaboration. But the damage had been done, and the joint communiqu\u00e9 badly weakened Goukouni's prestige as a nationalist and a statesman.<ref name=Azevedo147/>\n\nIn response to the increasing international pressure, Goukouni stated that Libyan forces were in Chad by government request, and that international mediators should accept the decision of Chad's legitimate government. In a meeting held in May, Goukouni became more accommodating, declaring that while Libyan withdrawal was not a priority, he would accept the decisions of the OAU. Goukouni could not at the time renounce Libyan military support, necessary for dealing with Habr\u00e9's FAN, which was supported by Egypt and Sudan and funded through Egypt by the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 156</ref>\n\nRelations between Goukouni and Gaddafi started deteriorating. Libyan troops were stationed in various points of northern and central Chad, in numbers that had reached about 14,000 troops by January\u2013February 1981. These forces created considerable annoyance in the GUNT by supporting Acyl's faction in its disputes with the other militias, including the clashes held in late April with Goukouni's FAP. There were also attempts to Libyanize the local population, which made many conclude that \"unification\" for Libya meant Arabization and the imposition of Libyan political culture, in particular of ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 153</ref><ref name=Brecher90>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 90</ref><ref name=Azevedo148>M. Azevedo, p. 148</ref>\n\nAmid fighting in October between Gaddafi's Islamic Legionnaires and Goukouni's troops, and rumors that Acyl was planning a coup d'\u00e9tat to assume the leadership of the GUNT, Goukouni demanded on 29 October the complete and unequivocal withdrawal of Libyan forces from Chadian territory, which, beginning with the capital, was to be completed by 31 December. The Libyans were to be replaced by an OAU [[Inter-African Force]] (IAF). Gaddafi complied, and by 16 November all Libyan forces had left Chad, redeploying in the Aouzou Strip.<ref name=Brecher90/><ref name=Azevedo148/>\n\nLibya's prompt retreat took many observers by surprise. One reason lay in Gaddafi's desire to host the OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency. Another was Libya's difficult situation in Chad where, without some popular and international acceptance for Libyan presence, it would have been difficult to take the concrete risk of causing a war with Egypt and Sudan, with US support. Gaddafi had not renounced the goals he had set for Chad, but he had to find a new Chadian leader, as Goukouni had proved himself unreliable.<ref name=Azevedo148/><ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\n=== Habr\u00e9 takes N'Djamena ===\nThe first IAF component to arrive in Chad were the Zairean paratroopers; they were followed by Nigerian and [[Senegal]]ese forces, bringing the IAF to 3,275 men. Before the peace-keeping force was fully deployed, Habr\u00e9 had already taken advantage of Libya's withdrawal, and made massive inroads in eastern Chad, including the important city of [[Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9]], that fell on 19 November.<ref name=iaf>S. Nolutshungu, p. 164</ref> Next to fall was [[Oum Hadjer]] in early January 1982, only {{convert|160|km|mi}} from Ati, the last major town before the capital. The GUNT was saved for the moment by the IAF, the only credible military force confronting Habr\u00e9, which prevented the FAN from taking Ati.<ref>T. Mays, pp. 134\u2013135</ref>\n\nIn the light of Habr\u00e9's offensive, the OAU requested that the GUNT open reconciliation talks with Habr\u00e9, a demand that was angrily refused by Goukouni;<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 165</ref> later he was to say:\n{{quote|\n\"The OAU has deceived us. Our security was fully ensured by Libyan troops. The OAU put pressure on us to expel the Libyans. Now that they have gone, the organization has abandoned us while imposing on us a negotiated settlement with Hissein Habre\".<ref name=Mays139>T. Mays, p. 139</ref>\n}}\nIn May 1982, the FAN started a final offensive, passing unhindered by the peacekeepers in Ati and [[Mongo, Chad|Mongo]].<ref name=Mays139/> Goukouni, increasingly angered with the IAF's refusal to fight Habr\u00e9, made an attempt to restore his relations with Libya, and reached Tripoli on 23 May. Gaddafi, however, burned by his experience the previous year, proclaimed Libya neutral in the civil war.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 168</ref>\n\nThe GUNT forces made a last stand at [[Massaguet]], {{convert|80|km|mi}} north of capital, but were defeated by the FAN on 5 June after a hard battle. Two days later Habr\u00e9 entered N'Djamena unopposed, making him the de facto leader of Chad, while Goukouni fled the country, seeking sanctuary in [[Cameroon]].<ref name=Pollack382>K. Pollack, p. 382</ref><ref>T. Mays, p. 99</ref>\n\nAfter occupying the capital, Habr\u00e9 consolidated power by occupying the rest of the country. In barely six weeks, he conquered southern Chad, destroying the FAT, Kamougu\u00e9's militia; Kamougu\u00e9's hopes for Libyan help failed to materialize. The rest of the country was conquered, with the exception of the [[Tibesti]].<ref name=Nolutshungu186>S.Nolutshungu, p. 186</ref>\n\n=== GUNT offensive ===\nSince Gaddafi had kept mostly aloof in the months prior to the fall of N'Djamena, Habr\u00e9 hoped to reach an understanding with Libya, possibly through an accord with Acyl, who appeared receptive to dialogue. But Acyl died on 19 July, replaced by [[Acheikh ibn Oumar]], and the CDR was antagonized by Habr\u00e9's eagerness to unify the country, which led him to overrun the CDR's domains.<ref>S.Nolutshungu, p. 185</ref>\n\nTherefore, it was with Libyan support that Goukouni reassembled the GUNT, creating in October a National Peace Government in the Tibesti town of Barda\u00ef and claiming itself the legitimate government by the terms of the Lagos Accord. For the impending fight, Goukouni could count on 3,000\u20134,000 men taken from several militias, later merged in an ''Arm\u00e9e Nationale de Lib\u00e9ration'' (ANL) under the command of a Southerner, [[Negue Djogo]].<ref name=Nolutshungu188>S. Nolutshungu, p. 188</ref><ref>M. Azevedo, p. 110, 139</ref>\n\nBefore Gaddafi could throw his full weight behind Goukouni, Habr\u00e9 attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti, but was repelled both in December 1982 and in January 1983. The following months saw the clashes intensify in the North, while talks, including visits in March between Tripoli and N'Djamena, broke down. On 17 March, Habr\u00e9 brought the conflict before the UN, asking for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to consider Libya's \"aggression and occupation\" of Chadian territory.<ref name=Nolutshungu188/><ref name=Brecher91>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 91</ref>\n\nGaddafi was ready now for an offensive. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invaded Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards [[Koro Toro]], [[Oum Chalouba]], and Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, assuming control of the main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, and most of these were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.<ref name=Metz261/><ref name=Pollack382/><ref name=Nolutshungu188/>\n\nThe international community, in particular France and the US, reacted adversely to the Libyan-backed offensive. On the same day as the fall of Faya, [[French Foreign Minister]] [[Claude Cheysson]] warned Libya that France would \"not remain indifferent\" to a new Libyan involvement in Chad, and on 11 July the French government accused again Libya of direct military support to the rebels. French arms shipments were resumed on 27 June, and on 3 July a first contingent of 250 Zaireans arrived to strengthen Habr\u00e9; the United States announced in July military and food aid for 10 million dollars. Gaddafi suffered also a diplomatic setback from the OAU, that at the meeting held in June officially recognized Habr\u00e9's government and asked for all foreign troops to leave Chad.<ref name=Nolutshungu188/><ref name=Brecher91/><ref>M. Azevedo, p. 159</ref>\n\nSupplied by Americans, Zaireans and the French, Habr\u00e9 rapidly reorganized his forces (now called [[Chadian National Armed Forces]], or FANT). FANT marched north to confront the GUNT and the Libyans, who he met south of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9. Habr\u00e9 crushed Goukouni's forces and started a vast counteroffensive that enabled him to retake in rapid succession Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, [[Biltine, Chad|Biltine]], [[Fada, Chad|Fada]] and, on 30 July, Faya-Largeau, threatening to attack the Tibesti and the Aouzou Strip.<ref name=Nolutshungu188/>\n\n=== French intervention ===\n{{main|Operation Manta}}\n[[File:Tschad GUNT.jpg|300px|thumb|GUNT-controlled area in Chad until 1986/87 (light green), \"red line\" on the 15th and 16th parallels (1983 and 1984) and Libyan-occupied Aouzou Strip (dark green)]]\n[[File:Chad relief map 1991, CIA.jpg|300px|thumb|A map of Chad including the 15th parallel (the Red Line) where the French separated government and rebel forces]]\nFeeling that a complete destruction of the GUNT would be an intolerable blow for his prestige, and fearing that Habr\u00e9 would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure a definitive victory without Libyan armor and airpower.<ref>K. Pollack, pp. 382\u2013383</ref>\n\nSince the day after the fall of the town, Faya-Largeau was subjected to a sustained air bombardment, using [[Su-22]] and [[Mirage F-1]]s from the Aouzou air base, along with [[Tu-22]] bombers from [[Sabha Air Base|Sabha]]. Within ten days, a large ground force had been assembled east and west of Faya-Largeau by first ferrying men, armor, and artillery by air to Sabha, [[Kufra]] and the Aouzou airfield, and then by shorter-range transport planes to the area of conflict. The fresh Libyan forces amounted to 11,000 mostly regular troops, and eighty combat aircraft participated in the offensive; however, the Libyans maintained their traditional role of providing fire support, and occasional tank charges, for the assaults of the GUNT, which could count on 3,000\u20134,000 men on this occasion.<ref name=Metz261/><ref name=Pollack383>K. Pollack, p. 383</ref>\n\nThe GUNT-Libyan alliance invested on 10 August the Faya-Largeau oasis, where Habr\u00e9 had entrenched himself with about 5,000 troops. Battered by [[multiple rocket launcher]] (MRL), artillery and tank fire and continuous airstrikes, the FANT's defensive line disintegrated when the GUNT launched the final assault, leaving 700 FANT troops on the ground. Habr\u00e9 escaped with the remnants of his army to the capital, without being pursued by the Libyans.<ref name=Pollack383/>\n\nThis was to prove a tactical blunder, as the new Libyan intervention had alarmed France. Habr\u00e9 issued a fresh plea for French military assistance on 6 August.<ref>J. Jessup, ''An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict'', p. 116</ref> France, also due to American and African pressures, announced on 6 August the return of French troops in Chad as part of [[Operation Manta]], meant to stop the GUNT-Libyan advance and more generally weaken Gaddafi's influence in the internal affairs of Chad. Three days later several hundred French troops were dispatched to N'Djamena from the [[Central African Republic]], later brought to 2,700, with several squadrons of [[SEPECAT Jaguar|Jaguar]] fighter-bombers. This made it the largest expeditionary force ever assembled by the French in Africa outside of the [[Algerian War]].<ref name=Pollack383/><ref name=Nolutshungu189>S. Nolutshungu, p. 189</ref><ref>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, pp. 91\u201392</ref><ref name=Azevedo139>M. Azevedo, p. 139</ref>\n\nThe French government then defined a limit (the so-called Red Line), along the [[15th parallel north|15th parallel]], extending from [[Mao, Chad|Mao]] to Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, and warned that they would not tolerate any incursion south of this line by Libyan or GUNT forces. Both the Libyans and the French remained on their side of the line, with France showing itself unwilling to help Habr\u00e9 retake the north, while the Libyans avoided starting a conflict with France by attacking the line. This led to a de facto division of the country, with Libya maintaining control of all the territory north of the Red Line.<ref name=Metz261/><ref name=Nolutshungu189/>\n\nA lull ensued, during which November talks sponsored by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions. Ethiopian leader [[Mengistu Haile Mariam|Mengistu]]'s attempt at the beginning of 1984 was also unsuccessful. Mengistu's failure was followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT outpost of [[Ziguey]], a move mainly meant to persuade France and the African states to reopen negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new troops into Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the [[16th parallel north|16th parallel]].<ref name=Brecher92>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 92</ref><ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 191</ref><ref name=Azevedo110>M. Azevedo, p. 110</ref>\n\n=== French withdrawal ===\nTo put an end to the deadlock, Gaddafi proposed on 30 April a mutual withdrawal of both the French and Libyan forces in Chad. French President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] showed himself receptive to the offer, and on 17 September the two leaders publicly announced that the mutual withdrawal would start on 25 September, and be completed by 10 November.<ref name=Brecher92/> The accord was at first hailed by the media as proof of Mitterrand's diplomatic skill and a decisive progress towards the solution of the Chadian crisis;<ref>M. Azevedo, pp. 139\u2013140</ref> it also demonstrated Mitterrand's intent of following a foreign policy independent from both the US and the Chadian government regarding Libya and Chad.<ref name=Nolutshungu189/>\n\nWhile France respected the deadline, the Libyans limited themselves to retiring some forces, while maintaining at least 3,000 men stationed in Northern Chad. When this became evident, it embarrassed the French and caused recriminations between the French and Chadian governments.<ref>M. Azevedo, p. 140</ref> On 16 November, Mitterrand met with Gaddafi on [[Crete]], under the auspices of the Greek prime minister [[Andreas Papandreou|Papandreou]]. Despite Gaddafi's declaration that all Libyan forces had been withdrawn, the next day Mitterrand admitted that this was not true. However, he did not order French troops back to Chad.<ref>G.L. Simons, p. 293</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Sam Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], the 1984 bilateral Franco-Libyan agreement may have provided Gaddafi with an excellent opportunity to find an exit from the Chadian quagmire, while bolstering his international prestige and giving him an opportunity to force Habr\u00e9 into accepting a peace accord which would have included Libya's proxies. Instead, Gaddafi misread France's withdrawal as a willingness to accept Libya's military presence in Chad and the ''de facto'' annexation of the whole BET Prefecture by Libya, an action that was certain to meet the opposition of all Chadian factions and of the OAU and UN. Gaddafi's blunder would eventually bring about his defeat, with the rebellion against him of the GUNT and a new French expedition in 1986.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 202\u2013203</ref>\n\n=== New French intervention ===\n{{main|Op\u00e9ration Epervier}}\nDuring the period between 1984 and 1986, in which no major clash took place, Habr\u00e9 greatly strengthened his position thanks to staunch US support and Libya's failure to respect the Franco-Libyan 1984 agreement. Also decisive was the increasing factional bickering that started plaguing the GUNT since 1984, centered around the fight between Goukouni and Acheikh ibn Oumar over the organization's leadership.<ref>S.Nolutshungu, pp. 191\u2013192, 210</ref>\n\nIn this period, Gaddafi expanded his control over northern Chad, building new roads and erecting a major new airbase, [[Ouadi Doum]], meant to better support air and ground operations beyond the [[Aouzou Strip]]. He also brought in considerable reinforcements in 1985, raising Libyan forces in the country to 7,000 troops, 300 tanks and 60 combat aircraft.<ref>K. Pollack, pp. 384\u2013385</ref> While this build-up took place, significant elements of the GUNT passed over to the Habr\u00e9 government, as part of the latter's policy of accommodation.<ref name=Nolutshungu212>S. Nolutshungu, p. 212</ref>\n\nThese desertions alarmed Gaddafi, as the GUNT provided a cover of legitimacy to Libya's presence in Chad. To put a halt to these and reunite the GUNT, a major offensive was launched on the Red Line with the goal of taking N'Djamena. The attack, started on 10 February 1986, involved 5,000 Libyan and 5,000 GUNT troops, and concentrated on the FANT outposts of [[Kouba Olanga]], [[Kalait]] and [[Oum Chalouba]]. The campaign ended in disaster for Gaddafi, when a FANT counteroffensive on 13 February using the new equipment obtained from the French forced the attackers to withdraw and reorganize.<ref name=Azevedo110/><ref name=\"Nolutshungu212\"/><ref name=\"K. Pollack, p. 389\">K. Pollack, p. 389</ref>\n\nMost important was French reaction to the attack. Gaddafi had possibly believed that, due to the [[1986 French legislative election|upcoming French legislative elections]], Mitterrand would be reluctant to start a new risky and costly expedition to save Habr\u00e9; this evaluation proved wrong, as what the French President could not politically risk was to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Op\u00e9ration Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a clear message to Gaddafi, the [[French Air Force]] [[Ouadi Doum air raid|bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase]]. Libya retaliated the next day when a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the [[N'Djamena International Airport|N'Djamena Airport]], causing minimal damage.<ref name=\"K. Pollack, p. 389\"/><ref>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 93</ref><ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 212\u2013213</ref>\n\n=== Tibesti War ===\nThe defeats suffered in February and March accelerated the disintegration of the GUNT. When in March, at a new round of OAU-sponsored talks held in the [[People's Republic of Congo]], Goukouni failed to appear, many suspected the hand of Libya. These suspicions caused the defection from the GUNT of its vice president, Kamougu\u00e9, followed by the [[First Army (Chad)|First Army]] and the piecemeal FROLINAT Originel. In August, it was the CDR's turn to leave the coalition, seizing the town of Fada. When in October Goukouni's FAP attempted to retake Fada, the Libyan garrison attacked Goukouni's troops, giving way to a pitched battle that effectively ended the GUNT. In the same month, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, while his troops rebelled against Gaddafi, dislodging the Libyans from all their positions in the Tibesti, and on 24 October went over to Habr\u00e9.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\nTo reestablish their supply lines and retake the towns of Barda\u00ef, Zouar and [[Wour]], the Libyans sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with [[T-62]] tanks and heavy support by the [[Libyan Air Force (1951-2011)|Libyan Air Force]] into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, also through the use of [[napalm]]. This attack ultimately backfired, causing the prompt reaction of Habr\u00e9, who sent 2,000 FANT soldiers to link with the GUNT forces. Also Mitterrand reacted forcefully, ordering a mission which parachuted fuel, food, ammunition and anti-tank missiles to the rebels, and also infiltrated military personnel. Through this action, the French made clear that they no longer felt committed to keep south of the Red Line, and were ready to act whenever they found it necessary.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 214\u2013216</ref><ref>K. Pollack, p. 390</ref>\n\nWhile militarily Habr\u00e9 was only partly successful in his attempt to evict the Libyans from the Tibesti (the Libyans would fully leave the region in March, when a series of defeats in the north-east had made the area untenable), the campaign was a great strategic breakthrough for the FANT, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity that had never been seen before in Chad.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 215\u2013216, 245</ref>\n\n=== Toyota War ===\n{{main|Toyota War}}\nAt the opening of 1987, the last year of the war, the Libyan expeditionary force was still impressive, numbering 8,000 troops and 300 tanks. However, it had lost the key support of its Chadian allies, who had generally provided reconnaissance and acted as assault infantry. Without them the Libyan garrisons resembled isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian desert. On the other side, the FANT was greatly strengthened, now having 10,000 highly motivated troops, provided with fast-moving and sand-adapted [[Toyota truck]]s equipped with [[MILAN]] [[anti-tank missile]]s. These trucks gave the name \"Toyota War\" to the last phase of the conflict.<ref>M. Azevedo, pp. 149\u2013150</ref><ref>K. Pollack, p. 391, 398</ref><ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>\n\nHabr\u00e9 started, on 2 January 1987, his reconquest of northern Chad with a [[battle of Fada|successful attack]] on the well-defended Libyan communications base of Fada. Against the Libyan army the Chadian commander [[Hassan Djamous]] conducted a series of swift pincer movements, enveloping the Libyan positions and crushing them with sudden attacks from all sides. This strategy was repeated by Djamous in March in the [[battle of B'ir Kora|battles of B'ir Kora]] and [[battle of Ouadi Doum|Ouadi Doum]], inflicting crushing losses and forcing Gaddafi to evacuate northern Chad.<ref>K. Pollack, pp. 391\u2013394</ref>\n\nThis in turn endangered Libyan control over the Aouzou Strip, and Aouzou fell in August to the FANT, only to be repelled by an overwhelming Libyan counter-offensive and the French refusal to provide air cover to the Chadians. Habr\u00e9 readily replied to this setback with the first Chadian incursion in Libyan territory of the Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict, mounting on 5 September a surprise and fully successful [[Battle of Maaten al-Sarra|raid against the key Libyan air base at Maaten al-Sarra]]. This attack was part of a plan to remove the threat of Libyan airpower before a renewed offensive on Aouzou.<ref>K. Pollack, pp. 395\u2013396</ref>\n\nThe projected attack on Aouzou never took place, as the dimensions of the victory obtained at Maaten made France fear that the attack on [[Maaten al-Sarra Air Base|the Libyan base]] was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not willing to tolerate. As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed himself more conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 222\u2013223</ref><ref>K. Pollack, p. 397</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nWhile there were many violations of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave the door open for a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to unseat Gaddafi.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 223\u2013224</ref>\n\nSteadily, relations among the two countries improved, with Gaddafi giving signs that he wanted to normalize relations with the Chadian government, to the point of recognizing that the war had been an error. In May 1988, the Libyan leader declared he would recognize Habr\u00e9 as the legitimate president of Chad \"as a gift to Africa\"; this led on 3 October to the resumption of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. The following year, on 31 August 1989, Chadian and Libyan representatives met in Algiers to negotiate the Framework Agreement on the Peaceful Settlement of the Territorial Dispute, by which Gaddafi agreed to discuss with Habr\u00e9 the Aouzou Strip and to bring the issue to the ICJ for a binding ruling if bilateral talks failed. After a year of inconclusive talks, the sides submitted the dispute to the ICJ in September 1990.<ref>G. Simons, p. 58, 60</ref><ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 227</ref><ref name=Brecher95>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 95</ref>\n\nChadian-Libyan relations further improved when Libyan-supported [[Idriss D\u00e9by]] unseated Habr\u00e9 on 2 December. Gaddafi was the first head of state to recognize the new government, and he also signed treaties of friendship and cooperation on various levels. Regarding the Aouzou Strip, however, D\u00e9by followed his predecessor, declaring that if necessary he would fight to keep the strip out of Libya's hands.<ref>{{Cite news|title =Chad The Devil Behind the Scenes| newspaper =Time| date =17 December 1990| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971950,00.html}}</ref><ref>M. Azevedo, p. 150</ref>\n\nThe Aouzou dispute was concluded for good on 3 February 1994, when the judges of the ICJ by a majority of 16 to 1 [[Case Concerning the Territorial Dispute (Libya v. Chad)|decided]] that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing an agreement as early as 4 April concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on 15 April and was completed by 10 May. The formal and final transfer of the Strip from Libya to Chad took place on 30 May, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.<ref name=Brecher95/><ref>G.

Libya had been involved in Chad's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat|rise to power]] in Libya in 1969, beginning with the extension of the [[Chadian Civil War (1979-1982)|Chadian Civil War]] to northern Chad in 1968.<ref name=Pollack375>K. Pollack, ''Arabs at War'', p. 375</ref> The conflict was marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980\u20131981 and 1983\u20131987. In all of these occasions Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the [[French government]], which intervened militarily to save the Chadian government in 1978, 1983 and 1986.\n\nThe pattern of the war delineated itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed the bulk of the scouting and fighting.<ref name=Pollack376>K. Pollack, p. 376</ref> This pattern was radically changed in 1986, towards the end of the war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the Libyan occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity that had never been seen before in Chad.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, ''Limits of Anarchy'', p. 230</ref> This deprived the Libyan forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now by the [[United States]], [[Zaire]] and [[France]] with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the Libyan superiority in firepower. What followed was the [[Toyota War]], in which the Libyan forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict.\n\nGaddafi initially intended to annex the [[Aouzou Strip]], the northernmost part of Chad, which he claimed as part of Libya on the grounds of an unratified treaty of the colonial period.<ref name=Pollack375/> In 1972 his goals became, in the evaluation of historian Mario Azevedo, the creation of a client state in Libya's \"underbelly\", an Islamic republic modelled after his [[jamahiriya]], that would maintain close ties with Libya, and secure his control over the Aouzou Strip; expulsion of the French from the region; and use of Chad as a base to expand his influence in Central Africa.<ref>M. Azevedo, ''Roots of Violence'', p. 151</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Occupation of the Aouzou Strip ===\nLibyan involvement with Chad can be said to have started in 1968, during the [[Civil war in Chad (1965\u20131979)|Chadian Civil War]], when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad ([[FROLINAT]]) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian [[List of heads of state of Chad|President]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye]] to the northerly [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture]] (BET).<ref>A. Clayton, ''Frontiersmen'', p. 98</ref> Libya's king [[Idris of Libya|Idris I]] felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between the two sides of the Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, [[France]], Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.<ref name=Pollack375/>\n\nAll this changed with the Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought [[Muammar Gaddafi]] to power. Gaddafi claimed the [[Aouzou Strip]] in northern Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by [[Italy]] and [[France]] (then the colonial powers of [[Libya]] and [[Chad]], respectively).<ref name=Pollack375/> Such claims had been previously made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the [[French Colonial Forces]].<ref>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, ''A Study of Crisis'', p. 84</ref>\n[[File:Map of Aouzou stip chad-svg.svg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Aouzou Strip]], highlighted in red]]\n\nThough initially wary of the [[FROLINAT]], Gaddafi had come to see by 1970 the organization as useful to his needs. With the support of [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]] nations, particularly [[East Germany]], he trained and armed the insurgents, and provided them with weapons and funding.<ref name=Pollack375/><ref>R. Brian Ferguson, ''The State, Identity and Violence'', p. 267</ref> On 27 August 1971 Chad accused [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]] of backing a coup against then-president [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye]] by recently amnestied Chadians.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V6M1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=KbcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1639,5039146|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=28 August 1971|accessdate=21 October 2012|title=Chad Splits with Egypt}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the failed coup, Tombalbaye cut all [[diplomatic relations]] with [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]], and invited all Libyan opposition groups to base themselves in Chad, and started laying claims to [[Fezzan]] on the grounds of \"historical rights\". Gaddafi's answer was to officially recognize on 17 September the [[FROLINAT]] as the sole legitimate government of Chad. In October, Chadian Foreign Minister Baba Hassan denounced Libya's \"expansionist ideas\" at the [[United Nations]].<ref name=Simons56>G. Simons, ''Libya and the West'', p. 56</ref>\n\nThrough French pressure on Libya and the mediation of [[List of heads of state of Niger|Nigerien President]] [[Hamani Diori]], the two countries resumed diplomatic relations on 17 April 1972. Shortly after, [[Fran\u00e7ois Tombalbaye|Tombalbaye]] broke diplomatic relations with Israel and is said to have secretly agreed on 28 November to cede the [[Aouzou Strip]] to Libya. In exchange, Gaddafi pledged 40 million pounds to the Chadian President<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 327</ref> and the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship in December 1972. Gaddafi withdrew official support to the FROLINAT and forced its leader [[Abba Siddick]] to move his headquarters from [[Tripoli]] to [[Algiers]].<ref name=Brecher85>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 85</ref><ref name=Wright130>J. Wright, ''Libya, Chad and the Central Sahara'', p. 130</ref> Good relations were confirmed in the following years, with Gaddafi visiting the Chadian capital [[N'Djamena]] in March 1974;<ref>M. Azevedo, p. 145</ref> in the same month a joint bank was created to provide Chad with investment funds.<ref name=Simons56/>\n\nSix months after the signing of the 1972 treaty, Libyan troops moved into the Strip and established an airbase just north of Aouzou, protected by surface-to-air missiles. A civil administration was set up, attached to [[Kufra]], and Libyan citizenship was extended to the few thousand inhabitants of the area. From that moment, Libyan maps represented the area as part of Libya.<ref name=Wright130/>\n\nThe exact terms by which Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The existence of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have argued that there never was any sort of formal agreement, and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient not to mention the occupation of a part of his country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was brought before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) in 1993.<ref name=Wright130/><ref>{{cite journal| title =Public sitting held on Monday 14 June 1993 in the case concerning Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamayiriya/Chad)| publisher =[[International Court of Justice]]| url =http://www.icj-cij.org/cijwww/ccases/cdt/cDT_cr/cDT_cCR9314_19930614.PDF| format =PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010727103312/http://www.icj-cij.org/cijwww/ccases/cdt/cDT_cr/cDT_cCR9314_19930614.PDF|archivedate=27 July 2001}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion of the insurgency ===\nThe rapprochement was not to last long, as on 13 April 1975 a coup d'\u00e9tat [[Chadian coup of 1975|removed Tombalbaye]] and replaced him with General [[F\u00e9lix Malloum]]. As the coup was partly motivated by opposition to Tombalbaye's appeasement of Libya, Gaddafi considered it a menace to his influence and resumed supplying the FROLINAT.<ref name=Pollack375/> In April 1976, there was a Gaddafi-backed attempted assassination of Malloum,<ref name=Brecher85/> and in the same year Libyan troops started making forays into central Chad in company of FROLINAT forces.<ref name=Pollack376/>\n\nLibyan activism began generating concerns in the strongest faction into which the FROLINAT had split, the [[Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North]] (CCFAN). The insurgents split on the issue of Libyan support in October 1976, with a minority leaving the militia and forming the [[Armed Forces of the North]] (FAN), led by the anti-Libyan [[Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9]]. The majority, willing to accept an alliance with Gaddafi, was commanded by [[Goukouni Oueddei]]. The latter group soon renamed itself [[People's Armed Forces]] (FAP).<ref name=BuijtenhuijsA19>R. Buijtenhuijs, \"Le FROLINAT \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve du pouvoir\", p. 19</ref>\n\nIn those years, Gaddafi's support had been mostly moral, with only a limited supply of weapons. All this started changing in February 1977, when the Libyans provided [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei's]] men with hundreds of [[AK-47|AK-47 assault rifles]], dozens of [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPGs]], 81 and 82mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and recoilless [[cannon]]s. Armed with these weapons, the FAP attacked in June the [[Chadian Armed Forces]]' (FAT) strongholds of [[Barda\u00ef, Chad|Barda\u00ef]] and [[Zouar, Chad|Zouar]] in [[Tibesti Region|Tibesti]] and of [[Ounianga K\u00e9bir (town)|Ounianga K\u00e9bir]] in [[Borkou]]. [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] took full control of the [[Tibesti Mountains|Tibesti]] with this attack after [[Barda\u00ef, Chad|Barda\u00ef]], besieged since 22 June, surrendered on 4 July, while [[Zouar, Chad|Zouar]] was evacuated. The FAT lost 300 men, and piles of military supplies fell into the hands of the rebels.<ref>R.

The city, defended by 5,000 Chadian soldiers, fell on 18 February after sharp fighting to a force of 2,500 rebels, supported by possibly as many as 4,000 Libyan troops. The Libyans do not seem to have directly participated in the fighting; in a pattern that was to repeat itself in the future, the Libyans provided armor, artillery and air support.<ref name=Pollack376/> The rebels also were much better armed than before, displaying [[9K32 Strela-2|Strela-2 surface-to-air missiles]].<ref name=BuijtenhuijsA18>R.

He raised again the question of [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya's]] occupation of the [[Aouzou Strip]]; on 19 February, however, after the fall of [[Faya-Largeau]], [[F\u00e9lix Malloum|Malloum]] was forced to accept a ceasefire and withdraw the protest. [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] halted the advance of [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] because of pressure from [[France]], then an important supplier of [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya's]] weapons.<ref name=Brecher86/>\n\nMalloum and Gaddafi restored diplomatic relations on 24 February in [[Sabha, Libya]], where an international peace conference was held which included as mediators Niger's President, [[Seyni Kountch\u00e9]], and Sudan's Vice-President, Abu al-Gasim Mohamed Ibrahim. Under severe pressure from [[France]], [[Sudan]] and [[Zaire]],<ref name=Azevedo146>M. Azevedo, p. 146</ref> [[F\u00e9lix Malloum|Malloum]] was forced to sign the Benghazi Accord, which recognized the [[FROLINAT]] and agreed on a new ceasefire, on 27 March. The agreement called for the creation of a joint [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]\u2013[[Niger]] military committee tasked with implementation; through this committee, [[Chad]] legitimized Libyan intervention in its territory. The accord also contained a condition dear to Libya: the termination of all French military presence in [[Chad]].<ref name=Brecher86/> The stillborn accord was for [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] nothing more than a strategy to strengthen his ''prot\u00e9g\u00e9'' [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]]; it also weakened considerably [[F\u00e9lix Malloum|Malloum's]] prestige among southern Chadians, who saw his concessions as a proof of his weak leadership.<ref name=Azevedo146/>\n\nOn 15 April, only a few days after signing the ceasefire, [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] left [[Faya-Largeau]], leaving there a Libyan garrison of 800 men. Relying on Libyan armor and air power, Goukouni's forces conquered a small FAT garrison and turned towards N'Djamena.<ref name=Pollack376/><ref name=Azevedo146/>\n\nAgainst [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] stood freshly arrived French forces. Already in 1977, after [[Goukouni Oueddei|Oueddei]] first offensives, [[F\u00e9lix Malloum|Malloum]] had asked for a French military return in [[Chad]], but [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing|President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] was at first reluctant to commit himself before the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative elections]]; also, France was afraid of damaging its profitable commercial and diplomatic relations with [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]. However, the rapid deterioration of the situation in [[Chad]] resolved the President on 20 February 1978 to start [[Op\u00e9ration Tacaud]], which by April brought 2,500 troops to Chad to secure the capital from the rebels.<ref>J. de L\u00e9spin\u00f4is, \"L'emploi de la force aeri\u00e9nne au Tchad\", pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nThe decisive battle took place at [[Ati, Chad|Ati]], a town 430 kilometres northeast of [[N'Djamena]]. The town's garrison of 1,500 soldiers was attacked on 19 May by the [[FROLINAT]] insurgents, equipped with artillery and modern weapons. The garrison was relieved by the arrival of a Chadian task force supported by armor and, more importantly, of the [[French Foreign Legion]] and the 3rd Regiment of Marine Infantry. In a two-day battle, the FROLINAT was repelled with heavy losses, a victory that was confirmed in June by another engagement at [[Djedaa]]. The FROLINAT admitted defeat and fled north, having lost 2,000 men and left the \"ultramodern equipment\" they carried on the ground. Of key importance in these battles was the complete air superiority the French could count on, as the Libyan Air Force pilots refused to fight them.<ref name=Azevedo146/><ref>M. Pollack, pp. 376\u2013377</ref><ref>H. Simpson, ''The Paratroopers of the French Foreign Legion'', p. 55</ref>\n\n=== Libyan difficulties ===\nOnly a few months after the failed offensive against the capital, major dissensions in the FROLINAT shattered all vestiges of unity and badly weakened Libyan power in Chad. On the night of 27 August, [[Ahmat Acyl]], leader of the [[Volcan Army]], attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of Libyan troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by expelling all Libyan military advisors present in Chad, and started searching for a compromise with France.<ref>M. Brandily, \"Le Tchad face nord\", p. 59</ref><ref>N. Mouric, \"La politique tchadienne de la France\", p. 99</ref>\n\nThe reasons for the clash between Gaddafi and Goukouni were both ethnic and political. The FROLINAT was divided between Arabs, like Acyl, and [[Toubou]]s, like Goukouni and Habr\u00e9. These ethnic divisions also reflected a different attitude towards Gaddafi and his ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|Green Book]]''. In particular, Goukouni and his men had shown themselves reluctant to follow Gaddafi's solicitations to make ''The Green Book'' the official policy of the FROLINAT, and had first tried to take time, postponing the question until the complete reunification of the movement. When the unification was accomplished, and Gaddafi pressed again for the adoption of ''The Green Book'', the dissensions in the Revolution's Council became manifest, with many proclaiming their loyalty to the movement's original platform approved in 1966 when [[Ibrahim Abatcha]] was made first secretary-general, while others, including Acyl, fully embraced the Colonel's ideas.<ref>M. Brandily, pp. 58\u201361</ref>\n\nIn N'Djamena, the simultaneous presence of two armies\u2014Prime Minister Habr\u00e9's FAN and President Malloum's FAT\u2014set the stage for the [[battle of N'Djamena (1979)|battle of N'Djamena]], which was to bring about the collapse of the State and the ascent to power of the Northern elite. A minor incident escalated on 12 February 1979 into heavy fighting between Habr\u00e9 and Malloum's forces, and the battle intensified on 19 February when Goukouni's men entered in the capital to fight alongside Habr\u00e9. By 16 March, when the first international peace conference took place, an estimated 2,000\u20135,000 people had been killed and 60,000\u201370,000 forced to flee. The greatly diminished Chadian army left the capital in the rebels' hands and reorganized itself in the south under the leadership of [[Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu\u00e9]]. During the battle, the French garrison stood passively by, even helping Habr\u00e9 in certain circumstances, as when they demanded that the [[Chadian Air Force]] stop its bombings.<ref>M. Azevedo, pp. 104\u2013105, 119, 135</ref>\n\nAn international peace conference was held in [[Kano]] in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habr\u00e9, and Goukouni. The [[Kano Accord]] was signed on 16 March by all those present, and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni.<ref>M. Azevedo, p. 106</ref> This was a result of Nigerian and French pressures on Goukouni and Habr\u00e9 to share power;<ref name=Brecher88>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 88</ref> the French in particular saw this as part of their strategy to cut all ties between Goukouni and Gaddafi.<ref>N. Mouric, p. 100</ref> A few weeks later, the same factions formed the [[Transitional Government of National Unity]] (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.<ref name=Pollack377>K. Pollack, p. 377</ref>\n\nDespite signing the Kano Accord,<ref>T. Mays, ''Africa's First Peacekeeping operation'', p. 43</ref> Libya was incensed that the GUNT did not include any of the leaders of the Volcan Army and had not recognized Libyan claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April there had been some minor Libyan military activity in northern Chad, and support was provided to the secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 Libyan troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The Libyan forces were first stymied by Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with Libyan military support.<ref name=Brecher88/><ref name=Pollack377/><ref>T. Mays, p. 39</ref>\n\nThe fighting with Libya, the imposition by Nigeria of an economic boycott, and international pressure led to a new international peace conference in [[Lagos]] in August, to which all eleven factions present in Chad participated. A [[Lagos Accord|new accord]] was signed on 21 August, under which a new GUNT was to be formed, open to all factions. The French troops were to leave Chad and be replaced by a multinational African peace force.<ref>T. Mays, pp. 45\u201346</ref> The new GUNT took office in November, with Goukouni President, Kamougu\u00e9 Vice-President, Habr\u00e9 Defence Minister<ref name=Nolutshungu133>S. Nolutshungu, p. 133</ref> and Acyl Foreign Minister.<ref name=Azevedo147>M. Azevedo, p. 147</ref> Despite the presence of Habr\u00e9, the new composition of the GUNT had enough pro-Libyans to satisfy Gaddafi.<ref>J. Wright, p. 131</ref>\n\n=== Libyan intervention ===\nFrom the start, Habr\u00e9 isolated himself from the other members of the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habr\u00e9's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habr\u00e9 and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habr\u00e9 and Goukouni.<ref name=Nolutshungu133/>\n\nClashes in the capital between Habr\u00e9's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became progressively more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the [[Battle of N'Djamena (1980)|second battle of N'Djamena]]. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000\u20131,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties and the flight of about half the capital's population. The few remaining French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 135</ref><ref name=Azevedo108>M. Azevedo, p. 108</ref>\n\nWhile the FAN was supplied economically and militarily by Sudan and Egypt, Goukouni received the armed support of Kamougu\u00e9's FAT and Acyl's CDR shortly after the beginning of the battle, and was provided with Libyan artillery. On 6 June, the FAN assumed control of the city of Faya. This alarmed Goukouni, and he signed, on 15 June, a Treaty of Friendship with Libya. The treaty gave Libya a free hand in Chad, legitimising its presence in that country; the treaty's first article committed the two countries to mutual defence, and a threat against one constituted a threat against the other.<ref name=Azevedo108/><ref name=Brecher89>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 89</ref>\n\nBeginning in October, Libyan troops, led by [[Khalifa Haftar]] and [[Ahmed Oun]], airlifted to the Aouzou Strip operated in conjunction with Goukouni's forces to reoccupy Faya. The city was then used as an assembly point for tanks, artillery and armored vehicles that moved south against the capital of N'Djamena.<ref name=Metz261>H. Metz, ''Libya'', p. 261</ref>\n\nAn attack started on 6 December, spearheaded by Soviet T-54 and [[T-55]] tanks and reportedly coordinated by advisors from the [[Soviet Union]] and East Germany, brought the fall of the capital on 16 December. The Libyan force, numbering between 7,000 and 9,000 men of regular units and the paramilitary Pan-African [[Islamic Legion]], 60 tanks, and other armored vehicles, had been ferried across 1,100 kilometers of desert from Libya's southern border, partly by airlift and tank transporters and partly under its own power. The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast.<ref name=Metz261/> Wright states that the Libyan intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first military victory and a substantial political achievement.<ref name=Wright132>J. Wright, p. 132</ref>\n\nWhile forced into exile and with his forces confined to the frontier zones of [[Darfur]], Habr\u00e9 remained defiant. On 31 December he announced in [[Dakar]] he would resume fighting as a guerrilla against the GUNT.<ref name=Azevedo108/><ref name=Wright132/>\n\n=== Libyan withdrawal ===\nOn 6 January 1981, a joint communiqu\u00e9 was issued in Tripoli by Gaddafi and Goukouni that Libya and Chad had decided \"to work to achieve full unity between the two countries\". The merger plan caused strong adverse reaction in Africa, and was immediately condemned by France, which on 11 January offered to strengthen its garrisons in friendly African states and on 15 January placed its Mediterranean fleet on alert. Libya answered by threatening to impose an oil embargo, while France threatened to react if Libya attacked another bordering country. The accord was also opposed by all GUNT ministers present with Goukouni at Tripoli, with the exception of Acyl.<ref name=Azevedo147/><ref>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, pp. 89\u201390</ref>\n\nMost observers believe that the reasons behind Goukouni's accepting the accord may be found in a mix of threats, intense pressure and the financial help promised by Gaddafi. Just before his visit to the Libyan capital, Goukouni had sent two of his commanders to Libya for consultations; at Tripoli, Goukouni learned from Gaddafi that they had been assassinated by \"Libyan dissidents\", and that if Goukouni did not want to risk losing Libyan favour and lose power, he should accept the merger plan.<ref>M. Azevedo, pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nThe level of opposition caused Gaddafi and Goukouni to downplay the importance of the communiqu\u00e9, speaking of a \"union\" of peoples, and not of states, and as a \"first step\" towards closer collaboration. But the damage had been done, and the joint communiqu\u00e9 badly weakened Goukouni's prestige as a nationalist and a statesman.<ref name=Azevedo147/>\n\nIn response to the increasing international pressure, Goukouni stated that Libyan forces were in Chad by government request, and that international mediators should accept the decision of Chad's legitimate government. In a meeting held in May, Goukouni became more accommodating, declaring that while Libyan withdrawal was not a priority, he would accept the decisions of the OAU. Goukouni could not at the time renounce Libyan military support, necessary for dealing with Habr\u00e9's FAN, which was supported by Egypt and Sudan and funded through Egypt by the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 156</ref>\n\nRelations between Goukouni and Gaddafi started deteriorating. Libyan troops were stationed in various points of northern and central Chad, in numbers that had reached about 14,000 troops by January\u2013February 1981. These forces created considerable annoyance in the GUNT by supporting Acyl's faction in its disputes with the other militias, including the clashes held in late April with Goukouni's FAP. There were also attempts to Libyanize the local population, which made many conclude that \"unification\" for Libya meant Arabization and the imposition of Libyan political culture, in particular of ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 153</ref><ref name=Brecher90>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 90</ref><ref name=Azevedo148>M. Azevedo, p. 148</ref>\n\nAmid fighting in October between Gaddafi's Islamic Legionnaires and Goukouni's troops, and rumors that Acyl was planning a coup d'\u00e9tat to assume the leadership of the GUNT, Goukouni demanded on 29 October the complete and unequivocal withdrawal of Libyan forces from Chadian territory, which, beginning with the capital, was to be completed by 31 December. The Libyans were to be replaced by an OAU [[Inter-African Force]] (IAF). Gaddafi complied, and by 16 November all Libyan forces had left Chad, redeploying in the Aouzou Strip.<ref name=Brecher90/><ref name=Azevedo148/>\n\nLibya's prompt retreat took many observers by surprise. One reason lay in Gaddafi's desire to host the OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency. Another was Libya's difficult situation in Chad where, without some popular and international acceptance for Libyan presence, it would have been difficult to take the concrete risk of causing a war with Egypt and Sudan, with US support. Gaddafi had not renounced the goals he had set for Chad, but he had to find a new Chadian leader, as Goukouni had proved himself unreliable.<ref name=Azevedo148/><ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\n=== Habr\u00e9 takes N'Djamena ===\nThe first IAF component to arrive in Chad were the Zairean paratroopers; they were followed by Nigerian and [[Senegal]]ese forces, bringing the IAF to 3,275 men. Before the peace-keeping force was fully deployed, Habr\u00e9 had already taken advantage of Libya's withdrawal, and made massive inroads in eastern Chad, including the important city of [[Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9]], that fell on 19 November.<ref name=iaf>S. Nolutshungu, p. 164</ref> Next to fall was [[Oum Hadjer]] in early January 1982, only {{convert|160|km|mi}} from Ati, the last major town before the capital. The GUNT was saved for the moment by the IAF, the only credible military force confronting Habr\u00e9, which prevented the FAN from taking Ati.<ref>T. Mays, pp. 134\u2013135</ref>\n\nIn the light of Habr\u00e9's offensive, the OAU requested that the GUNT open reconciliation talks with Habr\u00e9, a demand that was angrily refused by Goukouni;<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 165</ref> later he was to say:\n{{quote|\n\"The OAU has deceived us. Our security was fully ensured by Libyan troops. The OAU put pressure on us to expel the Libyans. Now that they have gone, the organization has abandoned us while imposing on us a negotiated settlement with Hissein Habre\".<ref name=Mays139>T. Mays, p. 139</ref>\n}}\nIn May 1982, the FAN started a final offensive, passing unhindered by the peacekeepers in Ati and [[Mongo, Chad|Mongo]].<ref name=Mays139/> Goukouni, increasingly angered with the IAF's refusal to fight Habr\u00e9, made an attempt to restore his relations with Libya, and reached Tripoli on 23 May. Gaddafi, however, burned by his experience the previous year, proclaimed Libya neutral in the civil war.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 168</ref>\n\nThe GUNT forces made a last stand at [[Massaguet]], {{convert|80|km|mi}} north of capital, but were defeated by the FAN on 5 June after a hard battle. Two days later Habr\u00e9 entered N'Djamena unopposed, making him the de facto leader of Chad, while Goukouni fled the country, seeking sanctuary in [[Cameroon]].<ref name=Pollack382>K. Pollack, p. 382</ref><ref>T. Mays, p. 99</ref>\n\nAfter occupying the capital, Habr\u00e9 consolidated power by occupying the rest of the country. In barely six weeks, he conquered southern Chad, destroying the FAT, Kamougu\u00e9's militia; Kamougu\u00e9's hopes for Libyan help failed to materialize. The rest of the country was conquered, with the exception of the [[Tibesti]].<ref name=Nolutshungu186>S.Nolutshungu, p. 186</ref>\n\n=== GUNT offensive ===\nSince Gaddafi had kept mostly aloof in the months prior to the fall of N'Djamena, Habr\u00e9 hoped to reach an understanding with Libya, possibly through an accord with Acyl, who appeared receptive to dialogue. But Acyl died on 19 July, replaced by [[Acheikh ibn Oumar]], and the CDR was antagonized by Habr\u00e9's eagerness to unify the country, which led him to overrun the CDR's domains.<ref>S.Nolutshungu, p. 185</ref>\n\nTherefore, it was with Libyan support that Goukouni reassembled the GUNT, creating in October a National Peace Government in the Tibesti town of Barda\u00ef and claiming itself the legitimate government by the terms of the Lagos Accord. For the impending fight, Goukouni could count on 3,000\u20134,000 men taken from several militias, later merged in an ''Arm\u00e9e Nationale de Lib\u00e9ration'' (ANL) under the command of a Southerner, [[Negue Djogo]].<ref name=Nolutshungu188>S. Nolutshungu, p. 188</ref><ref>M. Azevedo, p. 110, 139</ref>\n\nBefore Gaddafi could throw his full weight behind Goukouni, Habr\u00e9 attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti, but was repelled both in December 1982 and in January 1983. The following months saw the clashes intensify in the North, while talks, including visits in March between Tripoli and N'Djamena, broke down. On 17 March, Habr\u00e9 brought the conflict before the UN, asking for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to consider Libya's \"aggression and occupation\" of Chadian territory.<ref name=Nolutshungu188/><ref name=Brecher91>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 91</ref>\n\nGaddafi was ready now for an offensive. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invaded Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards [[Koro Toro]], [[Oum Chalouba]], and Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, assuming control of the main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, and most of these were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.<ref name=Metz261/><ref name=Pollack382/><ref name=Nolutshungu188/>\n\nThe international community, in particular France and the US, reacted adversely to the Libyan-backed offensive. On the same day as the fall of Faya, [[French Foreign Minister]] [[Claude Cheysson]] warned Libya that France would \"not remain indifferent\" to a new Libyan involvement in Chad, and on 11 July the French government accused again Libya of direct military support to the rebels. French arms shipments were resumed on 27 June, and on 3 July a first contingent of 250 Zaireans arrived to strengthen Habr\u00e9; the United States announced in July military and food aid for 10 million dollars. Gaddafi suffered also a diplomatic setback from the OAU, that at the meeting held in June officially recognized Habr\u00e9's government and asked for all foreign troops to leave Chad.<ref name=Nolutshungu188/><ref name=Brecher91/><ref>M. Azevedo, p. 159</ref>\n\nSupplied by Americans, Zaireans and the French, Habr\u00e9 rapidly reorganized his forces (now called [[Chadian National Armed Forces]], or FANT). FANT marched north to confront the GUNT and the Libyans, who he met south of Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9. Habr\u00e9 crushed Goukouni's forces and started a vast counteroffensive that enabled him to retake in rapid succession Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, [[Biltine, Chad|Biltine]], [[Fada, Chad|Fada]] and, on 30 July, Faya-Largeau, threatening to attack the Tibesti and the Aouzou Strip.<ref name=Nolutshungu188/>\n\n=== French intervention ===\n{{main|Operation Manta}}\n[[File:Tschad GUNT.jpg|300px|thumb|GUNT-controlled area in Chad until 1986/87 (light green), \"red line\" on the 15th and 16th parallels (1983 and 1984) and Libyan-occupied Aouzou Strip (dark green)]]\n[[File:Chad relief map 1991, CIA.jpg|300px|thumb|A map of Chad including the 15th parallel (the Red Line) where the French separated government and rebel forces]]\nFeeling that a complete destruction of the GUNT would be an intolerable blow for his prestige, and fearing that Habr\u00e9 would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure a definitive victory without Libyan armor and airpower.<ref>K. Pollack, pp. 382\u2013383</ref>\n\nSince the day after the fall of the town, Faya-Largeau was subjected to a sustained air bombardment, using [[Su-22]] and [[Mirage F-1]]s from the Aouzou air base, along with [[Tu-22]] bombers from [[Sabha Air Base|Sabha]]. Within ten days, a large ground force had been assembled east and west of Faya-Largeau by first ferrying men, armor, and artillery by air to Sabha, [[Kufra]] and the Aouzou airfield, and then by shorter-range transport planes to the area of conflict. The fresh Libyan forces amounted to 11,000 mostly regular troops, and eighty combat aircraft participated in the offensive; however, the Libyans maintained their traditional role of providing fire support, and occasional tank charges, for the assaults of the GUNT, which could count on 3,000\u20134,000 men on this occasion.<ref name=Metz261/><ref name=Pollack383>K. Pollack, p. 383</ref>\n\nThe GUNT-Libyan alliance invested on 10 August the Faya-Largeau oasis, where Habr\u00e9 had entrenched himself with about 5,000 troops. Battered by [[multiple rocket launcher]] (MRL), artillery and tank fire and continuous airstrikes, the FANT's defensive line disintegrated when the GUNT launched the final assault, leaving 700 FANT troops on the ground. Habr\u00e9 escaped with the remnants of his army to the capital, without being pursued by the Libyans.<ref name=Pollack383/>\n\nThis was to prove a tactical blunder, as the new Libyan intervention had alarmed France. Habr\u00e9 issued a fresh plea for French military assistance on 6 August.<ref>J. Jessup, ''An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Conflict'', p. 116</ref> France, also due to American and African pressures, announced on 6 August the return of French troops in Chad as part of [[Operation Manta]], meant to stop the GUNT-Libyan advance and more generally weaken Gaddafi's influence in the internal affairs of Chad. Three days later several hundred French troops were dispatched to N'Djamena from the [[Central African Republic]], later brought to 2,700, with several squadrons of [[SEPECAT Jaguar|Jaguar]] fighter-bombers. This made it the largest expeditionary force ever assembled by the French in Africa outside of the [[Algerian War]].<ref name=Pollack383/><ref name=Nolutshungu189>S. Nolutshungu, p. 189</ref><ref>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, pp. 91\u201392</ref><ref name=Azevedo139>M. Azevedo, p. 139</ref>\n\nThe French government then defined a limit (the so-called Red Line), along the [[15th parallel north|15th parallel]], extending from [[Mao, Chad|Mao]] to Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, and warned that they would not tolerate any incursion south of this line by Libyan or GUNT forces. Both the Libyans and the French remained on their side of the line, with France showing itself unwilling to help Habr\u00e9 retake the north, while the Libyans avoided starting a conflict with France by attacking the line. This led to a de facto division of the country, with Libya maintaining control of all the territory north of the Red Line.<ref name=Metz261/><ref name=Nolutshungu189/>\n\nA lull ensued, during which November talks sponsored by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions. Ethiopian leader [[Mengistu Haile Mariam|Mengistu]]'s attempt at the beginning of 1984 was also unsuccessful. Mengistu's failure was followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT outpost of [[Ziguey]], a move mainly meant to persuade France and the African states to reopen negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new troops into Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the [[16th parallel north|16th parallel]].<ref name=Brecher92>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 92</ref><ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 191</ref><ref name=Azevedo110>M. Azevedo, p. 110</ref>\n\n=== French withdrawal ===\nTo put an end to the deadlock, Gaddafi proposed on 30 April a mutual withdrawal of both the French and Libyan forces in Chad. French President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] showed himself receptive to the offer, and on 17 September the two leaders publicly announced that the mutual withdrawal would start on 25 September, and be completed by 10 November.<ref name=Brecher92/> The accord was at first hailed by the media as proof of Mitterrand's diplomatic skill and a decisive progress towards the solution of the Chadian crisis;<ref>M. Azevedo, pp. 139\u2013140</ref> it also demonstrated Mitterrand's intent of following a foreign policy independent from both the US and the Chadian government regarding Libya and Chad.<ref name=Nolutshungu189/>\n\nWhile France respected the deadline, the Libyans limited themselves to retiring some forces, while maintaining at least 3,000 men stationed in Northern Chad. When this became evident, it embarrassed the French and caused recriminations between the French and Chadian governments.<ref>M. Azevedo, p. 140</ref> On 16 November, Mitterrand met with Gaddafi on [[Crete]], under the auspices of the Greek prime minister [[Andreas Papandreou|Papandreou]]. Despite Gaddafi's declaration that all Libyan forces had been withdrawn, the next day Mitterrand admitted that this was not true. However, he did not order French troops back to Chad.<ref>G.L. Simons, p. 293</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Sam Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], the 1984 bilateral Franco-Libyan agreement may have provided Gaddafi with an excellent opportunity to find an exit from the Chadian quagmire, while bolstering his international prestige and giving him an opportunity to force Habr\u00e9 into accepting a peace accord which would have included Libya's proxies. Instead, Gaddafi misread France's withdrawal as a willingness to accept Libya's military presence in Chad and the ''de facto'' annexation of the whole BET Prefecture by Libya, an action that was certain to meet the opposition of all Chadian factions and of the OAU and UN. Gaddafi's blunder would eventually bring about his defeat, with the rebellion against him of the GUNT and a new French expedition in 1986.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 202\u2013203</ref>\n\n=== New French intervention ===\n{{main|Op\u00e9ration Epervier}}\nDuring the period between 1984 and 1986, in which no major clash took place, Habr\u00e9 greatly strengthened his position thanks to staunch US support and Libya's failure to respect the Franco-Libyan 1984 agreement. Also decisive was the increasing factional bickering that started plaguing the GUNT since 1984, centered around the fight between Goukouni and Acheikh ibn Oumar over the organization's leadership.<ref>S.Nolutshungu, pp. 191\u2013192, 210</ref>\n\nIn this period, Gaddafi expanded his control over northern Chad, building new roads and erecting a major new airbase, [[Ouadi Doum]], meant to better support air and ground operations beyond the [[Aouzou Strip]]. He also brought in considerable reinforcements in 1985, raising Libyan forces in the country to 7,000 troops, 300 tanks and 60 combat aircraft.<ref>K. Pollack, pp. 384\u2013385</ref> While this build-up took place, significant elements of the GUNT passed over to the Habr\u00e9 government, as part of the latter's policy of accommodation.<ref name=Nolutshungu212>S. Nolutshungu, p. 212</ref>\n\nThese desertions alarmed Gaddafi, as the GUNT provided a cover of legitimacy to Libya's presence in Chad. To put a halt to these and reunite the GUNT, a major offensive was launched on the Red Line with the goal of taking N'Djamena. The attack, started on 10 February 1986, involved 5,000 Libyan and 5,000 GUNT troops, and concentrated on the FANT outposts of [[Kouba Olanga]], [[Kalait]] and [[Oum Chalouba]]. The campaign ended in disaster for Gaddafi, when a FANT counteroffensive on 13 February using the new equipment obtained from the French forced the attackers to withdraw and reorganize.<ref name=Azevedo110/><ref name=\"Nolutshungu212\"/><ref name=\"K. Pollack, p. 389\">K. Pollack, p. 389</ref>\n\nMost important was French reaction to the attack. Gaddafi had possibly believed that, due to the [[1986 French legislative election|upcoming French legislative elections]], Mitterrand would be reluctant to start a new risky and costly expedition to save Habr\u00e9; this evaluation proved wrong, as what the French President could not politically risk was to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Op\u00e9ration Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a clear message to Gaddafi, the [[French Air Force]] [[Ouadi Doum air raid|bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase]]. Libya retaliated the next day when a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the [[N'Djamena International Airport|N'Djamena Airport]], causing minimal damage.<ref name=\"K. Pollack, p. 389\"/><ref>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 93</ref><ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 212\u2013213</ref>\n\n=== Tibesti War ===\nThe defeats suffered in February and March accelerated the disintegration of the GUNT. When in March, at a new round of OAU-sponsored talks held in the [[People's Republic of Congo]], Goukouni failed to appear, many suspected the hand of Libya. These suspicions caused the defection from the GUNT of its vice president, Kamougu\u00e9, followed by the [[First Army (Chad)|First Army]] and the piecemeal FROLINAT Originel. In August, it was the CDR's turn to leave the coalition, seizing the town of Fada. When in October Goukouni's FAP attempted to retake Fada, the Libyan garrison attacked Goukouni's troops, giving way to a pitched battle that effectively ended the GUNT. In the same month, Goukouni was arrested by the Libyans, while his troops rebelled against Gaddafi, dislodging the Libyans from all their positions in the Tibesti, and on 24 October went over to Habr\u00e9.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\nTo reestablish their supply lines and retake the towns of Barda\u00ef, Zouar and [[Wour]], the Libyans sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with [[T-62]] tanks and heavy support by the [[Libyan Air Force (1951-2011)|Libyan Air Force]] into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, also through the use of [[napalm]]. This attack ultimately backfired, causing the prompt reaction of Habr\u00e9, who sent 2,000 FANT soldiers to link with the GUNT forces. Also Mitterrand reacted forcefully, ordering a mission which parachuted fuel, food, ammunition and anti-tank missiles to the rebels, and also infiltrated military personnel. Through this action, the French made clear that they no longer felt committed to keep south of the Red Line, and were ready to act whenever they found it necessary.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 214\u2013216</ref><ref>K. Pollack, p. 390</ref>\n\nWhile militarily Habr\u00e9 was only partly successful in his attempt to evict the Libyans from the Tibesti (the Libyans would fully leave the region in March, when a series of defeats in the north-east had made the area untenable), the campaign was a great strategic breakthrough for the FANT, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of national unity that had never been seen before in Chad.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 215\u2013216, 245</ref>\n\n=== Toyota War ===\n{{main|Toyota War}}\nAt the opening of 1987, the last year of the war, the Libyan expeditionary force was still impressive, numbering 8,000 troops and 300 tanks. However, it had lost the key support of its Chadian allies, who had generally provided reconnaissance and acted as assault infantry. Without them the Libyan garrisons resembled isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian desert. On the other side, the FANT was greatly strengthened, now having 10,000 highly motivated troops, provided with fast-moving and sand-adapted [[Toyota truck]]s equipped with [[MILAN]] [[anti-tank missile]]s. These trucks gave the name \"Toyota War\" to the last phase of the conflict.<ref>M. Azevedo, pp. 149\u2013150</ref><ref>K. Pollack, p. 391, 398</ref><ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>\n\nHabr\u00e9 started, on 2 January 1987, his reconquest of northern Chad with a [[battle of Fada|successful attack]] on the well-defended Libyan communications base of Fada. Against the Libyan army the Chadian commander [[Hassan Djamous]] conducted a series of swift pincer movements, enveloping the Libyan positions and crushing them with sudden attacks from all sides. This strategy was repeated by Djamous in March in the [[battle of B'ir Kora|battles of B'ir Kora]] and [[battle of Ouadi Doum|Ouadi Doum]], inflicting crushing losses and forcing Gaddafi to evacuate northern Chad.<ref>K. Pollack, pp. 391\u2013394</ref>\n\nThis in turn endangered Libyan control over the Aouzou Strip, and Aouzou fell in August to the FANT, only to be repelled by an overwhelming Libyan counter-offensive and the French refusal to provide air cover to the Chadians. Habr\u00e9 readily replied to this setback with the first Chadian incursion in Libyan territory of the Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict, mounting on 5 September a surprise and fully successful [[Battle of Maaten al-Sarra|raid against the key Libyan air base at Maaten al-Sarra]]. This attack was part of a plan to remove the threat of Libyan airpower before a renewed offensive on Aouzou.<ref>K. Pollack, pp. 395\u2013396</ref>\n\nThe projected attack on Aouzou never took place, as the dimensions of the victory obtained at Maaten made France fear that the attack on [[Maaten al-Sarra Air Base|the Libyan base]] was only the first stage of a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not willing to tolerate. As for Gaddafi, being subjected to internal and international pressures, he showed himself more conciliatory, which led to an OAU-brokered ceasefire on 11 September.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 222\u2013223</ref><ref>K. Pollack, p. 397</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nWhile there were many violations of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave the door open for a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the best chance to unseat Gaddafi.<ref>S. Nolutshungu, pp. 223\u2013224</ref>\n\nSteadily, relations among the two countries improved, with Gaddafi giving signs that he wanted to normalize relations with the Chadian government, to the point of recognizing that the war had been an error. In May 1988, the Libyan leader declared he would recognize Habr\u00e9 as the legitimate president of Chad \"as a gift to Africa\"; this led on 3 October to the resumption of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. The following year, on 31 August 1989, Chadian and Libyan representatives met in Algiers to negotiate the Framework Agreement on the Peaceful Settlement of the Territorial Dispute, by which Gaddafi agreed to discuss with Habr\u00e9 the Aouzou Strip and to bring the issue to the ICJ for a binding ruling if bilateral talks failed. After a year of inconclusive talks, the sides submitted the dispute to the ICJ in September 1990.<ref>G. Simons, p. 58, 60</ref><ref>S. Nolutshungu, p. 227</ref><ref name=Brecher95>M. Brecher & J. Wilkenfeld, p. 95</ref>\n\nChadian-Libyan relations further improved when Libyan-supported [[Idriss D\u00e9by]] unseated Habr\u00e9 on 2 December. Gaddafi was the first head of state to recognize the new government, and he also signed treaties of friendship and cooperation on various levels. Regarding the Aouzou Strip, however, D\u00e9by followed his predecessor, declaring that if necessary he would fight to keep the strip out of Libya's hands.<ref>{{Cite news|title =Chad The Devil Behind the Scenes| newspaper =Time| date =17 December 1990| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971950,00.html}}</ref><ref>M. Azevedo, p. 150</ref>\n\nThe Aouzou dispute was concluded for good on 3 February 1994, when the judges of the ICJ by a majority of 16 to 1 [[Case Concerning the Territorial Dispute (Libya v. Chad)|decided]] that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing an agreement as early as 4 April concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on 15 April and was completed by 10 May. The formal and final transfer of the Strip from Libya to Chad took place on 30 May, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.<ref name=Brecher95/><ref>G. Simons, p. 78</ref>\n\nMuammar Gaddafi was angered by the devastating counter-attack on Libya and the ensuing defeat at the [[Battle of Maaten al-Sarra]]. Forced to accede to a ceasefire, the defeat ended his expansionist projects toward Chad and his dreams of African and Arab dominance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/chad/national_security/chad_national_security_the_french_military_~863.html|title=Chad  The French Military Role in Chad -
