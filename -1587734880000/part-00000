In addition there have been six short charity specials, between 1997 and 2015.\n\nThe first series was broadcast on BBC One from 10 November to 15 December 1994, consisting of six episodes. Following the first series, an Easter special and a Christmas special were broadcast in 1996. A four-episode second series was ordered and screened between the 26 December 1997 and 22 January 1998. Subsequent episodes consisted of Christmas and New Year specials, with the four \"Seasonal Specials\" (in the order autumn, winter, spring, summer, often referred to as the third series) airing from 24 December 1999 to 1 January 2000, the two-episode \"A Very Dibley Christmas\" screening between 25 December 2004 and 1 January 2005, and the two-part finale, \"A Wholly Holy Happy Ending\", which was broadcast during Christmas 2006 and New Year 2007.\n\nThe final 2006-2007 episode, in which Geraldine marries, was publicised as the \"last-ever\" episode,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6225745.stm|title=Dibley's farewell is ratings hit|publisher=BBC|date=2 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref> although there have been three [[Comic Relief]] charity specials since.\n\nOn 15 March 2013, French reprised her role as [[Geraldine Granger]] as part of her [[French and Saunders]] marathon on [[BBC Radio 2]].  She was interviewed by [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] on his ''Pause for Thought'' section.\n\nOn 23 April 2020, French appeared on [[The Big Night In]] as part of a joint [[Comic Relief]] and [[Children in Need]] special to support those affected by [[Covid-19]].\n\nThe episodes often begin and end with funny vignettes. In earlier episodes, the opening credits were followed by a humorous village scene, such as a woman knitting directly from a sheep, a man sliding off a thatched roof, or the vicar building a tower of books to amuse Alice's baby. After the closing credits Geraldine usually tells Alice a joke, to which Alice either overreacts, tries to interpret the joke literally, or understands only after Geraldine explains the joke. There are a few exceptions: in \"The Window & the Weather\" (1994) Alice tells a joke to Geraldine; in \"Love and Marriage\" (1998) Geraldine tells the joke to David, as Alice is away on her honeymoon; and in \"Happy New Year\" (2005) the joke is told at the beginning, since the end of the episode includes a discussion of the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign.\n\n==Awards and accolades==\n* [[British Comedy Awards]] \u2013 1997, 1998, 2000\n* [[National Television Awards]] \u2013 1998\n* [[List of International Emmy Award winners|International Emmy]] \u2013 1998,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/220992.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Emmy success for Vicar of Dibley |publisher= BBC News |date= 24 November 1998 |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/499480/ |title=French, Dawn (1957\u2013) Biography |publisher= [[British Film Institute|BFI]] Screenonline |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> 2001{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* [[British Academy Television Awards]] \u2013 [[British Academy Television Awards 1998|1998]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 1999|1999]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 2000|2000]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 2001|2001]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 2005|2005]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 2007|2007]] (nominee)\n* [[Britain's Best Sitcom]] (2004) \u2013 No. 3\n\nIn May 2007, [[Richard Curtis]] received a [[BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award]] for his humanitarian pursuits as well as his creative work including ''The Vicar of Dibley''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomas| first= Archie| title= British acad to honor Curtis \u2013 Scribe wrote 'Vicar of Dibley, ' 'Girl in the Cafe'|url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965325.html?categoryid=13&cs=1| work=Variety| accessdate= 21 May 2007 | date=18 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Location and setting==\n[[File:Turville.15.4.07.jpg|thumb|right|The village of [[Turville]] in Buckinghamshire stands in for the village of Dibley]]\n[[File:Turville, St Mary.jpg|thumb|right|St Mary's Church, Turville, stands in for the fictional 'Parish Church of St Barnabus' (''sic'')]]\nThe programme is set in the fictional [[Oxfordshire]] village of Dibley. Some of the villagers, including Alice, Jim and Owen, speak with slight [[West Country English|West Country accents]], as were once common in Oxfordshire but are now less common. The series was filmed in the [[Buckinghamshire]] village of [[Turville]] near High Wycombe, with the village's St Mary the Virgin Church doubling as Dibley's St Barnabus (''sic''). Other television programmes and films, such as ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'', ''[[Goodnight Mister Tom (film)|Goodnight Mister Tom]]'', ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'', ''[[Father Came Too!]]'', ''[[Marple (ITV TV series)|Marple]]'', and ''[[Foyle's War]]'' have also been filmed in the village. The exterior location for David Horton's manor (usually only seen in [[establishing shot]]s) was not located in Turville, but in the village of [[Little Missenden]], Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe opening titles show aerial shots of the [[M40 motorway]]'s [[Stokenchurch Gap]], the [[Chiltern Hills]] of Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and the village of Turville.\n\nOnly two episodes, \"The Window and the Weather\" (1994) and \"Celebrity Vicar\" (1998), plus the 2013 Comic Relief sketch have scenes clearly set in locations outside the village. It is not clear whether other scenes, such as the speed dating session in \"Happy New Year\" (2005), were meant to be located in the village or not.\n\n==Theme music==\nThe theme music was a setting of [[Psalm 23]] composed by [[Howard Goodall]] and was performed by the choir of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]], with George Humphreys<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s631456.htm |title=ABC Classic FM Music Details: Saturday 10 June 2000 |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> singing the solo. The conductor was [[Stephen Darlington]]. Goodall originally wrote it as a serious piece of church choral music. It has been released as a [[charity record|charity single]] with proceeds to Comic Relief. It also appears on Goodall's CD ''Choral Works'', which also includes his theme for another popular comedy, ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' - and coincidentally a snippet of The Vicar of Dibley's theme music was used in ''Mr. Bean'' episode \"[[Tee Off, Mr. Bean]]\".\n\n==Home media==\n''The Vicar of Dibley'' was released in DVD in Region 2 (UK) from 2001. In 2002, a DVD entitled ''The Best of The Vicar of Dibley'' was released featuring a 90-minute film of Dawn French talking to the producer, [[Jon Plowman]], with clips from the series. A 2002 documentary narrated by [[Jo Brand]], entitled ''The Real Vicars of Dibley'', was also on the DVD. In 2005, a boxset of the \"complete collection\" was released. This included all the then aired episodes and shorts except the 1997 ''BallyKissDibley'' Comic Relief short. The final two episodes and 6-disc \"ultimate\" box set were released on 26 November 2007, although neither included the 2007 Comic Relief short or ''BallyKissDibley''.\n\nIn Australia (Region 4), all episodes have been released on DVD, but the 2007 Comic Relief short episode, \"Wife Swap\", has only been released on a Comic Relief DVD called ''Now That's What I Call Comedy''.\n\nIn the United States and Canada (Region 1), all episodes have been released on DVD.\n\nThe seasonal specials are often referred to as \"Series 3\". This is not a series, and was not released as such on VHS or DVD in the UK.

Following the first series, an Easter special and a Christmas special were broadcast in 1996. A four-episode second series was ordered and screened between the 26 December 1997 and 22 January 1998. Subsequent episodes consisted of Christmas and New Year specials, with the four \"Seasonal Specials\" (in the order autumn, winter, spring, summer, often referred to as the third series) airing from 24 December 1999 to 1 January 2000, the two-episode \"A Very Dibley Christmas\" screening between 25 December 2004 and 1 January 2005, and the two-part finale, \"A Wholly Holy Happy Ending\", which was broadcast during Christmas 2006 and New Year 2007.\n\nThe final 2006-2007 episode, in which Geraldine marries, was publicised as the \"last-ever\" episode,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6225745.stm|title=Dibley's farewell is ratings hit|publisher=BBC|date=2 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref> although there have been three [[Comic Relief]] charity specials since.\n\nOn 15 March 2013, French reprised her role as [[Geraldine Granger]] as part of her [[French and Saunders]] marathon on [[BBC Radio 2]].

In earlier episodes, the opening credits were followed by a humorous village scene, such as a woman knitting directly from a sheep, a man sliding off a thatched roof, or the vicar building a tower of books to amuse Alice's baby. After the closing credits Geraldine usually tells Alice a joke, to which Alice either overreacts, tries to interpret the joke literally, or understands only after Geraldine explains the joke. There are a few exceptions: in \"The Window & the Weather\" (1994) Alice tells a joke to Geraldine; in \"Love and Marriage\" (1998) Geraldine tells the joke to David, as Alice is away on her honeymoon; and in \"Happy New Year\" (2005) the joke is told at the beginning, since the end of the episode includes a discussion of the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign.\n\n==Awards and accolades==\n* [[British Comedy Awards]] \u2013 1997, 1998, 2000\n* [[National Television Awards]] \u2013 1998\n* [[List of International Emmy Award winners|International Emmy]] \u2013 1998,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/220992.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Emmy success for Vicar of Dibley |publisher= BBC News |date= 24 November 1998 |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/499480/ |title=French, Dawn (1957\u2013) Biography |publisher= [[British Film Institute|BFI]] Screenonline |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> 2001{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n* [[British Academy Television Awards]] \u2013 [[British Academy Television Awards 1998|1998]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 1999|1999]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 2000|2000]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 2001|2001]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 2005|2005]] (nominee), [[British Academy Television Awards 2007|2007]] (nominee)\n* [[Britain's Best Sitcom]] (2004) \u2013 No. 3\n\nIn May 2007, [[Richard Curtis]] received a [[BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award]] for his humanitarian pursuits as well as his creative work including ''The Vicar of Dibley''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomas| first= Archie| title= British acad to honor Curtis \u2013 Scribe wrote 'Vicar of Dibley, ' 'Girl in the Cafe'|url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965325.html?categoryid=13&cs=1| work=Variety| accessdate= 21 May 2007 | date=18 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Location and setting==\n[[File:Turville.15.4.07.jpg|thumb|right|The village of [[Turville]] in Buckinghamshire stands in for the village of Dibley]]\n[[File:Turville, St Mary.jpg|thumb|right|St Mary's Church, Turville, stands in for the fictional 'Parish Church of St Barnabus' (''sic'')]]\nThe programme is set in the fictional [[Oxfordshire]] village of Dibley.

Other television programmes and films, such as ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'', ''[[Goodnight Mister Tom (film)|Goodnight Mister Tom]]'', ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'', ''[[Father Came Too!]]'', ''[[Marple (ITV TV series)|Marple]]'', and ''[[Foyle's War]]'' have also been filmed in the village. The exterior location for David Horton's manor (usually only seen in [[establishing shot]]s) was not located in Turville, but in the village of [[Little Missenden]], Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe opening titles show aerial shots of the [[M40 motorway]]'s [[Stokenchurch Gap]], the [[Chiltern Hills]] of Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and the village of Turville.\n\nOnly two episodes, \"The Window and the Weather\" (1994) and \"Celebrity Vicar\" (1998), plus the 2013 Comic Relief sketch have scenes clearly set in locations outside the village. It is not clear whether other scenes, such as the speed dating session in \"Happy New Year\" (2005), were meant to be located in the village or not.\n\n==Theme music==\nThe theme music was a setting of [[Psalm 23]] composed by [[Howard Goodall]] and was performed by the choir of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]], with George Humphreys<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/classic/daily/stories/s631456.htm |title=ABC Classic FM Music Details: Saturday 10 June 2000 |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> singing the solo. The conductor was [[Stephen Darlington]]. Goodall originally wrote it as a serious piece of church choral music. It has been released as a [[charity record|charity single]] with proceeds to Comic Relief. It also appears on Goodall's CD ''Choral Works'', which also includes his theme for another popular comedy, ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' - and coincidentally a snippet of The Vicar of Dibley's theme music was used in ''Mr. Bean'' episode \"[[Tee Off, Mr. Bean]]\".\n\n==Home media==\n''The Vicar of Dibley'' was released in DVD in Region 2 (UK) from 2001. In 2002, a DVD entitled ''The Best of The Vicar of Dibley'' was released featuring a 90-minute film of Dawn French talking to the producer, [[Jon Plowman]], with clips from the series. A 2002 documentary narrated by [[Jo Brand]], entitled ''The Real Vicars of Dibley'', was also on the DVD. In 2005, a boxset of the \"complete collection\" was released. This included all the then aired episodes and shorts except the 1997 ''BallyKissDibley'' Comic Relief short. The final two episodes and 6-disc \"ultimate\" box set were released on 26 November 2007, although neither included the 2007 Comic Relief short or ''BallyKissDibley''.\n\nIn Australia (Region 4), all episodes have been released on DVD, but the 2007 Comic Relief short episode, \"Wife Swap\", has only been released on a Comic Relief DVD called ''Now That's What I Call Comedy''.\n\nIn the United States and Canada (Region 1), all episodes have been released on DVD.\n\nThe seasonal specials are often referred to as \"Series 3\". This is not a series, and was not released as such on VHS or DVD in the UK. In the United States, the four specials were released as \"Series 3\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%; text-align: center; \"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|DVD Title\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Discs\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ep #\n!colspan=\"3\"|DVD release\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:37%;\"|Special episodes\n|-\n![[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n![[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]\n![[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]\n|-\n| style=\"background: darkBlue; height:10px; \"|\n| '''[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series One (1994)|Complete Series 1]]'''\n| 1\n| 1994\n| 6\n| 21 October 2003\n| 26 November 2001\n| 1 October 2003\n| The [[The Christmas Lunch Incident|1996 Christmas special]] (R2)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ae2029; height:10px; \"|\n| '''The Specials'''\n| 1\n| 1996\n| 2\n| \u2014\n| 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Vicar-Dibley-Specials-DVD/dp/B0014QZBNA/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=1Y3ZOVPITMSAU&coliid=I1C5LNZU08R9NQ |title=The Vicar of Dibley - The Specials |website=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-27}}</ref>\n|\n| \u2014\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ae2029; height:10px; \"|\n| '''[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series Two (1997\u20131998)|Complete Series 2]]'''\n| 1\n| 1997\u20131998\n| 6\n| 21 October 2003\n| 2002\n| 8 April 2004\n| The 1996 Easter [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Easter Special (1996)|special]] & [[The Christmas Lunch Incident|Christmas special]] (R1 & R4)\n|-\n| style=\"background: green; height:10px; \"|\n| '''[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series Three (1999\u20132000)|Complete Series 3]]'''\n| 1\n| 1999\u20132000\n| 4\n| 21 October 2003\n| 2002\n| 2 March 2005\n| The [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Comic Relief Special (1997)|1997]] & [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Comic Relief Special (1999)|1999]] [[Comic Relief]] shorts (R1 & R4)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#d2691e; height:10px; \"|\n| '''[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Christmas Specials (2004\u201305)|A Very Dibley Christmas]]'''\n| 1\n| 2004\u20132005\n| 2\n| 27 September 2005\n| 14 November 2005\n| 3 November 2005\n| The [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Red Nose Day Special (1999)|1999]] & [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Comic Relief Special (2005)|2005]] [[Comic Relief]] short (All)\n|-\n| style=\"background:red; height:10px; \"|\n| '''[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Christmas Specials (2006\u201307)|A Holy Wholly Happy Ending]]'''\n| 1\n| 2006\u20132007\n| 2\n| 9 October 2007\n| 26 November 2007\n| 16 January 2008\n| \u2014\n|-\n| style=\"background: ivory; height:10px; \"|\n| '''[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series One (1994)|Complete Series 1]] & [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series Two (1997\u20131998)|2]]'''\n| 2\n| 1994\u20131998\n| 10\n| \u2014\n| 7 May 2007\n| \u2014\n| The 1996 Christmas [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Christmas Special (1996)|special]] (R2)\n|-\n| style=\"background: maroon; height:10px; \"|\n| '''[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series One (1994)|Complete Series 1]]\u2013[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series Three (1999\u20132000)|3]]'''\n| 3\n| 1994\u20132000\n| 16\n| 21 October 2003\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n| style=\"background: skyBlue; height:10px; \"|\n| '''[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series One (1994)|Complete Series 1]] \u2013 [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Christmas Specials (2004\u201305)|2005 Sp.]]'''\n| 4\n| 1994\u20132005\n| 18\n| \u2014\n| 14 November 2005\n| 7 July 2005\n| \u2014\n|-\n| style=\"background: white; height:10px; \"|\n| '''[[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Series One (1994)|Complete Series 1]] \u2013 [[List of The Vicar of Dibley episodes#Christmas Specials (2006\u201307)|2007 Sp.]]'''\n| 6\n| 1994\u20132007\n| 20\n| 9 October 2007\n| 26 November 2007\n| 3 April 2008\n| All the Red Nose Day specials and more\n|-\n| style=\"background: green; height:10px; \"|\n| style=\"text-align: center; \"| '''The Best of...'''\n| 1\n| N/A\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| 25 November 2002\n| \u2014\n| Dawn French in conversation with producer John Plowman\n|}\n\n==Return==\nIn February 2016 it was reported that Dawn French was interested in returning to the role as \"The Bishop of Dibley\", to follow on from the 2015 Red Nose Day Special.<ref>{{cite web|author=Simon Cable |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/vicar-dibley-set-tv-comeback-7371605 |title=Vicar of Dibley set for TV comeback - but with one very big change - Mirror Online |website=Mirror.co.uk |date= 2016-02-14|accessdate=2016-11-27}}</ref>\n\n==American version==\nThe idea for a US version of the show came about when two co-stars of the American sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', [[Jane Leeves]] and [[Peri Gilpin]], set up their production company Bristol Cities with an American version of ''The Vicar of Dibley'' as their first project.

Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region, but [[European dragon|dragons in western cultures]] since the [[High Middle Ages]] have often been depicted as winged, horned, [[Quadrupedalism|four-legged]], and capable of [[Fire breathing|breathing fire]]. [[Chinese dragon|Dragons in eastern cultures]] are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.\n\nThe earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes. Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the [[ancient Near East]] and appear in [[Art of Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamian art]] and literature. Stories about [[Weather god|storm-gods]] slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] and Near Eastern mythologies. Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the ''[[mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u]]'' of [[Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamia]]; [[Apep]] in [[Egyptian mythology]]; [[Vritra|V\u1e5btra]] in the ''[[Rigveda]]''; the [[Leviathan]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; [[Big Ghoul|Grand'Goule]] in the Poitou region in [[France]], [[Python (mythology)|Python]], [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], [[Wyvern]], and the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in [[Greek mythology]]; [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], [[N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr]], and [[Fafnir]] in [[Norse mythology]]; and [[The dragon (Beowulf)|the dragon]] from ''[[Beowulf]]''.\n\nThe popular western image of a dragon is based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions, and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes. In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by [[saint]]s or [[culture hero]]es, as in the popular legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]. They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure. These dragons appear frequently in western [[fantasy]] literature, including ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series by [[J. K. Rowling]], and ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' by [[George R. R. Martin]].\n\nThe word \"dragon\" has also come to be applied to the Chinese ''lung'' (traditional \u9f8d, simplified \u9f99, [[Pinyin]] ''long''), which are associated with good fortune and are thought to have power over rain. Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of [[dragon dance|dragon dancing]] and [[dragon boat|dragon boat racing]]. Many [[East Asia]]n deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions. Dragons were also identified with the [[Emperor of China]], who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles.\n\nCommonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of avian, feline, and reptilian features, and may include: snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth. Several modern scholars believe huge extinct or migrating [[crocodile]]s bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern dragon imagery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/where-did-dragons-come-from-23969126/|title=Where Did Dragons Come From?|last=Stromberg|first=Joseph|date=January 23, 2012|website=Smithsonian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/english/200004/29/eng20000429_40001.html|title=Archeologists Find Crocodile is Prototype of Dragon|date=April 29, 2000|website=People's Daily}}</ref> This also fits with the ancient words 'Draco' and 'Drakon', meaning 'large serpent' or 'sea serpent.'\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Beowulf - dracan.jpg|thumb|An early appearance of the [[Old English]] word ''dracan'' in ''[[Beowulf]]''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OCc8TF53RhMC&pg=PA196 Beowulf; a heroic poem of the 8th century, with tr., note and appendix by T.

Jones]] suggests a hypothesis that humans, just like [[monkey]]s, have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, [[Big cat|large cats]], and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32-40}} He cites a study which found that approximately 39 people in a hundred are afraid of snakes{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} and notes that fear of snakes is especially prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} The earliest attested dragons all resemble snakes or bear snakelike attributes.{{sfn|Jones|2000|pages=166\u2013168}} Jones therefore concludes that the reason why dragons appear in nearly all cultures is because of humans' innate fear of snakes and other animals that were major predators of humans' primate ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32}} Dragons are usually said to reside in \"dank caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests\", all places which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=108}}\n\nIn her book ''The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times'' (2000), [[Adrienne Mayor]] argues that some stories of dragons may have been inspired by ancient discoveries of fossils belonging to [[dinosaur]]s and other prehistoric animals.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|pages=xiii\u2013xxii}} She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by \"observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the [[Siwalik Hills]] below the [[Himalayas]]\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the [[Cetus (mythology)|Monster of Troy]] may have been influenced by fossils of ''[[Samotherium]]'', an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are common in the Mediterranean region.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as \"dragon bones\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and are commonly used in Chinese [[traditional medicine]].{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} Mayor, however, is careful to point out that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and notes that Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long \"been considered barren of large fossils.\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} In one of her later books, she states that \"Many dragon images around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations of living reptiles, such as [[Komodo dragon]]s, [[Gila monster]]s, [[iguana]]s, [[alligator]]s, or, in California, [[Elgaria|alligator

[[ouroboros]] was a well-known Egyptian symbol of a serpent swallowing its own tail.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} The precursor to the ouroboros was the \"Many-Faced\",{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} a

protectively.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} The earliest surviving depiction of a \"true\" ouroboros comes from the gilded shrines in [[KV62|the tomb]] of [[Tutankhamun]].{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} In the early centuries AD, the ouroboros was adopted as a symbol by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christians{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=44}} and chapter 136 of the ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', an early Gnostic text, describes \"a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth\".{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=44}} In medieval alchemy, the ouroboros became a typical western dragon with wings, legs, and a tail.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} A famous image of the dragon gnawing on its tail from the eleventh-century [[Codex Marcianus CCXXVIII (406)|Codex Marcianus]] was copied in numerous works on

It differs from the Chinese dragon in that it developed a longer beard. Very occasionally a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the Yeouiju (\uc5ec\uc758\uc8fc), the Korean name for the mythical [[Cintamani]], in its claws or its mouth. It was said that whoever could wield the Yeouiju was blessed with the abilities of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons. As with China, the number nine is significant and auspicious in Korea, and dragons were said to have 81 (9\u00d79) scales on their backs, representing yang essence. Dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds. Hence, many Korean dragons are said to have resided in rivers, lakes, oceans, or even deep mountain ponds. And human journeys to undersea realms, and especially the undersea palace of the Dragon King (\uc6a9\uc655), are common in Korean folklore.<ref>{{cite book| last= Hayward | first = Philip| title= Scaled for Success: The Internationalisation of the Mermaid | year = 2018|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0861967322|url= |page= }}</ref>\n\nIn Korean myths, some kings who founded kingdoms were described as descendants of dragons because the dragon was a symbol of the monarch. [[Lady Aryeong]], who was the first queen of [[Silla]] is said to have been born from a [[cockatrice]],<ref>[[Samguk yusa]]</ref> while the grandmother of [[Taejo of Goryeo]], founder of [[Goryeo]], was reportedly the daughter of the dragon king of the West Sea.<ref>The book of the genealogy of [[Taejo of Goryeo]] - ''Pyeonnyeon-Tong-Long'' (\ud3b8\ub144\ud1b5\ub85d)</ref> And [[Munmu of Silla|King Munmu]] of Silla, who on his deathbed wished to become a dragon of the East Sea in order to protect the kingdom. Dragon patterns were used exclusively by the royal family. The royal robe was also called the dragon robe (\uc6a9\ud3ec). In [[Joseon Dynasty]], the royal insignia, featuring embroidered dragons, were attached to the robe's shoulders, the chest, and back. The King wore five-taloned dragon insignia while the Crown Prince wore four-taloned dragon insignia.<ref>{{cite book| title=\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc637 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 | year = 2004|publisher=Sungshin Women's University Press|isbn=978-8986092639|url= |pages=25\u201326 }}</ref>\n\nKorean folk mythology states that most dragons were originally [[:ko:\uc774\ubb34\uae30|Imugis]] (\uc774\ubb34\uae30), or lesser dragons, which were said to resemble gigantic serpents. There are a few different versions of Korean folklore that describe both what imugis are and how they aspire to become full-fledged dragons. Koreans thought that an Imugi could become a true dragon, ''yong'' or ''mireu'', if it caught a Yeouiju which had fallen from heaven. Another explanation states they are hornless creatures resembling dragons who have been cursed and thus were unable to become dragons. By other accounts, an Imugi is a ''proto-dragon'' which must survive one thousand years in order to become a fully fledged dragon. In either case they are said to be large, benevolent, [[Pythonidae|python]]-like creatures that live in water or caves, and their sighting is associated with good luck.<ref>{{cite book| last= Seo | first = Yeong Dae| title= \uc6a9, \uadf8 \uc2e0\ud654\uc640 \ubb38\ud654 | year = 2002|publisher=Min sokwon|isbn=978-8956380223|url= |page= 85}}</ref>\n\n====Japanese dragon====\n[[File:Hokusai Dragon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Painting of a Japanese dragon by [[Hokusai]] ({{circa}} 1730 \u2013 1849)]]\n{{Main|Japanese dragon}}\nJapanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China, Korea and India.

As Rostam is sleeping, the dragon approaches; Rakhsh attempts to wake Rostam, but fails to alert him to the danger until Rostam sees the dragon. Rakhsh bites the serpent, while Rostam decapitates it.

In this tale, Rostam is still an adolescent and kills a dragon in the \"Orient\" (either India or China depending on the source) by forcing it to swallow either ox hides filled with quicklime and stones or poisoned blades. The dragon swallows these foreign objects and its stomach bursts, after which Rostam flays the dragon and fashions a coat from its hide called the ''babr-e bay\u0101n''. In some variants of the story, Rostam then remains unconscious for two days and nights, but is guarded by his steed [[Rakhsh]]. On reviving, he washes himself in a spring. In the [[Mandaeism|Mandean]] tradition of the story, Rostam hides in a box, is swallowed by the dragon and kills it from inside its belly.

The ''bollar'' and ''errshaja'' are the intermediate stages, while the ''kulshedra'' is the ultimate phase, described as a huge multi-headed fire-spitting female serpent which causes drought, storms, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters against mankind.

In [[Romania]], there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named ''[[zmeu]]''. Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) ''\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043a'', ''\u0446\u043c\u043e\u043a'', or ''smok''.

Sandra Martina Schwab writes, \"With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film ''Reign of Fire'', dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the more technological world of science fiction.

Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region, but [[European dragon|dragons in western cultures]] since the [[High Middle Ages]] have often been depicted as winged, horned, [[Quadrupedalism|four-legged]], and capable of [[Fire breathing|breathing fire]]. [[Chinese dragon|Dragons in eastern cultures]] are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.\n\nThe earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes. Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the [[ancient Near East]] and appear in [[Art of Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamian art]] and literature. Stories about [[Weather god|storm-gods]] slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] and Near Eastern mythologies. Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the ''[[mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u]]'' of [[Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamia]]; [[Apep]] in [[Egyptian mythology]]; [[Vritra|V\u1e5btra]] in the ''[[Rigveda]]''; the [[Leviathan]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; [[Big Ghoul|Grand'Goule]] in the Poitou region in [[France]], [[Python (mythology)|Python]], [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], [[Wyvern]], and the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in [[Greek mythology]]; [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], [[N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr]], and [[Fafnir]] in [[Norse mythology]]; and [[The dragon (Beowulf)|the dragon]] from ''[[Beowulf]]''.\n\nThe popular western image of a dragon is based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions, and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes. In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by [[saint]]s or [[culture hero]]es, as in the popular legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]. They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure. These dragons appear frequently in western [[fantasy]] literature, including ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series by [[J. K. Rowling]], and ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' by [[George R. R. Martin]].\n\nThe word \"dragon\" has also come to be applied to the Chinese ''lung'' (traditional \u9f8d, simplified \u9f99, [[Pinyin]] ''long''), which are associated with good fortune and are thought to have power over rain. Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of [[dragon dance|dragon dancing]] and [[dragon boat|dragon boat racing]]. Many [[East Asia]]n deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions. Dragons were also identified with the [[Emperor of China]], who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles.\n\nCommonalities between dragons traits are often a hybridization of avian, feline, and reptilian features, and may include: snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth. Several modern scholars believe huge extinct or migrating [[crocodile]]s bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern dragon imagery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/where-did-dragons-come-from-23969126/|title=Where Did Dragons Come From?|last=Stromberg|first=Joseph|date=January 23, 2012|website=Smithsonian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/english/200004/29/eng20000429_40001.html|title=Archeologists Find Crocodile is Prototype of Dragon|date=April 29, 2000|website=People's Daily}}</ref> This also fits with the ancient words 'Draco' and 'Drakon', meaning 'large serpent' or 'sea serpent.'\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Beowulf - dracan.jpg|thumb|An early appearance of the [[Old English]] word ''dracan'' in ''[[Beowulf]]''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OCc8TF53RhMC&pg=PA196 Beowulf; a heroic poem of the 8th century, with tr., note and appendix by T.

Jones]] suggests a hypothesis that humans, just like [[monkey]]s, have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, [[Big cat|large cats]], and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32-40}} He cites a study which found that approximately 39 people in a hundred are afraid of snakes{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} and notes that fear of snakes is especially prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} The earliest attested dragons all resemble snakes or bear snakelike attributes.{{sfn|Jones|2000|pages=166\u2013168}} Jones therefore concludes that the reason why dragons appear in nearly all cultures is because of humans' innate fear of snakes and other animals that were major predators of humans' primate ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32}} Dragons are usually said to reside in \"dank caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests\", all places which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=108}}\n\nIn her book ''The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times'' (2000), [[Adrienne Mayor]] argues that some stories of dragons may have been inspired by ancient discoveries of fossils belonging to [[dinosaur]]s and other prehistoric animals.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|pages=xiii\u2013xxii}} She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by \"observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the [[Siwalik Hills]] below the [[Himalayas]]\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the [[Cetus (mythology)|Monster of Troy]] may have been influenced by fossils of ''[[Samotherium]]'', an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are common in the Mediterranean region.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as \"dragon bones\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and are commonly used in Chinese [[traditional medicine]].{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} Mayor, however, is careful to point out that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and notes that Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long \"been considered barren of large fossils.\"{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} In one of her later books, she states that \"Many dragon images around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations

divine dragon.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} Eventually, dragons were only allowed to appear on clothing, houses, and articles of everyday use belonging to the

It differs from the Chinese dragon in that it developed a longer beard. Very occasionally a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the Yeouiju (\uc5ec\uc758\uc8fc), the Korean name for the mythical [[Cintamani]], in its claws or its mouth. It was said that whoever could wield the Yeouiju was blessed with the abilities of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons. As with China, the number nine is significant and auspicious in Korea, and dragons were said to have 81 (9\u00d79) scales on their backs, representing yang essence. Dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds. Hence, many Korean dragons are said to have resided in rivers, lakes, oceans, or even deep mountain ponds. And human journeys to undersea realms, and especially the undersea palace of the Dragon King (\uc6a9\uc655), are common in Korean folklore.<ref>{{cite book| last= Hayward | first = Philip| title= Scaled for Success: The Internationalisation of the Mermaid | year = 2018|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0861967322|url= |page= }}</ref>\n\nIn Korean myths, some kings who founded kingdoms were described as descendants of dragons because the dragon was a symbol of the monarch. [[Lady Aryeong]], who was the first queen of [[Silla]] is said to have been born from a [[cockatrice]],<ref>[[Samguk yusa]]</ref> while the grandmother of [[Taejo of Goryeo]], founder of [[Goryeo]], was reportedly the daughter of the dragon king of the West Sea.<ref>The book of the genealogy of [[Taejo of Goryeo]] - ''Pyeonnyeon-Tong-Long'' (\ud3b8\ub144\ud1b5\ub85d)</ref> And [[Munmu of Silla|King Munmu]] of Silla, who on his deathbed wished to become a dragon of the East Sea in order to protect the kingdom. Dragon patterns were used exclusively by the royal family. The royal robe was also called the dragon robe (\uc6a9\ud3ec). In [[Joseon Dynasty]], the royal insignia, featuring embroidered dragons, were attached to the robe's shoulders, the chest, and back. The King wore five-taloned dragon insignia while the Crown Prince wore four-taloned dragon insignia.<ref>{{cite book| title=\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc637 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 | year = 2004|publisher=Sungshin Women's University Press|isbn=978-8986092639|url= |pages=25\u201326 }}</ref>\n\nKorean folk mythology states that most dragons were originally [[:ko:\uc774\ubb34\uae30|Imugis]] (\uc774\ubb34\uae30), or lesser dragons, which were said to resemble gigantic serpents. There are a few different versions of Korean folklore that describe both what imugis are and how they aspire to become full-fledged dragons. Koreans thought that an Imugi could become a true dragon, ''yong'' or ''mireu'', if it caught a Yeouiju which had fallen from heaven. Another explanation states they are hornless creatures resembling dragons who have been cursed and thus were unable to become dragons. By other accounts, an Imugi is a ''proto-dragon'' which must survive one thousand years in order to become a fully fledged dragon. In either case they are said to be large, benevolent, [[Pythonidae|python]]-like creatures that live in water or caves, and their sighting is associated with good luck.<ref>{{cite book| last= Seo | first = Yeong Dae| title= \uc6a9, \uadf8 \uc2e0\ud654\uc640 \ubb38\ud654 | year = 2002|publisher=Min sokwon|isbn=978-8956380223|url= |page= 85}}</ref>\n\n====Japanese dragon====\n[[File:Hokusai Dragon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Painting of a Japanese dragon by [[Hokusai]] ({{circa}} 1730 \u2013 1849)]]\n{{Main|Japanese dragon}}\nJapanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China, Korea and India.

have had two gold dragons crowned with red standing back-to-back on his royal [[coat of arms]].{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=28}} Originally, heraldic dragons could have any number of legs,{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} but, by the late Middle Ages, due to the widespread proliferation of bestiaries, heraldry began to distinguish between a \"dragon\" (which could only have exactly four legs) and a \"[[wyvern]]\" (which could only have exactly two).{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} In myths, wyverns are associated with viciousness, envy, and pestilence,{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} but, in heraldry, they are used as symbols for overthrowing the tyranny of Satan and his demonic forces.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} Late medieval heraldry also distinguished a draconic creature known as a \"[[cockatrice]]\".{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} A cockatrice is supposedly born when a serpent hatches an egg that has been laid on a dunghill by a rooster{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} and it is so venomous that its breath and its gaze are both lethal to any living creature, except for a weasel, which is the cockatrice's mortal enemy.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} A [[basilisk]] is a serpent with the head of a dragon at the end of its tail that is born when a toad hatches an egg that has been laid in a [[midden]] by a nine-year-old cockatrice.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}} Like the cockatrice, its glare is said to be deadly.{{sfn|Friar|Ferguson|1993|page=168}}\n\n===Post-classical Eastern

dragon|Kulshedra}}\n\nIn [[Albanian mythology|Albanian mythology and folklore]], ''[[stihi]]'', ''[[ljubi]]'', ''[[Kulshedra|bolla, bollar, errshaja and kulshedra]]'' are mythological figures described as serpentine dragons. It is believed that ''bolla'', a water and chthonic demonic serpent, undergoes [[metamorphosis]] passing through four distinct phases if it lives many years without being seen by a human. The ''bollar'' and ''errshaja'' are the intermediate stages, while the ''kulshedra'' is the ultimate phase, described as a huge multi-headed fire-spitting female serpent which causes drought, storms, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters against mankind. She is usually fought and defeated by a [[drangue]], a semi-human winged divine hero and protector of humans. Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of their battles.{{sfnp|Doja|2005|p=449\u2013462}}{{Sfn|Elsie|2001|pp=46-47, 74-76, 153-156}}\n\nIn [[Slavic mythology]], the words ''\"zmey\"'', ''\"zmiy\"'' or ''\"zmaj\"'' are used to describe dragons. These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for \"snake\", which are normally feminine (like Russian ''zmeya''). In [[Romania]], there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named ''[[zmeu]]''. Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) ''\u0441\u043c\u043e\u043a'', ''\u0446\u043c\u043e\u043a'', or ''smok''. In South Slavic folklores, the same thing is also called ''lamya'' (\u043b\u0430\u043c\u044f, \u043b\u0430\u043cj\u0430, lamja). Although quite similar to other [[European dragon]]s, Slavic dragons have their peculiarities.\n\nIn [[Folklore of Russia|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian folklore]], [[Zmey Gorynych]] is a dragon with three heads, each one bearing twin goatlike horns.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=146}} He is said to have breathed fire and smelled of [[sulfur]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=146}} It was believed that [[eclipse]]s were caused by Gorynych temporarily swallowing the sun.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} According to one legend, Gorynych's uncle was the evil sorcerer Nemal Chelovek, who abducted the daughter of the [[tsar]] and imprisoned her in his castle in the [[Ural Mountains]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} Many knights tried to free her, but all of them were killed by Gorynych's fire.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} Then a palace guard in [[Moscow]] named [[Ivan Tsarevich]] overheard two crows talking about the princess.{{sfn|Niles|2013|pages=147\u2013148}} He went to the tsar, who gave him a magic sword, and snuck into the castle.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} When Chelovek attacked Ivan in the form of a giant, the sword flew from Ivan's hand unbidden and killed him.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} Then the sword cut off all three of Gorynych's heads at once.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} Ivan brought the princess back to the tsar, who declared Ivan a nobleman and allowed him to marry the princess.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}}\n\nA popular Polish folk tale is the legend of the [[Wawel Dragon]],{{sfn|Sikorski|1997|page=235}}{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-\u0141ysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} which is first recorded in the ''[[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|Chronica Polonorum]]'' of [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]], written between 1190 and 1208.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-\u0141ysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} According to Kad\u0142ubek, the dragon appeared during the reign of [[Krakus|King Krakus]]{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} and demanded to be fed a fixed number of cattle every week.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} If the villagers failed to provide enough cattle, the dragon would eat the same number of villagers as the number of cattle they had failed to provide.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} Krakus ordered his sons to slay the dragon.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} Since they could not slay it by hand,{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} they tricked the dragon into eating calfskins filled with burning sulfur.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} Once the dragon was dead, the younger brother attacked and murdered his older brother and returned home to claim all the glory for himself,{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} telling his father that his brother had died fighting the dragon.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} The younger brother became king after his father died, but his secret was eventually revealed and he was banished.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}} In the fifteenth century, [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] rewrote the story so that King Krakus himself was the one who slew the dragon.{{sfn|Sikorski|1997|page=235}}{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-\u0141ysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} Another version of the story told by [[Marcin Bielski]] instead has the clever shoemaker Skub\u0119 come up with the idea for slaying the dragon.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}{{sfn|Ro\u017cek|1988|page=27}} Bielski's version is now the most popular.{{sfn|D\u0119bicka}}\n\n==Modern depictions==\n{{see also|List of dragons in popular culture#Dragons in fiction|label 1=List of dragons in fiction}}\n\n[[File:Smaug par David Demaret.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Modern [[Fan art|fan illustration]] by David Demaret of the dragon [[Smaug]] from [[J.

Sandra Martina Schwab writes, \"With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film ''Reign of Fire'', dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the more technological world of science fiction. Indeed, they have been called the emblem of fantasy. The hero's fight against the dragon emphasizes and celebrates his masculinity, whereas revisionist fantasies of dragons and dragon-slaying often undermine traditional gender roles.

{"title_page": "Yan Tan Tethera", "text_new": "{{about|the counting system|the opera|Yan Tan Tethera (opera)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}\n\n'''Yan Tan Tethera''' is a sheep-counting rhyme/system traditionally used by [[shepherd]]s in [[Northern England]] and earlier in some other parts of Britain.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cultural Evolution|first=Kate |last=Distin|year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18971-2|page=93}}</ref> Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the use of traditional number systems was common among shepherds, especially in the [[fells]] of the [[Lake District]]. The ''Yan Tan Tethera'' system was also used for counting stitches in knitting. The words derive from a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic Celtic]] language. Though most of these number systems fell out of use by 1910, some are still in use. \n\nThe word ''yan'' or ''yen'' for \"one\" in some northern English [[dialect]]s generally represents a regular development in [[Northern England English|Northern English]] in which the [[Old English]] long vowel {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} <\u0101> was broken into /ie/, /ia/ and so on. This explains the shift to ''yan'' and ''ane'' from the Old English ''\u0101n'', which is itself derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*ainaz''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Dick |last=Leith |title=A Social History of English |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-09797-5 |page=45}} (Alternate {{ISBN| 978-0-415-09797-0}})</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Griffiths |authorlink=Bill Griffiths (poet)  |title=A Dictionary of North East Dialect |year=2004 |publisher=Northumbria University Press |isbn=1-904794-16-5 |page=191}}</ref> Another example of this development is the Northern English word for \"home\", ''hame'', which has forms such as ''hyem, yem'' and ''yam'' all deriving from the Old English ''h\u0101m''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Griffiths |title=A Dictionary of North East Dialect |year=2004 |publisher=Northumbria University Press |isbn=1-904794-16-5 |page=79}}</ref>\n\n== Importance of keeping count ==\nIn order to keep accurate records (e.g. of birth and death) and to be alert to instances of straying, shepherds must perform frequent head-counts of their flocks. Dating back at least to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, and continuing to the present in some areas like [[Slaidburn]], farms were granted [[Fell farming|fell]] rights, allowing them access to common grazing land. To prevent [[overgrazing]], it was vitally important for each farm to keep accurate, updated head-counts.\n\nThough fell rights are largely obsolete in modern agriculture except in upland areas, farms are often [[subsidy|subsidised]] and [[taxation|taxed]] according to the quantity of their sheep. For this reason, accurate counts are still necessary, and must be performed frequently.\n\nGenerally, a count is the first action performed in the morning and the last action performed at night. A count is made after moving the sheep from one pasture to another, and after any operation involving the sheep, such as [[sheep shearing|shearing]], [[Ear tag|tagging]], foot-trimming, [[mulesing]], etc., although sheep are far less likely to stray while being moved in a group than when grazing at large on open ground.\n\n== Origin and usage ==\n\nSheep-counting systems ultimately derive from [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Celtic languages]], such as [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]; Tim Gay writes: \u201c[Sheep-counting systems from all over the British Isles] all compared very closely to 18th-century [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gay |first=Tim |title=Rural dialects and surviving Britons |url=https://reader.exacteditions.com/magazines/1291/search?q=yan |journal=[[British Archaeology]] |date=July 1999|issue=46 |url-access=subscription |page=18}}</ref> It is impossible, given the corrupted form in which they have survived, to be sure of their exact origin. The counting systems have changed considerably over time.  A particularly common tendency is for certain pairs of adjacent numbers to come to resemble each other by [[rhyme]] (notably 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 6 and 7, or 8 and 9). Still, multiples of five tend to be fairly conservative; compare ''bumfit'' with Welsh ''pymtheg'', in contrast with standard English ''fifteen''.\n\nLike most Celtic numbering systems, they tend to be [[vigesimal]] ([[radix|based]] on the number [[20 (number)|twenty]]), but they usually lack words to describe quantities larger than twenty; though this is not a limitation of either modernised decimal Celtic counting systems or the older ones. To count a large number of sheep, a shepherd would repeatedly count to twenty, placing a mark on the ground, or move his hand to another mark on his crook, or drop a pebble into his pocket to represent each [[20 (number)|score]] (e.g. 5 score sheep = 100 sheep).\n\nTheir use is also attested in a knitting song from Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40wAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA205 |journal=[[Notes and Queries]] |title=Knitting Song |author=R.

[[shepherd]]s in [[Northern England]] and earlier in some other parts of Britain.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cultural Evolution|first=Kate |last=Distin|year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18971-2|page=93}}</ref> Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the use of traditional number systems was common among shepherds, especially in the fells of the [[Lake District]]. The ''Yan Tan Tethera'' system was also used for counting stitches in knitting. The words derive from a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic Celtic]] language. Though most of these number systems fell out of use by 1910, some are still in use. \n\nThe word ''yan'' or ''yen'' for \"one\" in some northern English [[dialect]]s generally represents a regular development in [[Northern England English|Northern English]] in which the [[Old English]] long vowel {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} <\u0101> was broken into /ie/, /ia/ and so on. This explains the shift to ''yan'' and ''ane'' from the Old English ''\u0101n'', which is itself derived from the Proto-Germanic ''*ainaz''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Dick |last=Leith |title=A Social History of English |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-09797-5 |page=45}} (Alternate {{ISBN| 978-0-415-09797-0}})</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Griffiths |authorlink=Bill Griffiths (poet)  |title=A Dictionary of North East Dialect |year=2004 |publisher=Northumbria University Press |isbn=1-904794-16-5 |page=191}}</ref> Another example of this development is the [[Northern England English|Northern English]] word for \"home\", ''hame'', which has forms such as ''hyem, yem'' and ''yam'' all deriving from the [[Old English]] ''h\u0101m''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Griffiths |title=A Dictionary of North East Dialect |year=2004 |publisher=Northumbria University Press |isbn=1-904794-16-5 |page=79}}</ref>\n\n== Importance of keeping count ==\nIn order to keep accurate records (e.g. of birth and death) and to be alert to instances of straying, shepherds must perform frequent head-counts of their flocks. Dating back at least to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period, and continuing to the present in some areas like [[Slaidburn]], farms were granted [[Fell farming|fell]] rights, allowing them access to common grazing land. To prevent [[overgrazing]], it was vitally important for each farm to keep accurate, updated head-counts.\n\nThough fell rights are largely obsolete in modern agriculture except in upland areas, farms are often [[subsidy|subsidised]] and [[taxation|taxed]] according to the quantity of their sheep. For this reason, accurate counts are still necessary, and must be performed frequently.\n\nGenerally, a count is the first action performed in the morning and the last action performed at night. A count is made after moving the sheep from one pasture to another, and after any operation involving the sheep, such as [[sheep shearing|shearing]], [[Ear tag|tagging]], foot-trimming, [[mulesing]], etc., although sheep are far less likely to stray while being moved in a group than when grazing at large on open ground.\n\n== Origin and usage ==\n\nSheep-counting systems ultimately derive from [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[Celtic languages]], such as [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]; Tim Gay writes: \u201c[Sheep-counting systems from all over the British Isles] all compared very closely to 18th-century [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gay |first=Tim |title=Rural dialects and surviving Britons |url=https://reader.exacteditions.com/magazines/1291/search?q=yan |journal=[[British Archaeology]] |date=July 1999|issue=46 |url-access=subscription |page=18}}</ref> It is impossible, given the corrupted form in which they have survived, to be sure of their exact origin. The counting systems have changed considerably over time.  A particularly common tendency is for certain pairs of adjacent numbers to come to resemble each other by [[rhyme]] (notably 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 6 and 7, or 8 and 9). Still, multiples of five tend to be fairly conservative; compare ''bumfit'' with Welsh ''pymtheg'', in contrast with standard English ''fifteen''.\n\nLike most Celtic numbering systems, they tend to be [[vigesimal]] ([[radix|based]] on the number [[20 (number)|twenty]]), but they usually lack words to describe quantities larger than twenty; though this is not a limitation of either modernised decimal Celtic counting systems or the older ones. To count a large number of sheep, a shepherd would repeatedly count to twenty, placing a mark on the ground, or move his hand to another mark on his crook, or drop a pebble into his pocket to represent each [[20 (number)|score]] (e.g. 5 score sheep = 100 sheep).\n\nTheir use is also attested in a knitting song from Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40wAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA205 |journal=[[Notes and Queries]] |title=Knitting Song |author=R.

It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. [[Texas Annexation|annexation]] of [[Republic of Texas|Texas]], which Mexico still considered Mexican territory since the government did not recognize the [[Treaties of Velasco|treaty]] signed by Mexican General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] when he was a prisoner of the [[Texian Army]] during the 1836 [[Texas Revolution]]. The [[Republic of Texas]] was defacto an independent country, but most of its citizens wished to be annexed by the United States. Domestic sectional politics in the U.S. prevented that since Texas would have been a slave state, upsetting the balance of power between northern free states and southern slave states. In the [[1844 United States presidential election]], Democrat [[James K. Polk]] was elected on a platform of expanding U.S. territory in Oregon and Texas. Polk advocated expansion by either peaceful means or by armed force, with the 1845 annexation of Texas as furthering that goal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberg |first1=Amy |title=A Wicked War: Polk, Clay, Lincoln, and the 1846 U.S. Invasion of Mexico |date=2012 |publisher=Vintage |isbn=978-0-307-47599-2 |page=33}}</ref> For Mexico, this was itself a provocation, but Polk went further, sending U.S. Army troops to the area; he sent also a diplomatic mission to Mexico to try to negotiate sale of territory. U.S. troops' presence was provocative and designed to lure Mexico into starting the conflict, putting the onus on Mexico and allowing Polk to argue to Congress that a declaration of war should be issued.<ref>Guardino, Peter. ''The Dead March: A History of the Mexican-American War''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2017, p. 71</ref> Mexican forces [[Thornton Affair|attacked U.S. forces]], and the [[United States Congress]] declared war.\n\nBeyond the disputed area of Texas, U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] along the upper [[Rio Grande]], which had trade relations with the U.S. via the [[Santa Fe Trail]] between Missouri and New Mexico. U.S. forces also moved against the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific coast]] province of [[Alta California]], and then moved south. The [[Pacific Squadron]] of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] blockaded the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast farther south in the lower [[Baja California Territory]]. The Mexican government refused to be pressured into signing a peace treaty at this point, making the U.S. invasion of the Mexican heartland under Major General [[Winfield Scott]] and its capture of the capital [[Mexico City]] a strategy to force peace negotiations. Although Mexico was defeated militarily on the battlefield, politically its government's negotiating a treaty remained a fraught issue, with some factions refusing to consider any recognition of its loss of territory. Although Polk formally relieved his peace envoy, [[Nicholas Trist]], of his post as negotiator, Trist ignored the order and successfully concluded the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. It ended the war and Mexico recognized the [[Mexican Cession]], areas not part of disputed Texas but conquered by the U.S. Army. These were northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States. The U.S. agreed to pay $15&nbsp;million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $3.25&nbsp;million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the [[Texas|State of Texas]] and accepted the [[Rio Grande]] as its northern border with the United States.\n\nThe victory and [[Territorial expansion of the United States|territorial expansion]] Polk envisioned{{sfn|Rives|1913|p=658}} inspired patriotism among some sections of the United States, but the war and treaty drew fierce criticism for their casualties, monetary cost, and heavy-handedness,<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> particularly early on. The question of how to treat the new acquisitions also intensified the debate over [[slavery in the United States]]. Although the [[Wilmot Proviso]] that explicitly forbade the extension of slavery into conquered Mexican territory was not adopted by Congress, debates around it did heighten sectional tensions in the wake of the war. Most scholars see the Mexican\u2013American War as leading to the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865) with many officers trained at [[U.S. Military Academy|West Point]] playing prominent leadership roles on both sides. In Mexico, the war worsened domestic political turmoil. Since the war was fought on home ground, it suffered large loss of life of not only its soldiers, but also its civilian population. The nation's financial foundations were undermined, territory was lost, and national prestige left it in what prominent Mexicans called a \"state of degradation and ruin... [As for] the true origin of the war, it is sufficient to say that the insatiable ambition of the United States, favored by our weakness, caused it.\"<ref name=\"Alcaraz, pp. 1-2\">Alcaraz, et al.

Mexico had successfully resisted [[Spanish attempts to reconquer Mexico|Spanish attempts to reconquer]] former in the 1820s and resisted the French in the so-called [[Pastry War]] of 1838, but the secessionists' success in Texas and the Yucatan against the Centralist government of Mexico showed the weakness of the Mexican government, which changed hands multiple times. The Mexican military and the [[Catholic Church in Mexico]], both privileged institutions with conservative political views, were stronger politically than the Mexican state.\n\nNeither colonial Mexico, nor the newly sovereign Mexican state effectively controlled Mexico's far north and west. In the decades preceding the war, [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous groups]] raided in Mexico's sparsely settled north, which prompted the Mexican government to sponsor migration from the United States to the [[Mexican Texas|Mexican province of Texas]] to create a buffer. However, the newly named \"Texans\" revolted against the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico]] led by [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]. The conservative Centralists usurped the Mexican Federalist [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], creating a unitary central state and abolishing the independence of Mexican states under the federalist constitution.  In 1836 [[Texas Revolution|Texas rebelled]], defeating the Mexican army and created a republic. Although General Santa Anna had signed a treaty with the Texans acknowledging their independence, the agreement was not recognized by the Mexican government, which still claimed it as part of its national territory.  In 1845, the Texan Republic agreed to an offer of annexation by the [[U.S. Congress]] and became the 28th state in the Union on December 29 that year.<ref name=\"Republic of Texas\">See {{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mzr02|title=Republic of Texas|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429075659/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mzr02|archivedate=April 29, 2009|url-status=bot: unknown|accessdate=2014-07-05|date=2010-06-15}}</ref>  Having fought and bled over this sparsely populated northern territory, Mexico could not just relinquish it to rebel republic or to the United States by sale.\n\n===U.S. expansionism===\n{{Main|Manifest destiny}}\nSince the early nineteenth century, the U.S. sought to expand its territory, which evolved into the idea of [[Manifest Destiny]].  Jefferson's [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803 gave Spain and the U.S. an undefined border. The young and weak U.S. fought the [[War of 1812]] with Great Britain, seeking unsuccessfully to take portions of Britain's territory of Canada. Britain burned the White House as it captured Washington, D.C.  Some boundary issues were solved between the U.S. and Spain with the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] of 1818. The U.S. negotiator, [[John Quincy Adams]] wanted clear possession of east of Florida and establishing U.S. claims above the 42nd parallel, which for Spain sought to limit U.S. expansion into what is now the American Southwest. The U.S. then sought to purchase territory from Mexico, starting in 1825.  Under U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]], there was a sustained effort to acquire northern Mexican territory, with no success.<ref>Schoultz, ''Beneath the United States'', pp. 19-20</ref>\n\nHistorian Peter Guardino argues that in the war \"the greatest advantage the United States had was its prosperity.\"<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 6</ref> Economic prosperity likely also contributed to political stability in the U.S. In contrast to Mexico's financial precariousness, the U.S. was a prosperous country with major resource endowments that Mexico lacked. Its war of independence had taken place generations earlier and was a relatively short conflict that ended with French intervention on the side of the 13 colonies. After independence the U.S. grew rapidly and expanded westward, marginalizing and displacing Native Americans as white settlers cleared land and established farms. With the [[industrial revolution]] in Great Britain increasing the demand for cotton for textile factories, there was a large external market of a valuable commodity produced by slave labor in the southern states. This demand helped fuel expansion into northern Mexico. Although there were political conflicts in the U.S., they were largely contained by the framework of the constitution and did not result in revolution or rebellion by 1846, but rather by sectional political conflicts. This was to change in the aftermath of the Mexican\u2013American War in the bloody [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). But the expansionism of the U.S. was driven in part by the need to acquire new territory for economic reasons, in particular, as cotton exhausted the soil in areas of the south, new lands had to be brought under cultivation to supply the demand for it. Northerners in the U.S. sought to develop the country's existing resources and expand the industrial sector without expanding nation's territory. The existing balance of sectional interests would be disrupted by the expansion of slavery into new territory. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] strong beliefs in favor of expansion, so it is not by chance that the U.S. went to war with Mexico under a Democratic president, [[James K. Polk]].<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 18-22</ref>\n\n===Situation in Northern Mexico===\n{{see also|Comanche-Mexico Wars|Apache-Mexico Wars}}\n[[File:Mexico 1832, Region Comanche.PNG|thumb|alt=An Osage The boundaries of Comancheria \u2013 the Comanche homeland.|The 1832 boundaries of [[Comancheria]], the Comanche homeland]]\n[[File:Comanches.jpg|thumb|upright|Comanches of West [[Texas]] in war regalia, c. 1830.]]\nMexico's military and diplomatic capabilities declined after it attained independence from Spain in 1821 and left the northern one-half of the country vulnerable to attacks by [[Comanche]], [[Apache]], and [[Navajo]] native Americans.<ref name=\"Smith1963\">{{cite journal |author1=Ralph A.

It was mainly desert with little rainfall so that sedentary agriculture never developed there during the prehispanic or colonial periods. During the colonial era (1521-1821) had not been well controlled politically. After [[Mexican independence|independence]], Mexico contended with internal struggles that sometimes verged on civil war and the situation on northern frontier was not a high priority for the government in central Mexico. In northern Mexico, the end of Spanish rule was marked by the end of financing for [[presidio]]s and for gifts to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to maintain the peace. The Comanche and Apache were successful in raiding for livestock and looting much of northern Mexico outside the scattered cities.  Northern Mexico became again a violent and chaotic area due to the Indian raids. The raids after 1821 resulted in the death of many Mexicans, halted most transportation and communications, and decimated the ranching industry that was a mainstay of the northern economy. As a result, the demoralized civilian population of northern Mexico put up little resistance to the invading U.S. army.<ref name=\"DeLay2008\">{{cite book|author=Brian DeLay|title=War of a Thousand Deserts: Indian Raids and the U.

After independence, the Mexican government implemented the policy, granting [[Moses Austin]], a banker from Missouri, a large tract of land in Texas. Austin died before he could bring his plan of recruiting American settlers for the land to fruition, but his son, [[Stephen F. Austin]], brought over 300 American families into Texas.<ref>Jes\u00fas F. de la Teja, \"Texas Secession\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, 1403\u201304.</ref> This started the steady trend of migration from the United States into the Texas frontier. Austin's colony was the most successful of several colonies authorized by the Mexican government. The Mexican government intended the new settlers to act as a buffer between the [[Tejano]] residents and the [[Comanche]]s, but the non-Hispanic colonists tended to settle where there were decent farmland and trade connections with American Louisiana, which the United States had acquired in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], rather than farther west where they would have been an effective buffer against the Indians.\n\nIn 1829, as a result of the large influx of American immigrants, the non-Hispanic outnumbered native Spanish speakers in Texas. President [[Vicente Guerrero]], a hero of Mexican independence, moved to gain more control over Texas and its influx of non-Hispanic colonists from the southern U.S. and discourage further immigration by abolishing slavery in Mexico.<ref name=\"Santoni 1511\"/><ref>Douglas W. Richmond, \"Vicente Guerrero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 617.</ref> The Mexican government also decided to reinstate the property tax and increase tariffs on shipped American goods. The settlers and many Mexican businessmen in the region rejected the demands, which led to Mexico closing Texas to additional immigration, which continued from the United States into Texas illegally.\n\nIn 1834, Mexican conservatives seized the political initiative and General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] became the centralist president of Mexico.  The conservative-dominated congress abandoned the [[Federalist Constitution of 1824|federal system]], replacing it with a unitary central government that removed power from the states. Leaving politics to those in Mexico City, General Santa Anna led the Mexican army to quash the semi-independence of Texas. He had done that in Coahuila (in 1824, Mexico had merged Texas and Coahuila into the enormous state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]). Finally, Stephen F. Austin called Texians to arms, and they declared independence from Mexico in 1836. After Santa Anna defeated the Texians in the [[Battle of the Alamo]], he was defeated by the [[Texian Army]] commanded by General [[Sam Houston]] and captured at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]; he signed an [[Treaties of Velasco|agreement]] with [[David G. Burnet|David Burnet]] to allow Texas to plead its case for independence with the Mexican government, but did not commit himself or Mexico to anything beyond that.  He negotiated under duress and as a captive, and therefore had no standing to commit Mexico a treaty. The Mexican Congress did not ratify it.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 176-77.</ref> Although Mexico did not recognize Texas independence, Texas consolidated its status as an independent republic and received official recognition from Britain, France, and the United States, which all advised Mexico not to try to reconquer the new nation. Most Texians wanted to join the United States, but annexation of Texas was contentious in the [[United States Congress|US Congress]], where [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] were largely opposed, although neither group went so far as to deny funds for the war.<ref name=\"zinn\"/>{{rp|150\u2013155}}\n\nPublic opinion in the U.S. about the war was mixed.

The Boston ''Courier'' and [[Horace Greeley]]'s New York ''Tribune'' opposed it.

The Republic of Texas claimed land up to the [[Rio Grande]] based on the [[Treaties of Velasco]], but Mexico refused to accept these as valid, claiming that the Rio Grande in the treaty was the Nueces, since the current Rio Grande has always been called Rio Bravo in Mexico. The ill-fated [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]] of 1841 attempted to realize the claim to New Mexican territory east of the Rio Grande, but its members were captured and imprisoned.  Reference to the Rio Grande boundary of Texas was omitted from the US Congress's annexation resolution to help secure passage after the annexation treaty failed in the Senate. President Polk claimed the Rio Grande boundary, and when Mexico sent forces over the Rio Grande, this provoked a dispute.{{sfn|Rives|1913|pp=165\u2013168}}\n\n=== Polk's gambits ===\nIn July 1845, Polk sent General [[Zachary Taylor]] to Texas, and by October Taylor commanded 3,500 Americans on the [[Nueces River]], ready to take by force the disputed land. Polk wanted to protect the border and also coveted for the U.S. the continent clear to the Pacific Ocean. At the same time Polk wrote to the American consul in the Mexican territory of Alta California, disclaiming American ambitions in California, but offering to support independence from Mexico or voluntary accession to the United States, and warning that the United States would oppose a British or French takeover.{{sfn|Rives|1913|pp=165\u2013168}}\n\nTo end another [[Fifty-Four Forty or Fight|war scare with the United Kingdom]] over the [[Oregon Country]], Polk signed the [[Oregon Treaty]] dividing the territory, angering Northern Democrats who felt he was prioritizing Southern expansion over Northern expansion.\n\nIn the winter of 1845\u20131846, the federally commissioned explorer [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and a group of armed men appeared in Alta California. After telling the Mexican governor and the American Consul Larkin he was merely buying supplies on the way to Oregon, he instead went to the populated area of California and visited [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] and the [[Salinas Valley]], explaining he had been looking for a seaside home for his mother.{{sfn|Rives|1913|pp=172\u2013173}} Mexican authorities became alarmed and ordered him to leave. Fr\u00e9mont responded by building a fort on [[Fremont Peak (California)|Gavilan Peak]] and raising the American flag. Larkin sent word that Fr\u00e9mont's actions were counterproductive. Fr\u00e9mont left California in March but returned to California and took control of the [[California Battalion]] following the outbreak of the [[California Republic#Bear Flag Revolt|Bear Flag Revolt]] in Sonoma.<ref>Mary Lee Spence, and Donald Jackson, ''The Expeditions of John Charles Fremont: The Bear Flag Revolt and the Court-Martial''.

Before the war with the United States, the military faced both internal and foreign challenges. The Spanish still occupied the coastal fortress of San Juan de Ul\u00faa, and Spain did not recognize Mexico's independence, so that the new nation was at risk for invasion.

The permanent forces consisted of 12 regiments of infantry (of two battalions each), three brigades of artillery, eight regiments of cavalry, one separate squadron and a brigade of dragoons. The militia amounted to nine infantry and six cavalry regiments.

The Mexican army was using surplus British [[musket]]s (e.g. [[Brown Bess]]) from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] period. While at the beginning of the war the majority of American soldiers were still equipped with the very similar Springfield 1816 flintlock muskets, more reliable [[Caplock mechanism|caplock]] models gained large inroads within the rank and file as the conflict progressed. Some US troops carried radically modern weapons that gave them a significant advantage over their Mexican counterparts, such as the Springfield 1841 rifle of the Mississippi Rifles and the Colt Paterson revolver of the Texas Rangers. In the later stages of the war, the US Mounted Rifles were issued [[Colt Walker]] [[revolvers]], of which the US Army had ordered 1,000 in 1846. Most significantly, throughout the war, the superiority of the US artillery often carried the day. While technologically Mexican and American artillery operated on the same plane, US army training, as well as the quality and reliability of their logistics, gave US guns and cannoneers a significant edge.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nDesertion was a major problem for the Mexican army, depleting forces on the eve of battle. Most soldiers were peasants who held loyalty to their village and family, but not to the generals who had conscripted them. Often hungry and ill, under-equipped, only partially trained, and never well paid, the soldiers were held in contempt by their officers and had little reason to fight the invading US forces. Looking for their opportunity, many slipped away from camp to find their way back to their home village.<ref>{{cite book | first=Douglas |last=Meed | title=The Mexican War, 1846\u20131848 | publisher = Routledge | year=2003 | page=67}}</ref>  However, the Mexican Army repeatedly regrouped despite its many defeats and continued the fight against the invaders right to Mexico City.  \n \nIn his 1885 memoirs, former US President [[Ulysses Grant]] (himself a veteran of the Mexican war) attributed Mexico's defeat to the poor quality of their army, writing:\n\n{{blockquote| \"The Mexican army of that day was hardly an organization.

With all this I have seen as brave stands made by some of these men as I have ever seen made by soldiers.  Now Mexico has a standing army larger than the United States.

Just before the outbreak of the war, Liberal General [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] was President (December 1844-December 1845), and willing to engage in talks so long as he did not appear to be caving to the U.S., but he was accused by many Mexican factions of selling out his country (''vendepatria'') for considering it.<ref>Bauer, ''The Mexican War'', p. 16-17</ref> He was overthrown by Conservative [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|Mariano Paredes]] (December 1845-July 1846), who left the presidency to fight the invading U.S. Army, and was replaced by his vice president [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]] (28 July 1846&nbsp;\u2013 4 August 1846). The conservative Bravo was overthrown by federalists liberals who re-established the federal [[Constitution of 1824]]. [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Salas]] (6 August 1846&nbsp;\u2013 23 December 1846) served as president, and held elections under the restored federalist system.  General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna won those elections, but as was his practice, left administration to his vice president, who was again liberal [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]] (23 December 1846&nbsp;\u2013 21 March 1847). In February 1847, conservatives rebelled against the liberal government's attempt to take Church property to fund the war effort. The [[Revolt of the Polkos]] saw the Catholic Church and conservatives paid soldiers to rise against the liberal government.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara. \"Mexico\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 4, p. 10. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref>  Santa Anna had to leave his campaign to return to the capital to sort out the political mess.  Santa Anna briefly held the presidency again, from 21 March 1847&nbsp;\u2013 2 April 1847. His troops were deprived of support that would allow them to continue the fight. The conservatives demanded the removal of G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, and this was accomplished by abolishing the office of vice president.  Santa Anna returned to the field, replaced in the presidency by [[Pedro Mar\u00eda de Anaya]] (2 April 1847&nbsp;\u2013 20 May 1847). Santa Anna returned to the presidency on 20 May 1847 when Anaya left to fight the invasion, serving until 15 September 1847. Always preferring the battle field to administration, Santa Anna left office again, leaving the office to [[Manuel de la Pe\u00f1a y Pe\u00f1a]] (16 September 1847&nbsp;\u2013 13 November 1847). With U.S. forces occupying the Mexican capital and much of the heartland, negotiating a peace treaty was an exigent matter, and Pe\u00f1a y Pe\u00f1a left office to do that. Pedro Mar\u00eda Anaya returned to the presidency 13 November 1847&nbsp;\u2013 8 January 1848.

At the beginning of the war, the US Army had eight regiments of infantry (three battalions each), four artillery regiments and three mounted regiments (two dragoons, one of mounted rifles). These regiments were supplemented by 10 new regiments (nine of infantry and one of cavalry) raised for one year of service by the act of Congress from February 11, 1847.<ref>Robarts, \"Mexican War veterans\", pp. 1\u201324.</ref>\n\nAlthough Polk hoped to avoid a protracted war over Texas, the extended conflict stretched regular army resources, necessitating recruitment of volunteers with short-term enlistments. Some enlistments were for a year, but others were for 3 or 6 months.<ref>Robarts, \"Mexican War veterans\", pp. 39\u201379.</ref> The best volunteers signed up for a year's service in the summer of 1846, with their enlistments expiring just when General [[Winfield Scott]]'s campaign was poised to capture Mexico City. Many did not re-enlist, deciding that they would rather return home than place themselves in harm's way of disease, threat of dying or being injured on the battlefield, or in guerrilla warfare.  Their patriotism was doubted by some in the U.S., but they were not counted as deserters.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 209-10.</ref>  The volunteers were far less disciplined than the regular army, with many committing attacks on the civilian population, sometimes due simply to anti-Catholic and anti-Mexican racial bias.<ref>Foos, Paul.

There were two reasons for this. Both General Scott and General Taylor had such armies as are not often got together. At the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca-de-la-Palma, General Taylor had a small army, but it was composed exclusively of regular troops, under the best of drill and discipline. Every officer, from the highest to the lowest, was educated in his profession, not at West Point necessarily, but in the camp, in garrison, and many of them in Indian wars. The rank and file were probably inferior, as material out of which to make an army, to the volunteers that participated in all the later battles of the war; but they were brave men, and then drill and discipline brought out all there was in them. A better army, man for man, probably never faced an enemy than the one commanded by General Taylor in the earliest two engagements of the Mexican war. The volunteers who followed were of better material, but without drill or discipline at the start. They were associated with so many disciplined men and professionally educated officers, that when they went into engagements it was with a confidence they would not have felt otherwise. They became soldiers themselves almost at once. All these conditions we would enjoy again in case of war.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4367/4367-h/4367-h.htm#ch5 | title=Personal Memoirs of U. S.

Enlarging the country, particularly through armed combat against a sovereign nation, deepened sectional divisions. Polk had narrowly won the popular vote in the 1844 Presidential election and decisively won the Electoral College, but with the annexation of Texas in 1845 and the outbreak of war in 1846, Polk's Democrats lost the House of Representatives to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which opposed the war.  Unlike Mexico, which had weak formal institutions of governance and the intervention of the military in politics on a regular basis and multiple changes of government, the U.S. generally kept its political divisions within the bounds of the institutions of governance.\n\n==Outbreak of the war==\nIn 1846, after Polk ordered General Taylor's troops into what the U.S. claimed was disputed territory, [[Thornton Affair|Mexican forces attacked a U.S. Army outpost]] (\"[[Thornton Affair]]\"), killing 12 U.S. soldiers and capturing 52. Polk cited this attack as an invasion of U.S. territory and requested that the [[United States Congress|Congress]] declare war. Later, freshman [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] Congressman from Illinois, [[Abraham Lincoln]] challenged Polk's assertion that American blood had been shed on American soil, calling it \"a bold falsification of history.\"<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 206</ref><ref>Bauer, ''The Mexican War, 1846-1848'', p. 370</ref>\n\n===Initial skirmish at the Nueces Strip===\n{{main|Nueces Strip}}\nPresident Polk ordered General Taylor and his forces south to the Rio Grande, territory that had not been considered the boundary of Texas.

On April 25, 1846, a 2,000-man Mexican cavalry detachment attacked a 70-man U.S. patrol under the command of Captain Seth Thornton, which had been sent into the contested territory north of the Rio Grande and south of the Nueces River.

Grant]], who had opposed the war but served as an army lieutenant in Taylor's Army, claims in his ''[[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|Personal Memoirs]]'' (1885) that the main goal of the U.S. Army's advance from Nueces River to Rio Grande was to provoke the outbreak of war without attacking first, to debilitate any political opposition to the war.<blockquote>The presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputed territory farthest from the Mexican settlements, was not sufficient to provoke hostilities. We were sent to provoke a fight, but it was essential that Mexico should commence it. It was very doubtful whether Congress would declare war; but if Mexico should attack our troops, the Executive could announce, \"Whereas, war exists by the acts of, etc.,\" and prosecute the contest with vigor. Once initiated there were but few public men who would have the courage to oppose it. ... Mexico showing no willingness to come to the Nueces to drive the invaders from her soil, it became necessary for the \"invaders\" to approach to within a convenient distance to be struck. Accordingly, preparations were begun for moving the army to the Rio Grande, to a point near Matamoras [sic]. It was desirable to occupy a position near the largest centre of population possible to reach, without absolutely invading territory to which we set up no claim whatever.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4367/4367-h/4367-h.htm\n| title = PERSONAL MEMOIRS U.

Painting commissioned by the U.S. Army]]\n\nA few days after the defeat of the U.S. troops by General Arista, the [[Siege of Fort Texas]] began on May 3, 1846. Mexican artillery at Matamoros opened fire on Fort Texas, which replied with its own guns. The bombardment continued for 160 hours<ref name=\"Brooks122\"/> and expanded as Mexican forces gradually surrounded the fort. Thirteen U.S. soldiers were injured during the bombardment, and two were killed.<ref name=\"Brooks122\">Brooks (1849), p. 122.</ref> Among the dead was Jacob Brown, after whom the fort was later named.<ref>Brooks (1849), pp. 91, 117.</ref>\n\nOn May 8, Zachary Taylor and 2,400 troops arrived to relieve the fort.<ref>Brooks (1849), p. 121.</ref> However, General Arista rushed north and intercepted him with a force of 3,400 at [[Battle of Palo Alto|Palo Alto]]. The U.S. Army employed \"flying artillery\", their term for [[horse artillery]], a type of mobile light artillery that was mounted on horse carriages with the entire crew riding horses into battle. It had a devastating effect on the Mexican army. In contrast to the \"flying artillery\" of the Americans, the Mexican cannons at the [[Battle of Palo Alto]] fired at such slow velocities that it was possible for American soldiers to dodge artillery rounds.<ref>Morgan, Robert \"Lions of the West\" Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2011, p. 237.</ref> The Mexicans replied with cavalry skirmishes and their own artillery. The U.S. flying artillery somewhat demoralized the Mexican side, and seeking terrain more to their advantage, the Mexicans retreated to the far side of a dry riverbed ''([[Resaca (channel)|resaca]])'' during the night. It provided a natural fortification, but during the retreat, Mexican troops were scattered, making communication difficult.<ref name=\"Brooks122\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]] the next day, the two sides engaged in fierce [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The [[United States Cavalry|U.S. Cavalry]] managed to capture the Mexican artillery, causing the Mexican side to retreat\u2014a retreat that turned into a rout.<ref name=\"Brooks122\"/> Fighting on unfamiliar terrain, his troops fleeing in retreat, Arista found it impossible to rally his forces. Mexican casualties were significant, and the Mexicans were forced to abandon their artillery and baggage. Fort Brown inflicted additional casualties as the withdrawing troops passed by the fort. Many Mexican soldiers drowned trying to swim across the Rio Grande.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Both these engagements were fought before war was declared.\n\n===Declarations of war===\n[[File:Mexican\u2013American War (without Scott's Campaign)-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Overview map of the war.

After the U.S.  He wrote to the government in Mexico City, stating he did not want to return to the presidency, but he would like to come out of exile in Cuba to use his military experience to reclaim Texas for Mexico. President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], who had been Santa Anna's vice president in 1833-34 and ousted by him, was driven to desperation.  He accepted the offer and allowed Santa Anna to return. Unbeknownst to President G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with U.S. representatives to discuss a sale all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price on the condition that he be allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades. Polk sent his own representative to Cuba, [[Alexander Slidell MacKenzie]] to negotiate directly with Santa Anna. The negotiations were secret and there are no written records of the meetings, but there was some understanding that came out of the meetings. Polk asked the U.S. congress for $2&nbsp;million to be used in negotiating a treaty with Mexico. The U.S. allowed Santa Anna was to return to Mexico.  Santa Anna denied all knowledge of meeting with the U.S. representative or any offers or transactions. Rather than being Polk's [[Trojan horse]], he pocketed any money given him, and began to plan the defense of Mexico. The Americans were dismayed, including General Scott.  \"Santa Anna gloated over his enemies' na\u00efvet\u00e9: 'The United States was deceived in believing that I would be capable of betraying my mother country.'\"<ref>quoted in Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'' p. 255. The negotiations are discussed pp. 253-54</ref> Santa Anna avoided getting involved in politics, dedicating himself to Mexico's military defense. While politicians attempted to reset the governing framework to a federal republic, Santa Anna left for the front to retake lost northern territory. Although Santa Anna was elected president in 1846, he refused to govern, leaving that to his vice president, while he sought to engage with General [[Zachary Taylor]]'s forces.  With the restored federal republic, some states refused to support the national military campaign led by Santa Anna. He had battled some states into submission a decade before. Santa Anna urged vice president G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas to act as a dictator to get the men and materiel needed for the war. G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas forced a loan from the Catholic Church to secure funds for Sant Anna's army, but the funds were not available in time bolstering his army's readiness to attack Taylor's.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'' pp. 259-61</ref>\n\n==Reaction in the United States==\n\n===Opposition to the war===\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Nicholas Shepherd, 1846-crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abraham Lincoln]] in his late 30s as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], when he opposed the Mexican\u2013American War.

Most [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] in the North and South opposed it;<ref name=\"Jay166\">Jay (1853), pp. 165\u2013166.</ref> most Democrats supported it.<ref name=\"Jay165\">Jay (1853), p. 165.</ref> Southern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], animated by a popular belief in [[Manifest Destiny]], supported it in hope of adding slave-owning territory to the South and avoiding being outnumbered by the faster-growing North. [[John L. O'Sullivan]], editor of the ''Democratic Review'', coined this phrase in its context, stating that it must be \"our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.\"<ref>See O'Sullivan's 1845 article [http://web.grinnell.edu/courses/HIS/f01/HIS202-01/Documents/OSullivan.html \"Annexation\"], ''United States Magazine and Democratic Review''.</ref>\n\nNorthern antislavery elements feared the expansion of the Southern [[Slave Power]]; Whigs generally wanted to strengthen the economy with industrialization, not expand it with more land. Among the most vocal opposing the war in the House of Representatives was former U.S. president, [[John Quincy Adams]] now a representative from [[Massachusetts]]. Adams had first voiced concerns about expanding into Mexican territory in 1836 when he opposed Texas annexation following its de facto independence from Mexico. He continued this argument in 1846 for the same reason. War with Mexico would add new slavery territory to the nation. When the question to go to war with Mexico came to a vote on 13 May 1846, Adams spoke a resounding \"No!\" in the chamber. Only 13 others followed his lead. Despite that opposition, he later voted for war appropriations.<ref name=\"zinn\"/>{{rp|151}}\n\nEx-slave [[Frederick Douglass]] opposed the war and was dismayed by the weakness of the anti-war movement. \"The determination of our slave holding president, and the probability of his success in wringing from the people, men and money to carry it on, is made evident by the puny opposition arrayed against him. None seem willing to take their stand for peace at all risks.\"<ref>quoted in Christensen, ''The U.S.-Mexican War'', p. 74.</ref>\n\nPolk was generally able to manipulate Whigs into supporting appropriations for the war, but only once it had already started and then \"clouding the situation with a number of false statements about Mexican actions.\"<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 22.</ref>  Not everyone went along. [[Joshua Giddings]] led a group of dissenters in Washington D.C. He called the war with Mexico \"an aggressive, unholy, and unjust war\", and voted against supplying soldiers and weapons. He said: \"In the murder of Mexicans upon their own soil, or in robbing them of their country, I can take no part either now or hereafter. The guilt of these crimes must rest on others. I will not participate in them.<ref>Giddings, Joshua Reed. ''Speeches in Congress [1841\u20131852]'', J.P. Jewett and Company, 1853, p. 17.</ref>\n\nFellow Whig [[Abraham Lincoln]] contested Polk's causes for the war. Polk had said that Mexico had \"shed American blood upon American soil\". Lincoln submitted eight \"[[Spot Resolutions]]\", demanding that Polk state the exact spot where Thornton had been attacked and American blood shed, and clarify whether or not that location was actually American soil, or in fact had been claimed by Spain and Mexico. Lincoln, too, did not actually stop money for men or supplies in the war effort.<ref name=\"zinn\"/>{{rp|151}}\n\nWhig Senator [[Thomas Corwin]] of Ohio gave a long speech indicting presidential war in 1847. In the Senate, February 11, 1847.</ref> Whig leader [[Robert Toombs]] of Georgia declared: \"This war is nondescript ... We charge the President with usurping the war-making power&nbsp;... with seizing a country&nbsp;... which had been for centuries, and was then in the possession of the Mexicans. ... Let us put a check upon this lust of dominion. We had territory enough, Heaven knew.<ref>[[Albert J. Beveridge|Beveridge]] 1:417.</ref>\n\nNorthern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] attacked the war as an attempt by slave-owners to strengthen the grip of slavery and thus ensure their continued influence in the federal government. Prominent artists and writers opposed the war. The [[Transcendentalist]] writers [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] attacked the popular war. Thoreau, who served jail time for his opposition, turned a lecture into an essay now known as ''[[Civil Disobedience]]''. Emerson was succinct, predicting that, \"The United States will conquer Mexico, but it will be as a man who swallowed the arsenic which brings him down in turn. Mexico will poison us.\" Events proved him right, as arguments over the expansion of slavery in the lands seized from Mexico would fuel the drift to civil war just a dozen years later.<ref name=\"TD-20180818\">{{cite web |last1=Sjursen |first1=Danny |title=The Fraudulent Mexican-American War (1846\u201348) |url=https://www.truthdig.com/articles/american-history-for-truthdiggers-the-fraudulent-mexican-american-war-1846-48/ |website=Truthdig |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |date=2018-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDemocratic Representative [[David Wilmot]] introduced the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would prohibit slavery in new territory acquired from Mexico.

They saw the territories as actually unsettled, ungoverned, and unprotected frontier lands, whose non-aboriginal population, where there was any at all, represented a substantial\u2014in places even a majority\u2014American component. Moreover, the territories were feared to be under imminent threat of acquisition by America's rival on the continent, the British.\n\nPresident Polk reprised these arguments in his Third Annual Message to Congress on December 7, 1847.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=29488 |title=James K.

He also elaborated upon the many outstanding financial claims by American citizens against Mexico and argued that, in view of the country's insolvency, the cession of some large portion of its northern territories was the only indemnity realistically available as compensation. This helped to rally congressional Democrats to his side, ensuring passage of his war measures and bolstering support for the war in the U.S.\n\nFollowing the signing of the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], Polk sought to send troops to Yucatan, where there was a civil war between secessionists and those supporting the Mexican government. The U.S. Congress refused his request. The Mexican War was supposed to be short and nearly bloodless. It was neither. Congress did not support more foreign conflict.<ref>Christiansen, ''The U.S.-Mexico War'', p. 220</ref>\n\n===U.S. journalism during the war===\n[[File:War News from Mexico.jpg|thumb|upright|left|250px|''War News from Mexico'' (1848)]]\nThe Mexican\u2013American War was the first U.S. war that was covered by [[mass media]], primarily the [[penny press]] and was the first foreign war covered primarily by U.S. correspondents.<ref>Tom Reilly, \"Newspaper Suppression During the Mexican War, 1846\u201348,\" ''Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly'', Vol 54, Issue 2, pp. 262\u2013349, first published June 1, 1977, http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107769907705400205</ref> Press coverage in the United States was characterized by support for the war and widespread public interest and demand for coverage of the conflict. Mexican coverage of the war (both written by Mexicans and Americans based in Mexico) was affected by press censorship, first by the Mexican government and later by the American military.\n\n[[Walt Whitman]] enthusiastically endorsed the war in 1846, and showed his disdainful attitude toward Mexico and boosterism for Manifest Destiny: \"What has miserable, inefficient Mexico--with her superstition, her burlesque upon freedom, her actual tyranny by the few over the many--what has she to do with the great mission of peopling the new world with a noble race?

By late 1846, the U.S. Army had captured all of northern Mexico, as far south as [[Monterrey]]. The [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] sent a U.S. Cavalry force under [[Stephen W.

Kearny and his force entered Santa Fe and claimed the New Mexico Territory for the [[United States]] without a shot being fired. Kearny declared himself the military governor of the [[New Mexico Territory]] on August 18 and established a [[U.S. provisional government of New Mexico|civilian government]]. American officers with a background in law drew up a temporary legal system for the territory called the [[Kearny Code]].<ref>Morgan, Robert (2011). ''Lions of the West''.

He appointed [[Charles Bent]] as New Mexico's first territorial governor.\n\nFollowing Kearny's departure, dissenters in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] plotted a Christmas uprising. When the plans were discovered by the U.S. authorities, the dissenters postponed the uprising. They attracted numerous Indian allies, including [[Puebloan peoples]], who also wanted to push the Americans from the territory. On the morning of January 19, 1847, the insurrectionists began the revolt in Don Fernando de Taos, present-day [[Taos, New Mexico]], which later gave it the name the [[Taos Revolt]]. They were led by [[Pablo Montoya]], a New Mexican, and [[Tom\u00e1s Romero]], a Taos [[Puebloan peoples|pueblo Indian]] also known as ''Tomasito'' (Little Thomas).\n\nRomero led an Indian force to the house of Governor [[Charles Bent]], where they broke down the door, shot Bent with arrows, and scalped him in front of his family. They moved on, leaving Bent still alive. With his wife Ignacia and children, and the wives of friends [[Kit Carson]] and Thomas Boggs, the group escaped by digging through the adobe walls of their house into the one next door. When the insurgents discovered the party, they killed Bent, but left the women and children unharmed.\n\nThe next day a large armed force of approximately 500 New Mexicans and Pueblo attacked and laid siege to Simeon Turley's mill in [[Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico|Arroyo Hondo]], several miles outside of Taos. [[Charles Autobees]], an employee at the mill, saw the men coming. He rode to Santa Fe for help from the occupying U.S. forces. Eight to ten [[mountain man|mountain men]] were left at the mill for defense. After a day-long battle, only two of the mountain men survived, [[John David Albert]] and [[Thomas Tate Tobin]], Autobees' half brother. Both escaped separately on foot during the night. The same day New Mexican insurgents killed seven American traders who were passing through the village of [[Mora, New Mexico|Mora]]. At most, 15 Americans were killed in both actions on January 20.\n\nThe U.S. military moved quickly to quash the revolt; Col. Price led more than 300 U.S. troops from Santa Fe to Taos, together with 65 volunteers, including a few New Mexicans, organized by [[Ceran St. Vrain]], the business partner of the brothers William and Charles Bent. Along the way, the combined forces beat back a force of some 1,500 New Mexicans and Pueblo at [[Battle of Ca\u00f1ada|Santa Cruz de la Ca\u00f1ada]] and at [[Battle of Embudo Pass|Embudo Pass]]. The insurgents retreated to [[Taos Pueblo]], where they took refuge in the thick-walled adobe church.\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Pueblo de Taos|ensuing battle]], the U.S. breached a wall of the church and directed cannon fire into the interior, inflicting many casualties and killing about 150 rebels.

Taylor agreed to allow the Mexican Army to evacuate and to an eight-week armistice in return for the surrender of the city. Under pressure from Washington, Taylor broke the armistice and occupied the city of Saltillo, southwest of Monterrey. Santa Anna blamed the loss of Monterrey and Saltillo on Ampudia and demoted him to command a small artillery battalion.\n\nOn February 22, 1847, Santa Anna personally marched north to fight Taylor with 20,000 men. Taylor, with 4,600 men, had entrenched at a mountain pass called Buena Vista \"good view.\" Santa Anna suffered desertions on the way north and arrived with 15,000 men in a tired state. He demanded and was refused surrender of the U.S. Army; he attacked the next morning. Santa Anna flanked the U.S. positions by sending his cavalry and some of his infantry up the steep terrain that made up one side of the pass, while a division of infantry attacked frontally along the road leading to Buena Vista. Furious fighting ensued, during which the U.S. troops were nearly routed, but managed to cling to their entrenched position, thanks to the Mississippi Rifles, a volunteer regiment led by [[Jefferson Davis]], who formed them into a defensive V formation.<ref>Shelby Foote, ''The Civil War: A Narrative'': Volume 1: Fort Sumter to Perryville (1958).</ref> The Mexicans had inflicted considerable losses, and initial reports of the battle gave the victory to Santa Anna,much to the joy of Mexicans in towns and cities. But Santa Anna retreated, having gotten word of upheaval in Mexico City, and he returned to the capital with losing men on the way.

[[William Gilpin (governor)|Major William Gilpin]] advocated a march on Mexico City and convinced a majority of officers, but Doniphan subverted this plan. Then in late April, Taylor ordered the First Missouri Mounted Volunteers to leave Chihuahua and join him at [[Saltillo]]. The American merchants either followed or returned to Santa Fe.

Yucat\u00e1n in particular had closer ties to Cuba and to the United States than it did to central Mexico. On a number of occasions in the early era of the Mexican Republic, Yucat\u00e1n seceded from the federation. There were also rivalries between regional elites, with one faction based in M\u00e9rida and the other in Campeche. These issues factored into the Mexican\u2013American War.<ref>Gilbert M.

Even before hostilities began in the disputed northern region, the U.S. Navy created a blockade. Given the shallow waters of that portion of the Gulf coast, the U.S. Navy needed ships with a shallow draft rather than large frigates. Since the Mexican Navy was almost non-existent, the U.S. Navy could operate unimpeded in Gulf waters.<ref>K. Jack Bauer, ''The Mexican war, 1846\u20131848''. 1974.

In 1847 Maya revolted against the white elites of the peninsula in a racial war known as the [[Caste War of Yucatan]]. [[Jefferson Davis]], then a senator from Mississippi, argued in congress that the president needed no further powers to intervene in Yucatan since the war with Mexico was underway. Davis's concern was strategic and part of his vision of Manifest Destiny, considering the Gulf of Mexico \"a basin of water belonging to the United States\" and continuing \"the cape of Yucatan and the island of Cuba must be ours\" rather than under British influence.<ref>quoted in Brian Loveman, ''No Higher Law: American Foreign Policy and the Western Hemisphere Since 1776''.

On March 9, 1847, Scott performed the first major amphibious landing in U.S. history in preparation for the [[Siege of Veracruz]]. A group of 12,000 volunteer and regular soldiers successfully offloaded supplies, weapons, and horses near the walled city using specially designed landing crafts. Included in the invading force were [[Robert E. Lee]], [[George Meade]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[James Longstreet]], and [[Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]].\n\nThe city was defended by Mexican General Juan Morales with 3,400 men. [[Mortar (weapon)|Mortars]] and naval guns under Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] were used to reduce the city walls and harass defenders. After a bombardment on March 24, 1847, the walls of Veracruz had a thirty-foot gap.<ref>Morgan, Robert, ''Lions of the West'', Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2011, p. 282.</ref>\nThe city replied the best it could with its own artillery. The effect of the extended barrage destroyed the will of the Mexican side to fight against a numerically superior force, and they surrendered the city after 12 days under siege. U.S. troops suffered 80 casualties, while the Mexican side had around 180 killed and wounded, while hundreds of civilians were killed.<ref>{{cite web|website=Gobierno de Mexico, Servicio de Informacion Agroalimentaria y Pesqueria|url=https://www.gob.mx/siap/articulos/un-dia-como-hoy-pero-de-1847-fuerzas-invasoras-norteamericanas-toman-el-puerto-de-veracruz?idiom=es|title=Un d\u00eda como hoy, pero de 1847, fuerzas invasoras norteamericanas toman el puerto de Veracruz|accessdate=July 18, 2019|language=Spanish|trans-title=A day like today, but in 1847, Invading Northamerican forces take the Port of Veracruz}}</ref> During the siege, the U.S. side began to fall victim to [[yellow fever]].\n\n===Advance on Puebla===\n{{main|Battle of Cerro Gordo}}\n[[File:Batalla_de_Cerro_Gordo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Battle of Cerro Gordo, lithograph courtesy of the Yale Collection of Western Americana, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.]]\n[[File:Scott's campaign-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Scott's campaign]]\n\nSanta Anna allowed Scott's army to march inland, counting on yellow fever and other tropical diseases to take their toll before Santa Anna chose to place to engage the enemy. Mexico had used this tactic before, including when Spain attempted to reconquer Mexico in 1829.  Disease could be a decisive factor in the war.  Santa Anna was from Veracruz State, so he was on his home territory, knew the terrain, and had a network of allies. He could draw on local resources to feed his ill-fed army and gain intelligence on the enemy's movement. From his experience in the northern battles on open terrain, Santa Anna sought to negate the U.S. Army's advantage of the use of artillery.  Santa Anna chose Cerro Gordo to engage, calculating it would have maximum advantage for the Mexican forces.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 193-94</ref> Scott then marched westward on April 2, 1847, toward Mexico City with 8,500 initially healthy troops, while Santa Anna set up a defensive position in a canyon around the main road about {{convert|50|mi|km}} north-west of Veracruz, near the hamlet of Cerro Gordo. Santa Anna had entrenched with what the U.S. Army believed were 12,000 troops, but in fact only around 9,000,<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 200</ref> and artillery that were trained on the road, where he expected Scott to appear. However, Scott had sent 2,600 mounted [[dragoons]] ahead and they reached the pass on April 12. The Mexican artillery prematurely fired on them and therefore revealed their positions, beginning the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]].\n\nInstead of taking the main road, Scott's troops trekked through the rough terrain to the north, setting up his artillery on the high ground and quietly flanking the Mexicans. Although by then aware of the positions of U.S. troops, Santa Anna and his troops were unprepared for the onslaught that followed. In the battle fought on April 18, the Mexican army was routed. The U.S. Army suffered 400 casualties, while the Mexicans suffered over 1,000 casualties and 3,000 were taken prisoner. In August 1847, Captain [[Kirby Smith]], of Scott's 3rd Infantry, reflected on the resistance of the Mexican army:\n\n{{quote| They can do nothing and their continued defeats should convince them of it.

Santa Anna was determined to fight to the end and Mexican soldiers continued to regroup after battles to fight yet again.\n\n===Pause at Puebla===\n[[File:Nebel Mexican War 08 Molino del Rey Molino.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Molino del Rey]]]]\nIn May 1847, Scott pushed on to Puebla, the second largest city in Mexico. The city capitulated without resistance on May 1. The Mexican defeat at Cerro Gordo had demoralized Puebla's inhabitants, and they worried about the mayhem of U.S. Army looting, rape, and murder in the decision not to resist the U.S. Army. It was standard practice in Western warfare for victorious soldiers to be let loose to inflict horrors on civilian populations if they resisted; the threat of this was often used as a bargaining tool to secure surrender without a fight. Scott had aimed to prevent his troops from atrocities. Puebla's ruling elite also sought to prevent violence, as did the Catholic Church, but Puebla's poor and working class wanted to defend the city. U.S. Army troops who strayed outside at night were often murdered. Enough Mexicans were willing to sell supplies to the U.S. Army as to make local provisioning possible.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 201-202</ref>  During the following months, Scott gathered supplies and reinforcements at Puebla and sent back units whose enlistments had expired. Scott also made strong efforts to keep his troops disciplined and treat the Mexican people under occupation justly, so as to prevent a popular rising against his army.\n\n===Advance on Mexico City and its capture===\n[[File:Battle of Chapultepec.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Chapultepec]]]]\n{{Main|Battle for Mexico City}}\nWith guerrillas harassing his line of communications back to Veracruz, Scott decided not to weaken his army to defend Puebla but, leaving only a garrison at Puebla to protect the sick and injured recovering there, advanced on Mexico City on August 7 with his remaining force. The capital was laid open in a series of battles around the right flank of the city defenses, the [[Battle of Contreras]] and [[Battle of Churubusco]]. After Churubusco, fighting halted for an armistice and peace negotiations, which broke down on September 6, 1847.  With the subsequent battles of [[Battle of Molino del Rey|Molino del Rey]] and of [[Battle of Chapultepec|Chapultepec]], and the [[Battle for Mexico City#Attacks on the Bel\u00e9n and San Cosme Gates|storming of the city gates]], the capital was occupied. Scott became military governor of occupied [[Mexico City]]. His victories in this campaign made him an American national hero.\n\n===Battle of Chapultepec===\n[[File:Chapultepec1.jpg|thumb|Storming of Chapultepec]]\n{{main|Battle of Chapultepec}}\nThe Battle of Chapultepec In September 1847 was an encounter between the Mexican Army and the United States on the [[Chapultepec Castle|castle of Chapultepec]], built on a hill in Mexico City in the colonial era. At this time, this castle was a renowned military school in the capital. After the battle, which ended in a victory for the U.S., the legend of \"Los Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes\" was born. Although not confirmed by historians, six military cadets between the ages of 13 and 17 stayed in the school instead of evacuating.<ref name=\"Webtopia\">[http://www.chapultepec.com.mx/articulo.asp?articulo=66 ''Dise\u00f1o Web y Desarrollo de Aplicaciones por Webtopia''], Retrieved May 8, 2014.</ref> They decided to stay and fight for Mexico. These ''[[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]]'' (boy heroes) became icons in Mexico's patriotic pantheon. Rather than surrender to the U.S. Army, some military cadets leaped from the castle walls.

General [[Joaqu\u00edn Rea]] began the [[Siege of Puebla (1847)|Siege of Puebla]], soon joined by Santa Anna. Scott had left some 2,400 soldiers in Puebla, of whom around 400 were completely fit. After the fall of Mexico City, Santa Anna hoped to rally Puebla's civilian population against the U.S. soldiers there who were under siege and subject to guerrilla attacks.  Before the Mexican army could wipe out the Americans in Puebla, more troops landed in Veracruz under the command of Brig. General [[Joseph Lane]]. At Puebla, they sacked the town.  Santa Anna was not able to provision his troops, who effectively dissolved as a fighting force to forage for food.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 290-91</ref> Puebla was relieved by Gen. Lane October 12, 1847, following his defeat of Santa Anna at the [[Battle of Huamantla]] on October 9, 1847.  The battle was Santa Anna's last.  Following the defeat, the new Mexican government led by [[Manuel de la Pe\u00f1a y Pe\u00f1a]] asked Santa Anna to turn over command of the army to General [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Guerrilla campaign, counter-insurgency, and atrocities===\nFollowing the capture and securing of the capital, the Mexican government moved to the temporary capital at [[Quer\u00e9taro]]. Conventional warfare gave way to [[guerrilla]] warfare by Mexicans defending their homeland.  They inflicted significant casualties on the U.S. Army, particularly on soldiers slow to keep up General Scott sent about a quarter of his strength to secure his line of communications to Veracruz from the Light Corps of General [[Joaqu\u00edn Rea]] and other Mexican guerrilla forces that had made stealth attacks since May. Mexican guerrillas often tortured and mutilated bodies of the American troops, as revenge and warning. Americans' interpreted these acts not as Mexicans' defense of their patria, but as evidence of Mexicans' brutality as racial inferiors. For their part, U.S. soldiers took revenge on Mexicans (\"greasers\") for the attacks, whether or not they were individually suspected of guerrilla acts. Scott had planned to make total war on the Mexican population, but since he was losing soldiers to guerrilla attacks, he had to make some decisions. He viewed guerrilla attacks as contrary to the \"laws of war\" and threatened the property of populations that appeared to harbor the guerrillas. Captured guerrillas were to be shot, including helpless prisoners, with the reasoning that the Mexicans did the same. Historian Peter Guardino contends that the U.S. Army command was complicit in the attacks against Mexican civilians.  By threatening the civilian populations' homes, property, and families with burning whole villages, looting, and raping women, the U.S. Army separated guerrillas from their base. \"Guerrills cost the Americans dearly, but indirectly cost Mexican civilians more.\"<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 294-98.</ref>\n\nScott strengthened the garrison of Puebla and by November had added a 1200-man garrison at [[Xalapa|Jalapa]], established 750-man posts along the National Road the main route between the port of Veracruz and the capital, at the pass between Mexico City and Puebla at [[R\u00edo Fr\u00edo de Ju\u00e1rez|Rio Frio]], at [[Perote, Veracruz|Perote]] and [[Las Vigas de Ram\u00edrez, Veracruz|San Juan]] on the road between Jalapa and Puebla, and at [[Puente Nacional, Veracruz|Puente Nacional]] between Jalapa and Veracruz.<ref>Executive Document, No. 60, House of Representatives, first Session of the thirtieth Congress, pp. 1028, 1032.</ref> He had also detailed an anti guerrilla brigade under Brig. Gen. Joseph Lane to carry the war to the Light Corps and other guerrillas.  He ordered that convoys would travel with at least 1,300-man escorts. Victories by General Lane over the Light Corps at [[Atlixco]] (October 18, 1847), at [[Izucar de Matamoros]] (November 23, 1847), and at [[Affair at Galaxara Pass|Galaxara Pass]] (November 24, 1847) ended the threat of General Rea.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nLater a raid against the guerrillas of [[Celedonio D\u00f3meco de Jarauta|Padre Jarauta]] at [[Zacualtipan]] (25 February 1848) further reduced guerrilla raids on the American line of communications. After the two governments concluded a truce to await ratification of the peace treaty, on 6 March 1848, formal hostilities ceased.

In the Mexican Army, desertions depleted forces on the eve of battle. Most soldiers were peasants who had a loyalty to their village and family, but not to the generals who had conscripted them. Often hungry and ill, underequipped, only partially trained, and never well paid, the soldiers were held in contempt by their officers and had little reason to fight the Americans. Looking for their opportunity, many slipped away from camp to find their way back to their home village.<ref>{{cite book | first=Douglas |last=Meed | title=The Mexican War, 1846\u20131848 | publisher = Routledge | year=2003 | page=67}}</ref>\n\nThe desertion rate in the U.S. Army was 8.3% (9,200 out of 111,000), compared to 12.7% during the War of 1812 and usual peacetime rates of about 14.8% per year.<ref>{{cite web|last=McAllister |first=Brian |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0195045556?v=search-inside&keywords=desertion |title=see Coffman, ''Old Army'' (1988), p. 193 |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref> Many men deserted to join another U.S. unit and get a second enlistment bonus.

Nearly all were recent immigrants from Europe with weak ties to the U.S. The Mexicans issued broadsides and leaflets enticing U.S. soldiers with promises of money, land bounties, and officers' commissions. Mexican guerrillas shadowed the U.S. Army and captured men who took unauthorized leave or fell out of the ranks. The guerrillas coerced these men to join the Mexican ranks. The generous promises proved illusory for most deserters, who risked being executed if captured by U.S. forces.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n====San Patricios====\n{{Main|Saint Patrick's Battalion}}\n[[File:Sanpatricioshang.jpg|thumb|The mass hanging of Irish Catholic soldiers who joined the Mexican side, forming the [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]]]]\n\nThe most famous group of deserters from the U.

Mexico faced many continuing internal divisions between Mexican factions, so that bringing the war to a formal end was not straightforward. There were also divisions complications in the U.S. for negotiating the peace. Peace came in Alta California in January 1847 with the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]], with the [[Californios]] (Mexican residents of Alta California) capitulating to the American forces.<ref>Loveman, ''No Higher Law'', p. 87</ref> A more comprehensive peace treaty was needed to end the conflict. The U.S. forces had gone from being an army of conquest on the periphery for territory it desired to incorporate, to an invading force in central Mexico, potentially making it an army of long-term occupation. Mexico did not necessarily have to sign a peace treaty, but could have continued with long-term guerrilla warfare against the U.S. Army. However, it could not expel the invaders, so negotiating a treaty became more possible.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 305</ref> Polk's wish for a short war of conquest against a perceived weak enemy with no will to fight had turned into a long and bloody conflict in Mexico's heartland. Negotiating a treaty was in the U.S.'s best interest. It was not easy to achieve. Polk lost confidence in his negotiator [[Nicholas Trist]] and dismissed him as peace negotiations dragged on. Trist ignored t. he fact that he no longer had authorization to act for the United States.  When Trist managed to get yet another Mexican government to sign the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], Polk was presented with an accomplished fact and decided to present it to Congress for ratification.  Ratification was fraught, since the Democrats had lost the elections of 1846 and Whigs opposed to the war were now in ascendance.\n\n===All-Mexico Movement===\n{{Main|All of Mexico Movement}}\nHaving won a decisive victory, the U.S. was  divided on what the peace should entail. Polk had wanted acquisition of Mexican territory either by purchase or a short war that gained Mexico's northern territories. But Mexican resistance to sale of its territory and its continued military resistance even in face repeated defeats meant a short, bloodless solution was impossible.  Now that the U.S. had gone far beyond the territorial gains it initially envisioned by invading central Mexico with its dense population, the question was raised whether to annex Mexico itself. The [[All of Mexico Movement|All-Mexico Movement]] sought just that. After the [[Wilmot Proviso]], there was a lessening of fervor for the idea, but the taking of Mexico City had revived enthusiasm.<ref>Schoultz, Lars. ''Beneath the United States: A History of U.S. Policy Toward Latin America''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1998, p. 34</ref>  There were fierce objections in Congress to that on racial grounds.  South Carolina Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] argued that absorbing Mexico would threatened U.S. institutions and the character of the country. \"We have never dreamt of incorporating into our Union any but the Caucasian race\u2014the free white race. To incorporate Mexico, would be the very first instance of the kind, of incorporating an Indian race; for than half of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes. I protest against such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race.... We are anxious to force free government on all; and I see that it has been urged ... that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake.\"  Beyond the racial argument, Calhoun contended that the U.S. could not be both an empire and a republic, and argued that being an empire would strengthen the central government and detrimental to individual states.<ref>Merry, ''A Country of Vast Designs'', pp. 414-15</ref>\nRhode Island's Whig Senator [[John Hopkins Clarke|John Clarke]] also objected to annexing all of Mexico. \"To incorporate such a disjointed and degraded mass into even a limited participation with our social and political rights, would be fatally destructive to the institutions. of our country. There is a moral pestilence to such a people which is contagious -- a leprosy that will destroy [us].\"<ref>quoted in Schoultz, ''Beneath the United States'', p. 14</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo===\n{{Main|Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo}}\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, by diplomat [[Nicholas Trist]] and Mexican [[plenipotentiary]] representatives Luis G.

By early 1847, he helped take the Mexican cities of Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec. Lee was wounded in Chapultepec. General Scott was the ranking officer in the United States Army during the Mexican\u2013American campaign. He described Robert E.

It is also a  milestone in the U.S. narrative of Manifest Destiny.

The [[Marine Corps Hymn]], that includes the phrase \"From the Halls of Montezuma\" is an acknowledgement of the war, but there are no major monuments or memorials. Mexico City is the site of a [[Mexico City National Cemetery|cemetery]] created in 1851, still maintained by the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]]. It holds the remains of 1,563 U.S. soldiers who mainly died in the conflict were placed in a mass grave. Many more U.S. soldiers died in Mexico, but to transfer bodies there from shallow graves was expensive, $2,500-3,000. A few of those interred died in Mexico City long after the war. The Mexico City military cemetery \"signaled a transition in what the United States understood to be its obligations to its war dead,\" a pressing issue with the dead of the Civil War.<ref>Connors and Mu\u00f1oz, \"Look for the North American Invasion in Mexico City,\" pp. 511-12.</ref>\n[[File:Placa conmemorativa del batall\u00f3n de San Patricio.jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative plaque to the [[San Patricios]], Mexico City, 1959]] \n[[File:Obelisco a los Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes 03.

The war caused the country to enter \"a period of self-examination ... as its leaders sought to identify and address the reasons that had led to such a debacle.\"<ref>Pedro Santoni, \"U.S.-Mexican War\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1511.</ref> In the immediate aftermath of the war, a group of prominent Mexicans compiled an assessment of the reasons for the war and Mexico's defeat, edited by [[Ram\u00f3n Alcaraz]] and including contributions by [[Ignacio Ram\u00edrez]], [[Guillermo Prieto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Iglesias]], and [[Francisco Urquidi]]. They wrote that for \"the true origin of the war, it is sufficient to say that the insatiable ambition of the United States, favored by our weakness, caused it.\"<ref name=\"Alcaraz, pp. 1-2\"/> The work was translated to E.nglish by Colonel [[Albert Ramsey]], a veteran of the Mexican\u2013American War, and published in 1850.<ref>Ram\u00f3n Alcaraz, et al. ''The Other Side: or Notes for the History of the War between Mexico and the United States''. Translated by Albert C. Ramsey, Colonel of the Eleventh United States Infantry During with War with Mexico. New York: Burt Franklin 1850. Republished 1970.</ref> The war remains a painful historical event for the country.\n\nIn the capital, Mexico established the ''Museo Nacional de las Intervenciones'' (National Museum of Interventiones) in a former convent that was the site of the [[Battle of Churubusco]]. It also chronicles the attempts by the Spanish to reconquer Mexico after its independence as well as French interventions. The museum has an exhibition on the ''Intervenci\u00f3n norteamericana de 1846-1848'' that chronicles the Anglo American settlement of Texas and their rebellion after characterizing themselves as victims of Mexican oppression. It goes on to blame the war on U.S. President Polk and on the Mexican side scapegoats Santa Anna. \"The [museum's] interpretation concedes U.S. military superiority in arms and commanders, while disparaging General Santa Anna's costly mistakes and retreat from the capital city.\"<ref>Connors, Thomas G. and Ra\u00fal Isa\u00ed Mu\u00f1oz, \"Looking for the North American Invasion in Mexico City.\" American Historical Review vol. 125, no. 2, April 2020, p. 502.</ref>\n\nThe memory of military cadets fighting to the bitter end during the U.S. assault on Chapultepec Castle was not commemorated until 1881. A small stone monument was erected at the base of the hill on which the castle is built.  In Mexico City's [[Chapultepec Park]], the ''[[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]]'' (Monument to the Heroic Cadets) commemorates the heroic sacrifice of six adolescent military cadets who fought to their deaths rather than surrender to American troops during the [[Battle of Chapultepec]] Castle on September 13, 1847. The monument is now an important patriotic site in Mexico. On March 5, 1947, nearly one hundred years after the battle, U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] placed a wreath at the monument and stood for a [[moment of silence]], although some cadets removed the wreath and tossed it in front of the American Embassy.<ref name=\"van\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[American propaganda in the Mexican\u2013American War]]\n* [[List of battles of the Mexican\u2013American War]]\n* [[Border War (1910\u201319)|Mexican\u2013American Border War]]\n* [[Reconquista (Mexico)]]\n* [[Republic of Texas\u2013United States relations]]\n* [[Territories of Mexico]]\n* [[Christopher Werner#Works|Christopher Werner, maker of the \"Iron Palmetto\"]] commemorating the loss of South Carolinians in the War\n\n===General===\n* [[History of Mexico]]\n* [[History of New Mexico]]\n* [[History of the United States]]\n* [[List of conflicts in the United States]]\n* [[List of wars involving Mexico]]\n* [[List of wars involving the United States]]\n* [[Mexico\u2013United States relations]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Corwin-Speech_%27On_the_Mexican_War%27-1847-Congressional_Globe-ed._WRE-Apr11(2015).pdf\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Reference works===\n* {{cite book|last1=Crawford|first1=Mark|last2=Heidler|first2=Jeanne|last3=Heidler (eds.)|first3=David Stephen|title =Encyclopedia of the Mexican War|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57607-059-8}}\n* Frazier, Donald S. ed.

It followed in the wake of the 1845 U.S. [[Texas Annexation|annexation]] of [[Republic of Texas|Texas]], which Mexico still considered Mexican territory since the government did not recognize the [[Treaties of Velasco|treaty]] signed by Mexican General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] when he was a prisoner of the [[Texian Army]] during the 1836 [[Texas Revolution]]. The [[Republic of Texas]] was defacto an independent country, but most of its citizens wished to be annexed by the United States. Domestic sectional politics in the U.S. prevented that since Texas would have been a slave state, upsetting the balance of power between northern free states and southern slave states. In the [[1844 United States presidential election]], Democrat [[James K. Polk]] was elected on a platform of expanding U.S. territory in Oregon and Texas. Polk advocated expansion by either peaceful means or by armed force, with the 1845 annexation of Texas as furthering that goal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberg |first1=Amy |title=A Wicked War: Polk, Clay, Lincoln, and the 1846 U.S. Invasion of Mexico |date=2012 |publisher=Vintage |isbn=978-0-307-47599-2 |page=33}}</ref> For Mexico, this was itself a provocation, but Polk went further, sending U.S. Army troops to the area; he sent also a diplomatic mission to Mexico to try to negotiate sale of territory. U.S. troops' presence was provocative and designed to lure Mexico into starting the conflict, putting the onus on Mexico and allowing Polk to argue to Congress that a declaration of war should be issued.<ref>Guardino, Peter. ''The Dead March: A History of the Mexican-American War''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2017, p. 71</ref> Mexican forces [[Thornton Affair|attacked U.S. forces]], and the [[United States Congress]] declared war.\n\nBeyond the disputed area of Texas, U.S. forces quickly occupied the regional capital of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] along the upper [[Rio Grande]], which had trade relations with the U.S. via the [[Santa Fe Trail]] between Missouri and New Mexico. U.S. forces also moved against the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific coast]] province of [[Alta California]], and then moved south. The [[Pacific Squadron]] of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] blockaded the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast farther south in the lower [[Baja California Territory]]. The Mexican government refused to be pressured into signing a peace treaty at this point, making the U.S. invasion of the Mexican heartland under Major General [[Winfield Scott]] and its capture of the capital [[Mexico City]] a strategy to force peace negotiations. Although Mexico was defeated militarily on the battlefield, politically its government's negotiating a treaty remained a fraught issue, with some factions refusing to consider any recognition of its loss of territory. Although Polk formally relieved his peace envoy, [[Nicholas Trist]], of his post as negotiator, Trist ignored the order and successfully concluded the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. It ended the war and Mexico recognized the [[Mexican Cession]], areas not part of disputed Texas but conquered by the U.S. Army. These were northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States. The U.S. agreed to pay $15 million in compensation for the physical damage of the war and assumed $3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico acknowledged the loss of what became the [[Texas|State of Texas]] and accepted the [[Rio Grande]] as its northern border with the United States.\n\nThe victory and [[Territorial expansion of the United States|territorial expansion]] Polk envisioned{{sfn|Rives|1913|p=658}} inspired patriotism among some sections of the United States, but the war and treaty drew fierce criticism for their casualties, monetary cost, and heavy-handedness,<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> particularly early on. The question of how to treat the new acquisitions also intensified the debate over [[slavery in the United States]]. Although the [[Wilmot Proviso]] that explicitly forbade the extension of slavery into conquered Mexican territory was not adopted by Congress, debates around it did heighten sectional tensions in the wake of the war. Most scholars see the Mexican-American War as leading to the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865) with many officers trained at [[U.S. Military Academy|West Point]] playing prominent leadership roles on both sides. In Mexico, the war worsened domestic political turmoil. Since the war was fought on home ground, it suffered large loss of life of not only its soldiers, but also its civilian population. The nation's financial foundations were undermined, territory was lost, and national prestige left it in what prominent Mexicans called a \"state of degradation and ruin... [As for] the true origin of the war, it is sufficient to say that the insatiable ambition of the United States, favored by our weakness, caused it.\"<ref name=\"Alcaraz, pp. 1-2\">Alcaraz, et al.

The conflict ruined the silver mining districts of Zacatecas and Guanajuato, so that Mexico began as a sovereign nation with its future financial stability from its main export destroyed. Mexico briefly [[First Mexican Empire|experimented with monarchy]], but became [[First Mexican Republic|a republic]] in 1824. This government was characterized by instability,<ref name=\"Alcaraz1850\">{{cite book|author=Ram\u00f3n Alcaraz|translator=Albert C.

Mexico had successfully resisted [[Spanish attempts to reconquer Mexico|Spanish attempts to reconquer]] former in the 1820s and resisted the French in the so-called [[Pastry War]] of 1838, but the secessionists' success in Texas and the Yucatan against the Centralist government of Mexico showed the weakness of the Mexican government, which changed hands multiple times. The Mexican military and the [[Catholic Church in Mexico]], both privileged institutions with conservative political views, were stronger politically than the Mexican state. \n\nNeither colonial Mexico, nor the newly sovereign Mexican state effectively controlled Mexico's far north and west. In the decades preceding the war, [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous groups]] raided in Mexico's sparsely settled north, which prompted the Mexican government to sponsor migration from the United States to the [[Mexican Texas|Mexican province of Texas]] to create a buffer. However, the newly named \"Texans\" revolted against the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico]] led by [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]. The conservative Centralists usurped the Mexican Federalist [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], creating a unitary central state and abolishing the independence of Mexican states under the federalist constitution.  In 1836 [[Texas Revolution|Texas rebelled]], defeating the Mexican army and created a republic. Although General Santa Anna had signed a treaty with the Texans acknowledging their independence, the agreement was not recognized by the Mexican government, which still claimed it as part of its national territory.  In 1845, the Texan Republic agreed to an offer of annexation by the [[U.S. Congress]] and became the 28th state in the Union on December 29 that year.<ref name=\"Republic of Texas\">See {{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mzr02|title=Republic of Texas|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429075659/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mzr02|archivedate=April 29, 2009|url-status=bot: unknown|accessdate=2014-07-05|date=2010-06-15}}</ref>  Having fought and bled over this sparsely populated northern territory, Mexico could not just relinquish it to rebel republic or to the United States by sale.\n\n===U.S. expansionism===\n{{Main|Manifest destiny}}\nSince the early nineteenth century, the U.S. sought to expand its territory, which evolved into the idea of [[Manifest Destiny]].  Jefferson's [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803 gave Spain and the U.S. an undefined border. The young and weak U.S. fought the [[War of 1812]] with Great Britain, seeking unsuccessfully to take portions of Britain's territory of Canada. Britain burned the White House as it captured Washington, D.C.  Some boundary issues were solved between the U.S. and Spain with the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] of 1818. The U.S. negotiator, [[John Quincy Adams]] wanted clear possession of east of Florida and establishing U.S. claims above the 42nd parallel, which for Spain sought to limit U.S. expansion into what is now the American Southwest. The U.S. then sought to purchase territory from Mexico, starting in 1825.  Under U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]], there was a sustained effort to acquire northern Mexican territory, with no success.<ref>Schoultz, ''Beneath the United States'', pp. 19-20</ref>\n\nHistorian Peter Guardino argues that in the war \"the greatest advantage the United States had was its prosperity.\"<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 6</ref> Economic prosperity likely also contributed to political stability in the U.S. In contrast to Mexico's financial precariousness, the U.S. was a prosperous country with major resource endowments that Mexico lacked. Its war of independence had taken place generations earlier and was a relatively short conflict that ended with French intervention on the side of the 13 colonies. After independence the U.S. grew rapidly and expanded westward, marginalizing and displacing Native Americans as white settlers cleared land and established farms. With the [[industrial revolution]] in Great Britain increasing the demand for cotton for textile factories, there was a large external market of a valuable commodity produced by slave labor in the southern states. This demand helped fuel expansion into northern Mexico. Although there were political conflicts in the U.S., they were largely contained by the framework of the constitution and did not result in revolution or rebellion by 1846, but rather by sectional political conflicts. This was to change in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War in the bloody [[American Civil War]] (1861-65). But the expansionism of the U.S. was driven in part by the need to acquire new territory for economic reasons, in particular, as cotton exhausted the soil in areas of the south, new lands had to be brought under cultivation to supply the demand for it. Northerners in the U.S. sought to develop the country's existing resources and expand the industrial sector without expanding nation's territory. The existing balance of sectional interests would be disrupted by the expansion of slavery into new territory. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] strong beliefs in favor of expansion, so it is not by chance that the U.S. went to war with Mexico under a Democratic president, [[James K. Polk]].<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 18-22</ref>\n\n===Situation in Northern Mexico===\n{{see also|Comanche-Mexico Wars|Apache-Mexico Wars}}\n[[File:Mexico 1832, Region Comanche.PNG|thumb|alt=An Osage The boundaries of Comancheria \u2013 the Comanche homeland.|The 1832 boundaries of [[Comancheria]], the Comanche homeland]]\n[[File:Comanches.jpg|thumb|upright|Comanches of West [[Texas]] in war regalia, c. 1830.]]\nMexico's military and diplomatic capabilities declined after it attained independence from Spain in 1821 and left the northern one-half of the country vulnerable to attacks by [[Comanche]], [[Apache]], and [[Navajo]] native Americans.<ref name=\"Smith1963\">{{cite journal |author1=Ralph A.

It was mainly desert with little rainfall so that sedentary agriculture never developed there during the prehispanic or colonial periods. During the colonial era (1521-1821) had not been well controlled politically. After [[Mexican independence|independence]], Mexico contended with internal struggles that sometimes verged on civil war and the situation on northern frontier was not a high priority for the government in central Mexico. In northern Mexico, the end of Spanish rule was marked by the end of financing for [[presidio]]s and for gifts to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to maintain the peace. The Comanche and Apache were successful in raiding for livestock and looting much of northern Mexico outside the scattered cities.  Northern Mexico became again a violent and chaotic area due to the Indian raids. The raids after 1821 resulted in the death of many Mexicans, halted most transportation and communications, and decimated the ranching industry that was a mainstay of the northern economy. As a result, the demoralized civilian population of northern Mexico put up little resistance to the invading U.S. army.<ref name=\"DeLay2008\">{{cite book|author=Brian DeLay|title=War of a Thousand Deserts: Indian Raids and the U.

After independence, the Mexican government implemented the policy, granting [[Moses Austin]], a banker from Missouri, a large tract of land in Texas. Austin died before he could bring his plan of recruiting American settlers for the land to fruition, but his son, [[Stephen F. Austin]], brought over 300 American families into Texas.<ref>Jes\u00fas F. de la Teja, \"Texas Secession\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, 1403\u201304.</ref> This started the steady trend of migration from the United States into the Texas frontier. Austin's colony was the most successful of several colonies authorized by the Mexican government. The Mexican government intended the new settlers to act as a buffer between the [[Tejano]] residents and the [[Comanche]]s, but the non-Hispanic colonists tended to settle where there were decent farmland and trade connections with American Louisiana, which the United States had acquired in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], rather than farther west where they would have been an effective buffer against the Indians.\n\nIn 1829, as a result of the large influx of American immigrants, the non-Hispanic outnumbered native Spanish speakers in Texas. President [[Vicente Guerrero]], a hero of Mexican independence, moved to gain more control over Texas and its influx of non-Hispanic colonists from the southern U.S. and discourage further immigration by abolishing slavery in Mexico.<ref name=\"Santoni 1511\"/><ref>Douglas W.

The settlers and many Mexican businessmen in the region rejected the demands, which led to Mexico closing Texas to additional immigration, which continued from the United States into Texas illegally.\n\nIn 1834, Mexican conservatives seized the political initiative and General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] became the centralist president of Mexico.  The conservative-dominated congress abandoned the [[Federalist Constitution of 1824|federal system]], replacing it with a unitary central government that removed power from the states. Leaving politics to those in Mexico City, General Santa Anna led the Mexican army to quash the semi-independence of Texas. He had done that in Coahuila (in 1824, Mexico had merged Texas and Coahuila into the enormous state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]). Finally, Stephen F. Austin called Texians to arms, and they declared independence from Mexico in 1836. After Santa Anna defeated the Texians in the [[Battle of the Alamo]], he was defeated by the [[Texian Army]] commanded by General [[Sam Houston]] and captured at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]; he signed an [[Treaties of Velasco|agreement]] with [[David G. Burnet|David Burnet]] to allow Texas to plead its case for independence with the Mexican government, but did not commit himself or Mexico to anything beyond that.  He negotiated under duress and as a captive, and therefore had no standing to commit Mexico a treaty. The Mexican Congress did not ratify it.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 176-77.</ref> Although Mexico did not recognize Texas independence, Texas consolidated its status as an independent republic and received official recognition from Britain, France, and the United States, which all advised Mexico not to try to reconquer the new nation. Most Texians wanted to join the United States, but annexation of Texas was contentious in the [[United States Congress|US Congress]], where [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] were largely opposed, although neither group went so far as to deny funds for the war.<ref name=\"zinn\"/>{{rp|150\u2013155}}\n\nPublic opinion in the U.S. about the war was mixed.

The ill-fated [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]] of 1841 attempted to realize the claim to New Mexican territory east of the Rio Grande, but its members were captured and imprisoned.  Reference to the Rio Grande boundary of Texas was omitted from the US Congress's annexation resolution to help secure passage after the annexation treaty failed in the Senate. President Polk claimed the Rio Grande boundary, and when Mexico sent forces over the Rio Grande, this provoked a dispute.{{sfn|Rives|1913|pp=165\u2013168}}\n\n=== Polk's gambits ===\nIn July 1845, Polk sent General [[Zachary Taylor]] to Texas, and by October Taylor commanded 3,500 Americans on the [[Nueces River]], ready to take by force the disputed land. Polk wanted to protect the border and also coveted for the U.S. the continent clear to the Pacific Ocean. At the same time Polk wrote to the American consul in the Mexican territory of Alta California, disclaiming American ambitions in California, but offering to support independence from Mexico or voluntary accession to the United States, and warning that the United States would oppose a British or French takeover.{{sfn|Rives|1913|pp=165\u2013168}}\n\nTo end another [[Fifty-Four Forty or Fight|war scare with the United Kingdom]] over the [[Oregon Country]], Polk signed the [[Oregon Treaty]] dividing the territory, angering Northern Democrats who felt he was prioritizing Southern expansion over Northern expansion.\n\nIn the winter of 1845\u20131846, the federally commissioned explorer [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and a group of armed men appeared in Alta California. After telling the Mexican governor and the American Consul Larkin he was merely buying supplies on the way to Oregon, he instead went to the populated area of California and visited [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] and the [[Salinas Valley]], explaining he had been looking for a seaside home for his mother.{{sfn|Rives|1913|pp=172\u2013173}} Mexican authorities became alarmed and ordered him to leave. Fr\u00e9mont responded by building a fort on [[Fremont Peak (California)|Gavilan Peak]] and raising the American flag. Larkin sent word that Fr\u00e9mont's actions were counterproductive.

US expansionists wanted California to thwart British ambitions in the area and to gain a port on the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Before the war with the United States, the military faced both internal and foreign challenges.

The permanent forces consisted of 12 regiments of infantry (of two battalions each), three brigades of artillery, eight regiments of cavalry, one separate squadron and a brigade of dragoons. The militia amounted to nine infantry and six cavalry regiments.

The Mexican army was using surplus British [[musket]]s (e.g. [[Brown Bess]]) from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] period. While at the beginning of the war the majority of American soldiers were still equipped with the very similar Springfield 1816 flintlock muskets, more reliable [[Caplock mechanism|caplock]] models gained large inroads within the rank and file as the conflict progressed. Some US troops carried radically modern weapons that gave them a significant advantage over their Mexican counterparts, such as the Springfield 1841 rifle of the Mississippi Rifles and the Colt Paterson revolver of the Texas Rangers. In the later stages of the war, the US Mounted Rifles were issued [[Colt Walker]] [[revolvers]], of which the US Army had ordered 1,000 in 1846. Most significantly, throughout the war, the superiority of the US artillery often carried the day. While technologically Mexican and American artillery operated on the same plane, US army training, as well as the quality and reliability of their logistics, gave US guns and cannoneers a significant edge.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nDesertion was a major problem for the Mexican army, depleting forces on the eve of battle. Most soldiers were peasants who held loyalty to their village and family, but not to the generals who had conscripted them. Often hungry and ill, under-equipped, only partially trained, and never well paid, the soldiers were held in contempt by their officers and had little reason to fight the invading US forces. Looking for their opportunity, many slipped away from camp to find their way back to their home village.<ref>{{cite book | first=Douglas |last=Meed | title=The Mexican War, 1846\u20131848 | publisher = Routledge | year=2003 | page=67}}</ref>  However, the Mexican Army repeatedly regrouped despite its many defeats and continued the fight against the invaders right to Mexico City.  \n \nIn his 1885 memoirs, former US President [[Ulysses Grant]] (himself a veteran of the Mexican war) attributed Mexico's defeat to the poor quality of their army, writing:\n\n{{blockquote| \"The Mexican army of that day was hardly an organization.

With all this I have seen as brave stands made by some of these men as I have ever seen made by soldiers.  Now Mexico has a standing army larger than the United States.

Just before the outbreak of the war, Liberal General [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] was President (December 1844-December 1845), and willing to engage in talks so long as he did not appear to be caving to the U.S., but he was accused by many Mexican factions of selling out his country (''vendepatria'') for considering it.<ref>Bauer, ''The Mexican War'', p. 16-17</ref> He was overthrown by Conservative [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|Mariano Paredes]] (December 1845-July 1846), who left the presidency to fight the invading U.S. Army, and was replaced by his vice president [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]] (28 July 1846-4 August 1846). The conservative Bravo was overthrown by federalists liberals who re-established the federal [[Constitution of 1824]]. [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Salas]] (6 August 1846-23 December 1846) served as president, and held elections under the restored federalist system.  General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna won those elections, but as was his practice, left administration to his vice president, who was again liberal [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]] (23 December 1846-21 March 1847). In February 1847, conservatives rebelled against the liberal government's attempt to take Church property to fund the war effort. The [[Revolt of the Polkos]] saw the Catholic Church and conservatives paid soldiers to rise against the liberal government.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara. \"Mexico\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 4, p. 10. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref>  Santa Anna had to leave his campaign to return to the capital to sort out the political mess.  Santa Anna briefly held the presidency again, from 21 March 1847-2 April 1847. His troops were deprived of support that would allow them to continue the fight. The conservatives demanded the removal of G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, and this was accomplished by abolishing the office of vice president.  Santa Anna returned to the field, replaced in the presidency by [[Pedro Mar\u00eda de Anaya]] (2 April 1847-20 May 1847). Santa Anna returned to the presidency on 20 May 1847 when Anaya left to fight the invasion, serving until 15 September 1847. Always preferring the battle field to administration, Santa Anna left office again, leaving the office to [[Manuel de la Pe\u00f1a y Pe\u00f1a]] (16 September 1847-13 November 1847). With U.S. forces occupying the Mexican capital and much of the heartland, negotiating a peace treaty was an exigent matter, and Pe\u00f1a y Pe\u00f1a left office to do that. Pedro Mar\u00eda Anaya returned to the presidency 13 November 1847-8 January 1848. Anaya refused to sign any treaty that ceded land to the U.S., despite the situation on the ground with Americans occupying the capital,  Pe\u00f1a y Pe\u00f1a resumed the presidency 8 January 1848-3 June 1848, during which time the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] was signed, bringing the war to an end.\n\n=== Challenges in the United States ===\n[[File:US_Uniform_1840.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|U.S. Army full dress and campaign uniforms, 1835-1851.]]\n====United States Army====\n{{Main|List of U.S. Army, Navy, and volunteer units in the Mexican\u2013American War}}\nThe new U.President, James K.

These regiments were supplemented by 10 new regiments (nine of infantry and one of cavalry) raised for one year of service by the act of Congress from February 11, 1847.<ref>Robarts, \"Mexican War veterans\", pp. 1\u201324.</ref>\n\nAlthough Polk hoped to avoid a protracted war over Texas, the extended conflict stretched regular army resources, necessitating recruitment of volunteers with short-term enlistments.

Many did not re-enlist, deciding that they would rather return home than place themselves in harm's way of disease, threat of dying or being injured on the battlefield, or in guerrilla warfare.  Their patriotism was doubted by some in the U.S., but they were not counted as deserters.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 209-10.</ref>  The volunteers were far less disciplined than the regular army, with many committing attacks on the civilian population, sometimes due simply to anti-Catholic and anti-Mexican racial bias.<ref>Foos, Paul.

There were two reasons for this. Both General Scott and General Taylor had such armies as are not often got together. At the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca-de-la-Palma, General Taylor had a small army, but it was composed exclusively of regular troops, under the best of drill and discipline. Every officer, from the highest to the lowest, was educated in his profession, not at West Point necessarily, but in the camp, in garrison, and many of them in Indian wars. The rank and file were probably inferior, as material out of which to make an army, to the volunteers that participated in all the later battles of the war; but they were brave men, and then drill and discipline brought out all there was in them. A better army, man for man, probably never faced an enemy than the one commanded by General Taylor in the earliest two engagements of the Mexican war. The volunteers who followed were of better material, but without drill or discipline at the start. They were associated with so many disciplined men and professionally educated officers, that when they went into engagements it was with a confidence they would not have felt otherwise. They became soldiers themselves almost at once. All these conditions we would enjoy again in case of war.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4367/4367-h/4367-h.htm#ch5 | title=Personal Memoirs of U. S.

Enlarging the country, particularly through armed combat against a sovereign nation, deepened sectional divisions. Polk had narrowly won the popular vote in the 1844 Presidential election and decisively won the Electoral College, but with the annexation of Texas in 1845 and the outbreak of war in 1846, Polk's Democrats lost the House of Representatives to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which opposed the war.  Unlike Mexico, which had weak formal institutions of governance and the intervention of the military in politics on a regular basis and multiple changes of government, the U.S. generally kept its political divisions within the bounds of the institutions of governance.\n\n==Outbreak of the war==\nIn 1846, after Polk ordered General Taylor's troops into what the U.S. claimed was disputed territory, [[Thornton Affair|Mexican forces attacked a U.S. Army outpost]] (\"[[Thornton Affair]]\"), killing 12 U.S. soldiers and capturing 52. Polk cited this attack as an invasion of U.S. territory and requested that the [[United States Congress|Congress]] declare war. Later, freshman [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] Congressman from Illinois, [[Abraham Lincoln]] challenged Polk's assertion that American blood had been shed on American soil, calling it \"a bold falsification of history.\"<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 206</ref><ref>Bauer, ''The Mexican War, 1846-1848'', p. 370</ref> \n\n===Initial skirmish at the Nueces Strip===\n{{main|Nueces Strip}}\nPresident Polk ordered General Taylor and his forces south to the Rio Grande, territory that had not been considered the boundary of Texas.

Grant]], who had opposed the war but served as an army lieutenant in Taylor's Army, claims in his ''[[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|Personal Memoirs]]'' (1885) that the main goal of the U.S. Army's advance from Nueces River to Rio Grande was to provoke the outbreak of war without attacking first, to debilitate any political opposition to the war.<blockquote>The presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputed territory farthest from the Mexican settlements, was not sufficient to provoke hostilities. We were sent to provoke a fight, but it was essential that Mexico should commence it. It was very doubtful whether Congress would declare war; but if Mexico should attack our troops, the Executive could announce, \"Whereas, war exists by the acts of, etc.,\" and prosecute the contest with vigor. Once initiated there were but few public men who would have the courage to oppose it. ... Mexico showing no willingness to come to the Nueces to drive the invaders from her soil, it became necessary for the \"invaders\" to approach to within a convenient distance to be struck. Accordingly, preparations were begun for moving the army to the Rio Grande, to a point near Matamoras [sic]. It was desirable to occupy a position near the largest centre of population possible to reach, without absolutely invading territory to which we set up no claim whatever.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4367/4367-h/4367-h.htm\n| title = PERSONAL MEMOIRS U.

Painting commissioned by the U.S. Army]]\n\nA few days after the defeat of the U.S. troops by General Arista, the [[Siege of Fort Texas]] began on May 3, 1846. Mexican artillery at Matamoros opened fire on Fort Texas, which replied with its own guns. The bombardment continued for 160 hours<ref name=\"Brooks122\"/> and expanded as Mexican forces gradually surrounded the fort. Thirteen U.S. soldiers were injured during the bombardment, and two were killed.<ref name=\"Brooks122\">Brooks (1849), p. 122.</ref> Among the dead was Jacob Brown, after whom the fort was later named.<ref>Brooks (1849), pp. 91, 117.</ref>\n\nOn May 8, Zachary Taylor and 2,400 troops arrived to relieve the fort.<ref>Brooks (1849), p. 121.</ref> However, General Arista rushed north and intercepted him with a force of 3,400 at [[Battle of Palo Alto|Palo Alto]]. The U.S. Army employed \"flying artillery\", their term for [[horse artillery]], a type of mobile light artillery that was mounted on horse carriages with the entire crew riding horses into battle. It had a devastating effect on the Mexican army. In contrast to the \"flying artillery\" of the Americans, the Mexican cannons at the [[Battle of Palo Alto]] fired at such slow velocities that it was possible for American soldiers to dodge artillery rounds.<ref>Morgan, Robert \"Lions of the West\" Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2011, p. 237.</ref> The Mexicans replied with cavalry skirmishes and their own artillery. The U.S. flying artillery somewhat demoralized the Mexican side, and seeking terrain more to their advantage, the Mexicans retreated to the far side of a dry riverbed ''([[Resaca (channel)|resaca]])'' during the night. It provided a natural fortification, but during the retreat, Mexican troops were scattered, making communication difficult.<ref name=\"Brooks122\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]] the next day, the two sides engaged in fierce [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The [[United States Cavalry|U.S. Cavalry]] managed to capture the Mexican artillery, causing the Mexican side to retreat\u2014a retreat that turned into a rout.<ref name=\"Brooks122\"/> Fighting on unfamiliar terrain, his troops fleeing in retreat, Arista found it impossible to rally his forces. Mexican casualties were significant, and the Mexicans were forced to abandon their artillery and baggage. Fort Brown inflicted additional casualties as the withdrawing troops passed by the fort. Many Mexican soldiers drowned trying to swim across the Rio Grande.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Both these engagements were fought before war was declared.\n\n===Declarations of war===\n[[File:Mexican\u2013American War (without Scott's Campaign)-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Overview map of the war.

After the U.S.  He wrote to the government in Mexico City, stating he did not want to return to the presidency, but he would like to come out of exile in Cuba to use his military experience to reclaim Texas for Mexico. President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], who had been Santa Anna's vice president in 1833-34 and ousted by him, was driven to desperation.  He accepted the offer and allowed Santa Anna to return. Unbeknownst to President G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with U.S. representatives to discuss a sale all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price on the condition that he be allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades. Polk sent his own representative to Cuba, [[Alexander Slidell MacKenzie]] to negotiate directly with Santa Anna. The negotiations were secret and there are no written records of the meetings, but there was some understanding that came out of the meetings. Polk asked the U.S. congress for $2 million to be used in negotiating a treaty with Mexico. The U.S. allowed Santa Anna was to return to Mexico.  Santa Anna denied all knowledge of meeting with the U.S. representative or any offers or transactions. Rather than being Polk's [[Trojan horse]], he pocketed any money given him, and began to plan the defense of Mexico. The Americans were dismayed, including General Scott.  \"Santa Anna gloated over his enemies' na\u00efvet\u00e9: 'The United States was deceived in believing that I would be capable of betraying my mother country.'\"<ref>quoted in Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'' p. 255. The negotiations are discussed pp. 253-54</ref> Santa Anna avoided getting involved in politics, dedicating himself to Mexico's military defense. While politicians attempted to reset the governing framework to a federal republic, Santa Anna left for the front to retake lost northern territory. Although Santa Anna was elected president in 1846, he refused to govern, leaving that to his vice president, while he sought to engage with General [[Zachary Taylor]]'s forces.  With the restored federal republic, some states refused to support the national military campaign led by Santa Anna. He had battled some states into submission a decade before. Santa Anna urged vice president G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas to act as a dictator to get the men and materiel needed for the war. G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas forced a loan from the Catholic Church to secure funds for Sant Anna's army, but the funds were not available in time bolstering his army's readiness to attack Taylor's.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'' pp. 259-61</ref>\n\n==Reaction in the United States==\n\n===Opposition to the war===\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Nicholas Shepherd, 1846-crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abraham Lincoln]] in his late 30s as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], when he opposed the Mexican\u2013American War.

Most [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] in the North and South opposed it;<ref name=\"Jay166\">Jay (1853), pp. 165\u2013166.</ref> most Democrats supported it.<ref name=\"Jay165\">Jay (1853), p. 165.</ref> Southern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], animated by a popular belief in [[Manifest Destiny]], supported it in hope of adding slave-owning territory to the South and avoiding being outnumbered by the faster-growing North. [[John L. O'Sullivan]], editor of the ''Democratic Review'', coined this phrase in its context, stating that it must be \"our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.\"<ref>See O'Sullivan's 1845 article [http://web.grinnell.edu/courses/HIS/f01/HIS202-01/Documents/OSullivan.html \"Annexation\"], ''United States Magazine and Democratic Review''.</ref>\n\nNorthern antislavery elements feared the expansion of the Southern [[Slave Power]]; Whigs generally wanted to strengthen the economy with industrialization, not expand it with more land. Among the most vocal opposing the war in the House of Representatives was former U.S. president, [[John Quincy Adams]] now a representative from [[Massachusetts]]. Adams had first voiced concerns about expanding into Mexican territory in 1836 when he opposed Texas annexation following its de facto independence from Mexico. He continued this argument in 1846 for the same reason. War with Mexico would add new slavery territory to the nation. When the question to go to war with Mexico came to a vote on 13 May 1846, Adams spoke a resounding \"No!\" in the chamber. Only 13 others followed his lead. Despite that opposition, he later voted for war appropriations.<ref name=\"zinn\"/>{{rp|151}}\n\nEx-slave [[Frederick Douglass]] opposed the war and was dismayed by the weakness of the anti-war movement. \"The determination of our slave holding president, and the probability of his success in wringing from the people, men and money to carry it on, is made evident by the puny opposition arrayed against him. None seem willing to take their stand for peace at all risks.\"<ref>quoted in Christensen, ''The U.S.-Mexican War'', p. 74.</ref>\n\nPolk was generally able to manipulate Whigs into supporting appropriations for the war, but only once it had already started and then \"clouding the situation with a number of false statements about Mexican actions.\"<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 22.</ref>  Not everyone went along. [[Joshua Giddings]] led a group of dissenters in Washington D.C. He called the war with Mexico \"an aggressive, unholy, and unjust war\", and voted against supplying soldiers and weapons. He said: \"In the murder of Mexicans upon their own soil, or in robbing them of their country, I can take no part either now or hereafter. The guilt of these crimes must rest on others. I will not participate in them.<ref>Giddings, Joshua Reed. ''Speeches in Congress [1841\u20131852]'', J.P. Jewett and Company, 1853, p. 17.</ref>\n\nFellow Whig [[Abraham Lincoln]] contested Polk's causes for the war. Polk had said that Mexico had \"shed American blood upon American soil\". Lincoln submitted eight \"[[Spot Resolutions]]\", demanding that Polk state the exact spot where Thornton had been attacked and American blood shed, and clarify whether or not that location was actually American soil, or in fact had been claimed by Spain and Mexico. Lincoln, too, did not actually stop money for men or supplies in the war effort.<ref name=\"zinn\"/>{{rp|151}}\n\nWhig Senator [[Thomas Corwin]] of Ohio gave a long speech indicting presidential war in 1847. In the Senate, February 11, 1847.</ref> Whig leader [[Robert Toombs]] of Georgia declared: \"This war is nondescript ... We charge the President with usurping the war-making power&nbsp;... with seizing a country&nbsp;... which had been for centuries, and was then in the possession of the Mexicans. ... Let us put a check upon this lust of dominion. We had territory enough, Heaven knew.<ref>[[Albert J. Beveridge|Beveridge]] 1:417.</ref>\n\nNorthern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] attacked the war as an attempt by slave-owners to strengthen the grip of slavery and thus ensure their continued influence in the federal government. Prominent artists and writers opposed the war. The [[Transcendentalist]] writers [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] attacked the popular war. Thoreau, who served jail time for his opposition, turned a lecture into an essay now known as ''[[Civil Disobedience]]''. Emerson was succinct, predicting that, \"The United States will conquer Mexico, but it will be as a man who swallowed the arsenic which brings him down in turn. Mexico will poison us.\" Events proved him right, as arguments over the expansion of slavery in the lands seized from Mexico would fuel the drift to civil war just a dozen years later.<ref name=\"TD-20180818\">{{cite web |last1=Sjursen |first1=Danny |title=The Fraudulent Mexican-American War (1846\u201348) |url=https://www.truthdig.com/articles/american-history-for-truthdiggers-the-fraudulent-mexican-american-war-1846-48/ |website=Truthdig |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |date=2018-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDemocratic Representative [[David Wilmot]] introduced the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would prohibit slavery in new territory acquired from Mexico.

They saw the territories as actually unsettled, ungoverned, and unprotected frontier lands, whose non-aboriginal population, where there was any at all, represented a substantial\u2014in places even a majority\u2014American component. Moreover, the territories were feared to be under imminent threat of acquisition by America's rival on the continent, the British.\n\nPresident Polk reprised these arguments in his Third Annual Message to Congress on December 7, 1847.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=29488 |title=James K. Polk: Third Annual Message\u2014December 7, 1847 |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref> He scrupulously detailed his administration's position on the origins of the conflict, the measures the U.S. had taken to avoid hostilities, and the justification for declaring war. He also elaborated upon the many outstanding financial claims by American citizens against Mexico and argued that, in view of the country's insolvency, the cession of some large portion of its northern territories was the only indemnity realistically available as compensation. This helped to rally congressional Democrats to his side, ensuring passage of his war measures and bolstering support for the war in the U.S.\n\nFollowing the signing of the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], Polk sought to send troops to Yucatan, where there was a civil war between secessionists and those supporting the Mexican government. The U.S. Congress refused his request. The Mexican War was supposed to be short and nearly bloodless. It was neither. Congress did not support more foreign conflict.<ref>Christiansen, ''The U.S.-Mexico War'', p. 220</ref>\n\n===U.S. journalism during the war===\n[[File:War News from Mexico.jpg|thumb|upright|left|250px|''War News from Mexico'' (1848)]]\nThe Mexican\u2013American War was the first U.S. war that was covered by [[mass media]], primarily the [[penny press]] and was the first foreign war covered primarily by U.S. correspondents.<ref>Tom Reilly, \"Newspaper Suppression During the Mexican War, 1846\u201348,\" ''Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly'', Vol 54, Issue 2, pp. 262\u2013349, first published June 1, 1977, http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107769907705400205</ref> Press coverage in the United States was characterized by support for the war and widespread public interest and demand for coverage of the conflict. Mexican coverage of the war (both written by Mexicans and Americans based in Mexico) was affected by press censorship, first by the Mexican government and later by the American military.\n\n[[Walt Whitman]] enthusiastically endorsed the war in 1846, and showed his disdainful attitude toward Mexico and boosterism for Manifest Destiny: \"What has miserable, inefficient Mexico--with her superstition, her burlesque upon freedom, her actual tyranny by the few over the many--what has she to do with the great mission of peopling the new world with a noble race?

Initial fighting was in and around Texas, but the U.S. moved swiftly to expand the conflict beyond the disputed area. By late 1846, the U.S. Army had captured all of northern Mexico, as far south as [[Monterrey]]. The [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] sent a U.S. Cavalry force under [[Stephen W. Kearny]] to invade western Mexico, taking New Mexico, then aiming for Arizona and heading to California. U.S. forces in the Pacific were  reinforced by a Pacific fleet under [[John D. Sloat]]. This was done primarily because of concerns that the British might also try to seize the area.<ref>S\u00e1nchez, Joseph P. \"Mexican-American War (1846-1848)\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 4, pp. 32-34.

Kearny and his force entered Santa Fe and claimed the New Mexico Territory for the [[United States]] without a shot being fired. Kearny declared himself the military governor of the [[New Mexico Territory]] on August 18 and established a [[U.S. provisional government of New Mexico|civilian government]]. American officers with a background in law drew up a temporary legal system for the territory called the [[Kearny Code]].<ref>Morgan, Robert (2011). ''Lions of the West''. Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, p. 243.</ref>\n\nKearny then took the remainder of his army west to [[Alta California]].<ref name=BoSF/> When he departed with his forces for [[California]], he left Colonel [[Sterling Price]] in command of U.S. forces in New Mexico. He appointed [[Charles Bent]] as New Mexico's first territorial governor.\n\nFollowing Kearny's departure, dissenters in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] plotted a Christmas uprising. When the plans were discovered by the U.S. authorities, the dissenters postponed the uprising. They attracted numerous Indian allies, including [[Puebloan peoples]], who also wanted to push the Americans from the territory. On the morning of January 19, 1847, the insurrectionists began the revolt in Don Fernando de Taos, present-day [[Taos, New Mexico]], which later gave it the name the [[Taos Revolt]]. They were led by [[Pablo Montoya]], a New Mexican, and [[Tom\u00e1s Romero]], a Taos [[Puebloan peoples|pueblo Indian]] also known as ''Tomasito'' (Little Thomas).\n\nRomero led an Indian force to the house of Governor [[Charles Bent]], where they broke down the door, shot Bent with arrows, and scalped him in front of his family. They moved on, leaving Bent still alive. With his wife Ignacia and children, and the wives of friends [[Kit Carson]] and Thomas Boggs, the group escaped by digging through the adobe walls of their house into the one next door. When the insurgents discovered the party, they killed Bent, but left the women and children unharmed.\n\nThe next day a large armed force of approximately 500 New Mexicans and Pueblo attacked and laid siege to Simeon Turley's mill in [[Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico|Arroyo Hondo]], several miles outside of Taos. [[Charles Autobees]], an employee at the mill, saw the men coming. He rode to Santa Fe for help from the occupying U.S. forces. Eight to ten [[mountain man|mountain men]] were left at the mill for defense. After a day-long battle, only two of the mountain men survived, [[John David Albert]] and [[Thomas Tate Tobin]], Autobees' half brother. Both escaped separately on foot during the night. The same day New Mexican insurgents killed seven American traders who were passing through the village of [[Mora, New Mexico|Mora]]. At most, 15 Americans were killed in both actions on January 20.\n\nThe U.S. military moved quickly to quash the revolt; Col. Price led more than 300 U.S. troops from Santa Fe to Taos, together with 65 volunteers, including a few New Mexicans, organized by [[Ceran St. Vrain]], the business partner of the brothers William and Charles Bent. Along the way, the combined forces beat back a force of some 1,500 New Mexicans and Pueblo at [[Battle of Ca\u00f1ada|Santa Cruz de la Ca\u00f1ada]] and at [[Battle of Embudo Pass|Embudo Pass]]. The insurgents retreated to [[Taos Pueblo]], where they took refuge in the thick-walled adobe church.\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Pueblo de Taos|ensuing battle]], the U.S. breached a wall of the church and directed cannon fire into the interior, inflicting many casualties and killing about 150 rebels.

Other ports, not on the peninsula, were taken as well. The objective of the Pacific Coast Campaign was to capture [[Mazatl\u00e1n]], on the Mexican mainland, which was a major supply base for Mexican forces.

Taylor agreed to allow the Mexican Army to evacuate and to an eight-week armistice in return for the surrender of the city. Under pressure from Washington, Taylor broke the armistice and occupied the city of Saltillo, southwest of Monterrey. Santa Anna blamed the loss of Monterrey and Saltillo on Ampudia and demoted him to command a small artillery battalion.\n\nOn February 22, 1847, Santa Anna personally marched north to fight Taylor with 20,000 men. Taylor, with 4,600 men, had entrenched at a mountain pass called Buena Vista \"good view.\" Santa Anna suffered desertions on the way north and arrived with 15,000 men in a tired state. He demanded and was refused surrender of the U.S. Army; he attacked the next morning. Santa Anna flanked the U.S. positions by sending his cavalry and some of his infantry up the steep terrain that made up one side of the pass, while a division of infantry attacked frontally along the road leading to Buena Vista. Furious fighting ensued, during which the U.S. troops were nearly routed, but managed to cling to their entrenched position, thanks to the Mississippi Rifles, a volunteer regiment led by [[Jefferson Davis]], who formed them into a defensive V formation.<ref>Shelby Foote, ''The Civil War: A Narrative'': Volume 1: Fort Sumter to Perryville (1958).</ref> The Mexicans had inflicted considerable losses, and initial reports of the battle gave the victory to Santa Anna,much to the joy of Mexicans in towns and cities. But Santa Anna retreated, having gotten word of upheaval in Mexico City, and he returned to the capital with losing men on the way.  Taylor was left in control of part of northern Mexico, and Santa Anna much criticized for his withdrawal. Mexican military historians argue that the U.S. Army could have been beaten back if Santa Anna had acted differently.<ref>Christiansen, ''The U.S.-Mexican War'', p. 161.</ref>\n\nPolk mistrusted Taylor, who he felt had shown incompetence in the Battle of Monterrey by agreeing to the armistice.

British consul John Potts did not want to let Doniphan search Governor Trias's mansion, and unsuccessfully asserted it was under British protection. American merchants in Chihuahua wanted the American force to stay in order to protect their business. [[William Gilpin (governor)|Major William Gilpin]] advocated a march on Mexico City and convinced a majority of officers, but Doniphan subverted this plan. Then in late April, Taylor ordered the First Missouri Mounted Volunteers to leave Chihuahua and join him at [[Saltillo]]. The American merchants either followed or returned to Santa Fe.

Yucat\u00e1n in particular had closer ties to Cuba and to the United States than it did to central Mexico. On a number of occasions in the early era of the Mexican Republic, Yucat\u00e1n seceded from the federation. There were also rivalries between regional elites, with one faction based in M\u00e9rida and the other in Campeche. These issues factored into the Mexican\u2013American War.<ref>Gilbert M.

Even before hostilities began in the disputed northern region, the U.S. Navy created a blockade. Given the shallow waters of that portion of the Gulf coast, the U.S. Navy needed ships with a shallow draft rather than large frigates. Since the Mexican Navy was almost non-existent, the U.S. Navy could operate unimpeded in Gulf waters.<ref>K. Jack Bauer, ''The Mexican war, 1846\u20131848''. 1974.

In 1847 Maya revolted against the white elites of the peninsula in a racial war known as the [[Caste War of Yucatan]]. [[Jefferson Davis]], then a senator from Mississippi, argued in congress that the president needed no further powers to intervene in Yucatan since the war with Mexico was underway. Davis's concern was strategic and part of his vision of Manifest Destiny, considering the Gulf of Mexico \"a basin of water belonging to the United States\" and continuing \"the cape of Yucatan and the island of Cuba must be ours\" rather than under British influence.<ref>quoted in Brian Loveman, ''No Higher Law: American Foreign Policy and the Western Hemisphere Since 1776''.

On March 9, 1847, Scott performed the first major amphibious landing in U.S. history in preparation for the [[Siege of Veracruz]]. A group of 12,000 volunteer and regular soldiers successfully offloaded supplies, weapons, and horses near the walled city using specially designed landing crafts. Included in the invading force were [[Robert E. Lee]], [[George Meade]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[James Longstreet]], and [[Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]].\n\nThe city was defended by Mexican General Juan Morales with 3,400 men. [[Mortar (weapon)|Mortars]] and naval guns under Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] were used to reduce the city walls and harass defenders. After a bombardment on March 24, 1847, the walls of Veracruz had a thirty-foot gap.<ref>Morgan, Robert, ''Lions of the West'', Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2011, p. 282.</ref>\nThe city replied the best it could with its own artillery. The effect of the extended barrage destroyed the will of the Mexican side to fight against a numerically superior force, and they surrendered the city after 12 days under siege. U.S. troops suffered 80 casualties, while the Mexican side had around 180 killed and wounded, while hundreds of civilians were killed.<ref>{{cite web|website=Gobierno de Mexico, Servicio de Informacion Agroalimentaria y Pesqueria|url=https://www.gob.mx/siap/articulos/un-dia-como-hoy-pero-de-1847-fuerzas-invasoras-norteamericanas-toman-el-puerto-de-veracruz?idiom=es|title=Un d\u00eda como hoy, pero de 1847, fuerzas invasoras norteamericanas toman el puerto de Veracruz|accessdate=July 18, 2019|language=Spanish|trans-title=A day like today, but in 1847, Invading Northamerican forces take the Port of Veracruz}}</ref> During the siege, the U.S. side began to fall victim to [[yellow fever]].\n\n===Advance on Puebla===\n{{main|Battle of Cerro Gordo}}\n[[File:Batalla_de_Cerro_Gordo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Battle of Cerro Gordo, lithograph courtesy of the Yale Collection of Western Americana, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.]]\n[[File:Scott's campaign-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Scott's campaign]]\n\nSanta Anna allowed Scott's army to march inland, counting on yellow fever and other tropical diseases to take their toll before Santa Anna chose to place to engage the enemy. Mexico had used this tactic before, including when Spain attempted to reconquer Mexico in 1829.  Disease could be a decisive factor in the war.  Santa Anna was from Veracruz State, so he was on his home territory, knew the terrain, and had a network of allies. He could draw on local resources to feed his ill-fed army and gain intelligence on the enemy's movement. From his experience in the northern battles on open terrain, Santa Anna sought to negate the U.S. Army's advantage of the use of artillery.  Santa Anna chose Cerro Gordo to engage, calculating it would have maximum advantage for the Mexican forces.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 193-94</ref> Scott then marched westward on April 2, 1847, toward Mexico City with 8,500 initially healthy troops, while Santa Anna set up a defensive position in a canyon around the main road about {{convert|50|mi|km}} north-west of Veracruz, near the hamlet of Cerro Gordo. Santa Anna had entrenched with what the U.S. Army believed were 12,000 troops, but in fact only around 9,000<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 200</ref>, and artillery that were trained on the road, where he expected Scott to appear. However, Scott had sent 2,600 mounted [[dragoons]] ahead and they reached the pass on April 12. The Mexican artillery prematurely fired on them and therefore revealed their positions, beginning the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]].\n\nInstead of taking the main road, Scott's troops trekked through the rough terrain to the north, setting up his artillery on the high ground and quietly flanking the Mexicans. Although by then aware of the positions of U.S. troops, Santa Anna and his troops were unprepared for the onslaught that followed. In the battle fought on April 18, the Mexican army was routed. The U.S. Army suffered 400 casualties, while the Mexicans suffered over 1,000 casualties and 3,000 were taken prisoner. In August 1847, Captain [[Kirby Smith]], of Scott's 3rd Infantry, reflected on the resistance of the Mexican army:\n\n{{quote| They can do nothing and their continued defeats should convince them of it.

Santa Anna was determined to fight to the end and Mexican soldiers continued to regroup after battles to fight yet again.\n\n===Pause at Puebla===\n[[File:Nebel Mexican War 08 Molino del Rey Molino.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Molino del Rey]]]]\nIn May 1847, Scott pushed on to Puebla, the second largest city in Mexico. The city capitulated without resistance on May 1. The Mexican defeat at Cerro Gordo had demoralized Puebla's inhabitants, and they worried about the mayhem of U.S. Army looting, rape, and murder in the decision not to resist the U.S. Army. It was standard practice in Western warfare for victorious soldiers to be let loose to inflict horrors on civilian populations if they resisted; the threat of this was often used as a bargaining tool to secure surrender without a fight. Scott had aimed to prevent his troops from atrocities. Puebla's ruling elite also sought to prevent violence, as did the Catholic Church, but Puebla's poor and working class wanted to defend the city. U.S. Army troops who strayed outside at night were often murdered. Enough Mexicans were willing to sell supplies to the U.S. Army as to make local provisioning possible.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 201-202</ref>  During the following months, Scott gathered supplies and reinforcements at Puebla and sent back units whose enlistments had expired. Scott also made strong efforts to keep his troops disciplined and treat the Mexican people under occupation justly, so as to prevent a popular rising against his army.\n\n===Advance on Mexico City and its capture===\n[[File:Battle of Chapultepec.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Chapultepec]]]]\n{{Main|Battle for Mexico City}}\nWith guerrillas harassing his line of communications back to Veracruz, Scott decided not to weaken his army to defend Puebla but, leaving only a garrison at Puebla to protect the sick and injured recovering there, advanced on Mexico City on August 7 with his remaining force. The capital was laid open in a series of battles around the right flank of the city defenses, the [[Battle of Contreras]] and [[Battle of Churubusco]]. After Churubusco, fighting halted for an armistice and peace negotiations, which broke down on September 6, 1847.  With the subsequent battles of [[Battle of Molino del Rey|Molino del Rey]] and of [[Battle of Chapultepec|Chapultepec]], and the [[Battle for Mexico City#Attacks on the Bel\u00e9n and San Cosme Gates|storming of the city gates]], the capital was occupied. Scott became military governor of occupied [[Mexico City]]. His victories in this campaign made him an American national hero.\n\n===Battle of Chapultepec===\n[[File:Chapultepec1.jpg|thumb|Storming of Chapultepec]]\n{{main|Battle of Chapultepec}}\nThe Battle of Chapultepec In September 1847 was an encounter between the Mexican Army and the United States on the [[Chapultepec Castle|castle of Chapultepec]], built on a hill in Mexico City in the colonial era. At this time, this castle was a renowned military school in the capital. After the battle, which ended in a victory for the U.S., the legend of \"Los Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes\" was born. Although not confirmed by historians, six military cadets between the ages of 13 and 17 stayed in the school instead of evacuating.<ref name=\"Webtopia\">[http://www.chapultepec.com.mx/articulo.asp?articulo=66 ''Dise\u00f1o Web y Desarrollo de Aplicaciones por Webtopia''], Retrieved May 8, 2014.</ref> They decided to stay and fight for Mexico. These ''[[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]]'' (boy heroes) became icons in Mexico's patriotic pantheon. Rather than surrender to the U.S. Army, some military cadets leaped from the castle walls.

General [[Joaqu\u00edn Rea]] began the [[Siege of Puebla (1847)|Siege of Puebla]], soon joined by Santa Anna. Scott had left some 2,400 soldiers in Puebla, of whom around 400 were completely fit. After the fall of Mexico City, Santa Anna hoped to rally Puebla's civilian population against the U.S. soldiers there who were under siege and subject to guerrilla attacks.  Before the Mexican army could wipe out the Americans in Puebla, more troops landed in Veracruz under the command of Brig. General [[Joseph Lane]]. At Puebla, they sacked the town.  Santa Anna was not able to provision his troops, who effectively dissolved as a fighting force to forage for food.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 290-91</ref> Puebla was relieved by Gen. Lane October 12, 1847, following his defeat of Santa Anna at the [[Battle of Huamantla]] on October 9, 1847.  The battle was Santa Anna's last.  Following the defeat, the new Mexican government led by [[Manuel de la Pe\u00f1a y Pe\u00f1a]] asked Santa Anna to turn over command of the army to General [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Guerrilla campaign, counter-insurgency, and atrocities===\nFollowing the capture and securing of the capital, the Mexican government moved to the temporary capital at [[Quer\u00e9taro]]. Conventional warfare gave way to [[guerrilla]] warfare by Mexicans defending their homeland.  They inflicted significant casualties on the U.S. Army, particularly on soldiers slow to keep up General Scott sent about a quarter of his strength to secure his line of communications to Veracruz from the Light Corps of General [[Joaqu\u00edn Rea]] and other Mexican guerrilla forces that had made stealth attacks since May. Mexican guerrillas often tortured and mutilated bodies of the American troops, as revenge and warning. Americans' interpreted these acts not as Mexicans' defense of their patria, but as evidence of Mexicans' brutality as racial inferiors. For their part, U.S. soldiers took revenge on Mexicans (\"greasers\") for the attacks, whether or not they were individually suspected of guerrilla acts. Scott had planned to make total war on the Mexican population, but since he was losing soldiers to guerrilla attacks, he had to make some decisions. He viewed guerrilla attacks as contrary to the \"laws of war\" and threatened the property of populations that appeared to harbor the guerrillas. Captured guerrillas were to be shot, including helpless prisoners, with the reasoning that the Mexicans did the same. Historian Peter Guardino contends that the U.S. Army command was complicit in the attacks against Mexican civilians.  By threatening the civilian populations' homes, property, and families with burning whole villages, looting, and raping women, the U.S. Army separated guerrillas from their base. \"Guerrills cost the Americans dearly, but indirectly cost Mexican civilians more.\"<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', pp. 294-98.</ref>  \n\nScott strengthened the garrison of Puebla and by November had added a 1200-man garrison at [[Xalapa|Jalapa]], established 750-man posts along the National Road the main route between the port of Veracruz and the capital, at the pass between Mexico City and Puebla at [[R\u00edo Fr\u00edo de Ju\u00e1rez|Rio Frio]], at [[Perote, Veracruz|Perote]] and [[Las Vigas de Ram\u00edrez, Veracruz|San Juan]] on the road between Jalapa and Puebla, and at [[Puente Nacional, Veracruz|Puente Nacional]] between Jalapa and Veracruz.<ref>Executive Document, No. 60, House of Representatives, first Session of the thirtieth Congress, pp. 1028, 1032.</ref> He had also detailed an anti guerrilla brigade under Brig. Gen. Joseph Lane to carry the war to the Light Corps and other guerrillas.  He ordered that convoys would travel with at least 1,300-man escorts. Victories by General Lane over the Light Corps at [[Atlixco]] (October 18, 1847), at [[Izucar de Matamoros]] (November 23, 1847), and at [[Affair at Galaxara Pass|Galaxara Pass]] (November 24, 1847) ended the threat of General Rea.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nLater a raid against the guerrillas of [[Celedonio D\u00f3meco de Jarauta|Padre Jarauta]] at [[Zacualtipan]] (25 February 1848) further reduced guerrilla raids on the American line of communications. After the two governments concluded a truce to await ratification of the peace treaty, on 6 March 1848, formal hostilities ceased. However, some bands continued in defiance of the Mexican government until the U.S. Army's evacuation in August.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.history.army.mil//brochures/Occupation/Occupation.htm#b9 | first=Stephen A. |last = Carney |title=U.S. Army Campaigns of the Mexican War: The Occupation of Mexico, May 1846 \u2013 July 1848 (CMH Pub 73-3) | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | location=Washington | year=2005| pages=30\u201338}}</ref>  Some were suppressed by the Mexican Army or, like Padre Jarauta, executed.<ref>[[:es:Celedonio Domeco de Jarauta|Celedonio Domeco de Jarauta]] from es.wikipedia.org accessed June 5, 2013.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://memoriapoliticademexico.org/Efemerides/7/19071848-DJ.html|title=Memoria Pol\u00edtica de M\u00e9xico}}</ref>\n\n===Desertions in both armies===\n[[File:Battle of Churubusco2.jpg|thumb|''[[Battle of Churubusco]]'' by J.

In the Mexican Army, desertions depleted forces on the eve of battle. Most soldiers were peasants who had a loyalty to their village and family, but not to the generals who had conscripted them. Often hungry and ill, underequipped, only partially trained, and never well paid, the soldiers were held in contempt by their officers and had little reason to fight the Americans. Looking for their opportunity, many slipped away from camp to find their way back to their home village.<ref>{{cite book | first=Douglas |last=Meed | title=The Mexican War, 1846\u20131848 | publisher = Routledge | year=2003 | page=67}}</ref>\n\nThe desertion rate in the U.S. Army was 8.3% (9,200 out of 111,000), compared to 12.7% during the War of 1812 and usual peacetime rates of about 14.8% per year.<ref>{{cite web|last=McAllister |first=Brian |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0195045556?v=search-inside&keywords=desertion |title=see Coffman, ''Old Army'' (1988), p. 193 |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref> Many men deserted to join another U.S. unit and get a second enlistment bonus.

Nearly all were recent immigrants from Europe with weak ties to the U.S. The Mexicans issued broadsides and leaflets enticing U.S. soldiers with promises of money, land bounties, and officers' commissions. Mexican guerrillas shadowed the U.S. Army and captured men who took unauthorized leave or fell out of the ranks. The guerrillas coerced these men to join the Mexican ranks. The generous promises proved illusory for most deserters, who risked being executed if captured by U.S. forces.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n====San Patricios====\n{{Main|Saint Patrick's Battalion}}\n[[File:Sanpatricioshang.jpg|thumb|The mass hanging of Irish Catholic soldiers who joined the Mexican side, forming the [[Saint Patrick's Battalion]]]]\n\nThe most famous group of deserters from the U.

Mexico faced many continuing internal divisions between Mexican factions, so that bringing the war to a formal end was not straightforward. There were also divisions complications in the U.S. for negotiating the peace. Peace came in Alta California in January 1847 with the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]], with the [[Californios]] (Mexican residents of Alta California) capitulating to the American forces.<ref>Loveman, ''No Higher Law'', p. 87</ref> A more comprehensive peace treaty was needed to end the conflict. The U.S. forces had gone from being an army of conquest on the periphery for territory it desired to incorporate, to an invading force in central Mexico, potentially making it an army of long-term occupation. Mexico did not necessarily have to sign a peace treaty, but could have continued with long-term guerrilla warfare against the U.S. Army. However, it could not expel the invaders, so negotiating a treaty became more possible.<ref>Guardino, ''The Dead March'', p. 305</ref> Polk's wish for a short war of conquest against a perceived weak enemy with no will to fight had turned into a long and bloody conflict in Mexico's heartland. Negotiating a treaty was in the U.S.'s best interest. It was not easy to achieve. Polk lost confidence in his negotiator [[Nicholas Trist]] and dismissed him as peace negotiations dragged on. Trist ignored t. he fact that he no longer had authorization to act for the United States.  When Trist managed to get yet another Mexican government to sign the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], Polk was presented with an accomplished fact and decided to present it to Congress for ratification.  Ratification was fraught, since the Democrats had lost the elections of 1846 and Whigs opposed to the war were now in ascendance.\n\n===All-Mexico Movement===\n{{Main|All of Mexico Movement}}\nHaving won a decisive victory, the U.S. was  divided on what the peace should entail. Polk had wanted acquisition of Mexican territory either by purchase or a short war that gained Mexico's northern territories. But Mexican resistance to sale of its territory and its continued military resistance even in face repeated defeats meant a short, bloodless solution was impossible.  Now that the U.S. had gone far beyond the territorial gains it initially envisioned by invading central Mexico with its dense population, the question was raised whether to annex Mexico itself. The [[All of Mexico Movement|All-Mexico Movement]] sought just that. After the [[Wilmot Proviso]], there was a lessening of fervor for the idea, but the taking of Mexico City had revived enthusiasm.<ref>Schoultz, Lars. ''Beneath the United States: A History of U.S. Policy Toward Latin America''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1998, p. 34</ref>  There were fierce objections in Congress to that on racial grounds.  South Carolina Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] argued that absorbing Mexico would threatened U.S. institutions and the character of the country. \"We have never dreamt of incorporating into our Union any but the Caucasian race\u2014the free white race. To incorporate Mexico, would be the very first instance of the kind, of incorporating an Indian race; for than half of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes. I protest against such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race.... We are anxious to force free government on all; and I see that it has been urged ... that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake.\"  Beyond the racial argument, Calhoun contended that the U.S. could not be both an empire and a republic, and argued that being an empire would strengthen the central government and detrimental to individual states.<ref>Merry, ''A Country of Vast Designs'', pp. 414-15</ref>\nRhode Island's Whig Senator [[John Hopkins Clarke|John Clarke]] also objected to annexing all of Mexico. \"To incorporate such a disjointed and degraded mass into even a limited participation with our social and political rights, would be fatally destructive to the institutions. of our country.

By early 1847, he helped take the Mexican cities of Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec. Lee was wounded in Chapultepec. General Scott was the ranking officer in the United States Army during the Mexican\u2013American campaign. He described Robert E.

The House of Representatives is apportioned by population, and the North's was growing, allowing it to win the majority of the House in the 1846 elections; but the Senate representation is two per state and Southerners had enough votes to block the addition.\n\nThe war proved a decisive event for the U.S., marking a significant turning point for the nation as a growing military power. It is also a  milestone in the U.S. narrative of Manifest Destiny.

The Mexico City military cemetery \"signaled a transition in what the United States understood to be its obligations to its war dead,\" a pressing issue with the dead of the Civil War.<ref>Connors and Mu\u00f1oz, \"Look for the North American Invasion in Mexico City,\" pp. 511-12.</ref>\n[[File:Placa conmemorativa del batall\u00f3n de San Patricio.jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative plaque to the [[San Patricios]], Mexico City, 1959]] \n[[File:Obelisco a los Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes 03.

The war caused the country to enter \"a period of self-examination ... as its leaders sought to identify and address the reasons that had led to such a debacle.\"<ref>Pedro Santoni, \"U.S.-Mexican War\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1511.</ref> In the immediate aftermath of the war, a group of prominent Mexicans compiled an assessment of the reasons for the war and Mexico's defeat, edited by [[Ram\u00f3n Alcaraz]] and including contributions by [[Ignacio Ram\u00edrez]], [[Guillermo Prieto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Iglesias]], and [[Francisco Urquidi]]. They wrote that for \"the true origin of the war, it is sufficient to say that the insatiable ambition of the United States, favored by our weakness, caused it.\"<ref name=\"Alcaraz, pp. 1-2\"/> The work was translated to E.nglish by Colonel [[Albert Ramsey]], a veteran of the Mexican\u2013American War, and published in 1850.<ref>Ram\u00f3n Alcaraz, et al.

Ramsey, Colonel of the Eleventh United States Infantry During with War with Mexico. New York: Burt Franklin 1850. Republished 1970.</ref> The war remains a painful historical event for the country.\n\nIn the capital, Mexico established the ''Museo Nacional de las Intervenciones'' (National Museum of Interventiones) in a former convent that was the site of the [[Battle of Churubusco]]. It also chronicles the attempts by the Spanish to reconquer Mexico after its independence as well as French interventions. The museum has an exhibition on the ''Intervenci\u00f3n norteamericana de 1846-1848'' that chronicles the Anglo American settlement of Texas and their rebellion after characterizing themselves as victims of Mexican oppression. It goes on to blame the war on U.S. President Polk and on the Mexican side scapegoats Santa Anna. \"The [museum's] interpretation concedes U.S. military superiority in arms and commanders, while disparaging General Santa Anna's costly mistakes and retreat from the capital city.\"<ref>Connors, Thomas G. and Ra\u00fal Isa\u00ed Mu\u00f1oz, \"Looking for the North American Invasion in Mexico City.\" American Historical Review vol. 125, no. 2, April 2020, p. 502.</ref>\n\nThe memory of military cadets fighting to the bitter end during the U.S. assault on Chapultepec Castle was not commemorated until 1881. A small stone monument was erected at the base of the hill on which the castle is built.  In Mexico City's [[Chapultepec Park]], the ''[[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]]'' (Monument to the Heroic Cadets) commemorates the heroic sacrifice of six adolescent military cadets who fought to their deaths rather than surrender to American troops during the [[Battle of Chapultepec]] Castle on September 13, 1847. The monument is now an important patriotic site in Mexico. On March 5, 1947, nearly one hundred years after the battle, U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] placed a wreath at the monument and stood for a [[moment of silence]], although some cadets removed the wreath and tossed it in front of the American Embassy.<ref name=\"van\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[All of Mexico Movement]]\n* [[American propaganda in the Mexican\u2013American War]]\n* [[List of battles of the Mexican\u2013American War|Battles of the Mexican\u2013American War]]\n* [[Christopher Werner#Works|Christopher Werner, maker of the \"Iron Palmetto\"]] commemorating the loss of South Carolinians in the War\n* [[Border War (1910\u201319)|Mexican\u2013American Border War]]\n* [[Reconquista (Mexico)]]\n* [[Republic of Texas\u2013United States relations]]\n* [[Texas annexation]]\n* [[Territories of Mexico]]\n* [[Treaties of Velasco]]\n\n===General===\n* [[History of Mexico]]\n* [[History of New Mexico]]\n* [[History of the United States]]\n* [[List of conflicts in the United States]]\n* [[List of wars involving the United States]]\n* [[List of wars involving Mexico]]\n* [[Mexico\u2013United States relations]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Corwin-Speech_%27On_the_Mexican_War%27-1847-Congressional_Globe-ed._WRE-Apr11(2015).pdf\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Reference works===\n* {{cite book|last1=Crawford|first1=Mark|last2=Heidler|first2=Jeanne|last3=Heidler (eds.)|first3=David Stephen|title =Encyclopedia of the Mexican War|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57607-059-8}}\n* Frazier, Donald S. ed.
