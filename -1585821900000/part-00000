There are around forty historic buildings that you can enter and see from the inside and there is also a historic tram that can transport you through the park.

This way the old traditions could be preserved the  \"Vereniging voor Volkskunde Het Nederlands Openluchtmuseum\" (Association for Folklore The Dutch Open Air Museum) was created that same month. It opened it's door on the 13 of July [[1918]]. At the time of its opening the museum contained 6 building that had been moved in from other locations across the country. One of the first building was the [[los hoes]] originally build in [[Beuningen]] in the 17th century.\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring World War II the museum was hit with incendiary bombs, this caused a building in the [[Zaanse buurt]] to go up in flames. In 1941 the museum was renamed to the ''Rijksmuseum voor Volkskunde'' (National museum for folklore). During the [[Battle of Arnhem]] the museum was temporally lived in by some hundred evacuees. On the 17th of November 1944 Franneke van der Kallen was born in one of the houses in the Zaanse buurt. Later on the 15th of November 1944 Nora Olga Marijke was born.

In 1945 during an attack from a [[V-1 flying bomb]] the collection of garbs and painted furniture were lost.\n\n==Research==\nSome research is done on-site at the Open Air Museum for the dating and conservation of materials acquired. The Multimedia Library of the museum contains pictures, slides, diagrams, videos, and audio recordings documenting Dutch folk life. They also work in tandem with the Foundation for Historical Farm Research (SHBO), the Working Party for Farmyards Foundation (SWB), and the Centre for Documentation and Information on Regional Dress (SDI) in their research on folk culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nederlands Openluchtmusuem|year=2000|author=Ton Wagemakers|work=Openluchtmuseum}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nVeluwse Papiermolen, Openluchtmuseum Arnhem.jpg|Paper mill\nTram RET 500-serie.jpg|Tramway\nOpenluchtmuseum Arnhem, Grensovergang 1914-'18.jpg|German border crossing from WWI, part of the [[Wire of Death]]\n(14) Kasteelboerderij - Openluchtmuseum Arnhem.JPG|Farmhouse\nAmsterdam buildings Openluchtmuseum Arnhem (cropped).jpg|Two Amsterdam houses in the Arnhem Open Air Museum\n(33) Winkel Zus en Jet, krommenie - Openluchtmuseum Arnhem.JPG|Houses from the Zaan region\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Wagemakers, Ton.
