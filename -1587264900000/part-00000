Sotira entrusted all public aspects of the project to Scott Jarkoff as an engineer and visionary to launch the early program. All three co-founders shared backgrounds in the application skinning community, but it was Matt Stephens whose major contribution to DeviantArt was the suggestion to take the concept further than [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and more toward an \"art community\". Many of the individuals involved with the initial development and promotion of DeviantArt still hold positions with the project, from administrators to volunteers serving as gallery directors and Message Network Administration.

Shotokan is named after Funakoshi's pen name, ''Sh\u014dt\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u677e|\u677e]][[wikt:\u6fe4|\u6fe4]]), which means \"waving pines\".  ''Kan'' means training hall or house, thus ''Sh\u014dt\u014dkan'' (\u677e\u6fe4\u9928) referred to the \"house of Sh\u014dt\u014d\". This name was coined by Funakoshi's students when they posted a sign above the entrance of the hall at which Funakoshi taught. In addition to being a karate master, Funakoshi was an avid [[poet]] and [[philosopher]] who would reportedly go for long walks in the forest where he would [[meditation|meditate]] and write his poetry.<ref name=\"threemasters\">John Stevens (1995). \"Three Budo Masters: Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba\". Kodansha International {{ISBN|4-7700-1852-5}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1910s, Funakoshi had many students, of which a few were deemed capable of passing on their master's teachings. Continuing his effort to garner widespread interest in Okinawan karate, Funakoshi ventured to mainland Japan in 1917, and again in 1922.<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" />\n\nIn 1930, Funakoshi established an association named Dai-Nihon Karate-do Kenkyukai to promote communication and information exchange among people who study karate-d\u014d. In 1936, Dai-Nippon Karate-do Kenkyukai changed its name to Dai-Nippon Karate-do Shoto-kai.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |title=The Official Homepage of Nihon Karate-do Shotokai |access-date=2010-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227032101/http://www.shotokai.jp/english/about/history.html |archive-date=2010-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The association is known today as [[Shotokai]], and is the official keeper of Funakoshi's karate heritage.\n\nIn 1936, Funakoshi built the first Sh\u014dt\u014dkan ''[[dojo]]'' (training hall) in Tokyo. While on the Japanese mainland, he changed the [[kanji|written characters]]  of karate to mean \"empty hand\" (\u7a7a\u624b) instead of \"China hand\" (\u5510\u624b) (literally [[Tang dynasty]]) to downplay its connection to [[Chinese boxing]]. Karate had borrowed many aspects from Chinese boxing.  Funakoshi also argued in his autobiography that a philosophical evaluation of the use of \"empty\" seemed to fit as it implied a way which was not tethered to any other physical object.\n\nFunakoshi's re-interpretation of the [[kanji|character]] ''kara'' in karate to mean \"empty\" ([[wikt:\u7a7a|\u7a7a]]) rather than \"Chinese\" ([[wikt:\u5510|\u5510]])  caused some tension with traditionalists back in Okinawa, prompting Funakoshi to remain in [[Tokyo]] indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1949 Funakoshi's students created the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA), with Funakoshi as the honorary head of the organization. However, in practise this organization was led by [[Masatoshi Nakayama]]. The JKA began formalizing Funakoshi's teachings.\n\n==Illness and death==\nFunakoshi developed [[osteoarthritis]] in 1948, and died in April 26, 1957.\n\n==Legacy==\nFunakoshi published several books on karate including his autobiography, ''Karate-Do: My Way of Life''. His legacy, however, rests in a document containing his philosophies of karate training now referred to as the ''[[niju kun]]'', or \"twenty principles\".  These rules are the premise of training for all Shotokan practitioners and are published in a work titled ''The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate: The Spiritual Legacy of the Master  | publisher=Kodansha International Ltd | author=Funakoshi, Gichin | translator=John Teramoto| year=1975 |isbn=4-7700-2796-6}}</ref> Within this book, Funakoshi lays out 20 rules by which students of karate are urged to abide in an effort to \"become better human beings\".<ref name=\"funakoshi_autobiography\" /> Funakoshi's Karate-Do Kyohan \"The Master Text\" remains his most detailed publication, containing sections on history, basics, [[kata]], and [[kumite]].

From about eleven years old he began to study to-te jutsu under [[Azato Anko]] and [[Itosu Anko]]. He practiced diligently and in 1912 became the president of the Okinawan Shobukai. In May 1922, he relocated to Tokyo and became a professional teacher of karate-do. He devoted his entire life to the development of karate-do. He lived out his eighty-eight years of life and left this world on April 26, 1957. Reinterpreting to-te jutsu, the Sensei promulgated karate-do while not losing its original philosophy. Like bugei (classical martial arts), so too is the pinnacle of karate \u201cmu\u201d (enlightenment): to purify and make one empty through the transformation from \u201cjutsu\u201d to \u201cdo\u201d. Through his famous words \"\u7a7a\u624b\u306b\u5148\u624b\u306a\u3057\" (karate ni sente nashi) meaning ''There is no first attack in Karate'' and \u7a7a\u624b\u306f\u541b\u5b50\u306e\u6b66\u82b8

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{in use}}\n{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company. The Tennessee Chemical Company immediately began contesting its property tax requirements, which resulted in Polk County laying off 20% of its government employees, resulting in further turmoil amongst local residents.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe company announced plans to shut down all mining operations on January 22, 1985, and the final mine closed on August 27, 1987.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. Due to the removal of the forests, this also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Apple heads have rounded heads, close-set eyes, and relatively short ears and legs. Deer heads have flat-topped heads, more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer, more slender legs. Deer heads were the breed standard conformation in the mid-20th century, but current breed standards defined by registries such as the AKC specify the apple-head conformation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Apple Head Chihuahua is known for having a round/apple \n-shaped head and a definite \u201cstop\u201d whereas a Deer Head Chihuahua \u201cmay\u201d have a flatter head, thinner skull, but is unlikely to have a \u201cstop\u201d and will probably have a much longer nose. Their physical body shape is largely the same, except the Deer Head Chihuahua is known to have longer legs than other Chihuahuas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.puppywire.com/chihuahua-types/|title=7 Types of Chihuahuas You'll Love in 2019 (Guide + Tips)|last=PuppyWire|website=https://www.puppywire.com/|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> The Deer Head Chihuahua tends to be larger in weight, where an Apple Head is more likely to keep their weight under ten pounds. \n\nApple Head Chihuahuas are longer than they are tall and have shorter necks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animalso.com/breeds/chihuahua/deer-head-vs-apple-head-chihuahua/|title=Deer Head Chihuahua vs. Apple Head Chihuahua|website=Animalso|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Deer Head Chihuahuas have longer ears than Apple Heads and their head also has a slope-shaped form. Both Apple Head and Deer Head can have short hair or long hair. They also both come in various different colors such as brown, black, tan, or white.

There is no scientific evidence that Apple Heads have a higher risk of getting respiratory issues, due to having a smaller airway. Deer Headed Chihuahuas are not allowed in the AKC due to not meeting the standards that Apple Heads do. Deer Head Chihuahuas are not allowed because they have a longer jaw line and a slope that connects their muzzle and head, creating a 45 degree angle instead of a 90 degree angle like the Apple Head.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animalso.com/breeds/chihuahua/deer-head-vs-apple-head-chihuahua/|title=Deer Head Chihuahua vs. Apple Head Chihuahua|website=Animalso|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Apple Heads are allowed in the AKC and meet the requirements due to having a smaller weight, having a rounder head, and also having a 90 degree angle formed by the muzzle to the forehead.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Chihuahua.pdf|title=Official Standard of the Chihuahua|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Temperament==\n[[File:00100trPORTRAIT 00100 BURST20200417141352037 COVER.jpg|thumb|Chihuahua lounging on owner's lap]]\nHow a Chihuahua behaves depends on the genetic temperament of their parents and grandparents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/chihuahuas.html|title=Chihuahuas: They are DEMONS!!!!\n\n== Teacup Chihuahuas ==\nJust like Apple Head and Deer Head Chihuahuas, Teacup Chihuahuas are from the same breed but have a different appearance. A Teacup Chihuahua on average doesn't weigh more than four pounds. In a household they may need a little more looking after due to their small\u00a0size. Teacup Chihuahuas can have either short or long hair. Although a Teacup is much smaller in size, they still have the same confident and energetic personality as a full-sized Chihuahua.

Dental care is a must for these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth.

A true case of hydrocephalus can be diagnosed by a veterinarian, though the prognosis is grim.\n\nApple head Chihuahuas can have [[molera]]s, or a soft spot in their skulls, and they are the only breed of dog to be born with an incomplete skull. This is not a defect; it is a normal adaptation facilitating the passage through the birth canal and growth and development of the domed type of forehead. The molera is predominant in the apple heads and is present in nearly all Chihuahua puppies. The molera fills in with age, but great care needs to be taken during the first six months until the skull is fully formed. Some moleras do not close completely and require extra care to prevent injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/molera.htm |title=Molera Statement |accessdate=2010-09-05 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403223157/http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/molera.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nChihuahua puppies can be at risk for [[hypoglycemia]] (low [[blood sugar]]). Signs of hypoglycemia include lethargy, sleepiness, uncoordinated walking, unfocused eyes, spasms of the neck muscles or head pulling back or to the side, fainting, and seizures. Hypoglycemia can be avoided with adequate nutrition and frequent feedings, especially for Chihuahuas that are younger, smaller, or leaner. Chihuahua owners should have a simple-sugar supplement on hand to use in emergencies, such as Nutri-Cal or corn syrup. These supplements can be rubbed on the gums and roof of the mouth to rapidly raise the blood sugar level.\n\nHowever, as with any dog, owners should take care not to overfeed their Chihuahua, since obesity can result in increased rates of joint injuries, tracheal collapse, [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], and shortened lifespan.\n\nAs in other breeds with large protruding eyes, Chihuahuas are prone to eye infections and eye injury. The eyes may water in response to dry air, dust, or airborne allergens.\n\n[[Tracheal collapse|Collapsed trachea]] is a health concern characteristic of the Chihuahua breed.<ref name=\"tracheal collapse\">{{cite web|url=http://www.famouschihuahua.com/chihuahua-health-concerns/tracheal-collapse-in-chihuahua-puppies-and-dogs|title=tracheal collapse in chihuahuas: a serious chihuahua respiratory problem|work=famous chihuahua}}</ref>\n\nChihuahuas may tremble or shiver when stressed, excited, or cold. These dogs, especially the short coat variety, are less tolerant of cold than larger breeds, and require a sweater/coat and/or boots in cold weather. They seek warmth in sunshine, under blankets, or on furniture, or human laps.\n\nSome Chihuahuas may present separation anxiety as a result of being so close and loyal to their owners. This is a fairly common cause behind any pacing, excessive salivating, destructive chewing, or barking, howling, or whining in dogs. Many [[Separation anxiety in dogs|treatments and tips]] can help prevent separation anxiety in dogs.\n\nThe lifespan for a Chihuahua is usually between 12 and 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/chihuahua|title=Chihuahua|work=Vetstreet}}</ref>\n\nChihuahuas are also known for [[luxating patella]], a genetic condition that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.\n\nChihuahuas are also prone to some heart-related disorders, such as heart murmurs and pulmonic stenosis, a condition in which the blood outflow from the heart's right ventricle is obstructed at the pulmonic valve.\n\n== Chihuahua crossbreeds ==\n\nApart from different types of Chihuahuas, breeders across the world started [[crossbreed]]ing Chihuahuas with other dog breeds in order to create breeds of mixed traits. The result of crossbreeding Chihuahuas with other dog breeds such as [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian dog]]s, [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]]s, [[Boston Terrier]]s, [[Pug]]s and so on, usually ends up in a dog breed of a Chihuahua's body size and the other parent breed's coat color and fur traits. \nThese are the most common Chihuahua crossbreeds:\n* Chihuahua and Pug - also called the Chug <ref name=\"Barking Royalty\">{{cite web|url=https://barkingroyalty.com/chihuahua-pug-mix/|title=Chug dog|work=Chug Dog \u2013 Ultimate Guide To The Chihuahua Pug Mix|publisher=Barking Royalty|location=barkingroyalty.com}}</ref>\n* Chihuahua and [[Bichon Frise]] - also called the Chi Chon\n* Chihuahua and Boston Terrier - also known as the Boston Huahua\n* Chihuahua and [[Pekingese]] - also known as the Cheek \n* Chihuahua and [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]] - also known as the Chilier <ref name=\"The Dogs Journal\">{{cite web|url=https://thedogsjournal.com/chilier-dog-breed-info/|title=Chilier dog|work=Chilier Dog Breed Info (Chihuahua Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Mix)|publisher=The DOgs Journal|location=thedogsjournal.com}}</ref>\n* Chihuahua and [[Jack Russell Terrier|Jack Russell]] - also called the Jack Huahua\n* Chihuahua and Pomeranian - also called the Pomchi\n* Chihuahua and Pembroke Welsh Corgi - also called the Chigi\n* Chihuahua and [[Poodle]] - also known as Chipoo\n* Chihuahua and Dachshund - also called the Chiweenie \n* Chihuahua and MinPin (Miniature Pinscher) - also called the Chipin\nPoodles and Bichon Frise dog breeds are often used in crossbreeding because of their hypoallergenic fur.

Longhaired Chihuahuas are actually smoother to the touch, having soft, fine guard hairs and a downy undercoat, which gives them their fluffy appearance. Unlike many longhaired breeds, longhaired Chihuahuas require no trimming and minimal grooming. Contrary to popular belief, the longhaired breed also typically sheds less than its shorthaired counterparts.

A Teacup Chihuahua on average doesn't weigh more than four pounds. In a household they may need a little more looking after due to their small\u00a0size. Teacup Chihuahuas can have either short or long hair. Although a Teacup is much smaller in size, they still have the same confident and energetic personality as a full-sized Chihuahua. It is also very risky for Teacup Chihuahuas to have puppies due to their size.

Dental care is a must for these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth.

A true case of hydrocephalus can be diagnosed by a veterinarian, though the prognosis is grim.\n\nApple head Chihuahuas can have [[molera]]s, or a soft spot in their skulls, and they are the only breed of dog to be born with an incomplete skull. This is not a defect; it is a normal adaptation facilitating the passage through the birth canal and growth and development of the domed type of forehead. The molera is predominant in the apple heads and is present in nearly all Chihuahua puppies. The molera fills in with age, but great care needs to be taken during the first six months until the skull is fully formed. Some moleras do not close completely and require extra care to prevent injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/molera.htm |title=Molera Statement |accessdate=2010-09-05 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403223157/http://www.chihuahuaclubofamerica.com/molera.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nChihuahua puppies can be at risk for [[hypoglycemia]] (low [[blood sugar]]). Signs of hypoglycemia include lethargy, sleepiness, uncoordinated walking, unfocused eyes, spasms of the neck muscles or head pulling back or to the side, fainting, and seizures. Hypoglycemia can be avoided with adequate nutrition and frequent feedings, especially for Chihuahuas that are younger, smaller, or leaner. Chihuahua owners should have a simple-sugar supplement on hand to use in emergencies, such as Nutri-Cal or corn syrup. These supplements can be rubbed on the gums and roof of the mouth to rapidly raise the blood sugar level.\n\nHowever, as with any dog, owners should take care not to overfeed their Chihuahua, since obesity can result in increased rates of joint injuries, tracheal collapse, [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], and shortened lifespan.\n\nAs in other breeds with large protruding eyes, Chihuahuas are prone to eye infections and eye injury. The eyes may water in response to dry air, dust, or airborne allergens.\n\n[[Tracheal collapse|Collapsed trachea]] is a health concern characteristic of the Chihuahua breed.<ref name=\"tracheal collapse\">{{cite web|url=http://www.famouschihuahua.com/chihuahua-health-concerns/tracheal-collapse-in-chihuahua-puppies-and-dogs|title=tracheal collapse in chihuahuas: a serious chihuahua respiratory problem|work=famous chihuahua}}</ref>\n\nChihuahuas may tremble or shiver when stressed, excited, or cold. These dogs, especially the short coat variety, are less tolerant of cold than larger breeds, and require a sweater/coat and/or boots in cold weather. They seek warmth in sunshine, under blankets, or on furniture, or human laps.\n\nSome Chihuahuas may present separation anxiety as a result of being so close and loyal to their owners. This is a fairly common cause behind any pacing, excessive salivating, destructive chewing, or barking, howling, or whining in dogs. Many [[Separation anxiety in dogs|treatments and tips]] can help prevent separation anxiety in dogs.\n\nThe lifespan for a Chihuahua is usually between 12 and 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/chihuahua|title=Chihuahua|work=Vetstreet}}</ref>\n\nChihuahuas are also known for [[luxating patella]], a genetic condition that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways. The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens, after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with activity.\n\nChihuahuas are also prone to some heart-related disorders, such as heart murmurs and pulmonic stenosis, a condition in which the blood outflow from the heart's right ventricle is obstructed at the pulmonic valve.\n\n== Chihuahua crossbreeds ==\n\nApart from different types of Chihuahuas, breeders across the world started [[crossbreed]]ing Chihuahuas with other dog breeds in order to create breeds of mixed traits. The result of crossbreeding Chihuahuas with other dog breeds such as [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian dog]]s, [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]]s, [[Boston Terrier]]s, [[Pug]]s and so on, usually ends up in a dog breed of a Chihuahua's body size and the other parent breed's coat color and fur traits. \nThese are the most common Chihuahua crossbreeds:\n* Chihuahua and Pug - also called the Chug <ref name=\"Barking Royalty\">{{cite web|url=https://barkingroyalty.com/chihuahua-pug-mix/|title=Chug dog|work=Chug Dog \u2013 Ultimate Guide To The Chihuahua Pug Mix|publisher=Barking Royalty|location=barkingroyalty.com}}</ref>\n* Chihuahua and [[Bichon Frise]] - also called the Chi Chon\n* Chihuahua and Boston Terrier - also known as the Boston Huahua\n* Chihuahua and [[Pekingese]] - also known as the Cheek \n* Chihuahua and [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]] - also known as the Chilier <ref name=\"The Dogs Journal\">{{cite web|url=https://thedogsjournal.com/chilier-dog-breed-info/|title=Chilier dog|work=Chilier Dog Breed Info (Chihuahua Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Mix)|publisher=The DOgs Journal|location=thedogsjournal.com}}</ref>\n* Chihuahua and [[Jack Russell Terrier|Jack Russell]] - also called the Jack Huahua\n* Chihuahua and Pomeranian - also called the Pomchi\n* Chihuahua and Pembroke Welsh Corgi - also called the Chigi\n* Chihuahua and [[Poodle]] - also known as Chipoo\n* Chihuahua and Dachshund - also called the Chiweenie \n* Chihuahua and MinPin (Miniature Pinscher) - also called the Chipin\nPoodles and Bichon Frise dog breeds are often used in crossbreeding because of their hypoallergenic fur.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre.

Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===SmackDown===\nOn the following episode of ''SmackDown'', Bray Wyatt interrupted new Universal Champion Braun Strowman.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]].

In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin, who was arguing with the referee, to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center.

Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre.

Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n====SmackDown====\nOn the following episode of ''SmackDown'', Bray Wyatt interrupted new Universal Champion Braun Strowman.

There were stations in all the towns and almost every city served as a  junction.\n\nSouthern Poland (the former Austrian province of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] with [[Krak\u00f3w Voivodeship]], [[Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship]], [[Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w Voivodeship]], and [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]]) was less developed. The areas with a fairly dense rail network were only around Krak\u00f3w and Lw\u00f3w. In the very south, along the border with [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]], and [[Hungary]], rail lines were virtually non-existent, although it is fair to say that lines would have been difficult to build in that mostly mountainous region anyway.\n\nThe worst situation was in Central and Eastern Poland&nbsp;\u2013 the territory of the former [[Russian Empire]]. These were the Voivodeships of [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], [[Kielce]], [[Warszawa]], [[Lublin]], [[Bia\u0142ystok]], [[Wo\u0142y\u0144 Voivodeship (1921\u20131939)|Volhynian]], [[Polesie Voivodeship|Polesie]], [[Nowogr\u00f3dek Voivodeship (1919-1939)|Nowogr\u00f3dek]] and [[Wilno Voivodeship (1926\u20131939)|Wilno]]. The rail network in some parts, especially in easternmost provinces (close to the Soviet border), was nonexistent. A better situation was around Warsaw and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\n\nEven though the Polish railway network in 1939 had deficiencies, the majority of important cities had convenient rail connections with each other. The major exception  was the connection of [[Wilno]] to the [[Port|seaport]] of [[Gdynia]], some 500&nbsp;km away. Trains running on this route had to cover a distance of about 900&nbsp;km, because they had to go via Warsaw. Construction of a line that would shorten this distance was planned, but the start of World War II prevented any work. This line would have taken the route: [[Lapy]] (on the Warsaw-Bia\u0142ystok line)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Ostro\u0142\u0119ka]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Przasnysz]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[M\u0142awa]] (located on the Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 Gda\u0144sk/Gdynia line).\n\nAnother rail connection whose construction was stopped by the war was the line [[D\u0119bica]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Pilzno]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Jas\u0142o]]. Works on it had already started in early 1939, but were never finished.\n\n[[Electrification]] of long-distance lines was planned, but by 1939 only some of the suburban stretches around Warsaw were upgraded with the electric infrastructure.\n\n==Polish national railway's structure in 1939==\nIn the summer of 1939, the PKP was divided into eight regions&nbsp;\u2013 Warsaw, [[Toru\u0144]], Pozna\u0144, [[Katowice]], Cracow, Radom, Lw\u00f3w and Wilno, with PKP's headquarters located in Warsaw. Also, for practical purposes, PKP was divided into five communications districts and every train in the timetable was numbered according to the district within which it operated. The districts were as follows:\n\n\u2013 First&nbsp;\u2013 North-West, starting with the 278&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 [[M\u0142awa]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Grudzi\u0105dz]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Laskowice Pomorskie]] (timetable route number 101),\n\n\u2013 Second&nbsp;\u2013 West, starting with the 379&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 [[Kutno]]&nbsp;\u2013 Pozna\u0144&nbsp;\u2013 [[Zb\u0105szy\u0144]] (timetable route number 201),\n\n\u2013 Third&nbsp;\u2013 South-West, starting with the 318&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 [[Koluszki]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Z\u0105bkowice]]&nbsp;\u2013 Katowice (timetable route number 301),\n\n\u2013 Fourth&nbsp;\u2013 South-East,  starting with the 491&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 [[Radom]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Skar\u017cysko-Kamienna|Skar\u017cysko]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rozwad\u00f3w]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Przemy\u015bl]]&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w (timetable route number 401),\n\n\u2013 Fifth&nbsp;\u2013 North-East, starting with the 571&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 Bia\u0142ystok&nbsp;\u2013 Wilno&nbsp;\u2013 [[Turmont]] (timetable route number 501).\n\n[[Image:Pocztowkapkp.jpg|thumb|Polish station on postcard, 1930s]]\n\n==The summer 1939 timetable==\n\"Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w Lato 1939\" (\"Official Train and Flight Timetable Summer 1939\") was published in May 1939 and was valid from May 15, 1939 to October 7, 1939. What adds to this document's importance is the time it was published: just a few months before the Polish Second Republic (Druga Rzeczpospolita) ceased to exist. In the document we can find the following:\n\n:''The following timetable is valid until October 7. On midnight of October 8, a new Winter timetable will be introduced, valid until May 18, 1940. All suggestions for necessary changes in the Winter timetable should be presented to the Polish National Railways Regional Directions not later than August 1.''\n\nApart from the train timetable, the document also included the flight timetable of [[LOT Polish Airlines]].\n\n==Types of trains in 1939==\nThe following types of trains were run in Poland at that time: express, fast, and ordinary. The most interesting and impressive were the diesel express trains, or \"Pociagi Motorowe-Ekspresowe&nbsp;\u2013 MtE\" (some of them operated with the famous [[Luxtorpeda]]). The MtE units achieved speeds up to 110&nbsp;km/h and connected Warsaw with the most important cities, as well as major tourist areas. The 179&nbsp;km journey from Warszawa Wschodnia (Warsaw East) to Bia\u0142ystok Centralny was covered in 1 hour 56 minutes.\n\nMtE trains ran from Warsaw to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (a distance of 133&nbsp;km in 1 hour 28 minutes), Krak\u00f3w, Katowice (through either [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] or Kielce), and [[Suwa\u0142ki]]. They also operated on lines from Krak\u00f3w to Katowice and the mountain resorts of [[Zakopane]] and [[Krynica-Zdr\u00f3j|Krynica]]. In southeastern Poland, MtE trains ran from Lw\u00f3w to [[Zaleszczyki]], [[Boryslav|Boryslaw]], Tarnopol, and Kolomyja. In August 1939 a new MtE connected Warsaw with Pozna\u0144 (due to the war the service lasted only few days).\n\nWarsaw lacked an MtE connection with Lw\u00f3w (the third largest city in 1939 Poland). This problem was solved by taking the morning express to Krak\u00f3w where it split at Skarzysko, with one part becoming an express to [[Przeworsk]]. There passengers could also change to an international fast train travelling between Berlin and Bucharest.\n\nFast trains served long-distance lines, but they were not quite as fast as the MtE trains. The most interesting fast trains in the summer 1939 were:\n\n* Wilno&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w (a journey of 720&nbsp;km.) It crossed practically the whole Polish Eastern Borderlands, stopping at Lida, Baranowicze, Luniniec, Rowne, and Zdolbunow.\n* Lw\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 Krak\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 Katowice&nbsp;\u2013 Pozna\u0144&nbsp;\u2013 [[Bydgoszcz]]&nbsp;\u2013 Gdynia&nbsp;\u2013 [[Hel, Poland|Hel]] (a journey of almost 1000&nbsp;km). It traveled non-stop through the territory of the [[Free City of Danzig]].\n\nThe last train category in Poland were ordinary trains. They usually served short-distance lines, but in some cases covered impressive distances, especially in the Polish Eastern Borderlands.\n\n==International trains==\nIn 1939, trains tended to run over longer distances than today. The Nord Express Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 Berlin&nbsp;\u2013 Paris&nbsp;\u2013 [[Calais]] ran daily and it was the only train in Poland of the L (Luxurious) standard. This train consisted only of coaches owned by the [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]]. There also was another train to the English Channel coast: from Warsaw, Lw\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w and Katowice to [[Ostend]]. Warsaw was also connected with the capital of France by a  Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&nbsp;\u2013 Paris train. Another train to France ran from Warsaw to [[Strasbourg]], with cars to [[Geneva]] and [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]].\n\nAs for the south of Europe, trains ran from Warsaw to Rome, and in the summer also to three cities in [[Yugoslavia]]: [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Su\u0161ak, Rijeka|Su\u0161ak]] and [[Belgrade]]. A train from Berlin to [[Istanbul]] crossed the Polish territory. Warsaw, Cracow and Lw\u00f3w had trains to [[Vienna]].\n\nWarsaw was connected with [[Prague]], [[Bratislava]] and [[\u017dilina]]. Lw\u00f3w and Gdynia  were also connected with Prague. [[Budapest]] had train connections with Warsaw, Cracow and Lw\u00f3w (the train from Cracow to Budapest had a coach from Krynica to Budapest attached).\n\n[[Romania]] was served twice daily by  Warsaw-Lw\u00f3w-[[Bucharest]] trains (in the summer an additional train reached the Romanian seaport of [[Constan\u0163a]]). Poland was also crossed by an international train Berlin&nbsp;\u2013 Breslau&nbsp;\u2013 Katowice&nbsp;\u2013 Krak\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 [[Sniatyn]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Bucharest]] (with a direct car Katowice&nbsp;\u2013 [[Constan\u0163a]]). Other transit trains ran between Berlin and  [[East Prussia]], [[Danzig]], [[Riga]] and [[Daugavpils]].\n\nTwice a day a train from Wilno reached [[Kaunas]]. One of them  had a direct Warsaw-Kaunas coach.\n\nPassenger rail connections between the Soviet Union and Western Europe required a change of trains due to the difference in gauge. If one traveled towards Moscow, it was necessary to change at the Soviet border station Niegoreloje. Travelling from Moscow, the change took place at the Polish station [[Stolpce]].\n\nAltogether there were 48 rail border crossings in operation in the summer of 1939.\n\n==Curiosities==\n* Rail lines of Wolne Miasto Gda\u0144sk ([[Free City of Danzig]]) were controlled by the Toru\u0144 region of the [[Polish State Railways]], therefore were included in the Polish timetable.\n* In the summer of 1939,  three pairs of German transit trains crossed the [[Polish Corridor]] daily en route to [[East Prussia]]: two  between Berlin and Eydtkau  (now [[Chernyshevskoye]]) and one between Berlin  and [[Tilsit]] (now Sovetsk). They travelled through the  Polish territory between [[Chojnice]] and  [[Tczew]]-Liessau (Lisewo), the distance of 97&nbsp;km.\n* Apart from long-distance fast trains, there were also ordinary and accelerated trains, that ran on very long routes in interwar Poland. The best example is the  train [[Wejherowo]]&nbsp;\u2013 Toru\u0144&nbsp;\u2013 Kutno&nbsp;\u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska&nbsp;\u2013 Rozwad\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w, which  crossed virtually the whole Poland, from southeast to the coast (930&nbsp;km). Other interesting examples are: Warszawa Wilenska&nbsp;\u2013 Brzesc n/B Centralny&nbsp;\u2013 [[Pinsk]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Mikashevichy|Mikaszewicze]] (490&nbsp;km), Warszawa Wilenska&nbsp;\u2013 [[Siedlce]]&nbsp;\u2013 Wolkowysk&nbsp;\u2013 Lida&nbsp;\u2013 Molodeczno (530&nbsp;km), Warszawa Glowna&nbsp;\u2013 Lublin&nbsp;\u2013 Kowel&nbsp;\u2013 Zdolbunow (480&nbsp;km), Warsaw Gdanska&nbsp;\u2013 Lublin&nbsp;\u2013 Rejowiec&nbsp;\u2013 [[Zawada, Zamo\u015b\u0107 County|Zawada]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rawa Ruska]]&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w (438&nbsp;km).\n\n==See also==\n* Timetable of Polish Railways and LOT Polish Airlines [http://bibliotekacyfrowa.eu/dlibra/docmetadata?id=2988 in 1947(in English and French also), online]\n* Timetable of Polish Railways&nbsp;\u2013 [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=33342  oriented for Greater Poland from 17 may 1938 as appendix to Kurier Pozna\u0144ski]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Urz\u0119dowy rozk\u0142ad jazdy i lot\u00f3w Lato 1939.

Works on it had already started in early 1939, but were never finished.\n\n[[Electrification]] of long distance lines was planned, but by 1939 only some of the suburban stretches around Warsaw were upgraded with the electric infrastructure.\n\n==Polish national railway's structure in 1939==\nIn the summer of 1939, the PKP was divided into eight regions&nbsp;\u2013 Warsaw, [[Toru\u0144]], Pozna\u0144, [[Katowice]], Cracow, Radom, Lw\u00f3w and Wilno, with PKP's headquarters located in Warsaw. Also, for practical purposes, PKP was divided into five communications districts and every train in the timetable was numbered according to the district within which it operated. The districts were as follows:\n\n\u2013 First&nbsp;\u2013 North-West, starting with the 278&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 [[M\u0142awa]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Grudzi\u0105dz]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Laskowice Pomorskie]] (timetable route number 101),\n\n\u2013 Second&nbsp;\u2013 West, starting with the 379&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 [[Kutno]]&nbsp;\u2013 Pozna\u0144&nbsp;\u2013 [[Zb\u0105szy\u0144]] (timetable route number 201),\n\n\u2013 Third&nbsp;\u2013 South-West, starting with the 318&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 [[Koluszki]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Z\u0105bkowice]]&nbsp;\u2013 Katowice (timetable route number 301),\n\n\u2013 Fourth&nbsp;\u2013 South-East,  starting with the 491&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 [[Radom]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Skar\u017cysko-Kamienna|Skar\u017cysko]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rozwad\u00f3w]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Przemy\u015bl]]&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w (timetable route number 401),\n\n\u2013 Fifth&nbsp;\u2013 North-East, starting with the 571&nbsp;km route Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 Bia\u0142ystok&nbsp;\u2013 Wilno&nbsp;\u2013 [[Turmont]] (timetable route number 501).\n\n[[Image:Pocztowkapkp.jpg|thumb|Polish station on postcard, 1930s]]\n\n==The summer 1939 timetable==\n\"Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w Lato 1939\" (\"Official Train and Flight Timetable Summer 1939\") was published in May 1939 and was valid from May 15, 1939 to October 7, 1939. What adds to this document's importance is the time it was published: just a few months before the Polish Second Republic (Druga Rzeczpospolita) ceased to exist. In the document we can find the following:\n\n:''The following timetable is valid until October 7. On midnight of October 8, a new Winter timetable will be introduced, valid until May 18, 1940. All suggestions for necessary changes in the Winter timetable should be presented to the Polish National Railways Regional Directions not later than August 1.''\n\nApart from the train timetable, the document also included the flight timetable of [[LOT Polish Airlines]].\n\n==Types of trains in 1939==\nThe following types of trains were run in Poland at that time: express, fast, and ordinary. The most interesting and impressive were the diesel express trains, or \"Pociagi Motorowe-Ekspresowe&nbsp;\u2013 MtE\" (some of them operated with the famous [[Luxtorpeda]]). The MtE units achieved speeds up to 110&nbsp;km/h and connected Warsaw with the most important cities, as well as major tourist areas. The 179&nbsp;km journey from Warszawa Wschodnia (Warsaw East) to Bia\u0142ystok Centralny was covered in 1 hour 56 minutes.\n\nMtE trains ran from Warsaw to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (a distance of 133&nbsp;km in 1 hour 28 minutes), Krak\u00f3w, Katowice (through either [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] or Kielce), and [[Suwa\u0142ki]]. They also operated on lines from Krak\u00f3w to Katowice and the mountain resorts of [[Zakopane]] and [[Krynica-Zdr\u00f3j|Krynica]]. In southeastern Poland, MtE trains ran from Lw\u00f3w to [[Zaleszczyki]], [[Boryslav|Boryslaw]], Tarnopol, and Kolomyja. In August 1939 a new MtE connected Warsaw with Pozna\u0144 (due to the war the service lasted only few days).\n\nWarsaw lacked an MtE connection with Lw\u00f3w (the third largest city in 1939 Poland). This problem was solved by taking the morning express to Krak\u00f3w where it split at Skarzysko, with one part becoming an express to [[Przeworsk]]. There passengers could also change to an international fast train travelling between Berlin and Bucharest.\n\nFast trains served long distance lines, but they were not quite as fast as the MtE trains. The most interesting fast trains in the summer 1939 were:\n\n* Wilno&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w (a journey of 720&nbsp;km.) It crossed practically the whole Polish Eastern Borderlands, stopping at Lida, Baranowicze, Luniniec, Rowne, and Zdolbunow.\n* Lw\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 Krak\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 Katowice&nbsp;\u2013 Pozna\u0144&nbsp;\u2013 [[Bydgoszcz]]&nbsp;\u2013 Gdynia&nbsp;\u2013 [[Hel, Poland|Hel]] (a journey of almost 1000&nbsp;km). It traveled non-stop through the territory of the [[Free City of Danzig]].\n\nThe last train category in Poland were ordinary trains. They usually served short distance lines, but in some cases covered impressive distances, especially in the Polish Eastern Borderlands.\n\n==International trains==\nIn 1939, trains tended to run over longer distances than today. The Nord Express Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 Berlin&nbsp;\u2013 Paris&nbsp;\u2013 [[Calais]] ran daily and it was the only train in Poland of the L (Luxurious) standard. This train consisted only of coaches owned by the [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]]. There also was another train to the English Channel coast: from Warsaw, Lw\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w and Katowice to [[Ostend]]. Warsaw was also connected with the capital of France by a  Warsaw&nbsp;\u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a&nbsp;\u2013 Paris train. Another train to France ran from Warsaw to [[Strasbourg]], with cars to [[Geneva]] and [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]].\n\nAs for the south of Europe, trains ran from Warsaw to Rome, and in the summer also to three cities in [[Yugoslavia]]: [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Su\u0161ak, Rijeka|Su\u0161ak]] and [[Belgrade]]. A train from Berlin to [[Istanbul]] crossed the Polish territory. Warsaw, Cracow and Lw\u00f3w had trains to [[Vienna]].\n\nWarsaw was connected with [[Prague]], [[Bratislava]] and [[\u017dilina]]. Lw\u00f3w and Gdynia  were also connected with Prague. [[Budapest]] had train connections with Warsaw, Cracow and Lw\u00f3w (the train from Cracow to Budapest had a coach from Krynica to Budapest attached).\n\n[[Romania]] was served twice daily by  Warsaw-Lw\u00f3w-[[Bucharest]] trains (in the summer an additional train reached the Romanian seaport of [[Constan\u0163a]]). Poland was also crossed by an international train Berlin&nbsp;\u2013 Breslau&nbsp;\u2013 Katowice&nbsp;\u2013 Krak\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 [[Sniatyn]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Bucharest]] (with a direct car Katowice&nbsp;\u2013 [[Constan\u0163a]]). Other transit trains ran between Berlin and  [[East Prussia]], [[Danzig]], [[Riga]] and [[Daugavpils]].\n\nTwice a day a train from Wilno reached [[Kaunas]]. One of them  had a direct Warsaw-Kaunas coach.\n\nPassenger rail connections between the Soviet Union and Western Europe required a change of trains due to the difference in gauge. If one traveled towards Moscow, it was necessary to change at the Soviet border station Niegoreloje. Travelling from Moscow, the change took place at the Polish station [[Stolpce]].\n\nAltogether there were 48 rail border crossings in operation in the summer of 1939.\n\n==Curiosities==\n* Rail lines of Wolne Miasto Gda\u0144sk ([[Free City of Danzig]]) were controlled by the Toru\u0144 region of the [[Polish State Railways]], therefore were included in the Polish timetable.\n* In the summer of 1939,  three pairs of German transit trains crossed the [[Polish Corridor]] daily en route to [[East Prussia]]: two  between Berlin and Eydtkau  (now [[Chernyshevskoye]]) and one between Berlin  and [[Tilsit]] (now Sovetsk). They travelled through the  Polish territory between [[Chojnice]] and  [[Tczew]]-Liessau (Lisewo), the distance of 97&nbsp;km.\n* Apart from long-distance fast trains, there were also ordinary and accelerated trains, that ran on very long routes in interwar Poland. The best example is the  train [[Wejherowo]]&nbsp;\u2013 Toru\u0144&nbsp;\u2013 Kutno&nbsp;\u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska&nbsp;\u2013 Rozwad\u00f3w&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w, which  crossed virtually the whole Poland, from southeast to the coast (930&nbsp;km). Other interesting examples are: Warszawa Wilenska&nbsp;\u2013 Brzesc n/B Centralny&nbsp;\u2013 [[Pinsk]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Mikashevichy|Mikaszewicze]] (490&nbsp;km), Warszawa Wilenska&nbsp;\u2013 [[Siedlce]]&nbsp;\u2013 Wolkowysk&nbsp;\u2013 Lida&nbsp;\u2013 Molodeczno (530&nbsp;km), Warszawa Glowna&nbsp;\u2013 Lublin&nbsp;\u2013 Kowel&nbsp;\u2013 Zdolbunow (480&nbsp;km), Warsaw Gdanska&nbsp;\u2013 Lublin&nbsp;\u2013 Rejowiec&nbsp;\u2013 [[Zawada, Zamo\u015b\u0107 County|Zawada]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rawa Ruska]]&nbsp;\u2013 Lw\u00f3w (438&nbsp;km).\n\n==See also==\n* Timetable of Polish Railways and LOT Polish Airlines [http://bibliotekacyfrowa.eu/dlibra/docmetadata?id=2988 in 1947(in English and French also), online]\n* Timetable of Polish Railways&nbsp;\u2013 [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=33342  oriented for Greater Poland from 17 may 1938 as appendix to Kurier Pozna\u0144ski]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Urz\u0119dowy rozk\u0142ad jazdy i lot\u00f3w Lato 1939.
