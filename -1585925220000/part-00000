It is the third entry in the ''Houkai'' series and [[spiritual successor]] to ''Houkai Gakuen'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fangcun.gg.en.aisa&hl=en_US|title=Guns Girl - Honkai Gakuen - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> using many characters from the previous title in a separate story. The game is notable for incorporating a variety of genres from [[hack and slash]] and [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] to elements of [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], [[shoot 'em up]] and [[dungeon crawl]]ing across multiple single and multiplayer modes.\n\nIn addition to the mobile game, the storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' has players control a team of up to three characters, known as \"Valkyries\", in real-time combat against various enemies. During battle, players may freely move their character around the battlefield and switch between their three deployed Valkyries to adapt to various enemy types. Each Valkyrie has unique attack, evasion, switch, and ultimate skills, as well as a [[rock-paper-scissors]]-based character type to fulfill different team roles. Valkyrie stats and skills can be customized with various weapons and equipment, which can be improved by using in-game resources. New equipment (known as \"Stigmata\"), weapons, and Valkyries can obtained either through in-game crafting or through a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSingle-player game modes include the \"Story\" campaign, consisting of short stages punctuated by dialogue in [[cutscene]]s and [[full motion video]]s (FMVs), \"Chronicles\", a series of brief side stories that explore Valkyries' backstories, and \"Open World\", allowing exploration of a large open-ended field to gather materials and complete various challenge tasks, coupled with its own storyline. The game features various multiplayer cooperative and competitive modes such as \"Co-Op Raid\", where players team up to unlock legendary weapons; \"Memorial Arena\", where players compete against a set of bosses for the highest score; and \"Dirac Sea\", where players attempt to progress as far as possible through a gauntlet of battles to compete for high scores. Players are able to join groups of other players, called \"Armadas\", which allow for more opportunities for events and rewards. Armadas allow for limited requesting of materials and resources from other players in the Armada.\n\nOutside of battles, ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' allows players to interact with the Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the \"Dorm\" mode. Upon completing character specific tasks, different characters may be able to move into the dorms, whereupon new character information and dialogues between those characters can be seen. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of the dorm rooms to increase the \"comfort\" of the Valkyries and Stigmata therein. Greater comfort levels allow players to level up their dorm limits for more elaborate decoration. Players are able to visit and view each other's decorated dorm layouts.\n\nSecondary gameplay mechanics include various [[minigame]]s incorporating [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[shoot 'em up]] elements that allow players to gather various crafting and experience materials. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles such as [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon crawling]] and [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] which are not normally seen in the main gameplay modes.\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \"Honkai\" (roughly translates to \"the collapse\"). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \"Herrschers\" to imbue with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity.  \n\nIn the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \"Schicksal\", a European-based peace keeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \"Anti-Entropy\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \"World Serpent\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. \n\nPrior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \"Impacts\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was sealed away by Schicksal under mysterious circumstances, and the Herrscher of Lightning who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St.Freya school.   \n\n=== Story ===\n{{plot|date=April 2020}}\nThe storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game's story starts with three Valkyries-in-training (Kiana Kaslana, Mei Raiden, and Bronya Zaychik) boarding the ''Selene'', a hostile flying battleship. The three take control of the battleship, then subdue Bronya when she is abruptly controlled malevolently. Following the successful mission, the girls take a graduation exam, during which a mysterious voice contacts Kiana and informs her of her lost parents, Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac.\n\nThe Valkyries then dispatch to Schicksal's Oceania Branch to recover the Gem of Desire following a local Honkai Eruption that decimated the area. The trio discovers Wendy, who was implanted with the Gem of Desire, and learn that Wendy triggered the Honkai Eruption due to a hatred of Schicksal, which had crippled Wendy. Bronya is controlled again and attacks, causing Wendy to transform into a Herrscher. Although Mei and Kiana are able to subdue both girls, Anti-Entropy forces appear and Bronya kidnaps Wendy and Mei. The Valkyries subsequently track Anti-Entropy to the hijacked ME Corp with Bronya's assistance. There, Bronya destroys the biochip in her brain to free herself from Cocolia's control and enable the Valkyries to escape, but leaving Wendy behind.\n\nSearching for a way to revive Bronya, Theresa Apocalypse creates a virtual datascape to find data on the biochip. Kiana is transported to a recreation of Siberia during the year 2000 in the midst of the 2nd Honkai War. Kiana meets virtual recreations of her parents, Siegfried and Cecilia, and while Siegfried is badly injured, Kiana and Cecilia team up and successfully defeat a recreation of 2nd Herrscher, Sirin. Upon Sirin's defeat, it is revealed that the events that Kiana experienced were a hallucination created from Kiana's desires by Sirin. Fu Hua captures Kiana and takes her to Schicksal HQ.\n\nTheresa, Mei, and Himeko ally with Anti-Entropy forces and storm Schicksal HQ to save Kiana, breaching its defenses with the ''Selene'' and the ''Hyperion''. While the Valkyries are successful in infiltrating Schicksal HQ, Rita Rossweisse and Fu Hua captures Himeko and Tesla. Otto Apocalypse successfully reawakens Sirin using Kiana's body as a host. Sirin dispatches Mei, Theresa, and the Anti-Entropy forces and engages Fu Hua in combat, stealing the 3rd Herrscher's power in the process. Himeko and Tesla, with Fu Hua's help, obtain a vial of anti-Honkai serum and a prototype Battlesuit imbued with a Herrscher's power. Himeko dons the Battlesuit and engages Sirin, fighting her to a standstill. Einstein uses the ''Selene''<nowiki/>'s cannon on Sirin, forcing her to retreat into \"Imaginary Space\" with Himeko being pulled in as well. Himeko duels with Sirin in the Imaginary Space and injects the anti-Honkai serum into Sirin, causing her to revert to Kiana. Suffering massive losses, the remaining Valkyries and Anti-Entropy retreat, and the world is left devastated in the wake of Sirin's attack. Himeko and Kiana both go missing.\n\nFour months after Sirin's attack, Mei, Theresa, and Bronya attempt to meet with an intel dealer named Gray Serpent in Arc City who claims to have seen the Herrscher of the Void, unaware that Otto Apocalypse had dispatched Rita to obtain his information as well. Rita seems to kill Gray Serpent and steals his cybernetic implants, leading the Valkyries to capture a cyborg girl called the Ningyo. Before they can extract the Ningyo's information, Rita intercepts the Valkyries, steals the data, and formats the Ningyo's memory. While Einstein and Tesla attempt to retrieve the Ningyo's lost memories, the team is contacted by Cocolia, who convinces them to help find the Gem of Desire. Gray Serpent, seeking payment for the Valkyrie's theft of the Ningyo, hacks into the ''Selene''. When Bronya follows Gray Serpent into virtual space, he traps Bronya in a data labyrinth formed from her memories to deter her. Bronya is able to escape, though she witnesses a record of the 1st Herrscher, Welt Young, and Einstein battling the World Serpent, who is sealed within the Sea of Quanta.\n\nBronya, Theresa, and Einstein travel to The Deep, where Bronya is reunited with Cocolia and childhood friends Rosalia and Liliya. Cocolia informs the trio that the Gem of Desire was lost in the Sea of Quanta, and must be retrieved. While Einstein prepares to enter the Eye of the Deep, a portal leading to the Sea of Quanta, Bronya attempts to reconcile with Cocolia. When Einstein discovers Cocolia scheming with Gray Serpent, Gray Serpent attacks Einstein and she vanishes. A swarm of Honkai emerges from the Eye of the Deep and attacks, leading Bronya to dive into the Sea of Quanta alone. In the Sea, Bronya is greeted by Joachim, a fragment of Welt Young. Joachim sends Bronya to multiple pocket universes as a test, during which Bronya is reunited with Seele Vollerei (Bronya's childhood friend who became stuck in quantum state following a failed X-10 Project years ago). In efforts to guide Seele out of the quanta, they resolve to escape together.\n\nAfter clearing some honkai beasts and being separated, Seele and Bronya reunite and try to escape the labyrinth. The two girls reach the edge of the Quanta but are caught by tentacles. Bronya makes a sacrifice and cuts the tentacles binding Seele, succumbing to the tentacles herself. However, Seele dislikes her powerlessness and the Dark Seele finally agreesto lend her power to Seele, and they use their combined power to rescue Bronya.\n\nBack to Kiana; after recapturing control of her body, she has been living in exile alone in the Arc City in order not to hurt others with the Herrscher personality. One night, she is fighting with Honkai beasts when Sirin seeks the opportunity to torment and brainwash Kiana, attempting to reawake the Herrscher. Fortunately, Fu Hua reaches Kiana's mind and drive Sirin away. Kiana holds hatred towards Fu Hua at first, but Fu Hua tells Kiana that their spirits are combined forever due to the power of Key of Deity, and that Kiana must learn to control the Herrscher power by herself. Under Fu Hua's training, Kiana finally succeeds, and returns to fighting against Honkai in Arc City.\n\n==Development==\nThe production team for ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' grew from a 7-person start to employing over 200 employees in 2018.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilibili.com/read/cv1141716/|title=\u5d29\u574f3\u4e0a\u7ebf\u4e24\u5e74 \u8001\u73a9\u5bb6\u4eec\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u96c6\u9526|last=\u6bcf\u65e5\u6e38\u620f\u83cc|website=www.bilibili.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> [[Mihoyo]] offers small amounts of in-game currency to users that fill out surveys about their experience in the game, allowing the game's [[Developer (software)|developers]] to adjust future events and tweak the game.

Armadas allow for limited requesting of materials and resources from other players in the Armada.\n\nOutside of battles, ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' allows players to interact with the Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the \"Dorm\" mode. Upon completing character specific tasks, different characters may be able to move into the dorms, whereupon new character information and dialogues between those characters can be seen. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of the dorm rooms to increase the \"comfort\" of the Valkyries and Stigmata therein. Greater comfort levels allow players to level up their dorm limits for more elaborate decoration. Players are able to visit and view each other's decorated dorm layouts.\n\nSecondary gameplay mechanics include various [[minigame]]s incorporating [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[shoot 'em up]] elements that allow players to gather various crafting and experience materials. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles such as [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon crawling]] and [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] which are not normally seen in the main gameplay modes.\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \"Honkai\" (roughly translates to \"the collapse\"). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \"Herrschers\" to imbue with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity.  \n\nIn the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \"Schicksal\", a European-based peace keeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \"Anti-Entropy\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \"World Serpent\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. \n\nPrior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \"Impacts\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was sealed away by Schicksal under mysterious circumstances, and the Herrscher of Lightning who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St.Freya school.   \n\n=== Story ===\n{{plot|date=April 2020}}\nThe storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game's story starts with three Valkyries-in-training (Kiana Kaslana, Mei Raiden, and Bronya Zaychik) boarding the ''Selene'', a hostile flying battleship. The three take control of the battleship, then subdue Bronya when she is abruptly controlled malevolently. Following the successful mission, the girls take a graduation exam, during which a mysterious voice contacts Kiana and informs her of her lost parents, Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac.\n\nThe Valkyries then dispatch to Schicksal's Oceania Branch to recover the Gem of Desire following a local Honkai Eruption that decimated the area. The trio discovers Wendy, who was implanted with the Gem of Desire, and learn that Wendy triggered the Honkai Eruption due to a hatred of Schicksal, which had crippled Wendy. Bronya is controlled again and attacks, causing Wendy to transform into a Herrscher. Although Mei and Kiana are able to subdue both girls, Anti-Entropy forces appear and Bronya kidnaps Wendy and Mei. The Valkyries subsequently track Anti-Entropy to the hijacked ME Corp with Bronya's assistance. There, Bronya destroys the biochip in her brain to free herself from Cocolia's control and enable the Valkyries to escape, but leaving Wendy behind.\n\nSearching for a way to revive Bronya, Theresa Apocalypse creates a virtual datascape to find data on the biochip. Kiana is transported to a recreation of Siberia during the year 2000 in the midst of the 2nd Honkai War. Kiana meets virtual recreations of her parents, Siegfried and Cecilia, and while Siegfried is badly injured, Kiana and Cecilia team up and successfully defeat a recreation of 2nd Herrscher, Sirin. Upon Sirin's defeat, it is revealed that the events that Kiana experienced were a hallucination created from Kiana's desires by Sirin. Fu Hua captures Kiana and takes her to Schicksal HQ.\n\nTheresa, Mei, and Himeko ally with Anti-Entropy forces and storm Schicksal HQ to save Kiana, breaching its defenses with the ''Selene'' and the ''Hyperion''. While the Valkyries are successful in infiltrating Schicksal HQ, Rita Rossweisse and Fu Hua captures Himeko and Tesla. Otto Apocalypse successfully reawakens Sirin using Kiana's body as a host. Sirin dispatches Mei, Theresa, and the Anti-Entropy forces and engages Fu Hua in combat, stealing the 3rd Herrscher's power in the process. Himeko and Tesla, with Fu Hua's help, obtain a vial of anti-Honkai serum and a prototype Battlesuit imbued with a Herrscher's power. Himeko dons the Battlesuit and engages Sirin, fighting her to a standstill. Einstein uses the ''Selene''<nowiki/>'s cannon on Sirin, forcing her to retreat into \"Imaginary Space\" with Himeko being pulled in as well. Himeko duels with Sirin in the Imaginary Space and injects the anti-Honkai serum into Sirin, causing her to revert to Kiana. Suffering massive losses, the remaining Valkyries and Anti-Entropy retreat, and the world is left devastated in the wake of Sirin's attack. Himeko and Kiana both go missing.\n\nFour months after Sirin's attack, Mei, Theresa, and Bronya attempt to meet with an intel dealer named Gray Serpent in Arc City who claims to have seen the Herrscher of the Void, unaware that Otto Apocalypse had dispatched Rita to obtain his information as well. Rita seems to kill Gray Serpent and steals his cybernetic implants, leading the Valkyries to capture a cyborg girl called the Ningyo. Before they can extract the Ningyo's information, Rita intercepts the Valkyries, steals the data, and formats the Ningyo's memory. While Einstein and Tesla attempt to retrieve the Ningyo's lost memories, the team is contacted by Cocolia, who convinces them to help find the Gem of Desire. Gray Serpent, seeking payment for the Valkyrie's theft of the Ningyo, hacks into the ''Selene''. When Bronya follows Gray Serpent into virtual space, he traps Bronya in a data labyrinth formed from her memories to deter her. Bronya is able to escape, though she witnesses a record of the 1st Herrscher, Welt Young, and Einstein battling the World Serpent, who is sealed within the Sea of Quanta.\n\nBronya, Theresa, and Einstein travel to The Deep, where Bronya is reunited with Cocolia and childhood friends Rosalia and Liliya. Cocolia informs the trio that the Gem of Desire was lost in the Sea of Quanta, and must be retrieved. While Einstein prepares to enter the Eye of the Deep, a portal leading to the Sea of Quanta, Bronya attempts to reconcile with Cocolia. When Einstein discovers Cocolia scheming with Gray Serpent, Gray Serpent attacks Einstein and she vanishes. A swarm of Honkai emerges from the Eye of the Deep and attacks, leading Bronya to dive into the Sea of Quanta alone. In the Sea, Bronya is greeted by Joachim, a fragment of Welt Young. Joachim sends Bronya to multiple pocket universes as a test, during which Bronya is reunited with Seele Vollerei (Bronya's childhood friend who became stuck in quantum state following a failed X-10 Project years ago). In efforts to guide Seele out of the quanta, they resolve to escape together.\n\nAfter clearing some honkai beasts and being separated, Seele and Bronya reunite and try to escape the labyrinth.The two girls reach the edge of the Quanta but are caught by tentacles. Bronya makes a sacrifice and cuts the tentacles binding Seele, succumbing to the tentacles herself. However, Seele dislikes her powerlessness and the Dark Seele finally agreesto lend her power to Seele, and they use their combined power to rescue Bronya.\n\nBack to Kiana; after recapturing control of her body, she has been living in exile alone in the Arc City in order not to hurt others with the Herrscher personality. One night, she is fighting with Honkai beasts when Sirin seeks the opportunity to torment and brainwash Kiana, attempting to reawake the Herrscher. Fortunately, Fu Hua reaches Kiana's mind and drive Sirin away. Kiana holds hatred towards Fu Hua at first, but Fu Hua tells Kiana that their spirits are combined forever due to the power of Key of Deity, and that Kiana must learn to control the Herrscher power by herself. Under Fu Hua's training, Kiana finally succeeds, and returns to fighting against Honkai in Arc City.\n\n==Development==\nThe production team for ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' grew from a 7-person start to employing over 200 employees in 2018.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilibili.com/read/cv1141716/|title=\u5d29\u574f3\u4e0a\u7ebf\u4e24\u5e74 \u8001\u73a9\u5bb6\u4eec\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u96c6\u9526|last=\u6bcf\u65e5\u6e38\u620f\u83cc|website=www.bilibili.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> [[Mihoyo]] offers small amounts of in-game currency to users that fill out surveys about their experience in the game, allowing the game's [[Developer (software)|developers]] to adjust future events and tweak the game.

At the age of only three years the first turns on skis were carved into the snow. The local ski club (SV Tr\u00f6polach in the Nassfeld skiing area) and his family helped to develop a solid skiing technique as well as a passion for the sport early on. The first racing experiences were gained at the age of five when Markus began to compete in local skiing cups against non-disabled age-peers. Even though these first races were not overly successful, the motivation to pursue a professional career as a skier did not wane. First contacts to the field of professional disabled sports were made during the winter of 2000.

At the age of only three years the first turns on skis were carved into the snow. The local ski club (SV Tr\u00f6polach in the Nassfeld skiing area) and his family helped to develop a solid skiing technique as well as a passion for the sport early on. The first racing experiences were gained at the age of five when Markus began to compete in local skiing cups against non-disabled age-peers. Even though these first races were not overly successful, the motivation to pursue a professional career as a skier did not wane. First contacts to the field of professional disabled sports were made during the winter of 2000. Since the 2003 / 2004 winter season Markus has been an active athlete member of various teams of the Austrian Skiing Federation (\u00d6SV). In addition to Markus\u2019 personal ambition and self-motivation, the Sports-High School (SSLK Klagenfurt) needs to be credited with a big share in the development of the young athlete\u2019s personal and athletic skills, from first semi-professional training programs to the acceptance into Austria\u2019s National Skiing Team.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IPC athlete|910538}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Salcher, Markus}}\n[[Category:1991 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Austrian male alpine skiers]]\n[[Category:Alpine skiers at the 2014 Winter Paralympics]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 2014 Winter Paralympics]]\n[[Category:Paralympic gold medalists for Austria]]\n[[Category:Paralympic bronze medalists for Austria]]\n[[Category:Paralympic alpine skiers of Austria]]\n\n\n{{Austria-alpine-skiing-bio-stub}}\n{{Austria-Paralympic-medalist-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Zyxw", "label": "safe", "comment": "update IPC external link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Salcher"}
