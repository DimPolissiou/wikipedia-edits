The Hungarian metal band [[SZEG]] contributed to the soundtrack. The game combines elements of [[rallycross]] with those of [[tuning]]. It was relaunched on September 18, 2018 as '''''Cross Racing Championship Extreme''''' in the [[Steam]] store.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game does not have a fixed plot: it is much more a combination of a race, a race with time, a unique race and a multiplayer mode typical of racing games. In addition, ''CRC 2005'' also has a mode called \"Free Ride\", which allows you to freely explore locations without limiting yourself to previously defined routes. Then the player can get to places that are not accessible in normal races.\n\nThe game has two different multiplayer modes. Firstly, the online multiplayer available on the market and the LAN multiplayer, which allows a certain number of players to play together on their own computers via the Internet. The servers have now been shut down. However, it is still possible to play over the Internet through [[Local Area Network|LAN]] or a virtual LAN. A special feature is the \"hot seat\": here several players take turns on a computer and try to achieve the best time on a previously selected track. Consequently, this mode can also be used offline.\n\nCareer mode is the heart of the game, and before the new vehicles, routes, and parts are available to the player in the other modes, you must first unlock them there. You can choose from a large quantity of paint and your own starting number. The player starts with classic series vehicles in standard equipment on muddy tracks, then progresses through snow and road races to finally compete in a real, asphalt [[racing circuit]]. In each race, the player has to compete against up to eight computer opponents. As their careers progress, they get better control of their vehicles and can also be hostile or fearful of the player. This can lead to situations where one driver does not defend against overtaking while the other defends and even deliberately hits the player. AI opponents always have the same start number and livery, making them distinguishable from a distance.\n\nThe game also has great destruction and physics mechanics. For example, depending on the severity of the impact, dents of different sizes are displayed on the vehicle. The bumpers can fall off and even the entire body can be deformed. It is also possible to start tires and damage them. The vehicle can be repaired at the push of a button after too much damage - the player returns to the race without wasting much time. However, this feature can also be disabled, forcing you to drive more carefully, especially in multiplayer.\n\n== Vehicles ==\nThe game has a total of eight vehicles, which are inspired by real cars, but have fancy names for licensing reasons. There are also some deviations in the body.\n\nA list of vehicles with the names given in the game and the original model:\n\n* ''Quadro AD'' ([[Audi quattro]])\n* ''Corus'' ([[Ford Focus]])\n* ''Pickup'' ([[Ford Ranger]])\n* ''Scheforn'' (Phantasiefahrzeug)\n* ''C-Racer 4x4'' ([[Suzuki Vitara]])\n* ''T8 Classic'' ([[Donkervoort D8 GTO]])\n* ''Revo GT'' ([[BMW E36]])\n* ''Buggy'' ([[VW-Buggy]])\n\nAlso, there are many [[mods]] mainly from Eastern Europe that add more vehicles to the game.\n\nAn important aspect of the game is [[tuning]]. If the player starts with vehicles from the series without changes, he can improve them by unlocking parts during the game and significantly increasing the overall performance. Adjustments can be made to the [[engine]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], [[brake]], [[suspension]], [[differential]] and [[all-wheel drive]] for vehicles that are They are actually only delivered with front-wheel drive, as well as in the [[body]]. You can also choose from a range of different paint finishes. The player must also choose the most suitable tire compound: he can choose from a total of six sets for different surfaces. The wrong choice of tires can make driving extremely difficult or even impossible.\n\n== Tracks ==\nThe game has a total of six different locations. Depending on the race, these are staked differently with [[railings]] to form a route. So the player often drives in the same place during his career, but always on slightly different routes. All locations are imaginative, but each contains elements typical of the country in which they are supposed to be located.\n\nRaces in [[United Kingdom]] take place on public but closed roads and dirt roads through a forest. There is an autumnal atmosphere. [[France]] offers summer races on [[Serpentine]] and short gravel roads. In races [[United States]] take place on the beach, clearly reminiscent of the [[California]] s atmosphere. Winter runs through snowy forests and frozen lakes offer [[Finland]]. In [[Germany]] distance races are run on a comprehensive course, which is based on [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and [[Hockenheimring]]. Typical races [[Rallycross]], on the other hand, take place on a route consisting of [[Concrete]], [[Mud]] and [[Earth]] in [[Hungary]].\n\n== Extra ==\nThe player may copy your own music as [[MP3]] files in the game folder. These can be selected and played in-game. This is also possible during a race or while driving. A demo version limited to two races was included on many compilation CDs in Europe.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game was rated as good, but was not widely known. [[Metacritic]] awarded 77 out of 100 possible points.<ref>http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/cross-racing-championship-2005</ref> CRC 2005 also received good to very good reviews from the players themselves.<ref>https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/925177-cross-racing-championship-2005</ref><ref>https://www.gamespot.com/cross-racing-championship-2005/cheats/</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.crc-game.com/index.php?page=sys_req System requirements]\n* [http://www.crc-game.com/index.php?page=features Game features]\n\n[[Category:2005 video games]]\n[[Category:Racing video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n", "text_old": "{{dablinks|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title          = Cross Racing Championship 2005\n| collapsible    = \n| state          = \n| image          =\n| caption        = \n| developer      = [[Invictus Games (company)|Invictus Games]]\n| publisher      = [[Invictus Games (company)|Invictus Games]] <br> [[Take 2 Interactive]]\n| engine         = \n| released       = \n*October 4, 2005\n*September 18, 2018\n| genre          = [[Racing video game|Racing]]\n| modes          = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]\n| platforms      = [[Microsoft Windows]]\n}}\n\n'''''Cross Racing Championship 2005''''' ('''''CRC 2005''''') is a [[racing video game]] developed by [[Invictus Games (company)|Invictus Games]] and released on October 4, 2005 for [[Microsoft Windows]].

In addition, ''CRC 2005'' also has a mode called \"Free Ride\", which allows you to freely explore locations without limiting yourself to previously defined routes. Then the player can get to places that are not accessible in normal races.\n\nThe game has two different multiplayer modes. Firstly, the online multiplayer available on the market and the LAN multiplayer, which allows a certain number of players to play together on their own computers via the Internet. The servers have now been shut down. However, it is still possible to play over the Internet through [[Local Area Network|LAN]] or a virtual LAN. A special feature is the \"hot seat\": here several players take turns on a computer and try to achieve the best time on a previously selected track. Consequently, this mode can also be used offline.\n\nCareer mode is the heart of the game, and before the new vehicles, routes, and parts are available to the player in the other modes, you must first unlock them there. You can choose from a large quantity of paint and your own starting number. The player starts with classic series vehicles in standard equipment on muddy tracks, then progresses through snow and road races to finally compete in a real, asphalt [[racing circuit]]. In each race, the player has to compete against up to eight computer opponents. As their careers progress, they get better control of their vehicles and can also be hostile or fearful of the player. This can lead to situations where one driver does not defend against overtaking while the other defends and even deliberately hits the player. AI opponents always have the same start number and livery, making them distinguishable from a distance.\n\nThe game also has great destruction and physics mechanics. For example, depending on the severity of the impact, dents of different sizes are displayed on the vehicle. The bumpers can fall off and even the entire body can be deformed. It is also possible to start tires and damage them. The vehicle can be repaired at the push of a button after too much damage - the player returns to the race without wasting much time. However, this feature can also be disabled, forcing you to drive more carefully, especially in multiplayer.\n\n== Vehicles ==\nThe game has a total of eight vehicles, which are inspired by real cars, but have fancy names for licensing reasons. There are also some deviations in the body.\n\nA list of vehicles with the names given in the game and the original model:\n\n* ''Quadro AD'' ([[Audi quattro]])\n* ''Corus'' ([[Ford Focus]])\n* ''Pickup'' ([[Ford Ranger]])\n* ''Scheforn'' (Phantasiefahrzeug)\n* ''C-Racer 4x4'' ([[Suzuki Vitara]])\n* ''T8 Classic'' ([[Donkervoort D8 GTO]])\n* ''Revo GT'' ([[BMW E36]])\n* ''Buggy'' ([[VW-Buggy]])\n\nAlso, there are many [[mods]] mainly from Eastern Europe that add more vehicles to the game.\n\nAn important aspect of the game is [[tuning]]. If the player starts with vehicles from the series without changes, he can improve them by unlocking parts during the game and significantly increasing the overall performance. Adjustments can be made to the [[engine]], [[transmission]], [[brake]], [[suspension]], [[differential]] and [[all-wheel drive]] for vehicles that are They are actually only delivered with front-wheel drive, as well as in the [[body]]. You can also choose from a range of different paint finishes. The player must also choose the most suitable tire compound: he can choose from a total of six sets for different surfaces. The wrong choice of tires can make driving extremely difficult or even impossible.\n\n== Tracks ==\nThe game has a total of six different locations. Depending on the race, these are staked differently with [[railings]] to form a route. So the player often drives in the same place during his career, but always on slightly different routes. All locations are imaginative, but each contains elements typical of the country in which they are supposed to be located.\n\nRaces in [[United Kingdom]] take place on public but closed roads and dirt roads through a forest. There is an autumnal atmosphere. [[France]] offers summer races on [[Serpentine]] and short gravel roads. In races [[United States]] take place on the beach, clearly reminiscent of the [[California]] s atmosphere. Winter runs through snowy forests and frozen lakes offer [[Finland]]. In [[Germany]] distance races are run on a comprehensive course, which is based on [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and [[Hockenheimring]]. Typical races [[Rallycross]], on the other hand, take place on a route consisting of [[Concrete]], [[Mud]] and [[Earth]] in [[Hungary]].\n\n== Extra ==\nThe player may copy your own music as [[MP3]] files in the game folder. These can be selected and played in-game. This is also possible during a race or while driving. A demo version limited to two races was included on many compilation CDs in Europe.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game was rated as good, but was not widely known. [[Metacritic]] awarded 77 out of 100 possible points.<ref>http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/cross-racing-championship-2005</ref> CRC 2005 also received good to very good reviews from the players themselves.<ref>https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/925177-cross-racing-championship-2005</ref><ref>https://www.gamespot.com/cross-racing-championship-2005/cheats/</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.crc-game.com/index.php?page=sys_req System requirements]\n* [http://www.crc-game.com/index.php?page=features Game features]\n\n[[Category:2005 video games]]\n[[Category:Racing video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toTransmission(link changed toTransmission (mechanics)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Racing_Championship_2005"}
