Sixteen teams competed for the [[J J Giltinan Shield]] during the season which culminated in a [[grand final]] for the [[Winfield Cup]] between the [[Brisbane Broncos]], making their grand final debut, and the [[St. George Dragons]].<ref>[http://www.rleague.com//db/year/1992/j_j_giltinan_shield_and_winfield_cup/index.php 1992 J J Giltinan Shield and Winfield Cup] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603000000/http://www.rleague.com/ |date=3 June 2012 }} at ''rleague.com''</ref>\n\n==Season summary==\nThe [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]] also took place during the season. Having decided in May that a team from Auckland would join the premiership in 1995, the NSWRL announced in November that three more new clubs \u2014 from Townsville, Perth and a second team from Brisbane \u2014 will also be invited.\n\nTwenty-two regular season rounds were played from March till August, resulting in a top five of Brisbane, St. George, Illawarra, Newcastle and Wests, who battled it out in the finals. The 3rd-place finish for the Illawarra Steelers would be the best season they ever had in its time as a standalone club.\n\nThe 1992 season's [[Rothmans Medal]]list was the Brisbane Broncos' halfback and captain, [[Allan Langer]]. The [[Dally M Award]] went to Eastern Suburbs' halfback, [[Gary Freeman (rugby league)|Gary Freeman]], while Western Suburbs forward [[Paul Langmack]] was named ''[[Rugby League Week]]'s'' player of the year.\n\nThe 1992 season also saw the retirement from the League of future [[Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Wally Lewis]].\n\n===Teams===\nThe lineup of teams remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive season, with sixteen clubs contesting the 1992 premiership, including five [[Sydney]]-based foundation teams, another six from Sydney, two from elsewhere in [[New South Wales]], two from [[Queensland]], and one from the [[Australian Capital Territory]].\n{| align=\"center\" class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-valign: center;\" cellpadding=3

\"[[The Best (song)|The Best]]\" since its 1989 release, due partially to its use and association with the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]], [[Tina Turner]] went into a Los Angeles recording studio in early 1992 with [[Jimmy Barnes]] to record a duet version specifically for Australian release.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Creswell, Toby and Trenoweth \n  | first = Samantha\n  | authorlink

complementary vocal styles of Turner and Barnes and also features Barnes' brother-in-law [[Johnny Diesel]] on guitar.\n\nA simple black-and-white film clip shot around the recording sessions was produced and the track was released and renamed \"Simply the Best\" to coincide with the 1992 NSWRL season. That year the track peaked at #13 on the Australian charts.\n\nIn 1992 and 1993 the League and its advertising agency Hertz Walpole would use the new duet performance of the song in the season launch ads. Excerpts from the black-and-white film clip start the 1992 ad with firstly Tina and then Barnes in wistful solo shots before coming together and displaying a camaraderie that's intended to capture the good times they appear to have had in recording the track. Diesel also appears in the black-and-white footage before the ad bursts into colour with the standard fare of big hits and previous season action.\n\n===Ladder===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=20 abbr=\"Position\u00d7\" |\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points for\" |PF\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points against\" |PA\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points difference\" |PD\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|1||style=\"text-align:left;\"| '''[[File:Brisbane colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Brisbane Broncos]] (P)'''\n|22||18||0||4||506||311||+195||'''36'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|2||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|22||15||0||7||401||283||+118||'''30'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|3||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Illawarra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n|22||13||1||8||318||259||+59||'''27'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|4||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Newcastle colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Newcastle Knights]]\n|22||12||2||8||363||267||+96||'''26'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|5||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Western Suburbs colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]\n|22||12||1||9||356||327||+29||'''25'''\n|- \n|6||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Eastern Suburbs colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs Roosters]]\n|22||12||0||10||392||319||+73||'''24'''\n|- \n|7||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Canterbury colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]]\n|22||10||2||10||423||417||+6||'''22'''\n|- \n|8||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Manly Sea Eagles colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]]\n|22||10||2||10||334||335||-1||'''22'''\n|- \n|9||style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{leagueicon|Penrith|size=16}} [[Penrith Panthers]]\n|22||11||0||11||274||309||-35||'''22'''\n|- \n|10||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Balmain colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Balmain Tigers]]\n|22||10||1||11||402||398||+4||'''21'''\n|-\n|11||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:North Sydney colours.svg|16x16px]] [[North Sydney Bears]]\n|22||10||1||11||376||381||-5||'''21'''\n|-\n|12||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Canberra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Canberra Raiders]]\n|22||10||0||12||435||409||+26||'''20'''\n|-\n|13||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Cronulla colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]]\n|22||8||0||14||284||395||-111||'''16'''\n|-\n|14||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:South Sydney colours.svg|16x16px]] [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]]\n|22||7||0||15||429||533||-104||'''14'''\n|-\n|15||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Parramatta colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Parramatta Eels]]\n|22||6||1||15||276||491||-215||'''13'''\n|-\n|16||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Gold Coast Chargers colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Gold Coast Seagulls]]\n|22||6||1||15||288||423||-135||'''11'''\n|-\n|}\n*Gold Coast Seagulls were docked 2 points due to exceeding the replacement limit in one game.\n\n==Finals==\nA great advertisement for the expansion of the game was the appearance of three non-Sydney teams in the final five - [[Brisbane]], [[Illawarra]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. The \"steel-city-cousins\", Illawarra and Newcastle, both won their first semi finals from their first attempt, Illawarra defeating St George and Newcastle downing Wests.\n\nAn all non-Sydney grand final was a real possibility, with Illawarra and St George meeting a second time in the preliminary final with Brisbane waiting to play the winner in the grand final.\n\nThe Dragons played two of the lowest scoring matches in finals history as they beat the Newcastle Knights 3-2 in the semi final and the Illawarra Steelers 4-0 in the preliminary final.\n\nThe preliminary final saw four disallowed tries with Saints denied once in the first half and Illawarra three times in the second half. Illawarra looked as though they were going to finish on top and began opening up the St George defence, only to be denied twice by referee Greg McCallum for forward passes. A late attacking movement from the Steelers saw winger [[Alan McIndoe]] excitedly appeal for a try off a [[John Simon (rugby league)|John Simon]] grubber kick but was denied by the in-goal touch judge. St George had held on to win 4-0 and ensure a Sydney club appeared in the grand final once again (this Sydney representation in grand finals would be maintained until 2006).\n\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=100% \n|- bgcolor=#C1D8FF \n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Home\n!rowspan=2 width=6%|Score\n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Away\n!colspan=6|Match Information\n|- bgcolor=#EFEFEF \n!width=17%|Date and Time\n!width=17%|Venue\n!width=11%|Referee\n!width=7%|Crowd\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Qualifying Finals'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|16\u201318\n|align=left | [[File:Illawarra colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n|5 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Graeme Annesley\n|28,521\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:Newcastle colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Newcastle Knights]]\n|21\u20132\n|align=left | [[File:Western Suburbs colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]\n|6 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|28,571\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Semi Finals'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|3\u20132\n|align=left | [[File:Newcastle colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Newcastle Knights]]\n|12 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Graeme Annesley\n|38,772\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:Brisbane colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Brisbane Broncos]]\n|22\u201312\n|align=left | [[File:Illawarra colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n|13 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|38,859\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Preliminary Final'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | [[File:Illawarra colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n|0\u20134\n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|20 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|38,928\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Grand Final'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | [[File:Brisbane colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Brisbane Broncos]]\n|28-8\n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|27 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|41,560\n|}\n\n===Chart===\n{{5McIntyre | RD1= '''Qualifying/Elimination Final'''\n| RD2= '''Major/Minor Semi Final'''\n| RD3= '''Preliminary Final'''\n| RD4= '''Grand Final'''\n\n| RD1-seed1=2\n| RD1-team1=[[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n| RD1-score1=16\n| RD1-seed2=3\n| RD1-team2=[[File:Illawarra colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[Illawarra Steelers]]'''\n| RD1-score2='''18'''\n\n| RD1-seed3=4\n| RD1-team3=[[File:Newcastle colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[Newcastle Knights]]'''\n| RD1-score3='''21'''\n| RD1-seed4=5\n| RD1-team4=[[File:Western Suburbs colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]\n| RD1-score4=2\n\n| RD2-seed1=1\n| RD2-team1=[[File:Brisbane colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[Brisbane Broncos]]'''\n| RD2-score1='''22'''\n| RD2-seed2=\n| RD2-team2=[[File:Illawarra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n| RD2-score2=12\n\n| RD2-seed3=\n| RD2-team3=[[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[St. George Dragons]]'''\n| RD2-score3='''3'''\n| RD2-seed4=\n| RD2-team4=[[File:Newcastle colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Newcastle Knights]]\n| RD2-score4=2\n\n| RD3-seed1=\n| RD3-team1=[[File:Illawarra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n| RD3-score1=0\n| RD3-seed2=\n| RD3-team2=[[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[St. George Dragons]]'''\n| RD3-score2='''4'''\n\n| RD4-seed1=\n| RD4-team1=[[File:Brisbane colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[Brisbane Broncos]]'''\n| RD4-score1='''28'''\n| RD4-seed2=\n| RD4-team2=[[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n| RD4-score2=8\n}}\n\n===Grand Final===\n\nIn their fifth year of competition, Brisbane finally put together the right combination to reach the grand final.

Both sides then came close to scoring from kicks but no further points were posted before half-time.\n\nIn the second half the Broncos ran away with the game. About ten minutes in and after winning a scrum close to the Dragons try-line, Langer scurried through the defence from dummy-half and reached out to put the ball down. Terry Matterson kicked the extras and Brisbane's lead was now 12-4. A few minutes later they scored again when, about thirty metres out, the Broncos again decided to run on the fifth tackle, the ball reaching Alan Cann who beat several defenders to put it down.<ref>{{Cite news \n  | last = [[Roy Masters (rugby league)|Masters, Roy]]\n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Broncos rejoice, but the plotting begins\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place = Australia\n  | page = 27\n  | language = \n  | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]]\n  | date = 27 September 1992\n  | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news920927_0112_4495\n  | accessdate = 13 February 2011}}</ref> Matterson kicked the extras so now Brisbane led 18-4. Around the midpoint of the second half, after Willie Carne did well to return a kick from his own in goal to the field of play before being tackled, the Broncos decided to swing the ball left, out to centre Steve Renouf, who took off on a 90-metre run to the try-line in what was a defining moment in the game and the Broncos' season.<ref>{{Cite news \n  | last = Heads\n  | first = Ian\n  | coauthors = \n  | title = This will take League into the 21st Century\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place = Australia\n  | page = 48\n  | language = \n  | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]]\n  | date = 27 September 1992\n  | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news920927_0115_9615\n  | accessdate = 13 February 2011}}</ref> Matterson missed the conversion attempt so the score remained at 22-4. About five minutes later Cann scored a second try when he ran from over twenty metres out, stepping past lazy defence to score untouched. The extras were kicked successfully this time by Matterson, giving the Bronocos a lead of 28-4. In the seventy-ninth minute St. George got a consolation try when Scott Gourley crossed in the right corner and as the full-time siren sounded, Herron's kick from the sideline missed leaving the final score Brisbane 28, St. George 8.<ref>{{cite news|title=NRL Finals in the 1990s |url=http://www.sportal.com.au/league-ford-ute-display/nrl-finals-in-the-1990s-97342 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |newspaper=sportal.com.au }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n'''Brisbane Broncos 28'''<br />Tries: Langer 2, Cann 2, Renouf<br />Goals: Matterson 4/5\n\n'''St. George Dragons 8'''<br />Tries: Walford, Gourley<br />Goals: Herron 0/2\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=30em\n | quote  =For Langer to play as he did, after a week of hearing how St George must stop him, confirms he deserves to be talked about with [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]] and [[Wally Lewis]] as one of the three best players of the past decade.\n | source =''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 27 April 1992<ref>{{Cite news \n  | last = Williams\n  | first = Daniel\n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Beaten Saints take Defeat on the Chin\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place = Australia\n  | page = 47\n  | language = \n  | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]]\n  | date = 27 September 1992\n  | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?&docID=news920927_0109_1116\n  | accessdate = 13 February 2011}}</ref>\n  | align = left\n}}\nThe win enabled Brisbane captain Allan Langer, in his first year in the role, to hoist the [[Winfield Cup]] and bear the trophy and title back to Queensland. As a result of his two-try performance, Langer also became the first Queenslander to be awarded the [[Clive Churchill Medal]]. Brisbane thus became the second non New South Wales team to win the premiership after the Canberra Raiders previous victories in 1989 and 1990.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Great Britain Lions Tour==\n{{main|1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia}}\nThe 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia was a tour by the [[Great Britain national rugby league team]], nicknamed the 'Lions', of Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand which took place between May and July 1992. The tour was the last of such length undertaken by the Great Britain team, and included a [[Test match (rugby league)|test match]] against [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]], a three-test series against [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] for [[The Ashes (rugby league)|The Ashes]], and a two-test series against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] for the [[Baskerville Shield]], all interspersed with matches against local club and representative teams.\n\nThe British team was coached by two-time premiership winner with [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]], [[Mal Reilly]], who had toured as a player in [[1970 Great Britain Lions tour|1970]] and was coach of the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour|1988]] team. The team captain was [[Ellery Hanley]] who was making his third Lions tour as a player, though injury to Hanley would see the Lions captained by [[Garry Schofield]] in The Ashes tests.\n\nTaking place following the conclusion of England's [[1991\u201392 Rugby Football League season]] and during Australia's [[1992 Winfield Cup]] premiership season, the tour led to friction between the Great Britain team's management and the [[Australian Rugby League]] over match scheduling and promotion. For the first time ever, a Lions tour was shown live on television in the United Kingdom through [[Sky Sports]]. The commentators for the tour were [[Eddie Hemmings (rugby league)|Eddie Hemmings]] and former Lions [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] hooker [[Mike Stephenson]] who had a greater insight into the Australian game having spent most of the 1970s and 1980s, playing, coaching and commentating in the [[NSWRFL|Sydney premiership]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me-UT01BILw Great Britain's 1992 Tour Of Australasia]</ref> The Lions finished the tour with thirteen wins and four losses and a profit of [[English Pound|\u20a4]]244,645. Unfortunately for the Lions, three of their losses came in the Test matches, two against Australia and one against New Zealand with the other loss coming against Sydney club side [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]].<ref name=nz92>Lion Red Rugby League Annual 1992 ''New Zealand Rugby League'', 1992. p.p.52-73</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=#bdb76b\n!

Having decided in May that a team from Auckland would join the premiership in 1995, the NSWRL announced in November that three more new clubs \u2014 from Townsville, Perth and a second team from Brisbane \u2014 will also be invited.\n\nTwenty-two regular season rounds were played from March till August, resulting in a top five of Brisbane, St. George, Illawarra, Newcastle and Wests, who battled it out in the finals. The 3rd-place finish for the Illawarra Steelers would be the best season they ever had in its time as a standalone club.\n\nThe 1992 season's [[Rothmans Medal]]list was the Brisbane Broncos' halfback and captain, [[Allan Langer]]. The [[Dally M Award]] went to Eastern Suburbs' halfback, [[Gary Freeman (rugby league)|Gary Freeman]], while Western Suburbs forward [[Paul Langmack]] was named ''[[Rugby League Week]]'s'' player of the year.\n\nThe 1992 season also saw the retirement from the League of future [[Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Wally Lewis]].\n\n===Teams===\nThe lineup of teams remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive season, with sixteen clubs contesting the 1992 premiership, including five [[Sydney]]-based foundation teams, another six from Sydney, two from elsewhere in [[New South Wales]], two from [[Queensland]], and one from the [[Australian Capital Territory]].\n{| align=\"center\" class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-valign: center;\" cellpadding=3

\"[[The Best (song)|The Best]]\" since its 1989 release, due partially to its use and association with the [[New South Wales Rugby League|NSWRL]], [[Tina Turner]] went into a Los Angeles recording studio in early 1992 with [[Jimmy Barnes]] to record a duet version specifically for Australian release.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Creswell, Toby and Trenoweth \n  | first = Samantha\n  | authorlink

complementary vocal styles of Turner and Barnes and also features Barnes' brother-in-law [[Johnny Diesel]] on guitar.\n\nA simple black-and-white film clip shot around the recording sessions was produced and the track was released and renamed \"Simply the Best\" to coincide with the 1992 NSWRL season. That year the track peaked at #13 on the Australian charts.\n\nIn 1992 and 1993 the League and its advertising agency Hertz Walpole would use the new duet performance of the song in the season launch ads. Excerpts from the black-and-white film clip start the 1992 ad with firstly Tina and then Barnes in wistful solo shots before coming together and displaying a camaraderie that's intended to capture the good times they appear to have had in recording the track. Diesel also appears in the black-and-white footage before the ad bursts into colour with the standard fare of big hits and previous season action.\n\n===Ladder===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=20 abbr=\"Position\u00d7\" |\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points for\" |PF\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points against\" |PA\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points difference\" |PD\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|1||style=\"text-align:left;\"| '''[[File:Brisbane colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Brisbane Broncos]] (P)'''\n|22||18||0||4||506||311||+195||'''36'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|2||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|22||15||0||7||401||283||+118||'''30'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|3||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Illawarra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n|22||13||1||8||318||259||+59||'''27'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|4||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Newcastle colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Newcastle Knights]]\n|22||12||2||8||363||267||+96||'''26'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|5||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Western Suburbs colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]\n|22||12||1||9||356||327||+29||'''25'''\n|- \n|6||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Eastern Suburbs colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs Roosters]]\n|22||12||0||10||392||319||+73||'''24'''\n|- \n|7||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Canterbury colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]]\n|22||10||2||10||423||417||+6||'''22'''\n|- \n|8||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Manly Sea Eagles colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]]\n|22||10||2||10||334||335||-1||'''22'''\n|- \n|9||style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{leagueicon|Penrith|size=16}} [[Penrith Panthers]]\n|22||11||0||11||274||309||-35||'''22'''\n|- \n|10||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Balmain colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Balmain Tigers]]\n|22||10||1||11||402||398||+4||'''21'''\n|-\n|11||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:North Sydney colours.svg|16x16px]] [[North Sydney Bears]]\n|22||10||1||11||376||381||-5||'''21'''\n|-\n|12||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Canberra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Canberra Raiders]]\n|22||10||0||12||435||409||+26||'''20'''\n|-\n|13||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Cronulla colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]]\n|22||8||0||14||284||395||-111||'''16'''\n|-\n|14||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:South Sydney colours.svg|16x16px]] [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]]\n|22||7||0||15||429||533||-104||'''14'''\n|-\n|15||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Parramatta colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Parramatta Eels]]\n|22||6||1||15||276||491||-215||'''13'''\n|-\n|16||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Gold Coast Chargers colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Gold Coast Seagulls]]\n|22||6||1||15||288||423||-135||'''11'''\n|-\n|}\n*Gold Coast Seagulls were docked 2 points due to exceeding the replacement limit in one game.\n\n==Finals==\nA great advertisement for the expansion of the game was the appearance of three non-Sydney teams in the final five - [[Brisbane]], [[Illawarra]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. The \"steel-city-cousins\", Illawarra and Newcastle, both won their first semi finals from their first attempt, Illawarra defeating St George and Newcastle downing Wests.\n\nAn all non-Sydney grand final was a real possibility, with Illawarra and St George meeting a second time in the preliminary final with Brisbane waiting to play the winner in the grand final.\n\nThe Dragons played two of the lowest scoring matches in finals history as they beat the Newcastle Knights 3-2 in the semi final and the Illawarra Steelers 4-0 in the preliminary final.\n\nThe preliminary final saw four disallowed tries with Saints denied once in the first half and Illawarra three times in the second half. Illawarra looked as though they were going to finish on top and began opening up the St George defence, only to be denied twice by referee Greg McCallum for forward passes. A late attacking movement from the Steelers saw winger [[Alan McIndoe]] excitedly appeal for a try off a [[John Simon (rugby league)|John Simon]] grubber kick but was denied by the in-goal touch judge. St George had held on to win 4-0 and ensure a Sydney club appeared in the grand final once again (this Sydney representation in grand finals would be maintained until 2006).\n\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=100% \n|- bgcolor=#C1D8FF \n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Home\n!rowspan=2 width=6%|Score\n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Away\n!colspan=6|Match Information\n|- bgcolor=#EFEFEF \n!width=17%|Date and Time\n!width=17%|Venue\n!width=11%|Referee\n!width=7%|Crowd\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Qualifying Finals'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|16\u201318\n|align=left | [[File:Illawarra colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n|5 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Graeme Annesley\n|28,521\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:Newcastle colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Newcastle Knights]]\n|21\u20132\n|align=left | [[File:Western Suburbs colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]\n|6 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|28,571\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Semi Finals'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|3\u20132\n|align=left | [[File:Newcastle colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Newcastle Knights]]\n|12 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Graeme Annesley\n|38,772\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:Brisbane colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Brisbane Broncos]]\n|22\u201312\n|align=left | [[File:Illawarra colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n|13 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|38,859\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Preliminary Final'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | [[File:Illawarra colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n|0\u20134\n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|20 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|38,928\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Grand Final'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF\n|align=left | [[File:Brisbane colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Brisbane Broncos]]\n|28-8\n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|27 September 1992\n|[[Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|41,560\n|}\n\n===Chart===\n{{5McIntyre | RD1= '''Qualifying/Elimination Final'''\n| RD2= '''Major/Minor Semi Final'''\n| RD3= '''Preliminary Final'''\n| RD4= '''Grand Final'''\n\n| RD1-seed1=2\n| RD1-team1=[[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n| RD1-score1=16\n| RD1-seed2=3\n| RD1-team2=[[File:Illawarra colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[Illawarra Steelers]]'''\n| RD1-score2='''18'''\n\n| RD1-seed3=4\n| RD1-team3=[[File:Newcastle colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[Newcastle Knights]]'''\n| RD1-score3='''21'''\n| RD1-seed4=5\n| RD1-team4=[[File:Western Suburbs colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]\n| RD1-score4=2\n\n| RD2-seed1=1\n| RD2-team1=[[File:Brisbane colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[Brisbane Broncos]]'''\n| RD2-score1='''22'''\n| RD2-seed2=\n| RD2-team2=[[File:Illawarra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n| RD2-score2=12\n\n| RD2-seed3=\n| RD2-team3=[[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[St. George Dragons]]'''\n| RD2-score3='''3'''\n| RD2-seed4=\n| RD2-team4=[[File:Newcastle colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Newcastle Knights]]\n| RD2-score4=2\n\n| RD3-seed1=\n| RD3-team1=[[File:Illawarra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n| RD3-score1=0\n| RD3-seed2=\n| RD3-team2=[[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[St. George Dragons]]'''\n| RD3-score2='''4'''\n\n| RD4-seed1=\n| RD4-team1=[[File:Brisbane colours.svg|16x16px]] '''[[Brisbane Broncos]]'''\n| RD4-score1='''28'''\n| RD4-seed2=\n| RD4-team2=[[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n| RD4-score2=8\n}}\n\n===Grand Final===\n\nIn their fifth year of competition, Brisbane finally put together the right combination to reach the grand final.

The tour was the last of such length undertaken by the Great Britain team, and included a [[Test match (rugby league)|test match]] against [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]], a three-test series against [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] for [[The Ashes (rugby league)|The Ashes]], and a two-test series against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] for the [[Baskerville Shield]], all interspersed with matches against local club and representative teams.\n\nThe British team was coached by two-time premiership winner with [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]], [[Mal Reilly]], who had toured as a player in [[1970 Great Britain Lions tour|1970]] and was coach of the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour|1988]] team. The team captain was [[Ellery Hanley]] who was making his third Lions tour as a player, though injury to Hanley would see the Lions captained by [[Garry Schofield]] in The Ashes tests.\n\nTaking place following the conclusion of England's [[1991\u201392 Rugby Football League season]] and during Australia's [[1992 Winfield Cup]] premiership season, the tour led to friction between the Great Britain team's management and the [[Australian Rugby League]] over match scheduling and promotion. For the first time ever, a Lions tour was shown live on television in the United Kingdom through [[Sky Sports]]. The commentators for the tour were [[Eddie Hemmings (rugby league)|Eddie Hemmings]] and former Lions [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] hooker [[Mike Stephenson]] who had a greater insight into the Australian game having spent most of the 1970s and 1980s, playing, coaching and commentating in the [[NSWRFL|Sydney premiership]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me-UT01BILw Great Britain's 1992 Tour Of Australasia]</ref> The Lions finished the tour with thirteen wins and four losses and a profit of [[English Pound|\u20a4]]244,645. Unfortunately for the Lions, three of their losses came in the Test matches, two against Australia and one against New Zealand with the other loss coming against Sydney club side [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]].<ref name=nz92>Lion Red Rugby League Annual 1992 ''New Zealand Rugby League'', 1992. p.p.52-73</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=#bdb76b\n!

re-recording of \"[[The Best (song)|The Best]]\" by [[Tina Turner]] and [[Jimmy Barnes]] which had been released as \"Simply the Best\", the title by which the song was more popularly known in Australia.\n\nNo new Tina footage was available until she came to Australia at the season's end, so further shots were taken from the 1992 Tina and Jimmy black & white film clip that accompanied the

This was not to be however as a horrific leg injury sidelined Ricky Stuart for the last round of competition and the finals series.  The Raiders went on to lose to Canterbury in round 22 of the competition and then to Brisbane and St George in the finals, all of which they had beat easily during the preceding season.  By the end of the season there were only two points separating 1st and 5th.  Week one of the finals saw St George easily account for the Canberra Raiders whilst Brisbane brushed aside Manly on their march through to week two.  Canberra went into this game with their third halves combination in as many weeks and were unable to overcome the eventual premiers, succumbing to Brisbane 30\u201312. [[St. George Dragons|St. George]] beat Minor Premiers' [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] in the semi-final then had a week off to prepare for a Grand Final rematch with Brisbane who advanced through after beating Canterbury in a close and spiteful Preliminary Final.<ref>{{cite news|title=NRL Finals in the 1990s |url=http://www.sportal.com.au/league-ford-ute-display/nrl-finals-in-the-1990s-97342 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121206023313/http://www.sportal.com.au/league-ford-ute-display/nrl-finals-in-the-1990s-97342 |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 December 2012 |access-date=30 June 2012 |newspaper=sportal.com.au }}</ref>\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 width=100% \n|- bgcolor=#C1D8FF \n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Home\n!rowspan=2 width=6%|Score\n!rowspan=2 width=21%|Away\n!colspan=6|Match Information\n|- bgcolor=#EFEFEF \n!width=17%|Date and Time\n!width=17%|Venue\n!width=11%|Referee\n!width=7%|Crowd\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Qualifying Finals'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] '''[[St. George Dragons]]'''\n|31\u201310\n|align=left | [[File:Canberra colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Canberra Raiders]]\n|4 September 1993\n|[[Aussie Stadium|Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Bill Harrigan\n|31,429\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:Manly Sea Eagles colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]]\n|10\u201336\n|align=left | [[File:Brisbane colours.svg|23x23px]] '''[[Brisbane Broncos]]'''\n|5 September 1993\n|[[Aussie Stadium|Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|38,432\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Semi-finals'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:Canberra colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Canberra Raiders]]\n|12\u201330\n|align=left | [[File:Brisbane colours.svg|23x23px]] '''[[Brisbane Broncos]]'''\n|11 September 1993\n|[[Aussie Stadium|Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Bill Harrigan\n|33,893\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:Canterbury colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]]\n|12\u201327\n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] '''[[St. George Dragons]]'''\n|12 September 1993\n|[[Aussie Stadium|Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|41,384\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Preliminary Final'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:Canterbury colours.svg|23x23px]] [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]]\n|16\u201323\n|align=left | [[File:Brisbane colours.svg|23x23px]] '''[[Brisbane Broncos]]'''\n|19 September 1993\n|[[Aussie Stadium|Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|34,821\n|- bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"\n|  colspan=7 | '''Grand Final'''\n|- bgcolor=#F5FAFF \n|align=left | [[File:St. George colours.svg|23x23px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|6\u201314\n|align=left | [[File:Brisbane colours.svg|23x23px]] '''[[Brisbane Broncos]]'''\n|26 September 1993\n|[[Aussie Stadium|Sydney Football Stadium]]\n|Greg McCallum\n|42,329\n|}\n\n===Chart===\n{{5McIntyre | RD1= '''Qualifying/Elimination Final'''\n| RD2= '''Major/Minor Semi-final'''\n| RD3= '''Preliminary Final'''\n| RD4= '''Grand Final'''\n\n| RD1-seed1=2\n| RD1-team1={{leagueicon|St. George|16}} '''[[St. George Dragons|St. George]]'''\n| RD1-score1='''31'''\n| RD1-seed2=3\n| RD1-team2={{leagueicon|Canberra|16}} [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]]\n| RD1-score2=10\n\n| RD1-seed3=4\n| RD1-team3={{leagueicon|Manly|16}} [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]]\n| RD1-score3=10\n| RD1-seed4=5\n| RD1-team4={{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane]]'''\n| RD1-score4='''36'''\n\n| RD2-seed1=1\n| RD2-team1={{leagueicon|Canterbury|16}} [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury]]\n| RD2-score1=12\n| RD2-seed2=\n| RD2-team2={{leagueicon|St. George|16}} '''[[St. George Dragons|St. George]]'''\n| RD2-score2='''27'''\n\n| RD2-seed3=\n| RD2-team3={{leagueicon|Canberra|16}} [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]]\n| RD2-score3=12\n| RD2-seed4=\n| RD2-team4={{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane]]'''\n| RD2-score4='''30'''\n\n| RD3-seed1=\n| RD3-team1={{leagueicon|Canterbury|16}} [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury]]\n| RD3-score1=16\n| RD3-seed2=\n| RD3-team2={{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane]]'''\n| RD3-score2='''23'''\n\n| RD4-seed1=\n| RD4-team1={{leagueicon|St. George|16}} [[St. George Dragons|St. George]]\n| RD4-score1=6\n| RD4-seed2=\n| RD4-team2={{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Brisbane Broncos|Brisbane]]'''\n| RD4-score2='''14'''\n}}\n\n===Grand Final===\n{| align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin-left:1em\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#FF0033\" \n!

(song)|The Best]]\" by [[Tina Turner]] and [[Jimmy Barnes]] which had been released as \"Simply the Best\", the title by which the song was more popularly known in Australia.\n\nNo new Tina footage was available until she came to Australia at the season's end, so further shots were taken from the 1992 Tina and Jimmy black & white film clip that accompanied the song's release and used in amongst the usual previous season action and pre-season training images.\n\nThe League and Winfield enjoyed additional advertising exposure late in the season when Tina aligned an Australian leg of her 1993 tour with the NSWRL's final series. She performed on-stage at the Grand Final, presented the victor's trophy and performed the next week in a number of full-scale rock'n'roll shows with her band at the [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]].\n\n===Ladder===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=20 abbr=\"Position\u00d7\" |\n!width=220 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points for\" |PF\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points against\" |PA\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points difference\" |PD\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|1||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Canterbury colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]]\n|22||17||0||5||464||254||+210||'''34'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|2||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:St. George colours.svg|16x16px]] [[St. George Dragons]]\n|22||17||0||5||418||258||+160||'''34'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|3||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Canberra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Canberra Raiders]]\n|22||16||1||5||587||272||+315||'''33'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|4||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Manly Sea Eagles colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]]\n|22||16||0||6||442||232||+210||'''32'''\n|- style=\"background: #ccffcc;\"\n|5||style=\"text-align:left;\"| '''[[File:Brisbane colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Brisbane Broncos]] (P)'''\n|22||16||0||6||517||330||+187||'''32'''\n|- \n|6||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:North Sydney colours.svg|16x16px]] [[North Sydney Bears]]\n|22||14||1||7||448||325||+123||'''29'''\n|- \n|7||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Illawarra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Illawarra Steelers]]\n|22||12||0||10||373||253||+120||'''24'''\n|- \n|8||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Eastern Suburbs colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Sydney City Roosters|Eastern Suburbs Roosters]]\n|22||11||1||10||343||356||-13||'''23'''\n|- \n|9||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Newcastle colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Newcastle Knights]]\n|22||10||0||12||337||381||-44||'''20'''\n|- \n|10||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Cronulla colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]]\n|22||9||0||13||272||399||-127||'''18'''\n|-\n|11||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Parramatta colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Parramatta Eels]]\n|22||9||0||13||237||439||-202||'''18'''\n|-\n|12||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Penrith colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Penrith Panthers]]\n|22||7||0||15||314||428||-114||'''14'''\n|-\n|13||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Western Suburbs colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Western Suburbs Magpies]]\n|22||7||0||15||319||475||-156||'''14'''\n|-\n|14||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:South Sydney colours.svg|16x16px]] [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]]\n|22||6||0||16||319||560||-241||'''12'''\n|-\n|15||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Balmain colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Balmain Tigers]]\n|22||6||1||15||327||412||-85||'''11'''\n|-\n|16||style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Gold Coast Seagulls]]\n|22||1||0||21||229||572||-343||'''2'''\n|-\n|}\n*Balmain were stripped of 2 competition points due to an illegal replacement in one game.\n\n==Finals==\nWith one round remaining the Canberra Raiders were outright first on the ladder and favoured to participate in their 4th grand final in just 5 years.  This was not to be however as a horrific leg injury sidelined Ricky Stuart for the last round of competition and the finals series.  The Raiders went on to lose to Canterbury in round 22 of the competition and then to Brisbane and St George in the finals, all of which they had beat easily during the preceding season.  By the end of the season there were only two points separating 1st and 5th.  Week one of the finals saw St George easily account for the Canberra Raiders whilst Brisbane brushed aside Manly on their march through to week two.

The closing scenes of the commercial made it appear that Turner was singing the song high up in the Sydney Football Stadium's stands in front of its identifiable stretched-sail

Canberra Raiders were confident in the lead up, despite their one-point loss to the Bulldogs in the Major Semi-final, and everything played into their hands from the whistle. Canterbury veteran prop Martin Bella dropped the ball from the kick-off and before too long Canberra had posted two [[Try (rugby)|tries]].\n\nCanberra legend Mal Meninga was given a champion's farewell as his \"Green Machine\" swamped the Bulldogs.<ref>{{cite news|title=NRL Finals in the 1990s |url=http://www.sportal.com.au/league-ford-ute-display/nrl-finals-in-the-1990s-97342 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121206023313/http://www.sportal.com.au/league-ford-ute-display/nrl-finals-in-the-1990s-97342 |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 December 2012 |access-date=30 June 2012 |newspaper=sportal.com.au |df= }}</ref> Canberra's Paul Osborne also enjoyed a fairytale day. On the outer for most of the year, Osborne won a reprieve, playing at {{rlp|PR}} after team-mate John Lomax was suspended for a high tackle in the Preliminary Final against [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]]. Osborne, playing in his 135th and last career game before retirement, rose to the occasion by setting up the first two Raiders tries in the opening sixteen minutes.\n\nMeninga's 166th and final match for the Raiders ended perfectly when he scored the last try of the day after intercepting a pass from Jason Smith. Meninga then outlasted the cover defence, running almost 40 metres and palming off his opposite {{rlp|CE}} Jarrod McCracken to score the try beside the posts, sending the 42,234 strong crowd at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] into raptures. Despite being a goal kicker for most of his career, Meninga declined to take what would have been an easy conversion of his own try, instead leaving the kick to regular team kicker, [[Clive Churchill Medal]]list David Furner.\n\nThe [[Canberra Raiders]] had claimed their third premiership, amassing the highest score in a Grand Final since Eastern Suburbs defeated St. George 38-0 in 1975. It was the highest-scoring Grand Final since 1951 when South Sydney defeated Manly 42-14 (though tries then were worth only three points).\n\n'''Canberra Raiders 36'''<br/>Tries: Nagas 2, Furner, Daley, Nadruku, Croker, Meninga<br/>Goals: Furner 4/7\n\n'''Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 12'''<br/>Tries: Williams, Hetherington<br/>Goals: Halligan 2/2\n\n*[[Clive Churchill Medal]]list: [[David Furner]]\n*Referee: Greg McCallum\n*Attendance: 42,234 at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]<ref>{{cite web|last=D'Souza |first=Miguel |title=Grand Final History |url=http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/league/2009-grand-final/grandFinal_History.swf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082626/http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/league/2009-grand-final/grandFinal_History.swf |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 August 2014 |work=wwos.ninemsn.com.au |publisher=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |access-date=8 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[1994 State of Origin series]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070322205925/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1994.html Rugby League Tables - Season 1994] ''The World of Rugby League''\n*[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.com/competitions/NSWRL_1994.html NSWRL season 1994 at rugbyleagueproject.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080724073218/http://www.rabbitohs.com.au/The-Club/Tradition/Results---1991-2000.html Results: 1991-2000 at rabbitohs.com.au]\n\n{{Canberra Raiders}}\n{{National Rugby League seasons}}\n{{1994 in rugby league}}\n\n[[Category:1994 in Australian rugby league|NSWRL season]]\n[[Category:New South Wales Rugby League premiership]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rugby league season\n | year = 1994\n | competition = New South Wales Rugby League\n | image =\n | imagesize = 125px\n | caption = \n | teams = 16\n | premiers = [[File:Canberra colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]]\n | count = 3rd\n | minor premiers = [[File:Canterbury colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]]\n | mpcount = 6th\n | matches = 182\n | points = 7416\n | attendance = 2732389\n | top point scorer = [[File:Canterbury colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Daryl Halligan]] (270)\n | top try scorer = [[File:Brisbane colours.svg|16x16px]] [[Steve Renouf]] (23)\n | player of the year = {{leagueicon|North Sydney|16}} [[David Fairleigh]] ([[Rothmans Medal]])\n}}\nThe '''1994 NSWRL season''' (known as the '''1994 Winfield Cup Premiership''' due to sponsorship from [[Winfield (cigarette)|Winfield]]) was the eighty-seventh season of professional [[rugby league]] football in Australia.

The [[Dally M Award]] went to Manly-Warringah's five-eighth, [[Cliff Lyons]] who was also named as ''[[Rugby League Week]]'''s player of the year. 1994 was the last premiership season to be administered by the [[New South Wales Rugby League]]. At the end of the season control of the Winfield Cup would be passed on to the [[Australian Rugby League]] and re-branded as such, as part of the move to become a more national competition. This season was also the last in the Premiership for future [[Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame]] inductee and coach, [[Mal Meninga]]. At the end of the 1994 season a squad of players from the NSWRL Premiership went on the [[1994 Kangaroo tour]].\n\n===Teams===\nThe lineup of teams remained unchanged from the previous season, with sixteen clubs contesting the premiership, including five inner [[Sydney]]-based foundation teams, another six from greater Sydney, two from greater [[New South Wales]], two from [[Queensland]], and one from the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. \n{| align=\"center\" class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-valign: center;\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=2\n|-\n!width=175|\n!width=175|\n!width=175|\n!width=175|\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Balmain Tigers]]'''<br /><small>87th season<br />Ground: [[Leichhardt Oval]]<br />Coach: [[Wayne Pearce]]<br />Captain: [[Ben Elias]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Brisbane Broncos]]'''<br /><small>[[Brisbane Broncos 1994|7th season]]<br />Ground: [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]]<br />Captain: [[Allan Langer]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Canberra Raiders]]'''<br /><small>[[1994 Canberra Raiders season|13th season]]<br />Ground: [[Bruce Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[Tim Sheens]]<br />Captain: [[Mal Meninga]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]]'''<br />[[File:Canterbury home jersey 1966.svg|75px|center]]<small>[[1994 Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs season|60th season]]<br />Ground: [[Belmore Sports Ground|Belmore Oval]]<br />Coach: [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]]<br />Captain: [[Terry Lamb]]</small>\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]]'''<br /><small>[[1994 Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks season|28th season]]<br />Ground: [[Endeavour Park]]<br />Coach: [[John Lang (Australian rugby league)|John Lang]]<br />Captain: [[Dan Stains]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs Roosters]]'''<br /><small>[[1994 Eastern Suburbs Roosters season|87th season]]<br />Ground: [[Sydney Football Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[Mark Murray (rugby league)|Mark Murray]] \u2192 [[Arthur Beetson]]<br />Captain: [[Craig Salvatori]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Gold Coast Chargers#Gold Coast Seagulls|Gold Coast Seagulls]]'''<br /><small>7th season<br />Ground: [[Seagulls Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[John Harvey (rugby league)|John Harvey]]<br />Captain: [[Craig Coleman]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Illawarra Steelers]]'''<br /><small>[[1994 Illawarra Steelers season|13th season]]<br />Ground: [[Wollongong Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[Graham Murray]]<br />Captain: [[John Cross (rugby league)|John Cross]]</small>\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]]'''<br/>[[Image:Manly home jersey 1993.png|75px|center]]<br/><small>[[1994 Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles season|48th season]]<br />Ground: [[Brookvale Oval]]<br />Coach: [[Bob Fulton]]<br />Captain: [[Geoff Toovey]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Newcastle Knights]]'''<br />[[File:Newcastle Knights home jersey 1988.svg|75px|center]]<small>[[1994 Newcastle Knights season|7th season]]<br />Ground: [[Marathon Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[David Waite]]<br />Captain: [[Mark Sargent]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[North Sydney Bears]]'''<br /><small>87th season<br />Ground: [[North Sydney Oval]]<br />Coach: [[Peter Louis]]<br />Captain: [[Jason Taylor (rugby league)|Jason Taylor]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Parramatta Eels]]'''<br /><small>[[1994 Parramatta Eels season|48th season]]<br />Ground: [[Parramatta Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[Ron Hilditch]]<br />Captain: [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]]</small>\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Penrith Panthers]]'''<br /><small>[[1994 Penrith Panthers season|28th season]]<br />Ground: [[Penrith Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[Phil Gould]] \u2192 [[Royce Simmons]]<br />Captain: [[John Cartwright (rugby league)|John Cartwright]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[South Sydney Rabbitohs]]'''<br /><small>[[1994 South Sydney Rabbitohs season|87th season]]<br />Ground: [[Sydney Football Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[Ken Shine]]<br />Captain: [[Dean Schifilliti]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[St. George Dragons]]'''<br /><small>74th season<br />Ground: [[Kogarah Oval]]<br />Coach: [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]]<br />Captain: [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]]</small>\n|align=\"center\"|'''[[Western Suburbs Magpies]]'''<br /><small>87th season<br />Ground: [[Campbelltown Stadium]]<br />Coach: [[Wayne Ellis (coach)|Wayne Ellis]]<br />Captain: [[Paul Langmack]] \u2192 [[Jim Serdaris]]</small>\n|}\n\n===Advertising===\nIn 1994 the  [[New South Wales Rugby League|League]] and its advertising agency Hertz Walpole returned to the original 1989 recording of \"[[The Best (song)|The Best]]\" by [[Tina Turner]] to underscore the season launch ad. Footage had been shot of Turner's performance at the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1993#Grand Final|1993 Grand Final]] and a studio [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] shoot also took place during that visit ensuring a store of images that could be used in flexible adaptations for the final two years of Turner's association with the competition and the [[Winfield Cup]].\n\nThe 1994 advertisement used the performance and superimposed studio footage of Turner into crowd and stadium scenes that replicated the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. The closing scenes of the commercial made it appear that Turner was singing the song high up in the Sydney Football Stadium's stands in front of its identifiable stretched-sail roofing.\n\n===Ladder===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=20 abbr=\"Position\u00d7\" |\n!width=230 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\"

Canberra Raiders were confident in the lead up, despite their one-point loss to the Bulldogs in the Major Semi-final, and everything played into their hands from the whistle. Canterbury veteran prop Martin Bella dropped the ball from the kick-off and before too long Canberra had posted two [[Try (rugby)|tries]].\n\nCanberra legend Mal Meninga was given a champion's farewell as his \"Green Machine\" swamped the Bulldogs.<ref>{{cite news|title=NRL Finals in the 1990s |url=http://www.sportal.com.au/league-ford-ute-display/nrl-finals-in-the-1990s-97342 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121206023313/http://www.sportal.com.au/league-ford-ute-display/nrl-finals-in-the-1990s-97342 |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 December 2012 |access-date=30 June 2012 |newspaper=sportal.com.au |df= }}</ref> Canberra's Paul Osborne also enjoyed a fairytale day. On the outer for most of the year, Osborne won a reprieve, playing at {{rlp|PR}} after team-mate John Lomax was suspended for a high tackle in the Preliminary Final against [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]]. Osborne, playing in his 135th and last career game before retirement, rose to the occasion by setting up the first two Raiders tries in the opening sixteen minutes.\n\nMeninga's 166th and final match for the Raiders ended perfectly when he scored the last try of the day after intercepting a pass from Jason Smith. Meninga then outlasted the cover defence, running almost 40 metres and palming off his opposite {{rlp|CE}} Jarrod McCracken to score the try beside the posts, sending the 42,234 strong crowd at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]] into raptures. Despite being a goal kicker for most of his career, Meninga declined to take what would have been an easy conversion of his own try, instead leaving the kick to regular team kicker, [[Clive Churchill Medal]]list David Furner.\n\nThe [[Canberra Raiders]] had claimed their third premiership, amassing the highest score in a Grand Final since Eastern Suburbs defeated St. George 38-0 in 1975. It was the highest-scoring Grand Final since 1951 when South Sydney defeated Manly 42-14 (though tries then were worth only three points).\n\n'''Canberra Raiders 36'''<br/>Tries: Nagas 2, Furner, Daley, Nadruku, Croker, Meninga<br/>Goals: Furner 4/7\n\n'''Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 12'''<br/>Tries: Williams, Hetherington<br/>Goals: Halligan 2/2\n\n*[[Clive Churchill Medal]]list: [[David Furner]]\n*Referee: Greg McCallum\n*Attendance: 42,234 at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]<ref>{{cite web|last=D'Souza |first=Miguel |title=Grand Final History |url=http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/league/2009-grand-final/grandFinal_History.swf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082626/http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/league/2009-grand-final/grandFinal_History.swf |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 August 2014 |work=wwos.ninemsn.com.au |publisher=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |access-date=8 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[1994 State of Origin series]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070322205925/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1994.html Rugby League Tables - Season 1994] ''The World of Rugby League''\n*[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.com/competitions/NSWRL_1994.html NSWRL season 1994 at rugbyleagueproject.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080724073218/http://www.rabbitohs.com.au/The-Club/Tradition/Results---1991-2000.html Results: 1991-2000 at rabbitohs.com.au]\n\n{{Canberra Raiders}}\n{{National Rugby League seasons}}\n{{1994 in rugby league}}\n\n[[Category:1994 in Australian rugby league|NSWRL season]]\n[[Category:New South Wales Rugby League premiership]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toPhilip Gould (disambiguation)(link changed toPhil Gould (rugby league)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_NSWRL_season"}

For the first time since the [[1988 NSWRL season]], the Premiership expanded again, and for the first time ever outside the borders of New South Wales and Queensland, with the addition of four new clubs<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Harms\n  | first = John\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = The Pearl: Steve Renouf's Story\n  | publisher = [[University of Queensland]] Press\n  | year = 2005\n  | location = Australia\n  | page = 167\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OFE2EZ7JyEkC&source=gbs_navlinks_s\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 9780702235368}}\n</ref> from [[North Queensland]], [[WA Reds|Western Australia]], [[South Queensland Crushers|South Queensland]]\nand [[Auckland]]. This saw a total of twenty teams, the largest number in the League's history, compete during the regular season for the [[J J Giltinan Shield]], which was followed by a series of play-off finals between the top eight teams that culminated in a [[grand final]] for the [[Winfield Cup]] between the newly re-branded [[Sydney Bulldogs]] and the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\n\nThe 1995 season also saw the first major consequences of the [[Super League war]], with the ARL's refusal to select for participation in [[1995 State of Origin series|State of Origin]] or [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia national team]] matches any players from the eight clubs (which included every club that had won the premiership since 1988) aligned with [[News Ltd]]'s proposed [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]].\n\n==Season summary==\n\n1995 would prove to be a year of massive change for the League. In addition to the introduction of four new teams, it was the last year of the premiership's association with [[Rothmans International plc|Rothmans]] and the Winfield brand and consequently the final year that clubs competed for the [[Winfield Cup]].\n\nThe storm clouds that had been gathering for some time in the form of rumours and speculation about [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] were to break on 1 April 1995 with a verification that would rain on the game with more force than anyone could have expected. The subsequent [[Super League war]] would rock the sport in Australia and set it back almost a decade in terms of its loss of public support and damage to its grass roots values.\n\nThe 1995 season was played in front of a background of legal actions, breaking friendships and with clubs, players and managers all jockeying for position and self-interest. Players who had signed with the new [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] venture were forbidden by the ARL from participating in the [[1995 State of Origin]]. Queensland and New South Wales selectors were limited to selecting players only from ARL-aligned clubs.\n\nThe usual twenty-two regular season rounds were played from March till August. However the large number of teams meant a resulting top eight would battle it out in the finals rather than the usual five. These were Manly, Canberra, Brisbane, Cronulla, Newcastle, Bulldogs, St. George and Norths (who made it in due to Auckland being penalised for an interchange infringement).\nCronulla-Sutherland's halfback [[Paul Green (rugby league)|Paul Green]] was awarded the 1995 [[Rothmans Medal]]. The [[Dally M Award]] was given to Canberra's five-eighth, [[Laurie Daley]] who was also named ''[[Rugby League Week]]'s'' player of the year. Manly-Warringah's [[Steve Menzies]] became the first [[Rugby league positions#Forwards|forward]] for 50 years to top the season's try-scoring list, while his teammate [[Matthew Ridge]] set a club point scoring record of 257 points (11 tries, 106 goals and 1 field goal) to be the league's leading point scorer for the year.\n\nBy the end of the regular season, the ARL's inaugural 20-team competition had set a new record for aggregate match attendances of 3,061,338.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/02/2674785.htm |title=Gallop salutes NRL's march forward - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>\n\n===Advertising===\n1995 marked the final year of the [[New South Wales Rugby League]]'s sponsorship arrangement with [[Rothmans International plc|Rothmans]] and [[Winfield (cigarette)|Winfield]] due to the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]]'s blanket ban on cigarette advertising in Australia effective from 1 January 1996. It was consequently the final year of a seven-year association with [[Tina Turner]] and the end of an era in Australian sports marketing. \n{{Quotation|With a lock-up-your-daughters, kick-off your suspenders, red-blooded Tina Turner marketing blitz, the ARL had stuck it right up the other footy codes.|[[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]], 1999<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]\n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Why my beloved Rabbitohs can't die\n  | work = [[The Sun-Herald]]\n  | place =\n  | page = 69\n  | language = \n  | publisher = Fairfax Digital\n  | date = 1999-10-03\n  | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news991006_0574_7147\n  | accessdate = 2009-10-06}}</ref>}}\nAs in 1994 the New South Wales Rugby League and its advertising agency Hertz Walpole returned to the original 1989 recording of [[The Best (song)|The Best]] by Turner to underscore the season launch advertisement. Footage from the studio [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] shoot taken during Turner's 1993 Sydney visit was used in the final advertisements. The enduring images are of Turner performing the song on an elevated stage in front of the fluttering banners of the 20 clubs that would participate in 1995's expanded competition.\n\n===Teams===\nWhen the Australian Rugby League began taking bids for additional teams to begin playing in 1995, it was expected that only two teams would enter. The [[Auckland Warriors]] were the first club to be accepted, with the final place being fought for by [[South Queensland Crushers|South Queensland]], [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]] and [[WA Reds|Perth]]. The Australian Rugby League later announced that all three clubs had been accepted, taking the number of teams from 16 in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1994|1994]] to 20 in 1995, the highest it had ever been and would ever be.\n\nWith the addition of the [[Auckland Warriors]], [[North Queensland Cowboys]], [[South Queensland Crushers]] and [[Western Reds]] the 1995 season involved an unprecedented twenty clubs,<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Premiership |url=http://www.centenaryofrugbyleague.com.au/site/about/history/history-of-the-premiership.aspx

already brewing in the background, three clubs based in Sydney suburbs, in an effort to position themselves favourably as battle lines were being drawn up, re-branded themselves for the 1995 season with less geographically distinct names: the Balmain Tigers became the 'Sydney Tigers', the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs became the 'Sydney Bulldogs', and the Eastern Suburbs Roosters became the 'Sydney City Roosters'.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:auto; text-valign:center;\" cellpadding=\"3\"

This saw a total of twenty teams, the largest number in the League's history, compete during the regular season for the [[J J Giltinan Shield]], which was followed by a series of play-off finals between the top eight teams that culminated in a [[grand final]] for the [[Winfield Cup]] between the newly re-branded [[Sydney Bulldogs]] and the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\n\nThe 1995 season also saw the first major consequences of the [[Super League war]], with the ARL's refusal to select for participation in [[1995 State of Origin series|State of Origin]] or [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia national team]] matches any players from the eight clubs (which included every club that had won the premiership since 1988) aligned with [[News Ltd]]'s proposed [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]].\n\n==Season summary==\n\n1995 would prove to be a year of massive change for the League. In addition to the introduction of four new teams, it was the last year of the premiership's association with [[Rothmans International plc|Rothmans]] and the Winfield brand and consequently the final year that clubs competed for the [[Winfield Cup]].\n\nThe storm clouds that had been gathering for some time in the form of rumours and speculation about [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] were to break on 1 April 1995 with a verification that would rain on the game with more force than anyone could have expected. The subsequent [[Super League war]] would rock the sport in Australia and set it back almost a decade in terms of its loss of public support and damage to its grass roots values.\n\nThe 1995 season was played in front of a background of legal actions, breaking friendships and with clubs, players and managers all jockeying for position and self-interest. Players who had signed with the new [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] venture were forbidden by the ARL from participating in the [[1995 State of Origin]]. Queensland and New South Wales selectors were limited to selecting players only from ARL-aligned clubs.\n\nThe usual twenty-two regular season rounds were played from March till August. However the large number of teams meant a resulting top eight would battle it out in the finals rather than the usual five. These were Manly, Canberra, Brisbane, Cronulla, Newcastle, Bulldogs, St. George and Norths (who made it in due to Auckland being penalised for an interchange infringement).\nCronulla-Sutherland's halfback [[Paul Green (rugby league)|Paul Green]] was awarded the 1995 [[Rothmans Medal]]. The [[Dally M Award]] was given to Canberra's five-eighth, [[Laurie Daley]] who was also named ''[[Rugby League Week]]'s'' player of the year. Manly-Warringah's [[Steve Menzies]] became the first [[Rugby league positions#Forwards|forward]] for 50 years to top the season's try-scoring list, while his teammate [[Matthew Ridge]] set a club point scoring record of 257 points (11 tries, 106 goals and 1 field goal) to be the league's leading point scorer for the year.\n\nBy the end of the regular season, the ARL's inaugural 20-team competition had set a new record for aggregate match attendances of 3,061,338.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/02/2674785.htm |title=Gallop salutes NRL's march forward - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>\n\n===Advertising===\n1995 marked the final year of the [[New South Wales Rugby League]]'s sponsorship arrangement with [[Rothmans International plc|Rothmans]] and [[Winfield (cigarette)|Winfield]] due to the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]]'s blanket ban on cigarette advertising in Australia effective from 1 January 1996. It was consequently the final year of a seven-year association with [[Tina Turner]] and the end of an era in Australian sports marketing. \n{{Quotation|With a lock-up-your-daughters, kick-off your suspenders, red-blooded Tina Turner marketing blitz, the ARL had stuck it right up the other footy codes.|[[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]], 1999<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]\n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Why my beloved Rabbitohs can't die\n  | work = [[The Sun-Herald]]\n  | place =\n  | page = 69\n  | language = \n  | publisher = Fairfax Digital\n  | date = 1999-10-03\n  | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news991006_0574_7147\n  | accessdate = 2009-10-06}}</ref>}}\nAs in 1994 the New South Wales Rugby League and its advertising agency Hertz Walpole returned to the original 1989 recording of [[The Best (song)|The Best]] by Turner to underscore the season launch advertisement. Footage from the studio [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] shoot taken during Turner's 1993 Sydney visit was used in the final advertisements. The enduring images are of Turner performing the song on an elevated stage in front of the fluttering banners of the 20 clubs that would participate in 1995's expanded competition.\n\n===Teams===\nWhen the Australian Rugby League began taking bids for additional teams to begin playing in 1995, it was expected that only two teams would enter. The [[Auckland Warriors]] were the first club to be accepted, with the final place being fought for by [[South Queensland Crushers|South Queensland]], [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]] and [[WA Reds|Perth]].

He was present at the outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]] in the winter of 168/69. Galen briefly recorded observations and a description of the epidemic in the treatise ''Methodus Medendi'', and he scattered other references to it among his voluminous writings. He described the plague as \"great\" and of long duration and mentions [[fever]], [[diarrhea]] and [[pharyngitis]] as well as a skin eruption and sometimes dry and sometimes [[pus|pustular]] that appeared on the ninth day of the illness. The information that was provided by Galen dis not clearly define the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.<ref>See [[Frank McLynn|McLynn, Frank]], ''Marcus Aurelius, Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', Vintage Books, London, 2009.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William McNeill]]<ref>McNeill, W.H. 1976 ''Plagues and Peoples''.

The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox.<ref>D. Ch.

[[Lucian of Samosata]]'s irony-laden account of the charlatan [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]] records a verse of his \"which he despatched to all the nations during the pestilence... was to be seen written over doorways everywhere\", particularly in the houses that were emptied, Lucian further remarks.<ref>Lucian, ''Alexander'', 36.</ref>\n\nThe epidemic had drastic social and political effects throughout the Roman Empire. [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] (1776\u20131831) concluded that \"as the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] forms a turning point in so many things, and above all in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague.... The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted on it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.\"<ref>Niebuhr, ''Lectures on the history of Rome'' III, Lecture CXXXI (London 1849), quoted by Gilliam 1961:225</ref> During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], Marcus Aurelius wrote his philosophical work ''[[Meditations]]''. A passage (IX.2) states that even the pestilence around him was less deadly than falsehood, evil behaviour and lack of true understanding. As he lay dying, he uttered the words, \"Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others.\" [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737\u20131794) and [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] (1870\u20131952) assigned the Antonine plague less influence than contemporary political and economic trends, respectively.\n\n==Military concerns==\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Sestertius 177 860042.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman coin]] commemorating the victories of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] against the Germanic tribes along the [[Danube]] frontier in the early 170s AD]]\nSome direct effects of the contagion stand out. When imperial forces moved east, under the command of Emperor Verus, after the forces of [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] attacked [[Armenia]], the Romans' defense of the eastern territories was hampered when large numbers of troops succumbed to the disease. According to the 5th-century Spanish writer [[Paulus Orosius]], many towns and villages in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[Europe|European]] provinces of lost all of their inhabitants. As the disease swept north to the [[Rhine]], it also infected [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and [[Gaul|Gallic]] peoples outside the empire's borders. For a number of years, those northern groups had pressed south in search of more lands to sustain their growing populations. With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back. From 167 to his death, Marcus Aurelius personally commanded legions near the [[Danube]], trying, with only partial success, to control the advance of Germanic peoples across the river. A major offensive against the [[Marcomanni]] was postponed to 169 because of a shortage of imperial troops.\n\n==Indian Ocean trade and Han China==\n\nAlthough [[Ge Hong]] was the first writer of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] who accurately described the symptoms of smallpox, the historian [[Rafe de Crespigny]] mused that the plagues afflicting the [[Eastern Han]] Empire during the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146-168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168\u2013189)&nbsp;\u2013 with outbreaks in 151, 161, 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185&nbsp;\u2013 were perhaps connected to the Antonine plague on the western end of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny, Rafe]].

The information that was provided by Galen dis not clearly define the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.<ref>See [[Frank McLynn|McLynn, Frank]], ''Marcus Aurelius, Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', Vintage Books, London, 2009.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William McNeill]]<ref>McNeill, W.H. 1976 ''Plagues and Peoples''.

The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors.

[[Lucian of Samosata]]'s irony-laden account of the charlatan [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]] records a verse of his \"which he despatched to all the nations during the pestilence... was to be seen written over doorways everywhere\", particularly in the houses that were emptied, Lucian further remarks.<ref>Lucian, ''Alexander'', 36.</ref>\n\nThe epidemic had drastic social and political effects throughout the Roman Empire. [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] (1776\u20131831) concluded that \"as the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] forms a turning point in so many things, and above all in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague.... The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted on it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.\"<ref>Niebuhr, ''Lectures on the history of Rome'' III, Lecture CXXXI (London 1849), quoted by Gilliam 1961:225</ref> During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], Marcus Aurelius wrote his philosophical work ''[[Meditations]]''. A passage (IX.2) states that even the pestilence around him was less deadly than falsehood, evil behaviour and lack of true understanding. As he lay dying, he uttered the words, \"Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others.\" [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737\u20131794) and [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] (1870\u20131952) assigned the Antonine plague less influence than contemporary political and economic trends, respectively.\n\n==Military concerns==\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Sestertius 177 860042.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman coin]] commemorating the victories of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] against the Germanic tribes along the [[Danube]] frontier in the early 170s AD]]\nSome direct effects of the contagion stand out. When imperial forces moved east, under the command of Emperor Verus, after the forces of [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] attacked [[Armenia]], the Romans' defense of the eastern territories was hampered when large numbers of troops succumbed to the disease. According to the 5th-century Spanish writer [[Paulus Orosius]], many towns and villages in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[Europe|European]] provinces of lost all of their inhabitants. As the disease swept north to the [[Rhine]], it also infected [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and [[Gaul|Gallic]] peoples outside the wmpire's borders. For a number of years, those northern groups had pressed south in search of more lands to sustain their growing populations. With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back. From 167 to his death, Marcus Aurelius personally commanded legions near the [[Danube]], trying, with only partial success, to control the advance of Germanic peoples across the river. A major offensive against the [[Marcomanni]] was postponed to 169 because of a shortage of imperial troops.\n\n==Indian Ocean trade and Han China==\n\nAlthough [[Ge Hong]] was the first writer of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] who accurately described the symptoms of smallpox, the historian [[Rafe de Crespigny]] mused that the plagues afflicting the [[Eastern Han]] Empire during the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146-168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168\u2013189)&nbsp;\u2013 with outbreaks in 151, 161, 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185&nbsp;\u2013 were perhaps connected to the Antonine plague on the western end of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny, Rafe]].

Due to their domination of the competition 'Wenty' was widely considered the best candidate for promotion to the NSWRL Premiership when two positions were made available for the 1967 competition. Due to their proximity to [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]], where a Premiership club was established in 1946, the Magpies were overlooked.<ref>[http://rl1908.com/articles/Cronulla-Sharks.htm Sean Fagan, ''History of the Cronulla Sharks''].

Second Division 1969 runners-up [[Sydney University rugby league team|University of Sydney]] were also invited to participate.\n\nWentworthville finished 12th (above [[Penrith Panthers]] and University) in the competition with 1 win and 3 loses and a points differential of \u221221.

Their win came against local rivals Parramatta, winning 12 \u2013 8 at [[Parramatta Stadium|Cumberland Oval]] but they failed to defeat fellow Second Division club, University, narrowly losing 19 \u2013 17.\n\nDespite a promising win against a top-flight side the experiment of inviting Second Division teams to participate in first-grade competitions was not considered a success and was never repeated.\n\n==Jim Beam Cup/Bundaberg Red Cup/Ron Massey Cup==\n\nThe Wentworthville Magpies joined the [[NSWRL Jim Beam Cup]] in its first year in 2003 and were runners-up to [[The Entrance Tigers]] in the 2003 Grand Final.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/05/1065292469350.html?from=storyrhs Steve Mascord, ''Send-off adds salt to the wound'', Sydney Morning Herald, 6 October 2003].

Due to their domination of the competition 'Wenty' was widely considered the best candidate for promotion to the NSWRL Premiership when two positions were made available for the 1967 competition.

Second Division 1969 runners-up [[Sydney University rugby league team|University of Sydney]] were also invited to participate.\n\nWentworthville finished 12th (above [[Penrith Panthers]] and University) in the competition with 1 win and 3 loses and a points differential of \u221221.  They played games against Parramatta, University, Penrith and Western Suburbs.  Their win came against local rivals Parramatta, winning 12 \u2013 8 at [[Parramatta Stadium|Cumberland Oval]] but they failed to defeat fellow Second Division club, University, narrowly losing 19 \u2013 17.\n\nDespite a promising win against a top-flight side the experiment of inviting Second Division teams to participate in first-grade competitions was not considered a success and was never repeated.\n\n==Jim Beam Cup/Bundaberg Red Cup/Ron Massey Cup==\n\nThe Wentworthville Magpies joined the [[NSWRL Jim Beam Cup]] in its first year in 2003 and were runners-up to [[The Entrance Tigers]] in the 2003 Grand Final.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/05/1065292469350.html?from=storyrhs Steve Mascord, ''Send-off adds salt to the wound'', Sydney Morning Herald, 6 October 2003].

He is a former player, coach and administrator of the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] club. Following their exclusion from the [[National Rugby League]] premiership at the end of the [[Super League war]], Piggins also successfully led the Rabbitohs' battle for re-inclusion in the NRL in the early 2000s. Since 2003, the \"[[George Piggins Medal]]\" has been awarded annually to South Sydney's player of the year.\n\n==Playing career==\nOnce a wharf labourer from the Southern Sydney suburb of [[Mascot, New South Wales|Mascot]], Piggins played the game as a {{rlp|hk}}. He established himself in the NSWRFL Premiership's first grade in [[NSWRFL season 1967|1967]] but was left out for [[Elwyn Walters]] in the finals and took several years to re-establish himself. In [[NSWRFL season 1971|1971]] Piggins played a superb game in the grand final when Walters was injured and late the following year finally established a permanent first grade berth for good. In [[NSWRFL season 1974|1974]], with Walters leaving for [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]], Piggins advanced so much that he played for [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales]] and the following year, despite Souths finishing last after winning only two of their last sixteen games, Piggins' toughness saw him represent [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] three times in the [[1975 Rugby League World Cup|1975 World Series]]. The following year, he scored a memorable bustling [[Try (rugby)|try]] (one of only eight in 120 first grade games) against the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] and again played for New South Wales.

Although they scored the fewest tries of the thirteen clubs playing, their ability to win tight, low-scoring games kept the Rabbitohs at the top of the table. Injuries to their pack in [[NSWRL season 1988|1988]] saw them finish eighth despite remedying their weakness in backline pace through acquiring [[Phil Blake]]. The side was also set back by the loss of two premiership points due to Piggins playing 17-year-old President's Cup player Scott Wilson in a game against [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] which Souths won, due to a breach of replacement rules.  1989 saw the Rabbitohs as the undisputed pace-setters until the finals, winning twelve games in a row through a watertight defence and skilful, solid backline play. 1990, however, was a disaster as Boyle, Andrews and Chisholm succumbed to injury and Roberts, who by this time was Souths best player, was lost to Manly. The Rabbitohs' watertight defence became incredibly thin and the team won only two games all season \u2013 actually conceding more tries in their last five games than in the entire 1989 home-and-away season. Piggins was axed as coach at the end of that year to be replaced by Frank Curry in 1990, but stayed involved by becoming Chairman of the Leagues Club.\n\n==Administration==\nIn 2000 Piggins was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league.\n\nDue to the National Rugby League's plans for a fourteen-team competition, the South Sydney club was excluded from the NRL premiership commencing with the 2000 season. Piggins was the chairman of the South Sydney club during the legal battle against the NRL for re-inclusion in the premiership, which was achieved during 2001. He led the marches and even put up $3.2&nbsp;million of his own money in a mortgage on the club's block of units adjacent to the leagues club.<ref>{{cite news \n| last = Chesterton\n| first = Ray\n| title = George Piggins is finished\n| work = The Daily Telegraph\n| place = Australia\n| pages = \n| language = \n| publisher = News Limited\n| date = 30 May 2008\n| url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/george-piggins-is-finished/story-e6frext9-1111116481983\n| accessdate = 30 November 2009}}</ref> That year Piggins was awarded the [[Centenary Medal]] \"for service to the sport of rugby league\" as the Rabbitohs returned to the playing field in [[National Rugby League season 2002|2002]].

He is a former player, coach and administrator of the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] club. Following their exclusion from the [[National Rugby League]] premiership at the end of the [[Super League war]], Piggins also successfully led the Rabbitohs' battle for re-inclusion in the NRL in the early 2000s. Since 2003, the \"[[George Piggins Medal]]\" has been awarded annually to South Sydney's player of the year.\n\n==Playing career==\nOnce a wharf labourer from the Southern Sydney suburb of [[Mascot, New South Wales|Mascot]], Piggins played the game as a {{rlp|hk}}. He established himself in the NSWRFL Premiership's first grade in [[NSWRFL season 1967|1967]] but was left out for [[Elwyn Walters]] in the finals and took several years to re-establish himself. In [[NSWRFL season 1971|1971]] Piggins played a superb game in the grand final when Walters was injured and late the following year finally established a permanent first grade berth for good. In [[NSWRFL season 1974|1974]], with Walters leaving for [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]], Piggins advanced so much that he played for [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales]] and the following year, despite Souths finishing last after winning only two of their last sixteen games, Piggins' toughness saw him represent [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] three times in the [[1975 Rugby League World Cup|1975 World Series]]. The following year, he scored a memorable bustling [[Try (rugby)|try]] (one of only eight in 120 first grade games) against the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] and again played for New South Wales. With injuries catching up, however, Piggins retired at the end of [[NSWRFL season 1978|1978]], but his experience and the skill of coach [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]] that season was an important precursor for the Rabbitohs reaching the semi-finals in [[NSWRFL season 1980|1980]] after winning only one of their last eighteen games in [[NSWRFL season 1977|1977]].\n\nPost playing Piggins worked as a truck driver,<ref>{{cite news \n| last = Masters, Roy\n| first = \n| title = Life after the Rabbits: Piggins the litigator kicking plenty of goals \n| work = League HQ (smh.com.au)\n| place =\n| pages = \n| language = \n| publisher = Fairfax Digital\n| date = 15 May 2009\n| url = http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/life-after-the-rabbits-piggins-the-litigator-kicking-plenty-ofgoals-20091123-iwvc.html\n| accessdate = 30 November 2009}}</ref> eventually starting his own trucking business.

Based in [[Belmore, New South Wales|Belmore]], a suburb of [[Sydney]], the Bulldogs in 1935 were admitted to the [[New South Wales Rugby League|New South Wales Rugby Football League]] (NSWRFL) competition, a predecessor of the current NRL competition.\n\nThe Bulldogs won their first premiership in just their fourth season (1938). At the time it made them the quickest club (barring the founding clubs) to win a premiership after admission to the competition, a record which was only recently beaten in 1999 by the [[Melbourne Storm]]. They won a second premiership in 1942 but then had to wait another 38 years before breaking through for a third title in 1980. During the 1980s, the Bulldogs were a dominant force in the competition appearing in five Grand Finals, winning four of them. In the 1990s they featured in the 1994, 1995 and 1998 Grand Finals, winning the title in 1995 over Manly. Their most recent success was in 2004 when they beat the [[Sydney Roosters]] 16\u201313, the tryscorers being [[Hazem El Masri]] and Matt Utai, and the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] winner [[Willie Mason]].\n\n==Origin==\nThe [[Canterbury]]-[[Bankstown]] region in [[Sydney]]'s southwest had a thriving rugby league culture and local competition from 1922 onwards,<ref name=\"From\">Lester, Gary; ''From Berries to Bulldogs: Fifty Years of the Cantberury-Bankstown R.L.F.C.''; pp. 11-13 {{ISBN|9780949853066}}</ref> By 1930 the club had won the President's Cup competition<ref name=\"From\"/> and afterwards applied repeatedly to join the Sydney senior competition, finally being successful on 24 September 1934. The main barrier had been the lack of a suitable ground, which the NSWRL had set as a condition of entry. The club covered as territory the municipalities of Bankstown and Canterbury, taking them from St George and Western Suburbs. It would share the suburbs of Earlwood and Hurlstone Park with Newtown.<ref name=\"smh34\">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article136116132?searchTerm=%22Canterbury-Bankstown%22%20league&searchLimits=l-state=New+South+Wales|title=New First Grade League Club: Canterbury-Bankstown Elevated in Sydney |date=27 September 1934|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> It took part for the first time in 1935.\n\n==Debut season==\nCanterbury played its first premiership match against [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] on [[Anzac Day]], 25 April 1935 at [[North Sydney Oval]]. In a match refereed by Tom McMahon, North Sydney won by a margin of 20 points to 5. Scorers for Canterbury-Bankstown were a try to [[Jack Hartwell Sr.]] and a penalty goal to [[Tom Carey (rugby league)|Tom Carey]]. Hartwell was a prop forward, whilst Carey was a halfback or five-eighth who had been a Canterbury junior before playing with St George.\n\nThe first Canterbury team was: George Main, [[Vince Dwyer]], [[Jack Morrison (rugby league)|Jack Morrison]] (c), [[Sid Elliott]], Basil Crawford, Harry Brown, [[Tom Carey (rugby league)|Tom Carey]], [[Frank Sponberg]], [[Alan Wellington]], [[Jack McConnell (rugby league)|Jack McConnell]], [[Jack Hartwell Sr.]], [[Bob Lindfield]] and [[Fred Chaplin (rugby league)|Fred Chaplin]] and was coached by [[Tedda Courtney]].\n\nCanterbury's initial season was a remarkable one \u2013 for the wrong reasons. Playing without a home ground, the team suffered a number of massive losses, losing in successive weeks during May 6\u201391 to [[St George Dragons|St George]] and 7\u201387 to [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] \u2013 the two heaviest defeats in the history of the competition.<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_gr.html#1 Rugby League Tables: Biggest Wins] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717162122/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_gr.html#1 |date=17 July 2014 }}</ref> The club managed to avoid the wooden spoon by twice defeating the winless [[Sydney University rugby league team|University]], but still conceded 140 tries in sixteen matches or an average of 8.75 tries per game, which remains the second-highest figure in NSWRFL/NRL history behind the 9.08 tries per game conceded by University in their debut [[1920 NSWRFL season|1920 season]].<ref>[http://afltables.com/rl/teams/all/overall_sr.html Rugby League Tables: Season Records]</ref>\n\n==Early success==\nAfter the disastrous 1935 season, Canterbury became determined to achieve success and especially to improve the backline \u2013 the chief cause of the 1935 failures.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 22</ref> They bought fullback [[Tom Kirk (rugby league)|Tom Kirk]] from Tumut, centre and captain [[Alan Brady]] from Western Suburbs, threequarter [[Joe Gartner]] from Newtown and ex-Bluebag prop [[Henry Porter (rugby league)|Henry Porter]] from Goulburn. Along with champion coach [[Frank Burge]], these buys improved the Cantabs from 1935's two wins to nine in 1936, netting a place in the finals.\n\nIn 1938, the Cantabs suffered only one loss, and a first title, defeating former nemesis [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] 19\u20136 in the final. Instrumental in the club's success was the front row combination of props [[Eddie Burns]] and [[Henry Porter (rugby league footballer)|Henry Porter]] and hooker [[Roy Kirkaldy]]. The club also won the reserve grade premiership the same year. Canterbury made the grand final again in 1940 but lost to Easts 24\u201314. After long their semi-final in 1942, Canterbury finished on top of the ladder with Balmain in 1942, and secured the minor premiership after the NSWRL ruled that a play-off was necessary and they beat the Tigers 40\u201320. Canterbury were defeated by St George 35\u201310 in the semis, but as minor premiers had the right to challenge in a grand final which saw them defeat the Dragons 11\u20139 in wet conditions after the scores were even at half-time.\n\n==Decline as a Power==\nRemarkably \u2013 though largely due to the influence of [[World War II]] which deprived them of stars Porter and Newham, along with [[Bob Farrar]] and [[Bob Jackson (rugby league)|Bob Jackson]]<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 42</ref> \u2013 Canterbury fell from premiers in 1942 to wooden spooners in each of the following two seasons. As players returned from service in the war, the club did regain its strength, finishing sixth in 1945, third in 1946 and on top of the table in 1947. They finished the competition three points clear of the [[Balmain Tigers]] with Newtown and Wests making up the four. They beat Newtown 25\u201315 in the first semi but lost to Balmain 19\u201325 in the final. As they had been minor premiers, they had the right of a rematch to force a Grand Final. However, Canterbury were unsuccessful, going down 9\u201313 after leading 7\u20134 at half time.\n\nTheir loss of the 1947 campaign was, more than the lapse of 1943 to 1945, the end of their first successful period. With the retirement of the famous front three of [[Eddie Burns]], [[Roy Kirkaldy]] and Henry Porter (remarkably, none ever played for [[Australian national rugby league team|Australia]] owing to the war), Canterbury was unable to develop top-line players or attract established stars to its ranks, for the club's budget in this era was largely devoted to the establishment and development of their licensed club.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 49</ref> The club's financial position is the late 1950s was so precarious that only a loan from patron Stan Parry prevented the club from closing down.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 60</ref>\n\n[[Ron Willey]] was their sole Australian international between 1948 and 1962, but never played a Test match, whilst long-serving hooker [[Fred Anderson (rugby league)|Fred Anderson]] was the only Canterbury player between 1954 and 1962 to reach even State representation. Even a spell by Australian coach [[Vic Hey]] in 1955 and 1956,<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/coaches/vic-hey/summary.html Vic Hey: Coaching Summary]</ref> and the presence of other renowned mentors [[Col Geelan]] and Cec Cooper did not life the Berries up the ladder.\n\nIn 1948 they won only seven games, and after at one point looking like a surprise minor premiership in 1953 collapsed to never win more than six in a season from 1954 to 1959. Between 1952 and 1959 Canterbury were second last on five occasions (only [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] denying them the wooden spoon in four cases) but [[1960 NSWRFL season|in 1960]] under the coaching of club legend Burns they made the semis in an unparalleled ''four-way play-off''. However their finals campaign only lasted one match as they lost to [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] 16\u20139 in the second semi-final. In the following seasons, they slipped back down the ladder quickly: after beating Easts on 6 July 1963 they did not win again until 25 July 1964. However, the emergence of skillful fullback [[Les Johns]] gave them hope, and despite finishing third last in 1966, the next year they made the Grand Final.\n\nThe Berries' most persistent weakness during this long drought lay in attack: Canterbury did not score so many as fifty tries in any season between 1951 and 1969,<ref>AFL Tables; [http://afltables.com/rl/teams/canterbury/canterbury_ss.html Canterbury Season Summary]</ref> and between 1954 and 1961 the highest season's try tally by any individual Canterbury player was just seven by [[Rugby league positions#Five-eighth|five-eighth]] [[Ray Gartner]] in 1960.<ref>Rugby League Project; [http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/canterbury-bankstown-bulldogs/seasons.html Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs seasons]</ref> The Berries' one potential prolific tryscorer, winger and local junior Barry Stenhouse, suffered a career-ruining leg muscle injury in 1954,<ref>'Special Treatment for Stenhouse'; ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 18 June 1954, p. 8</ref> a season after scoring fourteen tries and sharing a ''Sydney Morning Herald'' \"Player of the Year\" award with Keith Holman.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 53</ref>\n\n==1967: the \"intercept\" Grand Final==\nIn 1967 Canterbury were captain-coached by tough forward [[Kevin Ryan (rugby league)|Kevin Ryan]], who had joined them from St George and helped them break his former club's extraordinary run of eleven straight premierships by beating them 12\u201311 in the preliminary final after being down 9-0 early on. Prior to this, Canterbury had finished third in the regular season, three points behind [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and four behind minor premiers St George. Their semi-final campaign started well, beating Easts 13\u20132, before victory over the Dragons. They lost to Souths in the premiership decider, in a match best remembered for [[Bob McCarthy]]'s intercept try. The match had been a close one, with Souths leading 10\u20138 at half time, before Canterbury drew level for much of the second half. Souths gained the lead four minutes from full-time with an [[Eric Simms (rugby league)|Eric Simms]] goal following a penalty for an incorrect scrum feed by Canterbury half [[Ross Kidd]]. For the losers, fullback Les Johns, second-rower [[Kevin Goldspink]] and centre [[Bob Hagan (rugby league)|Bob Hagan]] all stood out.\n\n==Reformation and rebuilding years==\nThe following few years saw mixed fortunes for the club on the field, with a sudden decline in 1968 and 1969 followed by a semi-final berth in 1970 (though they immediately bowed out by losing 12\u20137 to St George) and a return to mid-table in 1971 and 1972. However, off the field the club was developing administrative strength that would restore it to the status of a \"power\" for the following thirty seasons.\n\nCanterbury made the semis again in 1973, coming fifth in the first year the competition had a final five rather than four. Though they lost to [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], this heralded better times as the club made the semis every year for the rest of the decade, apart from 1977 when the team was heavily hit by injuries.\n\n1974 proved more promising, as the club finished third on the ladder behind a runaway [[Sydney Roosters|Roosters]] outfit coached by [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]], and [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly]]. They then defeated both clubs \u2013 Manly 20\u201314 and Easts 19\u201317 to be the first through to the Grand Final. However, missed opportunities in an initially tight game lead to a 19\u20134 defeat. This had been the first Premiership decider Canterbury had played in since 1967.\n\n==The Entertainers==\n[[Peter \"Bullfrog\" Moore]] was the top administrator at the Canterbury Bulldogs from 1970 to 1995. During this time the Bulldogs climbed to the very top of the game. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Bulldogs under coach [[Ted Glossop]] who came to the club in 1978 played an exciting and skilful brand of football that got them named '''The Entertainers'''. With brilliant halfback [[Steve Mortimer]] the linchpin, the Bulldogs as they were to be named in 1978 played a brand of football that was the envy of the Sydney Premiership.\n\nThe arrival of youngster [[Steve Mortimer]] and veteran [[Bob McCarthy]] in 1976 signalled a new beginning at the Bulldogs. McCarthy only had two seasons at Canterbury but his experience, knowledge and effect left a lasting impression with a new generation of forwards coming through the ranks, which included [[Steve Folkes]], [[Graeme Hughes]] and Geoff Robinson.\n\nHints of future heroics came in 1976, Canterbury scraped into the final five, finishing fifth, then beat Easts and St George before losing to Manly 15\u201312 at the last hurdle before the Grand Final, a Bob Fulton field goal breaking hearts late in the match.\n\nThe Bulldogs started off with promise but missed the semis in 1977, losing four out of their last five regular season matches and finishing seventh. They then scraped into fifth position again for 1978, but were the first team out of the playoffs losing 22\u201315 to [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]].\n\nThey came fifth for a third time in four years in 1979, with the following four weeks of Finals in 1979 proving to be a turning point for the club and the beginning of their great success in the 1980s. Inspired by Mortimer and led by Test captain [[George Peponis]], the Bulldogs disposed of [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]], [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] to make the Finals with some of Mortimer's tries leaving the public in awe of his genius. [[St. George Dragons|St George]] won the Grand Final 17\u201313 with the Bulldogs staging a great second half comeback after being down 17\u20132 at the break.\n\nThe 1980 season was a watershed year for the Bulldogs and they would win their first Premiership since 1942. Canterbury played consistent football all season to finish in a tie for top position with [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] having the superior for and against. The Bulldogs defeated [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] to make it through to the Grand Final having the week off. The Roosters were favoured to win the decider but the unheralded Bulldogs pack outmuscled the Roosters pack with [[Steve Mortimer]] doing the rest. Mortimer completely outplayed opposing half [[Kevin Hastings]] with the Bulldogs winning 18\u20134. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] scored the Bulldogs first try but the Grand Final will always be remembered for [[Steve Gearin]]'s performance where he landed six goals from six attempts and scored one of the all-time greatest tries in Grand Final history. Gearin chased through a [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]] by fullback [[Greg Brentnall]] 40 m out and caught the ball in mid-air despite the best attempts from Hastings and David Michael to prevent the try. The Grand Final was also famous for the three Mortimer and three Hughes brothers playing in the clash.\n\nAs premiers, the Bulldogs did not buy significantly in the following couple of years and paid the penalty. Crippled with injuries they fell to tenth in 1981, and in 1982 stood ninth among 14 clubs in a newly expanded competition. Despite finishing third in 1983, the gap between Parramatta and Manly and the rest of the Premiership was massive. The style of football that worked for Canterbury in 1979-80 was now outdated with the club looking in a new direction. [[Warren Ryan]] would be appointed coach and the Bulldogs would quickly go from the ''Entertainers'' to the ''Enforcers'' in very quick time.\n\n==\"Wozzaball\"==\nAt the end of 1983 the board decided to go on a major rebuilding exercise. New coach [[Warren Ryan]] was brought on board, together with a collection of new players. Some of the major signings by Ryan and Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] included 1983 Dally M Player of the Year [[Terry Lamb]] and [[Brian Battese]] from Wests, [[Queensland]] forward [[Darryl Brohman]] from Penrith, hooker [[Mark Bugden]], [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] and [[Peter Kelly (rugby league)|Peter Kelly]] from [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], and prop [[Peter Tunks]] from Souths. The Bulldogs went from the \"Entertainers\" to the \"Enforcers\". Young fullback [[Mick Potter]]'s form led to him becoming 1984 Dally M Player of the Year. The Bulldogs finished the season as minor premiers four points in front of rivals St. George and Parramatta. They beat the Eels in the major semi-final 16\u20138 before marking their fiftieth season by beating them again for the 1984 Premiership. However, it did not come without controversy. Ryan would drop long serving veterans [[Garry Hughes]] and club captain [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] to reserve grade.\n\nThe Bulldogs success over the coming five seasons was achieved using a new aggressive, defensively oriented way of playing, later named by some as \"Wozzaball\". This brand of football worked with Canterbury nullifying the attacking skil of Parramatta to win the decider 6\u20134 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n\nThe Bulldogs started the next year patchily but won their last seven matches to lie third on the ladder at the end of the regular season behind minor premiers St George and Balmain. They accounted for Balmain 14\u20138 before being beaten by the Dragons 17\u20136. Then they comprehensively crushed Parramatta 26\u20130 before making it back-to-back titles when they defeated St. George 7\u20136 in the Grand Final. Led by captain [[Steve Mortimer]], the Bulldogs constantly [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]]ed St. George, which forced a rule change in the catching of the ball in the in goal area. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nFinishing third in the regular season behind Parramatta and a rejuvenated Souths, the Bulldogs could not follow up with a hat-trick of titles losing the 1986 Grand Final 4\u20132 to the [[Parramatta Eels|Eels]] in a classic game of football. No tries were scored as both sides tackled as their lives depended on it.\n\nRyan's era at Canterbury ended after the 1987 season when he left the club on bad terms after the Bulldogs narrowly missed the semi-finals for the first time since 1982 \u2013 despite Ryan's success from 1984 until 1986. He is the only Canterbury coach to win two Premierships and when the Bulldogs named their greatest side in 2004, no coach was named, which many believe should have been Ryan. Others believed that Ryan was simply a professional coach rather than a \"true\" Bulldog and the choice of Moore as Manager of the greatest ever side was more appropriate.\n\n[[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] succeeded Ryan as coach and in his first year was in charge as the Bulldogs won the 1988 Grand Final against the Ryan-coached [[Balmain Tigers]] 24\u201312, the first at the new [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. It was a great and consistent season following the disappointment in 1987. 1988 also marked the final season for Canterbury legend [[Steve Mortimer]], who stood down as captain after Round 4. Mortimer suffered a broken wrist in the second last round but was fit enough to play-off the bench in the Grand Final victory. Mortimer retired with a club record 267 first grade games next to his name and at the time the most first grade games for one individual club. Mortimer captained the club to Premiership success in 1984 and 1985 and was a member of the 1980 and 1988 triumphs. He captained [[New South Wales]] in three [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] matches, winning all of them, giving the Blues their first triumph in 1985.\n\n==Chris Anderson Era==\n{{unbalanced|date=December 2010}}\nThe \"Wozzaball\" era came to an end in 1989 when the Bulldogs struggled and Gould left the club to join [[Penrith Panthers]]. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] returned as coach for the 1990 season and cleaned out the Ryan era, building the club around another club great in [[Terry Lamb]].\n\nAnderson had left the Bulldogs in 1984 and played the remaining years of his career with [[Halifax RLFC]] where he was captain-coach. Anderson intended to return to Canterbury but his commitments with Halifax in 1987-88 meant he could not take on the coaching position until 1989. Phil Gould's success in 1988 saw Anderson take on the Under 21s position in 1989 and he was promoted to first grade, which saw Gould leave on bad terms and join the [[Penrith Panthers]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nOne of Anderson's first jobs as first grade coach was appoint [[Terry Lamb]] as captain ahead of [[Paul Langmack]]. This caused some controversy at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Anderson was in the first stages of cleaning out the \"Wozzaball\" era and built his team around Lamb. [[Warren Ryan]], now coaching Western Suburbs, would snare four former Canterbury players Langmack, [[Andrew Farrar]], [[David Gillespie]] and Joe Thomas whilst [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]] followed Gould to [[Penrith Panthers]] and Jason Alchin joined [[St. George Dragons]].\n\nThe Bulldogs enjoyed encouraging results in 1991 led by Lamb with support from 1991 [[Rothmans Medal]] winner [[Ewan McGrady]] and \"the Welsh Wizard\" [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] with youngsters such as [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Jarrod McCracken]], [[Dean Pay]] and [[Simon Gillies]] coming through the ranks. The Bulldogs were inconsistent in 1992 and [[Peter Bullfrog Moore]] went on a recruitment drive snaring [[Martin Bella]], [[Jim Dymock]], [[Jim Serdaris]] and [[Gary Connolly]]. Canterbury won the Minor Premiership with Lamb leading the way but they fell short in the Finals losing to [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nGoal kicking wizard [[Daryl Halligan]] joined the Bulldogs in 1994 and he booted a then club record of 270 points including the match-winning drop goal in the 1994 Major Semi-Final against [[Canberra Raiders]] at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. [[Darren Britt]] and [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] emerged as leading players. Canberra were far too good on Grand Final day winning 36\u201312 with [[Mal Meninga]] enjoying a great exit from the game.\n\nCanterbury were confident heading into the 1995 season with a new home at Parramatta Stadium but the uproar of the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League War]] caused [[Jim Dymock]], [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]], and [[Jarrod McCracken]] to announce mid-season they were to leave the club. Their form before Super League was patchy and it was to get worse with demoralising losses against Manly 26\u20130, 19th place Parramatta, Newcastle 42-0 and Auckland 29-8 putting the season in doubt. Two major turning points was the switch of the final round match against [[North Queensland Cowboys]] to [[Belmore Sports Ground]] and [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] dropping Kiwi International [[Jarrod McCracken]] to reserve grade. Anderson would later omit McCracken from the overall squad. The Bulldogs walloped the Cowboys in a club record 66\u20134 victory and laid the platform for the Finals ahead.\n\nThe Bulldogs defeated the [[St. George Dragons]] 12\u20138, the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 24\u201310, and the 1994 Premiers [[Canberra Raiders]] 25\u20136. The Grand Final saw them up against the ARL's pin-up club [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] in an ultimate Super League-ARL match. The Bulldogs were never headed winning 17\u20134 with Lamb leading the way in an inspirational (and controversial) performance. One of the tryscorers that day for Canterbury was future club captain, [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]], who was starting in only his 3rd first grade match.\n\nThe Anderson-Lamb coach-captain era at the Bulldogs lasted six seasons and they worked on a very successful rebuilding programme. Lamb announced his retirement after the Grand Final but would play on for another year in 1996 to help the sudden loss of players due to the ARL departures. Lamb however decided not to stand for the leadership leaving it for [[Simon Gillies]]. When Gillies was injured, Lamb again opted not to be captain with [[Darren Britt]] taking control for the final nine matches. Lamb's six seasons as Canterbury captain saw the club rebuild and emerge back again as a force following the great 1980s era and Lamb in 2004 would be named captain in Canterbury's 'Greatest Ever Team'.\n\nAnother era ended following the 1995 season with the retirement of Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] after 26 years in power. Moore came into power in 1969 with the backing of captain-coach [[Kevin Ryan (rugby)|Kevin Ryan]] and brought in a complete reformation of the Bulldogs club, which saw it emerge as a competitive force in the 1970s and a [[rugby league]] powerhouse in the 1980s. Moore took on a position as [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] recruitment officer and he would retain his position on the Canterbury Leagues Club board until 1998. He was first diagnosed with cancer in 1998 and beat the first round but it returned in 2000 and lost his battle for life on 5 July. Moore's record at Canterbury was five Premierships and nine Grand Finals in 26 seasons.\n\n===Super League War===\nWhen the Canterbury administration saw the [[Super League war]] on the horizon they re-branded the club the \"Sydney Bulldogs\". The Bulldogs were one of the clubs most damaged by the big split in Australian rugby league and lost five key players for the [[1996 ARL season|1996 season]] with [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league footballer)|Jason Smith]], [[Jim Dymock]] and [[Jarrod McCracken]] joining arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] and [[Brett Dallas]] linking with [[North Sydney Bears]]. The Bulldogs were a shadow of their three previous seasons in 1996 and scrambled to finish 10th in the ARL Premiership.\n\nThe [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997 season]] saw Canterbury play in the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] competition and was the first without club legend [[Terry Lamb]] who finally hung up the boots after 349 first grade matches. The Bulldogs finished in fifth position in the ten-team competition. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] quit the club at the end of the 1997 after a lifetime of service as a player and coach. Anderson joined the newly formed [[Melbourne Storm]] with reserve grade coach [[Steve Folkes]] taking over the head coaching position.\n\nSuper League and the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] compromised at the end of 1997 and formed the [[National Rugby League]], which saw Canterbury playing arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]], [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] once again.\n\nThe Bulldogs struggled in 1998 as the effects from the [[Super League War]] and the retirement of [[Terry Lamb]] were still being felt. [[Simon Gillies]] was replaced mid-season as captain by [[Darren Britt]] and that sparked a Bulldogs revival. Canterbury won their last four matches to scrape into ninth position as the [[National Rugby League]] that season used a \"Top 10\" Finals format.\n\nJust prior to the Finals, it was revealed that former Chief Executive [[Peter \"Bullfrog\" Moore|Peter Moore]] was diagnosed with cancer. The Bulldogs lifted to new levels as an inspiration to 'Bullfrog' and in the first two weeks of the Finals defeated [[St. George Dragons]] 20-12 (ultimately their last match as a stand-alone club) and [[North Sydney Bears]] 23\u201312, both victories on away soil. The followed week without [[Craig Polla-Mounter]] the Bulldogs came from 16-0 down to defeat the [[Andrew Johns]] [[Newcastle Knights]] 28\u201316 with the scores locked at 16-all at full-time.\n\nThe most famous{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} semi-final came the next week against arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] with Pay, Dymock, Smith and McCracken in their line up. The Eels led 18\u20132 with 11 minutes remaining before [[Craig Polla-Mounter]] inspired a comeback. Canterbury scored three tries in the period of seven minutes to bring it back to 18\u201316 with [[Daryl Halligan]] landing a sideline goal to level up the scores before Polla-Mounter nearly snatched a win in regular time with a heart-stopping field goal just falling under the cross-bar. The Bulldogs got a 32\u201320 victory.\n\n[[Brisbane Broncos]] won the Grand Final 38-12 (after leading 12\u201310 at half time). The [[Super League War]] was now forgotten in a short period of time as they forged into a new era under the guidance of coach [[Steve Folkes]].\n\nThe 1998 season also marked the farewell to [[Belmore Sports Ground]] as the Bulldogs home ground. The decision to leave Belmore upset many of the Bulldogs' loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Belmore was Canterbury's home for 547 matches between 1936\u201398 and they had a great record on home soil. Belmore was also the home ground for the [[Parramatta Eels]] between 1982-85 as their new stadium was being built and [[St. George Dragons]] played at Belmore in 1988. Only the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], Sydney Sports Ground and [[North Sydney Oval]] have hosted more Premiership games than [[Belmore Sports Ground]]. Overall, Belmore hosted 602 Premiership games.\n\nDespite opposition from many supporters{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}, Canterbury moved to [[Telstra Stadium]] for the 1999 season and finished the Premiership rounds in fifth position with confidence gained from the Finals success in 1998 and signing new recruits [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Bradley Clyde]] and [[Ricky Stuart]]. The Bulldogs were defeated in the second week of the Finals with [[Melbourne Storm]]'s [[Matt Geyer]] swooping on a Stuart kick to seal victory in the dying minutes of the game.\n\nIn 1998 the Bulldogs won the [[President's Cup (rugby league)|President's Cup]] competition.\n\n==The Salary Cap==\n{{main|2002 Bulldogs RLFC season}}\nThe Bulldogs fallout from a disappointing 2000 season saw a \"new breed\" of players coming through for 2001. The Bulldogs' outfit aged badly in 2000 with many players past their best and a massive cleanout happened with several new players on the way including [[Nigel Vagana]], [[Luke Patten]], [[Brett Howland]] and [[Darrell Trindall]]. The Bulldogs finished the Minor Premiership in second position but crashed out of the Finals. The Dally M Rookie of the Year that season was [[Braith Anasta]]. [[Mark O'Meley]] was signed up for the 2002 season as the club said farewell to captain [[Darren Britt]] and his deputy [[Craig Polla-Mounter]]. With both of those gone, [[Steve Folkes]] opted for [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]] as captain ahead of the more experienced [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]].\n\nTrouble returned in a big way in 2002, with the Club being found guilty of [[salary cap]] breaches described by NRL Chief Executive David Gallop as \"exceptional in both its size and its deliberate and ongoing nature\". The club received a $500,000 fine, and was stripped of all 37 competition points; the club, who were poised to take the Minor Premiership and had won 17 consecutive matches, won the wooden spoon as a result.\n\nClub legend [[Steve Mortimer]] was brought in to save the Club, and the Bulldogs then finished one game short of the Grand Final in 2003.\n\n==Gang rape allegation==\nAt the start to the [[National Rugby League season 2004|2004 season]] a major off-field scandal allegedly involving Bulldogs players in [[Coffs Harbour]].

Former Test forward [[Bradley Clyde]] was named the new Football Manager and News Limited Executive [[Malcolm Noad]] taking over from Mortimer. The controversy was considered a major public relations nightmare for the club with significant media coverage. The [[National Rugby League|NRL]] announced that the Bulldogs would be fined $150,000, and an additional $350,000 if there were any other allegations of off-field misbehaviour before the end of the 2004 season. NRL chief executive officer David Gallop said that the fine had been imposed because during the months of media scrutiny the club had failed to behave \"in a way which protected the game's image\".<ref name=\"NRL fine\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1096854.htm|title=NRL fines Bulldogs for Coffs Harbour incident|last=Foschia|first=Liz|date=28 April 2004|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1096854.htm PM - NRL fines Bulldogs for Coffs Harbour incident]</ref> In 2006, Bulldogs chief executive Malcolm Noad said that the allegations had led to the loss of millions of dollars of sponsorship money, and to continuing negative beliefs in the community about Bulldogs players and supporters.

The Bulldogs season started slowly but they worked their way into being genuine Premiership contenders, which included big wins against the [[Sydney Roosters]], [[Penrith Panthers]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]] to finish the regular season on equal standing with eventual runners-up the Roosters, however due to points differential the Bulldogs were deemed to have finished second.\n\nFinals newcomers [[North Queensland Cowboys]] upset the Bulldogs 30\u201322 in the first week of the Finals. The Bulldogs powered past the [[Melbourne Storm]] 43\u201318 in the second week of the Finals. Three tries and five goals from [[Hazem El Masri]] saw the Bulldogs topple 2003 Premiers [[Penrith Panthers]] 30\u201314 in the Preliminary Final.\n\nThe Grand Final against the [[Sydney Roosters]] was always going to be a tense battle with neither club having much affection for the other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime to triumph 16\u201313. This victory saw desperate Bulldogs defence absorb much punishment and keep the Roosters scoreless for the entire second half. It was a sweet result for the Bulldogs after enduring a number of nightmare seasons on and off the field. It showed the great character in the club and the values that can't be bought or manufactured. To defeat the Roosters made it even sweeter considering the rivalry and backgrounds of both clubs. [[Matt Utai]] scored two tries with [[Hazem El Masri]] also scoring. [[Willie Mason]] was named Clive Churchill Medal Winner. Stand-in captain [[Andrew Ryan (rugby player)|Andrew Ryan]], who ultimately make the winning tackle, stopping Roosters forward [[Michael Crocker]] from scoring the final seconds of the match.\n\nWarriors-bound club captain [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]] missed the game due to injury sustained the week before in the semi-final victory against [[Penrith Panthers]]. Price's value and respect in the team was noticeable on Grand Final night when Ryan called up Price to hold the trophy and say a few words, whilst [[Johnathan Thurston]] gave Price his Grand Final ring.\n\nFollowing their Grand Final victory, the bulldogs traveled to England to play in the [[2005 World Club Challenge]] against [[Super League]] premiers, the [[Leeds Rhinos]]. The match was played on 4 February 2005 at [[Elland Road]] in front of 37,208 with the home team coming out winners in the end of a high-scoring match, with a final scoreline of 39\u201332.\n\n==Past decade==\nThe Bulldogs were unable to mount a serious defence of the title in [[National Rugby League season 2005|2005]] as injuries and contract negotiations saw the year start and finish on a sour note for the club. Due to the extent of injuries suffered, the team at times was unable to be at full-strength. This took its toll in the final six weeks of the season, the club suffering heavy losses and missing the finals series.\n\nIn [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006]], little was expected from the club after a lacklustre 2005 season, but despite some doubt over the strength of their side, the Bulldogs' impressive forward pack helped them to a better than expected result for the year, finishing just a game short of the Grand Final, in which they lost to eventual premiers the [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nThe [[National Rugby League season 2008|2008]] season was a tumultuous one for the Bulldogs. They finished at the bottom of the ladder, but the main news of the season was the controversial departure of star player [[Sonny Bill Williams]].\n\nA huge player recruitment drive saw the Bulldogs reverse their fortunes in the [[2009 NRL season]].  Canterbury finished in second place during the [[2009 NRL season|2009]] and made it all the way to the preliminary final before they were defeated by arch rivals the [[Parramatta Eels]] in front of a record non-grand final crowd of 74,549.

In May 2018, the new Canterbury board admitted that they would not be able to make any major signings until the end of the 2021 season due the salary cap drama engulfing the club.\n\nThe issue with the salary cap problems involved the previous administration and former coach [[Des Hasler]] who signed numerous players on back ended deals.  In the wake of the scandal, the club was forced to offload players to free up room in the cap.\n\nThis resulted in [[Moses Mbye]] departing for the [[Wests Tigers]] and star recruit [[Aaron Woods]] being sold to Cronulla after only signing with Canterbury months prior.  On 16 June 2018, Canterbury suffered a humiliating 32\u201310 loss to the [[Gold Coast Titans]] at Belmore, in the press conference coach Dean Pay said \"Physically, we just weren\u2019t good enough.

At the time it made them the quickest club (barring the founding clubs) to win a premiership after admission to the competition, a record which was only recently beaten in 1999 by the [[Melbourne Storm]]. They won a second premiership in 1942 but then had to wait another 38 years before breaking through for a third title in 1980. During the 1980s, the Bulldogs were a dominant force in the competition appearing in five Grand Finals, winning four of them. In the 1990s they featured in the 1994, 1995 and 1998 Grand Finals, winning the title in 1995 over Manly. Their most recent success was in 2004 when they beat the [[Sydney Roosters]] 16\u201313, the tryscorers being [[Hazem El Masri]] and Matt Utai, and the [[Clive Churchill Medal]] winner [[Willie Mason]].\n\n==Origin==\nThe [[Canterbury]]-[[Bankstown]] region in [[Sydney]]'s southwest had a thriving rugby league culture and local competition from 1922 onwards,<ref name=\"From\">Lester, Gary; ''From Berries to Bulldogs: Fifty Years of the Cantberury-Bankstown R.L.F.C.''; pp. 11-13 {{ISBN|9780949853066}}</ref> By 1930 the club had won the President's Cup competition<ref name=\"From\"/> and afterwards applied repeatedly to join the Sydney senior competition, finally being successful on 24 September 1934. The main barrier had been the lack of a suitable ground, which the NSWRL had set as a condition of entry. The club covered as territory the municipalities of Bankstown and Canterbury, taking them from St George and Western Suburbs. It would share the suburbs of Earlwood and Hurlstone Park with Newtown.<ref name=\"smh34\">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article136116132?searchTerm=%22Canterbury-Bankstown%22%20league&searchLimits=l-state=New+South+Wales|title=New First Grade League Club: Canterbury-Bankstown Elevated in Sydney |date=27 September 1934|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> It took part for the first time in 1935.\n\n==Debut season==\nCanterbury played its first premiership match against [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] on [[Anzac Day]], 25 April 1935 at [[North Sydney Oval]]. In a match refereed by Tom McMahon, North Sydney won by a margin of 20 points to 5. Scorers for Canterbury-Bankstown were a try to [[Jack Hartwell Sr.]] and a penalty goal to [[Tom Carey (rugby league)|Tom Carey]]. Hartwell was a prop forward, whilst Carey was a halfback or five-eighth who had been a Canterbury junior before playing with St George.\n\nThe first Canterbury team was: George Main, [[Vince Dwyer]], [[Jack Morrison (rugby league)|Jack Morrison]] (c), [[Sid Elliott]], Basil Crawford, Harry Brown, [[Tom Carey (rugby league)|Tom Carey]], [[Frank Sponberg]], [[Alan Wellington]], [[Jack McConnell (rugby league)|Jack McConnell]], [[Jack Hartwell Sr.]], [[Bob Lindfield]] and [[Fred Chaplin (rugby league)|Fred Chaplin]] and was coached by [[Tedda Courtney]].\n\nCanterbury's initial season was a remarkable one \u2013 for the wrong reasons. Playing without a home ground, the team suffered a number of massive losses, losing in successive weeks during May 6\u201391 to [[St George Dragons|St George]] and 7\u201387 to [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] \u2013 the two heaviest defeats in the history of the competition.<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_gr.html#1 Rugby League Tables: Biggest Wins] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717162122/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_gr.html#1 |date=17 July 2014 }}</ref> The club managed to avoid the wooden spoon by twice defeating the winless [[Sydney University rugby league team|University]], but still conceded 140 tries in sixteen matches or an average of 8.75 tries per game, which remains the second-highest figure in NSWRFL/NRL history behind the 9.08 tries per game conceded by University in their debut [[1920 NSWRFL season|1920 season]].<ref>[http://afltables.com/rl/teams/all/overall_sr.html Rugby League Tables: Season Records]</ref>\n\n==Early success==\nAfter the disastrous 1935 season, Canterbury became determined to achieve success and especially to improve the backline \u2013 the chief cause of the 1935 failures.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 22</ref> They bought fullback [[Tom Kirk (rugby league)|Tom Kirk]] from Tumut, centre and captain [[Alan Brady]] from Western Suburbs, threequarter [[Joe Gartner]] from Newtown and ex-Bluebag prop [[Henry Porter (rugby league)|Henry Porter]] from Goulburn. Along with champion coach [[Frank Burge]], these buys improved the Cantabs from 1935's two wins to nine in 1936, netting a place in the finals.\n\nIn 1938, the Cantabs suffered only one loss, and a first title, defeating former nemesis [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] 19\u20136 in the final. Instrumental in the club's success was the front row combination of props [[Eddie Burns]] and [[Henry Porter (rugby league footballer)|Henry Porter]] and hooker [[Roy Kirkaldy]]. The club also won the reserve grade premiership the same year. Canterbury made the grand final again in 1940 but lost to Easts 24\u201314. After long their semi-final in 1942, Canterbury finished on top of the ladder with Balmain in 1942, and secured the minor premiership after the NSWRL ruled that a play-off was necessary and they beat the Tigers 40\u201320. Canterbury were defeated by St George 35\u201310 in the semis, but as minor premiers had the right to challenge in a grand final which saw them defeat the Dragons 11\u20139 in wet conditions after the scores were even at half-time.\n\n==Decline as a Power==\nRemarkably \u2013 though largely due to the influence of [[World War II]] which deprived them of stars Porter and Newham, along with [[Bob Farrar]] and [[Bob Jackson (rugby league)|Bob Jackson]]<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 42</ref> \u2013 Canterbury fell from premiers in 1942 to wooden spooners in each of the following two seasons. As players returned from service in the war, the club did regain its strength, finishing sixth in 1945, third in 1946 and on top of the table in 1947. They finished the competition three points clear of the [[Balmain Tigers]] with Newtown and Wests making up the four. They beat Newtown 25\u201315 in the first semi but lost to Balmain 19\u201325 in the final. As they had been minor premiers, they had the right of a rematch to force a Grand Final. However, Canterbury were unsuccessful, going down 9\u201313 after leading 7\u20134 at half time.\n\nTheir loss of the 1947 campaign was, more than the lapse of 1943 to 1945, the end of their first successful period. With the retirement of the famous front three of [[Eddie Burns]], [[Roy Kirkaldy]] and Henry Porter (remarkably, none ever played for [[Australian national rugby league team|Australia]] owing to the war), Canterbury was unable to develop top-line players or attract established stars to its ranks, for the club's budget in this era was largely devoted to the establishment and development of their licensed club.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 49</ref> The club's financial position is the late 1950s was so precarious that only a loan from patron Stan Parry prevented the club from closing down.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 60</ref>\n\n[[Ron Willey]] was their sole Australian international between 1948 and 1962, but never played a Test match, whilst long-serving hooker [[Fred Anderson (rugby league)|Fred Anderson]] was the only Canterbury player between 1954 and 1962 to reach even State representation. Even a spell by Australian coach [[Vic Hey]] in 1955 and 1956,<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/coaches/vic-hey/summary.html Vic Hey: Coaching Summary]</ref> and the presence of other renowned mentors [[Col Geelan]] and Cec Cooper did not life the Berries up the ladder.\n\nIn 1948 they won only seven games, and after at one point looking like a surprise minor premiership in 1953 collapsed to never win more than six in a season from 1954 to 1959. Between 1952 and 1959 Canterbury were second last on five occasions (only [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] denying them the wooden spoon in four cases) but [[1960 NSWRFL season|in 1960]] under the coaching of club legend Burns they made the semis in an unparalleled ''four-way play-off''. However their finals campaign only lasted one match as they lost to [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] 16\u20139 in the second semi-final. In the following seasons, they slipped back down the ladder quickly: after beating Easts on 6 July 1963 they did not win again until 25 July 1964. However, the emergence of skillful fullback [[Les Johns]] gave them hope, and despite finishing third last in 1966, the next year they made the Grand Final.\n\nThe Berries' most persistent weakness during this long drought lay in attack: Canterbury did not score so many as fifty tries in any season between 1951 and 1969,<ref>AFL Tables; [http://afltables.com/rl/teams/canterbury/canterbury_ss.html Canterbury Season Summary]</ref> and between 1954 and 1961 the highest season's try tally by any individual Canterbury player was just seven by [[Rugby league positions#Five-eighth|five-eighth]] [[Ray Gartner]] in 1960.<ref>Rugby League Project; [http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/canterbury-bankstown-bulldogs/seasons.html Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs seasons]</ref> The Berries' one potential prolific tryscorer, winger and local junior Barry Stenhouse, suffered a career-ruining leg muscle injury in 1954,<ref>'Special Treatment for Stenhouse'; ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 18 June 1954, p. 8</ref> a season after scoring fourteen tries and sharing a ''Sydney Morning Herald'' \"Player of the Year\" award with Keith Holman.<ref>Lester; ''From Berries to Bulldogs''; p. 53</ref>\n\n==1967: the \"intercept\" Grand Final==\nIn 1967 Canterbury were captain-coached by tough forward [[Kevin Ryan (rugby league)|Kevin Ryan]], who had joined them from St George and helped them break his former club's extraordinary run of eleven straight premierships by beating them 12\u201311 in the preliminary final after being down 9-0 early on. Prior to this, Canterbury had finished third in the regular season, three points behind [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and four behind minor premiers St George. Their semi-final campaign started well, beating Easts 13\u20132, before victory over the Dragons. They lost to Souths in the premiership decider, in a match best remembered for [[Bob McCarthy]]'s intercept try. The match had been a close one, with Souths leading 10\u20138 at half time, before Canterbury drew level for much of the second half. Souths gained the lead four minutes from full-time with an [[Eric Simms (rugby league)|Eric Simms]] goal following a penalty for an incorrect scrum feed by Canterbury half [[Ross Kidd]]. For the losers, fullback Les Johns, second-rower [[Kevin Goldspink]] and centre [[Bob Hagan (rugby league)|Bob Hagan]] all stood out.\n\n==Reformation and rebuilding years==\nThe following few years saw mixed fortunes for the club on the field, with a sudden decline in 1968 and 1969 followed by a semi-final berth in 1970 (though they immediately bowed out by losing 12\u20137 to St George) and a return to mid-table in 1971 and 1972. However, off the field the club was developing administrative strength that would restore it to the status of a \"power\" for the following thirty seasons.\n\nCanterbury made the semis again in 1973, coming fifth in the first year the competition had a final five rather than four. Though they lost to [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], this heralded better times as the club made the semis every year for the rest of the decade, apart from 1977 when the team was heavily hit by injuries.\n\n1974 proved more promising, as the club finished third on the ladder behind a runaway [[Sydney Roosters|Roosters]] outfit coached by [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]], and [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly]]. They then defeated both clubs \u2013 Manly 20\u201314 and Easts 19\u201317 to be the first through to the Grand Final. However, missed opportunities in an initially tight game lead to a 19\u20134 defeat. This had been the first Premiership decider Canterbury had played in since 1967.\n\n==The Entertainers==\n[[Peter \"Bullfrog\" Moore]] was the top administrator at the Canterbury Bulldogs from 1970 to 1995. During this time the Bulldogs climbed to the very top of the game. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Bulldogs under coach [[Ted Glossop]] who came to the club in 1978 played an exciting and skilful brand of football that got them named '''The Entertainers'''. With brilliant halfback [[Steve Mortimer]] the linchpin, the Bulldogs as they were to be named in 1978 played a brand of football that was the envy of the Sydney Premiership.\n\nThe arrival of youngster [[Steve Mortimer]] and veteran [[Bob McCarthy]] in 1976 signalled a new beginning at the Bulldogs. McCarthy only had two seasons at Canterbury but his experience, knowledge and effect left a lasting impression with a new generation of forwards coming through the ranks, which included [[Steve Folkes]], [[Graeme Hughes]] and Geoff Robinson.\n\nHints of future heroics came in 1976, Canterbury scraped into the final five, finishing fifth, then beat Easts and St George before losing to Manly 15\u201312 at the last hurdle before the Grand Final, a Bob Fulton field goal breaking hearts late in the match.\n\nThe Bulldogs started off with promise but missed the semis in 1977, losing four out of their last five regular season matches and finishing seventh. They then scraped into fifth position again for 1978, but were the first team out of the playoffs losing 22\u201315 to [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]].\n\nThey came fifth for a third time in four years in 1979, with the following four weeks of Finals in 1979 proving to be a turning point for the club and the beginning of their great success in the 1980s. Inspired by Mortimer and led by Test captain [[George Peponis]], the Bulldogs disposed of [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]], [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] to make the Finals with some of Mortimer's tries leaving the public in awe of his genius. [[St. George Dragons|St George]] won the Grand Final 17\u201313 with the Bulldogs staging a great second half comeback after being down 17\u20132 at the break.\n\nThe 1980 season was a watershed year for the Bulldogs and they would win their first Premiership since 1942. Canterbury played consistent football all season to finish in a tie for top position with [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] having the superior for and against. The Bulldogs defeated [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests]] and [[Sydney Roosters|Easts]] to make it through to the Grand Final having the week off. The Roosters were favoured to win the decider but the unheralded Bulldogs pack outmuscled the Roosters pack with [[Steve Mortimer]] doing the rest. Mortimer completely outplayed opposing half [[Kevin Hastings]] with the Bulldogs winning 18\u20134. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] scored the Bulldogs first try but the Grand Final will always be remembered for [[Steve Gearin]]'s performance where he landed six goals from six attempts and scored one of the all-time greatest tries in Grand Final history. Gearin chased through a [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]] by fullback [[Greg Brentnall]] 40 m out and caught the ball in mid-air despite the best attempts from Hastings and David Michael to prevent the try. The Grand Final was also famous for the three Mortimer and three Hughes brothers playing in the clash.\n\nAs premiers, the Bulldogs did not buy significantly in the following couple of years and paid the penalty. Crippled with injuries they fell to tenth in 1981, and in 1982 stood ninth among 14 clubs in a newly expanded competition. Despite finishing third in 1983, the gap between Parramatta and Manly and the rest of the Premiership was massive. The style of football that worked for Canterbury in 1979-80 was now outdated with the club looking in a new direction. [[Warren Ryan]] would be appointed coach and the Bulldogs would quickly go from the ''Entertainers'' to the ''Enforcers'' in very quick time.\n\n==\"Wozzaball\"==\nAt the end of 1983 the board decided to go on a major rebuilding exercise. New coach [[Warren Ryan]] was brought on board, together with a collection of new players. Some of the major signings by Ryan and Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] included 1983 Dally M Player of the Year [[Terry Lamb]] and [[Brian Battese]] from Wests, [[Queensland]] forward [[Darryl Brohman]] from Penrith, hooker [[Mark Bugden]], [[Phil Gould]] and [[Peter Kelly (rugby league)|Peter Kelly]] from [[Newtown Jets|Newtown]], and prop [[Peter Tunks]] from Souths. The Bulldogs went from the \"Entertainers\" to the \"Enforcers\". Young fullback [[Mick Potter]]'s form led to him becoming 1984 Dally M Player of the Year. The Bulldogs finished the season as minor premiers four points in front of rivals St. George and Parramatta. They beat the Eels in the major semi-final 16\u20138 before marking their fiftieth season by beating them again for the 1984 Premiership. However, it did not come without controversy. Ryan would drop long serving veterans [[Garry Hughes]] and club captain [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] to reserve grade.\n\nThe Bulldogs success over the coming five seasons was achieved using a new aggressive, defensively oriented way of playing, later named by some as \"Wozzaball\". This brand of football worked with Canterbury nullifying the attacking skil of Parramatta to win the decider 6\u20134 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n\nThe Bulldogs started the next year patchily but won their last seven matches to lie third on the ladder at the end of the regular season behind minor premiers St George and Balmain. They accounted for Balmain 14\u20138 before being beaten by the Dragons 17\u20136. Then they comprehensively crushed Parramatta 26\u20130 before making it back-to-back titles when they defeated St. George 7\u20136 in the Grand Final. Led by captain [[Steve Mortimer]], the Bulldogs constantly [[Bomb (kick)|bomb]]ed St. George, which forced a rule change in the catching of the ball in the in goal area. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nFinishing third in the regular season behind Parramatta and a rejuvenated Souths, the Bulldogs could not follow up with a hat-trick of titles losing the 1986 Grand Final 4\u20132 to the [[Parramatta Eels|Eels]] in a classic game of football. No tries were scored as both sides tackled as their lives depended on it.\n\nRyan's era at Canterbury ended after the 1987 season when he left the club on bad terms after the Bulldogs narrowly missed the semi-finals for the first time since 1982 \u2013 despite Ryan's success from 1984 until 1986. He is the only Canterbury coach to win two Premierships and when the Bulldogs named their greatest side in 2004, no coach was named, which many believe should have been Ryan. Others believed that Ryan was simply a professional coach rather than a \"true\" Bulldog and the choice of Moore as Manager of the greatest ever side was more appropriate.\n\n[[Phil Gould]] succeeded Ryan as coach and in his first year was in charge as the Bulldogs won the 1988 Grand Final against the Ryan-coached [[Balmain Tigers]] 24\u201312, the first at the new [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. It was a great and consistent season following the disappointment in 1987. 1988 also marked the final season for Canterbury legend [[Steve Mortimer]], who stood down as captain after Round 4. Mortimer suffered a broken wrist in the second last round but was fit enough to play-off the bench in the Grand Final victory. Mortimer retired with a club record 267 first grade games next to his name and at the time the most first grade games for one individual club. Mortimer captained the club to Premiership success in 1984 and 1985 and was a member of the 1980 and 1988 triumphs. He captained [[New South Wales]] in three [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] matches, winning all of them, giving the Blues their first triumph in 1985.\n\n==Chris Anderson Era==\n{{unbalanced|date=December 2010}}\nThe \"Wozzaball\" era came to an end in 1989 when the Bulldogs struggled and Gould left the club to join [[Penrith Panthers]]. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] returned as coach for the 1990 season and cleaned out the Ryan era, building the club around another club great in [[Terry Lamb]].\n\nAnderson had left the Bulldogs in 1984 and played the remaining years of his career with [[Halifax RLFC]] where he was captain-coach. Anderson intended to return to Canterbury but his commitments with Halifax in 1987-88 meant he could not take on the coaching position until 1989. Phil Gould's success in 1988 saw Anderson take on the Under 21s position in 1989 and he was promoted to first grade, which saw Gould leave on bad terms and join the [[Penrith Panthers]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nOne of Anderson's first jobs as first grade coach was appoint [[Terry Lamb]] as captain ahead of [[Paul Langmack]]. This caused some controversy at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Anderson was in the first stages of cleaning out the \"Wozzaball\" era and built his team around Lamb. [[Warren Ryan]], now coaching Western Suburbs, would snare four former Canterbury players Langmack, [[Andrew Farrar]], [[David Gillespie]] and Joe Thomas whilst [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]] followed Gould to [[Penrith Panthers]] and Jason Alchin joined [[St. George Dragons]].\n\nThe Bulldogs enjoyed encouraging results in 1991 led by Lamb with support from 1991 [[Rothmans Medal]] winner [[Ewan McGrady]] and \"the Welsh Wizard\" [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] with youngsters such as [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Jarrod McCracken]], [[Dean Pay]] and [[Simon Gillies]] coming through the ranks. The Bulldogs were inconsistent in 1992 and [[Peter Bullfrog Moore]] went on a recruitment drive snaring [[Martin Bella]], [[Jim Dymock]], [[Jim Serdaris]] and [[Gary Connolly]]. Canterbury won the Minor Premiership with Lamb leading the way but they fell short in the Finals losing to [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nGoal kicking wizard [[Daryl Halligan]] joined the Bulldogs in 1994 and he booted a then club record of 270 points including the match-winning drop goal in the 1994 Major Semi-Final against [[Canberra Raiders]] at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. [[Darren Britt]] and [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] emerged as leading players. Canberra were far too good on Grand Final day winning 36\u201312 with [[Mal Meninga]] enjoying a great exit from the game.\n\nCanterbury were confident heading into the 1995 season with a new home at Parramatta Stadium but the uproar of the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League War]] caused [[Jim Dymock]], [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]], and [[Jarrod McCracken]] to announce mid-season they were to leave the club. Their form before Super League was patchy and it was to get worse with demoralising losses against Manly 26\u20130, 19th place Parramatta, Newcastle 42-0 and Auckland 29-8 putting the season in doubt. Two major turning points was the switch of the final round match against [[North Queensland Cowboys]] to [[Belmore Sports Ground]] and [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] dropping Kiwi International [[Jarrod McCracken]] to reserve grade. Anderson would later omit McCracken from the overall squad. The Bulldogs walloped the Cowboys in a club record 66\u20134 victory and laid the platform for the Finals ahead.\n\nThe Bulldogs defeated the [[St. George Dragons]] 12\u20138, the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 24\u201310, and the 1994 Premiers [[Canberra Raiders]] 25\u20136. The Grand Final saw them up against the ARL's pin-up club [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] in an ultimate Super League-ARL match. The Bulldogs were never headed winning 17\u20134 with Lamb leading the way in an inspirational (and controversial) performance. One of the tryscorers that day for Canterbury was future club captain, [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]], who was starting in only his 3rd first grade match.\n\nThe Anderson-Lamb coach-captain era at the Bulldogs lasted six seasons and they worked on a very successful rebuilding programme. Lamb announced his retirement after the Grand Final but would play on for another year in 1996 to help the sudden loss of players due to the ARL departures. Lamb however decided not to stand for the leadership leaving it for [[Simon Gillies]]. When Gillies was injured, Lamb again opted not to be captain with [[Darren Britt]] taking control for the final nine matches. Lamb's six seasons as Canterbury captain saw the club rebuild and emerge back again as a force following the great 1980s era and Lamb in 2004 would be named captain in Canterbury's 'Greatest Ever Team'.\n\nAnother era ended following the 1995 season with the retirement of Chief Executive [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]] after 26 years in power. Moore came into power in 1969 with the backing of captain-coach [[Kevin Ryan (rugby)|Kevin Ryan]] and brought in a complete reformation of the Bulldogs club, which saw it emerge as a competitive force in the 1970s and a [[rugby league]] powerhouse in the 1980s. Moore took on a position as [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] recruitment officer and he would retain his position on the Canterbury Leagues Club board until 1998. He was first diagnosed with cancer in 1998 and beat the first round but it returned in 2000 and lost his battle for life on 5 July. Moore's record at Canterbury was five Premierships and nine Grand Finals in 26 seasons.\n\n===Super League War===\nWhen the Canterbury administration saw the [[Super League war]] on the horizon they re-branded the club the \"Sydney Bulldogs\". The Bulldogs were one of the clubs most damaged by the big split in Australian rugby league and lost five key players for the [[1996 ARL season|1996 season]] with [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league footballer)|Jason Smith]], [[Jim Dymock]] and [[Jarrod McCracken]] joining arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] and [[Brett Dallas]] linking with [[North Sydney Bears]]. The Bulldogs were a shadow of their three previous seasons in 1996 and scrambled to finish 10th in the ARL Premiership.\n\nThe [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997 season]] saw Canterbury play in the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] competition and was the first without club legend [[Terry Lamb]] who finally hung up the boots after 349 first grade matches. The Bulldogs finished in fifth position in the ten-team competition. [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] quit the club at the end of the 1997 after a lifetime of service as a player and coach. Anderson joined the newly formed [[Melbourne Storm]] with reserve grade coach [[Steve Folkes]] taking over the head coaching position.\n\nSuper League and the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] compromised at the end of 1997 and formed the [[National Rugby League]], which saw Canterbury playing arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]], [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] once again.\n\nThe Bulldogs struggled in 1998 as the effects from the [[Super League War]] and the retirement of [[Terry Lamb]] were still being felt. [[Simon Gillies]] was replaced mid-season as captain by [[Darren Britt]] and that sparked a Bulldogs revival. Canterbury won their last four matches to scrape into ninth position as the [[National Rugby League]] that season used a \"Top 10\" Finals format.\n\nJust prior to the Finals, it was revealed that former Chief Executive [[Peter \"Bullfrog\" Moore|Peter Moore]] was diagnosed with cancer. The Bulldogs lifted to new levels as an inspiration to 'Bullfrog' and in the first two weeks of the Finals defeated [[St. George Dragons]] 20-12 (ultimately their last match as a stand-alone club) and [[North Sydney Bears]] 23\u201312, both victories on away soil. The followed week without [[Craig Polla-Mounter]] the Bulldogs came from 16-0 down to defeat the [[Andrew Johns]] [[Newcastle Knights]] 28\u201316 with the scores locked at 16-all at full-time.\n\nThe most famous{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} semi-final came the next week against arch-rivals [[Parramatta Eels]] with Pay, Dymock, Smith and McCracken in their line up. The Eels led 18\u20132 with 11 minutes remaining before [[Craig Polla-Mounter]] inspired a comeback. Canterbury scored three tries in the period of seven minutes to bring it back to 18\u201316 with [[Daryl Halligan]] landing a sideline goal to level up the scores before Polla-Mounter nearly snatched a win in regular time with a heart-stopping field goal just falling under the cross-bar. The Bulldogs got a 32\u201320 victory.\n\n[[Brisbane Broncos]] won the Grand Final 38-12 (after leading 12\u201310 at half time). The [[Super League War]] was now forgotten in a short period of time as they forged into a new era under the guidance of coach [[Steve Folkes]].\n\nThe 1998 season also marked the farewell to [[Belmore Sports Ground]] as the Bulldogs home ground. The decision to leave Belmore upset many of the Bulldogs' loyal supporters as the ground had so much history to it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Belmore was Canterbury's home for 547 matches between 1936\u201398 and they had a great record on home soil. Belmore was also the home ground for the [[Parramatta Eels]] between 1982-85 as their new stadium was being built and [[St. George Dragons]] played at Belmore in 1988. Only the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], Sydney Sports Ground and [[North Sydney Oval]] have hosted more Premiership games than [[Belmore Sports Ground]]. Overall, Belmore hosted 602 Premiership games.\n\nDespite opposition from many supporters{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}, Canterbury moved to [[Telstra Stadium]] for the 1999 season and finished the Premiership rounds in fifth position with confidence gained from the Finals success in 1998 and signing new recruits [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]], [[Bradley Clyde]] and [[Ricky Stuart]]. The Bulldogs were defeated in the second week of the Finals with [[Melbourne Storm]]'s [[Matt Geyer]] swooping on a Stuart kick to seal victory in the dying minutes of the game.\n\nIn 1998 the Bulldogs won the [[President's Cup (rugby league)|President's Cup]] competition.\n\n==The Salary Cap==\n{{main|2002 Bulldogs RLFC season}}\nThe Bulldogs fallout from a disappointing 2000 season saw a \"new breed\" of players coming through for 2001. The Bulldogs' outfit aged badly in 2000 with many players past their best and a massive cleanout happened with several new players on the way including [[Nigel Vagana]], [[Luke Patten]], [[Brett Howland]] and [[Darrell Trindall]]. The Bulldogs finished the Minor Premiership in second position but crashed out of the Finals. The Dally M Rookie of the Year that season was [[Braith Anasta]]. [[Mark O'Meley]] was signed up for the 2002 season as the club said farewell to captain [[Darren Britt]] and his deputy [[Craig Polla-Mounter]]. With both of those gone, [[Steve Folkes]] opted for [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]] as captain ahead of the more experienced [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]].\n\nTrouble returned in a big way in 2002, with the Club being found guilty of [[salary cap]] breaches described by NRL Chief Executive David Gallop as \"exceptional in both its size and its deliberate and ongoing nature\". The club received a $500,000 fine, and was stripped of all 37 competition points; the club, who were poised to take the Minor Premiership and had won 17 consecutive matches, won the wooden spoon as a result.\n\nClub legend [[Steve Mortimer]] was brought in to save the Club, and the Bulldogs then finished one game short of the Grand Final in 2003.\n\n==Gang rape allegation==\nAt the start to the [[National Rugby League season 2004|2004 season]] a major off-field scandal allegedly involving Bulldogs players in [[Coffs Harbour]]. A number of unidentified players were accused of [[Types of rape#Group rape|gang raping]] a 20-year-old woman at a resort in [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales|Coffs Harbour]], [[New South Wales]].<ref>{{Cite news\n |last=abc.net.au \n |title=Bulldogs' accuser gives statement to police \n |work=ABC News \n |place=Australia \n |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] \n |date=24 February 2004 \n |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/australia/nsw/200402/s1051920.htm \n |accessdate=6 March 2011 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629005311/http://www.abc.net.au/news/australia/nsw/200402/s1051920.htm \n |archivedate=29 June 2011 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> The woman filed a complaint with Coffs Harbour police alleging that she had been vaginally, orally and anally raped by multiple members of the Bulldogs team in the pool area of the Pacific Bay Resort, where the team had been staying, in the early hours of Sunday 22 February.<ref name=\"Age initial article\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/28/1077677017509.html|title=Rugby rocked by fresh rape claims|last=Magnay|first=Jacquelin|date=29 February 2004|publisher=The Age|accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref> On 27 April, New South Wales [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] [[Nicholas Cowdery]] informed detectives that he did not believe there was sufficient evidence to prosecute any Bulldogs players.

Former Test forward [[Bradley Clyde]] was named the new Football Manager and News Limited Executive [[Malcolm Noad]] taking over from Mortimer. The controversy was considered a major public relations nightmare for the club with significant media coverage. The [[National Rugby League|NRL]] announced that the Bulldogs would be fined $150,000, and an additional $350,000 if there were any other allegations of off-field misbehaviour before the end of the 2004 season. NRL chief executive officer David Gallop said that the fine had been imposed because during the months of media scrutiny the club had failed to behave \"in a way which protected the game's image\".<ref name=\"NRL fine\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1096854.htm|title=NRL fines Bulldogs for Coffs Harbour incident|last=Foschia|first=Liz|date=28 April 2004|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2004/s1096854.htm PM - NRL fines Bulldogs for Coffs Harbour incident]</ref> In 2006, Bulldogs chief executive Malcolm Noad said that the allegations had led to the loss of millions of dollars of sponsorship money, and to continuing negative beliefs in the community about Bulldogs players and supporters.

The Bulldogs season started slowly but they worked their way into being genuine Premiership contenders, which included big wins against the [[Sydney Roosters]], [[Penrith Panthers]] and [[Brisbane Broncos]] to finish the regular season on equal standing with eventual runners-up the Roosters, however due to points differential the Bulldogs were deemed to have finished second.\n\nFinals newcomers [[North Queensland Cowboys]] upset the Bulldogs 30\u201322 in the first week of the Finals. The Bulldogs powered past the [[Melbourne Storm]] 43\u201318 in the second week of the Finals. Three tries and five goals from [[Hazem El Masri]] saw the Bulldogs topple 2003 Premiers [[Penrith Panthers]] 30\u201314 in the Preliminary Final.\n\nThe Grand Final against the [[Sydney Roosters]] was always going to be a tense battle with neither club having much affection for the other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime to triumph 16\u201313. This victory saw desperate Bulldogs defence absorb much punishment and keep the Roosters scoreless for the entire second half. It was a sweet result for the Bulldogs after enduring a number of nightmare seasons on and off the field. It showed the great character in the club and the values that can't be bought or manufactured. To defeat the Roosters made it even sweeter considering the rivalry and backgrounds of both clubs. [[Matt Utai]] scored two tries with [[Hazem El Masri]] also scoring. [[Willie Mason]] was named Clive Churchill Medal Winner. Stand-in captain [[Andrew Ryan (rugby player)|Andrew Ryan]], who ultimately make the winning tackle, stopping Roosters forward [[Michael Crocker]] from scoring the final seconds of the match.\n\nWarriors-bound club captain [[Steve Price (rugby league)|Steve Price]] missed the game due to injury sustained the week before in the semi-final victory against [[Penrith Panthers]]. Price's value and respect in the team was noticeable on Grand Final night when Ryan called up Price to hold the trophy and say a few words, whilst [[Johnathan Thurston]] gave Price his Grand Final ring.\n\nFollowing their Grand Final victory, the bulldogs traveled to England to play in the [[2005 World Club Challenge]] against [[Super League]] premiers, the [[Leeds Rhinos]]. The match was played on 4 February 2005 at [[Elland Road]] in front of 37,208 with the home team coming out winners in the end of a high-scoring match, with a final scoreline of 39\u201332.\n\n==Past decade==\nThe Bulldogs were unable to mount a serious defence of the title in [[National Rugby League season 2005|2005]] as injuries and contract negotiations saw the year start and finish on a sour note for the club. Due to the extent of injuries suffered, the team at times was unable to be at full-strength. This took its toll in the final six weeks of the season, the club suffering heavy losses and missing the finals series.\n\nIn [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006]], little was expected from the club after a lacklustre 2005 season, but despite some doubt over the strength of their side, the Bulldogs' impressive forward pack helped them to a better than expected result for the year, finishing just a game short of the Grand Final, in which they lost to eventual premiers the [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nThe [[National Rugby League season 2008|2008]] season was a tumultuous one for the Bulldogs. They finished at the bottom of the ladder, but the main news of the season was the controversial departure of star player [[Sonny Bill Williams]].\n\nA huge player recruitment drive saw the Bulldogs reverse their fortunes in the [[2009 NRL season]].  Canterbury finished in second place during the [[2009 NRL season|2009]] and made it all the way to the preliminary final before they were defeated by arch rivals the [[Parramatta Eels]] in front of a record non-grand final crowd of 74,549.

On the appointment, chairman Ray Dib noted that \"Andrew was appointed from a very strong list of candidates and has exceptional experience in the game of rugby league.\"\nIn September 2017, Canterbury announced that former premiership winning player [[Dean Pay]] would be the new coach at the club starting in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-28/dean-pay-the-new-bulldogs-coach-replacing-des-hasler/8997400|title=Dean Pay the new Bulldogs coach, replacing Des Hasler|date=28 September 2017|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 2018 season started off badly for Canterbury with the club only winning 3 of its first 10 matches. In May 2018, the new Canterbury board admitted that they would not be able to make any major signings until the end of the 2021 season due the salary cap drama engulfing the club.\n\nThe issue with the salary cap problems involved the previous administration and former coach [[Des Hasler]] who signed numerous players on back ended deals.  In the wake of the scandal, the club was forced to offload players to free up room in the cap.\n\nThis resulted in [[Moses Mbye]] departing for the [[Wests Tigers]] and star recruit [[Aaron Woods]] being sold to Cronulla after only signing with Canterbury months prior.  On 16 June 2018, Canterbury suffered a humiliating 32\u201310 loss to the [[Gold Coast Titans]] at Belmore, in the press conference coach Dean Pay said \"Physically, we just weren\u2019t good enough.

The word ''''Sood'''' finds a mention in the Vedas at 23 places (15 places in the Rig Ved, 6 places in the Yajur Ved and twice in the Atharva Ved). Interestingly, Lord Krishna is also known as 'Madhusudan' \u2013 (Sudan means 'sanharak' \u2013 killer of demon Madhu). The Sood community is a very ancient fraternity and some Sood/Sud gotras are merchants as well. \n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the Brahmin Rishis were perturbed by the spread of Buddhism across India, because the old Vedic Hindu Dharma was getting a great set back. Hence, the Rishis performed a sacred Yajna at Mount Abu to revive old Hindu Dharma based on the Vedic traditions. The sacred flames of this Agni Kund, incarnated and baptised four Kshatriyas namely \u2013 the Parmar, the Parihar, the Solanki and the Chouhan. These four took a holy vow to re-establish the ancient glory of Hindu Dharma by fighting against the mass change of faith from Hinduism to Buddhism. These four Kshatriyas spread four new branches of Hinduism all over the country. The second son born to Parmar was named Sood and his descendents formed the Sood community. A reference of 44 descendants of Parmar is also available. These sood descendents formed the Sood Dynasty and the capital city of the Sood Dynasty for eight generations was Patten in Sind, now in Pakistan. The capital was later shifted to Alwar and finally King Jai Singh, (son of King Dahar) shifted his capital to Amar Kot, now in Pakistan. There is a reference of 101 Sood Kings or Rajas ruling in different parts of India. The Soods established themselves in the North and later got concentrated at Soodpur, now renamed Sirhind.  \n\nDue to the seven invasions of India by Ahmed Shah Abdali between 1748 and 1757 A.D., at Soodpur and gradually into Rajasthan and later of entire India, the Soods fled to different villages and towns in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.<ref name=\"originHistory\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#2|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==Gotras or Sub Castes==\nBoth the Punjab section and the Hill section of the Sood community have 52 Gotras or Sub Castes each, many of which are named after the villages they settled in. <ref name=\"Gotras or Sub Castes\">{{cite book|title=Origin And History Of Soods (A community in India)|first1=Yaman|last1=Sood|year=1975|publisher=Sood Sabha Chandigarh|url=http://soodsabhachandigarh.org/history.html#8|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Punjab section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Badhoo, Balgan, Baranwal, Behal, Beri, Bharak, Bhokaha (or Bhokhi), Bhola, Bodhi, Bourie, Brahmi, Dadan, Dauli (or Deli), Dhalli (or Dhati), Dhanda, Dhaunchak, Dhiri, Dhookhi, Dhoop, Dosaj, Gajri, Gajja (or Gajjey), Gondal (Gandel), Gopal, Goyal, Jandpal (or Janpal), Jari, Kajla (or Kajley), Lau, Mahidhar, Mahiyar (or Mayor), Makaura (or Makaurey), Mandal, Mohindra, Mohni, Mukandi, Momman, Nandoo, Nehra, Paal, Phakka, Pharwaha, Phassi, Poora, Rora, Rohnir, Rodher, Sanwal, Sulhan, Tagaley, Teji, Udhar, Ugal-Virk or Virk and Vassan.\n\nThe Hill section Gotras or Sub Castes are : Bahil, Bajwaria, Banta, Bhagley, Bhagra, Basohal, Basalia, Butail, Chakahria, Chakaseday, Chamib, Chaudhri, Chaukand, Chaujar, Chehray, Chimia, Cheemrey, Chhabb, Chonolia, Dagan, Didi, Dhophmal, Doddal, Dogan, Dorela, Dunyal, Indoria, Harail, Haraloo, Indoria, Jallundhroo, Jaiswal, Jandranglu, Jhalya, Jhangra, Jehelghat, Kalandar, Kandal, Karol, Kataway, Kaunsal, Kutharia, Kuthiala, Lahespar, Lakhanty, Lamsay, Lama, Langey, Lasaria, Laserday, Lauriya, Ling, Mahdoodia, Mangwalich, Mariya, Mand, Masoob, Mehtay, Mithoo, Naggal, Nehdal, Pabba, Panbalia, Paptopay, Patopa, Pulkaha, Phagdey, Phalkolia, Sabloria, Sah, Saraup, Sawali, Shall, Takalo and Udhwal.\n\nThe Soods are organized into city specific chapters of their organization in many countries.
