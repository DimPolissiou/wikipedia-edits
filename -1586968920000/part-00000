Jones founded and helped design the [[Augusta National Golf Club]], and co-founded the [[Masters Tournament]]. The innovations that he introduced at the Masters have been copied by virtually every professional golf tournament in the world.\n\nJones was the most successful amateur golfer ever to compete at a national and international level. During his peak from 1923 to 1930, he dominated top-level amateur competition, and competed very successfully against the world's best professional golfers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hardin |first=Robin |title=Crowning the King: Grantland Rice and Bobby Jones |journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly |year=2004 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=511\u2013529 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=15596790&site=eds-live&scope=site |accessdate=February 15, 2018}}</ref> Jones often beat stars such as [[Walter Hagen]] and [[Gene Sarazen]], the era's top pros. Jones earned his living mainly as a lawyer, and competed in golf only as an amateur, primarily on a part-time basis, and chose to retire from competition at age 28, though he earned significant money from golf after that, as an instructor and equipment designer.\n\nExplaining his decision to retire, Jones said, \"It [championship golf] is something like a cage. First you are expected to get into it and then you are expected to stay there. But of course, nobody can stay there.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations |editor-first=Jim |editor-last=Apfelbaum |year=2007 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |isbn=978-1-60239-014-0}}</ref> Jones is most famous for his unique \"[[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]],\" consisting of his victory in all four [[Men's major golf championships|major golf tournaments]] of his era (the open and amateur championships in both the U.S. & the U.K.) in a single calendar year (1930). In all Jones played in 31 majors, winning 13 and placing among the top ten finishers 27 times.\n\nAfter retiring from competitive golf in 1930, Jones founded and helped design the Augusta National Golf Club soon afterwards in 1933. He also co-founded the Masters Tournament, which has been annually staged by the club since [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] (except for 1943\u201345, when it was canceled due to [[World War II]]). The Masters evolved into one of golf's four major championships. Jones came out of retirement in 1934 to play in the Masters on an exhibition basis through [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]]. Jones played his last round of golf at [[East Lake Golf Club]], his home course in Atlanta, on August 18, 1948. A picture commemorating the event now sits in the clubhouse at East Lake. Citing health reasons, he quit golf permanently thereafter.\n\nBobby Jones was often confused with the prolific golf course designer, [[Robert Trent Jones]], with whom he worked from time to time. \"People always used to get them confused, so when they met, they decided each be called something different,\" Robert Trent Jones Jr. said. To help avoid confusion, the golfer was called \"Bobby,\" and the golf course designer was called \"Trent.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-06-16/sports/0006160238_1_golf-course-architecture-easy-bogey-robert-trent-jones |title=Course Designer Jones Dies |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |accessdate=May 4, 2014 |first=Michael |last=Mayo |date=June 16, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n[[File:BobbyJonesAge14.jpg|left|120px|thumb|Jones at age 14]]\nBorn in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, Jones battled health issues as a young boy, and golf was prescribed to strengthen him. Encouraged by his father, \"Colonel\" Robert Purmedus Jones, an Atlanta lawyer, Jones loved golf from the start. He developed quickly into a child prodigy who won his first children's tournament at the age of six at his home course at [[East Lake Golf Club]].  In 1916, Jones won his first major golf event when he claimed the inaugural Georgia Amateur Championship conducted by the Georgia State Golf Association at the Capital City Club, in Brookhaven, at age 14.  His victory at this event put him in the national spotlight for the first time. The Georgia Amateur win caught the eye of the United States Golf Association which awarded Jones his first invitation to the [[U.S. Amateur]] at [[Merion Golf Club|Merion]] near [[Philadelphia]]. Jones advanced to the quarterfinals in his first playing in the event.<ref name = \"timeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bobbyjones.com/the-legend_historical-timeline/#callout-1955 |title=The Legend \u2013 Historical Timeline |publisher=bobbyjones.com |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe was influenced by club professional [[Stewart Maiden]], a native of [[Carnoustie]], Scotland. Maiden was the professional at the [[Atlanta Athletic Club]]'s [[East Lake Golf Club]], who also trained [[Alexa Stirling]], the 3-time winner of the [[U.S. Women's Amateur]], who was five years older than Jones but also a prodigy at East Lake.<ref name=barclay>{{cite book |title=Golf in Canada: A History |first=James A. |last=Barclay |authorlink=James A.

Playing in front of such crowds in these matches helped him, as he moved into national competition a bit later on.\n\nJones successfully represented the United States for the first time, in two winning international amateur team matches against Canada, in 1919 and 1920, earning three of a possible four points in foursomes and singles play. In 1919 he traveled to [[Hamilton Golf and Country Club]], for his first serious competitive action outside the U.S., while in 1920, [[Engineers Country Club]], in Roslyn, [[Long Island]], hosted the matches. Still a teenager, he was by far the youngest player in the series. Jones also played in the 1919 [[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]] while in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], performing very well to place tied for second, but 16 shots behind winner [[J. Douglas Edgar]].<ref>Barclay, pp. 298\u20139, 329</ref> Edgar had immigrated from England in 1919 to take a club professional's job in Atlanta at [[Druid Hills Golf Club]]; Edgar mentored and played frequently with Jones from 1919 to 1921.

As he took his stance to pitch onto the green, the head of his club brushed the grass and caused a slight movement of the ball. He took the shot, then informed his playing partner [[Walter Hagen]] and the [[United States Golf Association|USGA]] official covering their match that he was calling a penalty on himself. Hagen was unable to talk him out of it, and they continued play.  After the round and before he signed his scorecard, officials argued with Jones but he insisted that he had violated Rule 18, moving a ball at rest after address, and took a 77 instead of the 76 he otherwise would have carded. Jones' self-imposed one-stroke penalty eventually cost him the win by a stroke in regulation, necessitating a playoff, which he then lost.

He firmly stated his dislike for The Old Course and the town reciprocated, saying in the press, \"Master Bobby is just a boy, and an ordinary boy at that.\" Later, he came to love the Old Course and the town like few others. When he won the Open at the Old Course in [[1927 Open Championship|1927]], he wowed the crowd by asking that the trophy remain with his friends at the [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|Royal and Ancient Golf Club]] rather than return with him to Atlanta. He won the [[The Amateur Championship|British Amateur]] over The Old Course in 1930, and scored a [[double eagle (golf)|double eagle]] 2 on the fourth hole (then a par-5, now a par-4), by holing a very long shot from a fairway bunker.<ref name=golfchannel/> In 1958, he was named a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman of the City]] of St Andrews, becoming only the second American to be so honored, the other being [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1759.

The films were popular, and Jones gave up his amateur status while earning lucrative contract money for this venture. These films were put into storage and were unavailable for decades, but a surviving print was located 60 years later and put into video format for preservation by [[Ely Callaway]], a distant cousin of Jones's.\n\nIn the early 1930s Jones worked with J Victor East (an Australian) of [[Spalding (sports equipment)|A.G. Spalding & Co.]] to develop the first set of matched steel-shafted clubs; the clubs sold very well and are still considered among the best-designed sets ever made.<ref name=golden/>\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n[[File:1933 Goudey Sport Kings 38 Bobby Jones.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jones in 1933]]\nFollowing his retirement from competitive golf in 1930, and even in the years leading up to that, Jones had become one of the most famous sports figures in the world, and was recognized virtually everywhere he went in public. While certainly appreciative of the enormous adulation and media coverage, this massive attention caused Jones to lose personal privacy in golf circles, and he wished to create a private golf club where he and his friends could play golf in peace and quiet. For several years, he searched for a property near Atlanta where he could develop his own golf club. His friend [[Clifford Roberts]], a New York City investment dealer, knew of Jones's desire, became aware of a promising property for sale in Augusta, Georgia, where Jones's mother-in-law<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/content/blog-post/don-rhodes/2010-04-05/bobby-jones-had-augusta-relatives|title=The Augusta Chronicle: Local & World News, Sports & Entertainment in Augusta, GA|website=The Augusta Chronicle}}</ref> had grown up, and informed Jones about it.<ref name=making>{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |date=April 2, 2003 |isbn=0-684-86751-6}}</ref> Jones first visited Fruitlands, an Augusta [[arboretum]] and [[Indigo dye|indigo]] plantation since the Civil War era, in the spring of 1930,<ref name=golfchannel/> and he purchased it for $70,000 in 1931, with the plan to design a golf course on the site.<ref>{{cite book |title=Arnie & Jack: Palmer, Nicklaus, and Golf's Greatest Rivalry |first=Ian |last=O'Connor |year=2008 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-618-75446-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/arniejackpalmern00ocon }}</ref>\n\nJones co-designed the Augusta National course with [[Alister MacKenzie]]; the new club opened in early 1933. He founded the Masters Tournament, first played at Augusta in March 1934. The new tournament, originally known as the Augusta National Invitational, was an immediate success, and attracted most of the world's top players right from its start. Jones came out of retirement to play, essentially on an exhibition basis, and his presence guaranteed enormous media attention, boosting the new tournament's fame.<ref name=making/>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Jones served as an officer in the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]]. His superiors wanted him to play exhibition golf in the United States, but Jones was insistent on serving overseas. In 1943 he was promoted to major and trained as an intelligence officer, serving in England with the 84th Fighter Wing, which was part of the [[Ninth Air Force]]. While in England, he made the acquaintance of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Landing in [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy]] on June 7, 1944, Jones spent two months with a front line division as a [[prisoner of war]] interrogator, reaching the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Frost |authorlink=Mark Frost |title=The Grand Slam: Bobby Jones, America, and the Story of Golf |year=2004 |publisher=Hyperion Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4013-0751-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/grandslamthe00mark/page/458 458\u20139] |url=https://archive.org/details/grandslamthe00mark/page/458 }}</ref> During the war, Jones permitted the [[U.S. Army]] to graze cattle on the grounds at Augusta National.

By then, his health at age 46 had declined to the stage where this was no longer possible. With his health difficulties, being past his prime, and not competing elsewhere to stay in tournament form, he never truly contended at the Masters, although his scores were usually respectable. These were almost all ceremonial performances, since his main duty was as host of the event. His extraordinary popularity, efforts with the course design, and tournament organization boosted the profile of the Masters significantly. The tournament, jointly run by Jones and Clifford Roberts, made many important innovations which became the norm elsewhere, such as gallery ropes to control the flow of the large crowds, many scoreboards around the course, the use of red / green numbers on those scoreboards to denote under / over par scores, an international field of top players, high-caliber television coverage, and week-long admission passes for patrons, which became extremely hard to obtain. The tournament also sought and welcomed feedback from players, fans, and writers, leading to continual improvement over the years. The Masters gradually evolved to being one of the most respected tournaments in the world, one of the four major championships.<ref name=making/>\n\n===Incapacity and death===\n\nIn 1948, Jones was diagnosed with [[syringomyelia]], a fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord that causes crippling pain, then paralysis; he was eventually restricted to a wheelchair.

The Jones legend was also used to create a supporting character in ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' in 2000, portrayed by [[Joel Gretsch]], and the event where he called his own penalty is used for the fictional protagonist, Rannulph Junuh.\n\n==Books==\nJones authored several books on golf including ''Down the Fairway'' with Oscar Bane \"O.B.\" Keeler (1927), ''The Rights and Wrongs of Golf'' (1933), ''Golf Is My Game'' (1959), ''Bobby Jones on Golf'' (1966), and ''Bobby Jones on the Basic Golf Swing'' (1968) with illustrator Anthony Ravielli. The 300-copy limited edition of ''Down the Fairway'' is considered one of the rarest and most sought after golf books by collectors. To keep this book readily available to golfers, [[Herbert Warren Wind]] included a reproduction of ''Down the Fairway'' in his Classics of Golf Library.<ref>[http://www.classicsofgolf.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=86 Classics of Golf Library].</ref>\n\nJones has been the subject of several books, most notably ''The Bobby Jones Story'' and ''A Boy's Life of Bobby Jones'', both by O.B. Keeler. Other notable texts are ''The Life and Times of Bobby Jones: Portrait of a Gentleman'' by Sidney L. Matthew, ''The Greatest Player Who Never Lived'' by J. Michael Veron, and ''Triumphant Journey: The Saga of Bobby Jones and the Grand Slam of Golf'' by Richard Miller. Published in 2006, ''The Grand Slam'' by [[Mark Frost]] has received much note as being evocative of Jones's life and times.\n\nA special room is dedicated to Jones's life and accomplishments at the [[United States Golf Association Museum and Arnold Palmer Center for Golf History]] in [[Far Hills, New Jersey]].\n\n==Honors==\nIn 1981, the U.S. Postal Service issued an 18-cent stamp commemorating Jones.<ref>{{cite web | title = American Sports Personalities | publisher = United States Postal Service | url = http://www.uspsstamps.com/stamps/series/american-sports-personalities | accessdate = October 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Jones Global Sports==\nFounded in 2013, Jones Global Sports designs, develops, and sells apparel, accessories and golf equipment.

Jones founded and helped design the [[Augusta National Golf Club]], and co-founded the [[Masters Tournament]]. The innovations that he introduced at the Masters have been copied by virtually every professional golf tournament in the world.\n\nJones was the most successful amateur golfer ever to compete at a national and international level. During his peak from 1923 to 1930, he dominated top-level amateur competition, and competed very successfully against the world's best professional golfers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hardin |first=Robin |title=Crowning the King: Grantland Rice and Bobby Jones |journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly |year=2004 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=511\u2013529 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=15596790&site=eds-live&scope=site |accessdate=February 15, 2018}}</ref> Jones often beat stars such as [[Walter Hagen]] and [[Gene Sarazen]], the era's top pros. Jones earned his living mainly as a lawyer, and competed in golf only as an amateur, primarily on a part-time basis, and chose to retire from competition at age 28, though he earned significant money from golf after that, as an instructor and equipment designer.\n\nExplaining his decision to retire, Jones said, \"It [championship golf] is something like a cage. First you are expected to get into it and then you are expected to stay there. But of course, nobody can stay there.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gigantic Book of Golf Quotations |editor-first=Jim |editor-last=Apfelbaum |year=2007 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |isbn=978-1-60239-014-0}}</ref> Jones is most famous for his unique \"[[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]],\" consisting of his victory in all four [[Men's major golf championships|major golf tournaments]] of his era (the open and amateur championships in both the U.S. & the U.K.) in a single calendar year (1930). In all Jones played in 31 majors, winning 13 and placing among the top ten finishers 27 times.\n\nAfter retiring from competitive golf in 1930, Jones founded and helped design the Augusta National Golf Club soon afterwards in 1933. He also co-founded the Masters Tournament, which has been annually staged by the club since [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] (except for 1943\u201345, when it was canceled due to [[World War II]]). The Masters evolved into one of golf's four major championships. Jones came out of retirement in 1934 to play in the Masters on an exhibition basis through [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]]. Jones played his last round of golf at [[East Lake Golf Club]], his home course in Atlanta, on August 18, 1948. A picture commemorating the event now sits in the clubhouse at East Lake. Citing health reasons, he quit golf permanently thereafter.\n\nBobby Jones was often confused with the prolific golf course designer, [[Robert Trent Jones]], with whom he worked from time to time. \"People always used to get them confused, so when they met, they decided each be called something different,\" Robert Trent Jones Jr. said. To help avoid confusion, the golfer was called \"Bobby,\" and the golf course designer was called \"Trent.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-06-16/sports/0006160238_1_golf-course-architecture-easy-bogey-robert-trent-jones |title=Course Designer Jones Dies |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |accessdate=May 4, 2014 |first=Michael |last=Mayo |date=June 16, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n[[File:BobbyJonesAge14.jpg|left|120px|thumb|Jones at age 14]]\nBorn in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, Jones battled health issues as a young boy, and golf was prescribed to strengthen him. Encouraged by his father, \"Colonel\" Robert Purmedus Jones, an Atlanta lawyer, Jones loved golf from the start. He developed quickly into a child prodigy who won his first children's tournament at the age of six at his home course at [[East Lake Golf Club]].  In 1916, Jones won his first major golf event when he claimed the inaugural Georgia Amateur Championship conducted by the Georgia State Golf Association at the Capital City Club, in Brookhaven, at age 14.  His victory at this event put him in the national spotlight for the first time. The Georgia Amateur win caught the eye of the United States Golf Association which awarded Jones his first invitation to the [[U.S. Amateur]] at [[Merion Golf Club|Merion]] near [[Philadelphia]]. Jones advanced to the quarterfinals in his first playing in the event.<ref name = \"timeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bobbyjones.com/the-legend_historical-timeline/#callout-1955 |title=The Legend \u2013 Historical Timeline |publisher=bobbyjones.com |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe was influenced by club professional [[Stewart Maiden]], a native of [[Carnoustie]], Scotland.

As he took his stance to pitch onto the green, the head of his club brushed the grass and caused a slight movement of the ball. He took the shot, then informed his playing partner [[Walter Hagen]] and the [[United States Golf Association|USGA]] official covering their match that he was calling a penalty on himself. Hagen was unable to talk him out of it, and they continued play.  After the round and before he signed his scorecard, officials argued with Jones but he insisted that he had violated Rule 18, moving a ball at rest after address, and took a 77 instead of the 76 he otherwise would have carded. Jones' self-imposed one-stroke penalty eventually cost him the win by a stroke in regulation, necessitating a playoff, which he then lost. Although praised by many sports writers for his gesture, Jones was reported to have said, \"You might as well praise me for not robbing banks.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.golf.com/photos/infamous-golf-rules-violations-blunders/bobby-jones-1925-us-open |title=Infamous Rules Mishaps |work=Golf Magazine |accessdate=August 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017211955/http://www.golf.com/photos/infamous-golf-rules-violations-blunders/bobby-jones-1925-us-open |archivedate=October 17, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/03/bobby-jones.html |title=\"Bobby\" Jones |journal=[[Harvard Magazine]] |first=Craig |last=Lambert |date=March\u2013April 2002 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://worcestercc.memberstatements.com/tour/tours.cfm?tourid=77762 |title=1925 Men's US Open |publisher=Worcester Country Club |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/06/12/us.open.history/ |title=Fun and sick facts about U.S. Open |publisher=[[CNN]] |first=Ethan |last=Trex |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA similar event occurred in the [[1926 U.S. Open (golf)|next U.S. Open]], played at the [[Scioto Country Club]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. In the second round, after his opening round put him in second place, Jones was putting on the 15th green in the face of a strong wind.  After grounding his putter during address to square up the club face, the ball rolled a half turn in the wind when Jones lifted the club head to place it behind the ball.  Although no one else observed this movement of the ball either, again Jones called a penalty on himself, but this time Jones went on to win the tournament, the second of his four U.S. Open victories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usopen.com/en_US/champ_experience/pastchamps/1926.html |title=U.S. Open History \u2013 1926 \u2013 Bobby Jones |publisher=USGA |accessdate=August 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018032734/http://www.usopen.com/en_US/champ_experience/pastchamps/1926.html |archivedate=October 18, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/node/174366#slide-83 |title=U.S. Open Champions \u2013 1926: Bobby Jones |work=NBC Sports |accessdate=August 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe USGA's sportsmanship award is named the [[Bob Jones Award]] in his honor.\n\n===St Andrews, Scotland===\n\nJones had a unique relationship with the town of [[St Andrews]]. On his first appearance on the [[Old Course at St Andrews|Old Course]] in The Open Championship of [[1921 Open Championship|1921]], he withdrew after 11 holes in the third round, when he failed to complete the hole (in effect disqualifying himself), and tore up his scorecard, although he finished the round and indeed played the fourth round as well. He firmly stated his dislike for The Old Course and the town reciprocated, saying in the press, \"Master Bobby is just a boy, and an ordinary boy at that.\" Later, he came to love the Old Course and the town like few others. When he won the Open at the Old Course in [[1927 Open Championship|1927]], he wowed the crowd by asking that the trophy remain with his friends at the [[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|Royal and Ancient Golf Club]] rather than return with him to Atlanta. He won the [[The Amateur Championship|British Amateur]] over The Old Course in 1930, and scored a [[double eagle (golf)|double eagle]] 2 on the fourth hole (then a par-5, now a par-4), by holing a very long shot from a fairway bunker.<ref name=golfchannel/> In 1958, he was named a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman of the City]] of St Andrews, becoming only the second American to be so honored, the other being [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1759.

The films were popular, and Jones gave up his amateur status while earning lucrative contract money for this venture. These films were put into storage and were unavailable for decades, but a surviving print was located 60 years later and put into video format for preservation by [[Ely Callaway]], a distant cousin of Jones's.\n\nIn the early 1930s Jones worked with J Victor East (an Australian) of [[Spalding (sports equipment)|A.G.

While certainly appreciative of the enormous adulation and media coverage, this massive attention caused Jones to lose personal privacy in golf circles, and he wished to create a private golf club where he and his friends could play golf in peace and quiet. For several years, he searched for a property near Atlanta where he could develop his own golf club. His friend [[Clifford Roberts]], a New York City investment dealer, knew of Jones's desire, became aware of a promising property for sale in Augusta, Georgia, where Jones's mother-in-law<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/content/blog-post/don-rhodes/2010-04-05/bobby-jones-had-augusta-relatives|title=The Augusta Chronicle: Local & World News, Sports & Entertainment in Augusta, GA|website=The Augusta Chronicle}}</ref> had grown up, and informed Jones about it.<ref name=making>{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |date=April 2, 2003 |isbn=0-684-86751-6}}</ref> Jones first visited Fruitlands, an Augusta [[arboretum]] and [[Indigo dye|indigo]] plantation since the Civil War era, in the spring of 1930,<ref name=golfchannel/> and he purchased it for $70,000 in 1931, with the plan to design a golf course on the site.<ref>{{cite book |title=Arnie & Jack: Palmer, Nicklaus, and Golf's Greatest Rivalry |first=Ian |last=O'Connor |year=2008 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-618-75446-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/arniejackpalmern00ocon }}</ref>\n\nJones co-designed the Augusta National course with [[Alister MacKenzie]]; the new club opened in early 1933. He founded the Masters Tournament, first played at Augusta in March 1934. The new tournament, originally known as the Augusta National Invitational, was an immediate success, and attracted most of the world's top players right from its start. Jones came out of retirement to play, essentially on an exhibition basis, and his presence guaranteed enormous media attention, boosting the new tournament's fame.<ref name=making/>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Jones served as an officer in the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]]. His superiors wanted him to play exhibition golf in the United States, but Jones was insistent on serving overseas. In 1943 he was promoted to major and trained as an intelligence officer, serving in England with the 84th Fighter Wing, which was part of the [[Ninth Air Force]]. While in England, he made the acquaintance of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Landing in [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy]] on June 7, 1944, Jones spent two months with a front line division as a [[prisoner of war]] interrogator, reaching the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Frost |authorlink=Mark Frost |title=The Grand Slam: Bobby Jones, America, and the Story of Golf |year=2004 |publisher=Hyperion Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4013-0751-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/grandslamthe00mark/page/458 458\u20139] |url=https://archive.org/details/grandslamthe00mark/page/458 }}</ref> During the war, Jones permitted the [[U.S. Army]] to graze cattle on the grounds at Augusta National.

By then, his health at age 46 had declined to the stage where this was no longer possible. With his health difficulties, being past his prime, and not competing elsewhere to stay in tournament form, he never truly contended at the Masters, although his scores were usually respectable. These were almost all ceremonial performances, since his main duty was as host of the event. His extraordinary popularity, efforts with the course design, and tournament organization boosted the profile of the Masters significantly. The tournament, jointly run by Jones and Clifford Roberts, made many important innovations which became the norm elsewhere, such as gallery ropes to control the flow of the large crowds, many scoreboards around the course, the use of red / green numbers on those scoreboards to denote under / over par scores, an international field of top players, high-caliber television coverage, and week-long admission passes for patrons, which became extremely hard to obtain. The tournament also sought and welcomed feedback from players, fans, and writers, leading to continual improvement over the years. The Masters gradually evolved to being one of the most respected tournaments in the world, one of the four major championships.<ref name=making/>\n\n===Incapacity and death===\n\nIn 1948, Jones was diagnosed with [[syringomyelia]], a fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord that causes crippling pain, then paralysis; he was eventually restricted to a wheelchair.

Some of the more well known actors to appear in the instructional plots included [[James Cagney]], [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[W.C. Fields]], [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], [[Richard Barthelmess]], [[Richard Arlen]], [[Guy Kibbee]], [[Warner Oland]] and [[Loretta Young]]. Various scenarios involving the actors were used to provide an opportunity for Jones to convey a lesson about a particular part of the game. The shorts were directed by the prolific [[George Marshall (director)|George Marshall]].\n\n'''Title list of the shorts:'''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0427602/ |title= Bobby Jones (III) (1902\u20131971) |publisher=IMDb}}</ref> <br/>\n''How I Play Golf''\n*''The Putter'' (April 26, 1931, ''Film Daily'' review)\n*''Chip Shots'' (April 26)\n*''The Niblick'' (May 31)\n*''The Mashie Niblick'' (June 5)\n*''Medium Irons'' (July 5)\n*''The Big Irons'' (July 12)\n*''The Spoon'' (July 19)\n*''The Brassie'' (August 1)\n*''The Driver'' (August 30)\n*''Trouble Shots'' (September 13)\n*''Practice Shots'' (September 27)\n*''A Round of Golf'' (September 4)\n\n''How To Break 90''\n*''The Grip'' (April 17, 1933)\n*''Position and Backswing'' (May 15)\n*''Hip Action'' (May 20)\n*''Down Swing (The Downswing)'' (May 29)\n*''Impact'' (July 15)\n*''Fine Points'' (August 5)\n\nJones was the subject of the quasi-biographical 2004 feature film ''[[Bobby Jones: A Stroke of Genius]]'' in which he was portrayed by [[Jim Caviezel]]. The Jones legend was also used to create a supporting character in ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' in 2000, portrayed by [[Joel Gretsch]], and the event where he called his own penalty is used for the fictional protagonist, Rannulph Junuh.\n\n==Books==\nJones authored several books on golf including ''Down the Fairway'' with Oscar Bane \"O.B.\" Keeler (1927), ''The Rights and Wrongs of Golf'' (1933), ''Golf Is My Game'' (1959), ''Bobby Jones on Golf'' (1966), and ''Bobby Jones on the Basic Golf Swing'' (1968) with illustrator Anthony Ravielli. The 300-copy limited edition of ''Down the Fairway'' is considered one of the rarest and most sought after golf books by collectors. To keep this book readily available to golfers, [[Herbert Warren Wind]] included a reproduction of ''Down the Fairway'' in his Classics of Golf Library.<ref>[http://www.classicsofgolf.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=86 Classics of Golf Library].</ref>\n\nJones has been the subject of several books, most notably ''The Bobby Jones Story'' and ''A Boy's Life of Bobby Jones'', both by O.B.

Michael Veron, and ''Triumphant Journey: The Saga of Bobby Jones and the Grand Slam of Golf'' by Richard Miller.
