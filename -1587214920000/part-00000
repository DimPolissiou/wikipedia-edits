King transformed a moribund program into a consistent winner and produced future [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] MVP [[Mel Daniels]]. The Lobos won the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC) championship in 1964 and 1968, making frequent appearances in national rankings. The team reached the [[1964 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] tournament final in 1964 and received its first bid to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] in 1968.  The success of the program continued after King departed, winning WAC titles in 1974, 1978, and 1994, winning the conference tournament in 1993 and 1996, and regularly earning post-season tournament bids.\n\nThe Lobos became frequent participants in the NCAA tournament during the 1990s and have made 15 appearances overall, as well as 19 NIT appearances. They have won the MWC regular season championship and the conference tournament four times each.

Dowling provides a detailed account of the schemes employed by Lobo coaches and complicit junior college administrators to gain eligibility for players.</ref> In an investigation into illegal gambling, the FBI had placed a wiretap on the phone of a major Lobo booster. While Ellenberger was visiting this booster, in November 1979, he took a call on the tapped phone from assistant coach Manny Goldstein. They discussed an arrangement to transfer bogus credits from a California Junior College to the office of the UNM registrar. Based on this conversation, the FBI launched an investigation that led to a federal indictment of Ellenberger on seven counts of fraud and forgery of academic transcripts, though he was acquitted of those charges at trial.<ref>Dowling (2007), p.26.</ref> In July 1981, however, he was convicted by a state District Court on 21 of 22 counts of fraud and submitting false public vouchers.

The team reached the [[1964 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] tournament final in 1964 and received its first bid to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] in 1968.  The success of the program continued after King departed, winning WAC titles in 1974, 1978, and 1994, winning the conference tournament in 1993 and 1996, and regularly earning post-season tournament bids.\n\nThe Lobos became frequent participants in the NCAA tournament during the 1990s and have made 15 appearances overall, as well as 19 NIT appearances. They have won the MWC regular season championship and the conference tournament four times each.

The Lobos won their fourth WAC championship with a 13-1 league record, losing only at ranked Utah, and entered the [[1978 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] ranked #5 and seeded second in the West Regional, with the opportunity to play in The Pit for the regional final with a win.  They were upset in the first round by unranked Cal State Fullerton, however, in another disappointing tournament performance.<ref name=MG116/><ref name=Wright032413/> The Lobos finished the season 24-4 and ranked #12, and Ellenberger was voted runner-up for the US Basketball Writers Coach of the Year award.<ref name=MG86/>\n\nThe 1978\u201379 Lobo squad returned starters Abney and Saunders while adding another strong JC class including Larry Belin.

While Ellenberger was visiting this booster, in November 1979, he took a call on the tapped phone from assistant coach Manny Goldstein. They discussed an arrangement to transfer bogus credits from a California Junior College to the office of the UNM registrar. Based on this conversation, the FBI launched an investigation that led to a federal indictment of Ellenberger on seven counts of fraud and forgery of academic transcripts, though he was acquitted of those charges at trial.<ref>Dowling (2007), p.26.</ref> In July 1981, however, he was convicted by a state District Court on 21 of 22 counts of fraud and submitting false public vouchers.

adopting forms of [[War of national liberation|national liberation movement]] ideology.<ref name=\"Origins\"/> This radicalisation helped reinforce a wider shift to the left in Third World politics and made the Soviet Union the more credible of the superpowers in anti-colonial causes.<ref name=\"Origins\"/> For its part, the Soviet Union approved of SWAPO's decision to adopt guerrilla warfare

[[Kavangoland]].<ref name=Camp/> SWAPO sources maintain that some of those captured by the police were later permitted to escape and make their way back to Kongwa, albeit as South African informants.<ref name=Camp/>\n\n===Early activities===\n\nIn September 1965, SWALA established its first training camp on South West African soil, at [[Omugulugwombashe]], one of five potential bases identified by SWALA's initial reconnaissance team as appropriate sites to recruit and drill more insurgents.<ref name=Dale/> At the time, SWALA numbered only about 250 personnel, most of whom were still undergoing training at Kongwa.<ref name=Dale/> The insurgents at Omugulugwombashe succeeded in recruiting only about 30 locals before the location of their camp was reported to the SAP.<ref name=Dale/> Three policemen discreetly visited the site on August 23, 1966, and confirmed that the insurgents were there.<ref name=Dale/> The SAP requested military assistance, and the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) was able to mobilise a small force of paratroops to attack the camp.<ref name=\"Lord\">{{cite book|last=Lord|first=Dick|title=From Fledgling to Eagle: The South African Air

South West Africa for the raid.<ref name=\"Lord\"/> The attack on Omugulugwombashe commenced on August 26, with the paratroops and policemen rappelling into the camp from eight SADF [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III]] helicopters on loan to the SAP.<ref name=\"Lord\"/> The SWALA camp was destroyed and the insurgents suffered 2 dead, 1 seriously wounded, and 8 captured.<ref

government subsequently arrested 37 of SWAPO's most prominent leaders and tried them, along with the captured SWALA insurgents, on charges of terrorism and armed insurrection.<ref name=Dobell/> The defence counsel argued that because SWAPO did not recognise South Africa's administration of South West Africa as legitimate, its members could not be tried under South African laws by a South African court.<ref name=\"Devils\"/> The court rejected this opinion, and at least 20 of the detainees were given life sentences, while another 9 were given twenty year sentences.<ref name=\"Devils\"/>\n\nDespite this setback, SWALA remained under pressure from the SWAPO leadership and pan-African strategists on the OAU Liberation Committee to establish \"liberated zones\" or \"semi-liberated zones\" in South West Africa.<ref name=Dale/> This strategy depended on the insurgents being able to seize and hold static positions, from which they could recruit more insurgents and receive supplies.<ref name=Dale/> However, SWALA remained stymied by its own over-extended logistics and geographic circumstances which made landing groups of armed partisans along the shoreline impossible.<ref name=Dale/> This forced the movement to continue sending cadres into South West Africa on long overland treks through Zambia, during which they had to cross through the Caprivi Strip, a region which was heavily monitored by the SAP for precisely this reason.<ref name=Dale/> From 1966 until the disintegration of Portuguese colonial rule in Angola during the mid 1970s, all of SWALA's infiltration attempts were made through the Caprivi Strip.<ref name=Office/> The incursions were almost wholly unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Lord\"/>\n\nThe arrest of so much of SWAPO's internal leadership in mid 1966 effectively decapitated SWALA at the command level for months.<ref name=Dobell/> It was not until December 1966 that the movement attempted to launch another major raid into South West Africa, this time further to the south near [[Grootfontein]].<ref name=\"Lord\"/> The SAP began carrying its own search and destroy operations to locate the insurgents after they attacked a white farmer.<ref name=\"Lord\"/> Again, extensive SADF assistance was utilised, in the form of aircraft on loan and counter-insurgency advisers.<ref name=\"Lord\"/> The South African government was initially reluctant to view SWALA's activities as a military problem, reflecting a trend among Anglophone Commonwealth states to regard the police as the principal force in the suppression of insurgencies.<ref name=Dale/>\n\nSWALA suffered a second major reversal on 18 May 1967, when its commander, [[Tobias Hainyeko]], attempted to lead a reconnaissance team into the Caprivi as part of a general survey aimed at opening new lines of communication between the front lines in South West Africa and SWALA's headquarters in Dar es Salaam.<ref name=Caprivi/> Heinyeko was intercepted by an SAP patrol, which killed him after a brief firefight.<ref name=Caprivi/> The SAP later tracked and killed another 5 insurgents, with 4 managing to escape back into Zambia.<ref name=\"Lord\"/> After this catastrophe, SWALA considered abandoning the Zambian front and opening up a new infiltration route through [[Botswana]].<ref name=\"Lord\"/> In December 1969, a group of insurgents were intercepted by the SAP shortly after crossing the Botswana border and 4 were killed.<ref name=\"Lord\"/>\n\n==Organization==\n\n===SWAPO Military Council===\nThe SWAPO Military Council was the highest decision-making body of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). The council was constituted in 1977 and met once a year to review the political and military situation and the progress of the war. It drew up strategies for the operations conducted by PLAN during the liberation struggle. The Military Council was one of SWAPO's most solid branches during the liberation struggle. Its members were either regional commanders or political commissars while others were chosen by merit of their vast experience in the struggle. They were instrumental in creating the Operational Command Headquarters which was situated in Lumbango.<ref name=\"Whatever\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevillager.com.na/articles/2298/Whatever-happened-to-the-Military-Council-/|title=The Villager-Whatever happened to the Military Council?|website=www.thevillager.com.na|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref> The council was established under the leadership of [[Peter Nanyemba]] who served as the first SWAPO Secretary of Defence. Nanyemba was delegated by the President to chair the council for the first five years until he, as the Commander-in-Chief, and as per requirement of both SWAPO Constitution and PLAN manual took over.\n\n===Operational Command Headquarters===\nThe Operational Command Headquarters was a highest level military command within PLAN consisting of the commander of PLAN and its deputy, PLAN chief political commissar, chief of staff, and all other departments within PLAN.<ref name=Whatever/> SWAPO had developed structures to manage and control its armed wing, structurally, the Central Committee and the National Executive controlled the army. \n\nThe party president was also the Commander-in-Chief of PLAN and chairman of the SWAPO Military Council. Under the president, a deputy chief commander was also the commander of the army, being responsible for all PLAN operations and activities. Below the commander was the Secretary of Defence, who was in charge of logistical operations. He reported to and advised the National Executive. Military operations were organised by the commanders of the different regions, who were responsible for making recommendations to the Secretary of Defence.\n\n====Command structure====\nThe command structure of PLAN consisted of: \n* PLAN Commander: [[Dimo Hamaambo]]<ref>Ekandjo, Peter (2014).

PLAN incursions from Angola into Namibia restarted in earnest after the Portuguese withdrawal from Angola in 1975. Infiltration began particularly after the first rains during the rainy season when conditions were favourable for the combatants. Vegetation was tall and this provided for cover. The Oshanas were filled with drinking water that combatants needed during the long treks from their Angolan bases into Namibia. The rain also washed away any foot tracks, which rendered follow-up operations by South African forces difficult. Once in Namibia combatants either planted [[Landmine]]s, sabotaged administration infrastructure i.e. electricity pylons, ambushed [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) convoys, or attacked SADF bases from a stand-off distance by using mortars.<ref>https://ujdigispace.uj.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10210/7595/J.L.%20NENGOVHELA_1999_MA.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Facilities===\nPLAN operated numerous base-camps and support facilities, which were initially set up across Southern [[Zambia]] and later in Southern [[Angola]]. Its main guerrilla training camps were located inside Angola, the Tobias Hainyeko Training Centre (THTC) and the Jumbo Training Centre (JTC), both located around [[Lubango]]. Due to the nature of [[guerrilla warfare]], the PLAN did not had permanent bases located closer to the Namibian\u2013Angolan border as compared to a conventional army. In reality, base-camps were set up on a temporary basis as the security situation changed every time.\n\n===Units===\nMain PLAN combat formations comprised:<ref name=\"swapoparty\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.swapoparty.org/zoom_in_126.html|title=SWAPO - How Moscow Battalion came into being|website=www.swapoparty.org|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref>\n*1st Motorized Infantry Brigade\n*Moscow Battalion\n*Alpha Battalion \n*Bravo Battalion \n*8th Battalion\n*Salute Unit\n*Volcano unit \u2013 this was a special commando force that was trained to infiltrate the Farming areas south of [[Oshivelo]].<ref name=swapoparty/>\n\n===Weapons and equipment===\nBesides enjoying political support and sanctuary from [[Ghana]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]], the PLAN received military assistance mainly from [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], [[Cuba]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[North Korea]], and the [[People's Republic of China]], who provided weapons, ammunition, vehicles and other non-lethal military equipments, such as field radios and uniforms.\n\n====Small-arms====\n*[[PPSh-41|PPSh-41 submachine gun]]\n*[[SKS|SKS semi-automatic rifle]]\n*[[AK-47|AK-47 assault rifle]]\n*[[AKM|AKM assault rifle]]\n*[[Type 56 assault rifle]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Elena Torreguitar| authorlink = | title = National Liberation Movements in Office: Forging Democracy with African Adjectives in Namibia|edition= 2009|page= 159 | publisher = Peter Lang GMBH| isbn= 978-3-631-57995-4}}</ref>\n*[[TT pistol|Tokarev TT-33 pistol]]\n*[[Makarov pistol|Makarov PM pistol]]\n*[[CZ 75|CZ 75 pistol]] \n*[[RPK|RPK light machine gun]]\n*[[RPD machine gun]]\n*[[PK machine gun]]\n*[[SG-43 Goryunov|SG-43/SGM Goryunov medium machine gun]] \n*[[DShK|DShk 12.7mm Heavy machine gun]] \n*[[Mosin\u2013Nagant|M/52 sniper rifle]]\n*[[SVD rifle|Dragunov SVD-63 sniper rifle]]\n\n====Grenade systems====\n*[[F1 grenade (Russia)|F1 hand grenade]]\n*[[RG-4]] anti-personnel grenade\n*[[RG-42]] hand grenade\n*[[RGD-5]] hand grenade\n*[[RPG-43]] anti-tank grenade\n*[[PGN-60]] anti-tank rifle grenade\n*[[M60 rifle grenades|M60 rifle grenade]]\n\n====Land mine systems====\n*[[OZM|OZM-4 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PMD series mines|PMD-6 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PMN mine|PMN-1/2 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[POMZ|POMZ-2/2M anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PP Mi-D mine|PP Mi-D anti-personnel mine]]\n*PP Mi-BA anti-personnel mine\n*PP Mi-SR anti-personnel mine\n*[[PPM-2 mine|PPM-2 anti-personnel mine]]\n*PMA-1 anti-personnel mine\n*[[PMA-2 mine|PMA-2 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PMA-3 mine|PMA-3 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[POMZ|PMR-1 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[POMZ|PMR-2A anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PROM-1|PROM-1 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PT Mi-Ba-II mine|PT Mi-Ba-II anti-tank mine]]\n*[[PT Mi-Ba-III mine|PT Mi-Ba-III anti-tank mine]]\n*[[PT Mi-K mine|PT-MI-K anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMA-2 mine|TMA-2 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMA-3 mine|TMA-3 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMA-4 mine|TMA-4 anti-tank mine]]\n*TMA-5 anti-tank mine\n*[[TM-46 mine|TM-46 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TM-57 mine|TM-57 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TM-62 series of mines|TM-62B/M anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMD-44 and TMD-B mines|TMD-44 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMD-44 and TMD-B mines|TMD-B anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMK-2 mine|TMK-2 anti-tank mine]]\n*UKA-63 anti-tank mine\n\n====Mortars====\n*[[Mortar 60mm M57|M57 60mm mortar]]\n*[[82-BM-41|82-BM-41 (M-1937) 82mm mortar]]\n\n====Anti-tank rocket and grenade launchers====\n*[[RPG-2]]<ref>L.

government subsequently arrested 37 of SWAPO's most prominent leaders and tried them, along with the captured SWALA insurgents, on charges of terrorism and armed insurrection.<ref name=Dobell/> The defence counsel argued that because SWAPO did not recognise South Africa's administration of South West Africa as legitimate, its members could not be tried under South African laws by a South African court.<ref name=\"Devils\"/> The court rejected this opinion, and at least 20 of the detainees were given life sentences, while another 9 were given twenty year sentences.<ref name=\"Devils\"/>\n\nDespite this setback, SWALA remained under pressure from the SWAPO leadership and pan-African strategists on the OAU Liberation Committee to establish \"liberated zones\" or \"semi-liberated zones\" in South West Africa.<ref name=Dale/> This strategy depended on the insurgents being able to seize and hold static positions, from which they could recruit more insurgents and receive supplies.<ref name=Dale/> However, SWALA remained stymied by its own over-extended logistics and geographic circumstances which made landing groups of armed partisans along the shoreline impossible.<ref name=Dale/> This forced the movement to continue sending cadres into South West Africa on long overland treks through Zambia, during which they had to cross through the Caprivi Strip, a region which was heavily monitored by the SAP for precisely this reason.<ref name=Dale/> From 1966 until the disintegration of Portuguese colonial rule in Angola during the mid 1970s, all of SWALA's infiltration attempts were made through the Caprivi Strip.<ref name=Office/> The incursions were almost wholly unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Lord\"/>\n\nThe arrest of so much of SWAPO's internal leadership in mid 1966 effectively decapitated SWALA at the command level for months.<ref name=Dobell/> It was not until December 1966 that the movement attempted to launch another major raid into South West Africa, this time further to the south near [[Grootfontein]].<ref name=\"Lord\"/> The SAP began carrying its own search and destroy operations to locate the insurgents after they attacked a white farmer.<ref name=\"Lord\"/> Again, extensive SADF assistance was utilised, in the form of aircraft on loan and counter-insurgency advisers.<ref name=\"Lord\"/> The South African government was initially reluctant to view SWALA's activities as a military problem, reflecting a trend among Anglophone Commonwealth states to regard the police as the principal force in the suppression of insurgencies.<ref name=Dale/>\n\nSWALA suffered a second major reversal on 18 May 1967, when its commander, [[Tobias Hainyeko]], attempted to lead a reconnaissance team into the Caprivi as part of a general survey aimed at opening new lines of communication between the front lines in South West Africa and SWALA's headquarters in Dar es Salaam.<ref name=Caprivi/> Heinyeko was intercepted by an SAP patrol, which killed him after a brief firefight.<ref name=Caprivi/> The SAP later tracked and killed another 5 insurgents, with 4 managing to escape back into Zambia.<ref name=\"Lord\"/> After this catastrophe, SWALA considered abandoning the Zambian front and opening up a new infiltration route through [[Botswana]].<ref name=\"Lord\"/> In December 1969, a group of insurgents were intercepted by the SAP shortly after crossing the Botswana border and 4 were killed.<ref name=\"Lord\"/>\n\n==Organization==\n\n===SWAPO Military Council===\nThe SWAPO Military Council was the highest decision-making body of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). The council was constituted in 1977 and met once a year to review the political and military situation and the progress of the war. It drew up strategies for the operations conducted by PLAN during the liberation struggle. The Military Council was one of SWAPO's most solid branches during the liberation struggle. Its members were either regional commanders or political commissars while others were chosen by merit of their vast experience in the struggle. They were instrumental in creating the Operational Command Headquarters which was situated in Lumbango.<ref name=\"Whatever\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevillager.com.na/articles/2298/Whatever-happened-to-the-Military-Council-/|title=The Villager-Whatever happened to the Military Council?|website=www.thevillager.com.na|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref> The council was established under the leadership of [[Peter Nanyemba]] who served as the first SWAPO Secretary of Defence. Nanyemba was delegated by the President to chair the council for the first five years until he, as the Commander-in-Chief, and as per requirement of both SWAPO Constitution and PLAN manual took over.\n\n===Operational Command Headquarters===\nThe Operational Command Headquarters was a highest level military command within PLAN consisting of the commander of PLAN and its deputy, PLAN chief political commissar, chief of staff, and all other departments within PLAN.<ref name=Whatever/> SWAPO had developed structures to manage and control its armed wing, structurally, the Central Committee and the National Executive controlled the army. \n\nThe party president was also the Commander-in-Chief of PLAN and chairman of the SWAPO Military Council. Under the president, a deputy chief commander was also the commander of the army, being responsible for all PLAN operations and activities. Below the commander was the Secretary of Defence, who was in charge of logistical operations. He reported to and advised the National Executive. Military operations were organised by the commanders of the different regions, who were responsible for making recommendations to the Secretary of Defence.\n\n====Command structure====\nThe command structure of PLAN consisted of: \n* PLAN Commander: [[Dimo Hamaambo]]<ref>Ekandjo, Peter (2014).

PLAN incursions from Angola into Namibia restarted in earnest after the Portuguese withdrawal from Angola in 1975. Infiltration began particularly after the first rains during the rainy season when conditions were favourable for the combatants. Vegetation was tall and this provided for cover. The Oshanas were filled with drinking water that combatants needed during the long treks from their Angolan bases into Namibia. The rain also washed away any foot tracks, which rendered follow-up operations by South African forces difficult. Once in Namibia combatants either planted [[Landmine]]s, sabotaged administration infrastructure i.e. electricity pylons, ambushed [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) convoys, or attacked SADF bases from a stand-off distance by using mortars.<ref>https://ujdigispace.uj.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10210/7595/J.L.%20NENGOVHELA_1999_MA.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Facilities===\nPLAN operated numerous base-camps and support facilities, which were initially set up across Southern [[Zambia]] and later in Southern [[Angola]]. Its main guerrilla training camps were located inside Angola, the Tobias Hainyeko Training Centre (THTC) and the Jumbo Training Centre (JTC), both located around [[Lubango]]. Due to the nature of [[guerrilla warfare]], the PLAN did not had permanent bases located closer to the Namibian\u2013Angolan border as compared to a conventional army. In reality, base-camps were set up on a temporary basis as the security situation changed every time.\n\n===Units===\nMain PLAN combat formations comprised:<ref name=\"swapoparty\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.swapoparty.org/zoom_in_126.html|title=SWAPO - How Moscow Battalion came into being|website=www.swapoparty.org|access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref>\n*1st Motorized Infantry Brigade\n*Moscow Battalion\n*Alpha Battalion \n*Bravo Battalion \n*8th Battalion\n*Salute Unit\n*Volcano unit \u2013 this was a special commando force that was trained to infiltrate the Farming areas south of [[Oshivelo]].<ref name=swapoparty/>\n\n===Weapons and equipment===\nBesides enjoying political support and sanctuary from [[Ghana]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]], the PLAN received military assistance mainly from [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], [[Cuba]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[North Korea]], and the [[People's Republic of China]], who provided weapons, ammunition, vehicles and other non-lethal military equipments, such as field radios and uniforms.\n\n====Small-arms====\n*[[PPSh-41|PPSh-41 submachine gun]]\n*[[SKS|SKS semi-automatic rifle]]\n*[[AK-47|AK-47 assault rifle]]\n*[[AKM|AKM assault rifle]]\n*[[Type 56 assault rifle]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Elena Torreguitar| authorlink = | title = National Liberation Movements in Office: Forging Democracy with African Adjectives in Namibia|edition= 2009|page= 159 | publisher = Peter Lang GMBH| isbn= 978-3-631-57995-4}}</ref>\n*[[TT pistol|Tokarev TT-33 pistol]]\n*[[Makarov pistol|Makarov PM pistol]]\n*[[CZ 75|CZ 75 pistol]] \n*[[RPK|RPK light machine gun]]\n*[[RPD machine gun]]\n*[[PK machine gun]]\n*[[SG-43 Goryunov|SG-43/SGM Goryunov medium machine gun]] \n*[[DShK|DShk 12.7mm Heavy machine gun]] \n*[[Mosin\u2013Nagant|M/52 sniper rifle]]\n*[[SVD rifle|Dragunov SVD-63 sniper rifle]]\n\n====Grenade systems====\n*[[F1 grenade (Russia)|F1 hand grenade]]\n*[[RG-4]] anti-personnel grenade\n*[[RG-42]] hand grenade\n*[[RGD-5]] hand grenade\n*[[RPG-43]] anti-tank grenade\n*[[PGN-60]] anti-tank rifle grenade\n*[[M60 rifle grenades|M60 rifle grenade]]\n\n====Land mine systems====\n*[[OZM|OZM-4 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PMD series mines|PMD-6 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PMN mine|PMN-1/2 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[POMZ|POMZ-2/2M anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PP Mi-D mine|PP Mi-D anti-personnel mine]]\n*PP Mi-BA anti-personnel mine\n*PP Mi-SR anti-personnel mine\n*[[PPM-2 mine|PPM-2 anti-personnel mine]]\n*PMA-1 anti-personnel mine\n*[[PMA-2 mine|PMA-2 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PMA-3 mine|PMA-3 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[POMZ|PMR-1 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[POMZ|PMR-2A anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PROM-1|PROM-1 anti-personnel mine]]\n*[[PT Mi-Ba-II mine|PT Mi-Ba-II anti-tank mine]]\n*[[PT Mi-Ba-III mine|PT Mi-Ba-III anti-tank mine]]\n*[[PT Mi-K mine|PT-MI-K anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMA-2 mine|TMA-2 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMA-3 mine|TMA-3 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMA-4 mine|TMA-4 anti-tank mine]]\n*TMA-5 anti-tank mine\n*[[TM-46 mine|TM-46 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TM-57 mine|TM-57 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TM-62 series of mines|TM-62B/M anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMD-44 and TMD-B mines|TMD-44 anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMD-44 and TMD-B mines|TMD-B anti-tank mine]]\n*[[TMK-2 mine|TMK-2 anti-tank mine]]\n*UKA-63 anti-tank mine\n\n====Mortars====\n*[[Mortar 60mm M57|M57 60mm mortar]]\n*[[82-BM-41|82-BM-41 (M-1937) 82mm mortar]]\n\n====Anti-tank rocket and grenade launchers====\n*[[RPG-2]]<ref>L.

This ship was built from 1985 to 1995.]]\n'''''Westerbeek''''' was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Dutch East India Company|East India Company]] sailing ship, built in 1722 in [[Amsterdam]]. It was {{convert|145|ft|m}} long and 650 tons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DAS/detailVoyage/98038 |website=Historici |title=Details of voyage 7145.6 from Ceylon |department=The Dutch East India Company's shipping between the Netherlands and Asia 1595-1795}}</ref>\n\n== The accident ==\nThe ship was wrecked at [[Lopransei\u00f0i]] on the west coast of [[Su\u00f0uroy]], [[Faroe Islands]] on 2 September 1742. In those days it was necessary either to see the stars or the sun in order to navigate a ship, that is to know how far north or how far south the ship was. The crew of ''Westerbeek'' had not seen the sun because of fog for 11 days on the day of the accident, and because of that they went too far north. Too late they realized, that they were about to sail directly on land, and the ship went on land between four [[skerry|skerries]] and a sea cliff of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] on Lopransei\u00f0i. The accident happened on ''Westerbeek''{{'}}s 6th voyage from the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The captain of this voyage was Hermanus Schutten. The cargo was usually tea, coffee, pepper and other spices. The voyage to the East Indies could take up to one year, and often the ships were away from home several years, before returning home. \n\nOn 2 September 1742 around 10:30 at night ''Westerbeek'' ran on land south of Lopransei\u00f0i and sank between the four skerries and the island of [[Su\u00f0uroy]]. Ten of the men never had the time to leave their beds, as they were lying there because of illness. Three men died before the accident and were buried at sea. 81 of the men reached land after the accident, but one of them fell and died while attempting to climb the steep hill where the ship wrecked. They climbed on land through the broken mast of the ship. Then they tied together some oars and then some of the strongest of the men climbed up the hill to get help. Lopra was not a village at that time. The nearest populated places were [[V\u00e1gur]] and [[Sumba, Faroe Islands|Sumba]]. A few men went towards north and arrived to V\u00e1gur, where they got help. The legend says, that some people from V\u00e1gur were in the church and that the men from ''Westerbeek'' got help from them there.\n\n== The survivors and their further voyage ==\nResearch shows that all these 80 men were rescued. They then started the voyage from Su\u00f0uroy to [[T\u00f3rshavn]], the capital of the [[Faroe Islands]]. Today a journey from Su\u00f0uroy to T\u00f3rshavn takes two hours by ferry, but in 1742 they used Faroese rowing boats for transport, and it took several days with breaks in some of the islands, which they passed on their way to T\u00f3rshavn. A book has been published about the accident of ''Westerbeek'' and about the story of the men who survived. The book is written by Mathias Lassen. In the book he describes, that the 80 men traveled to T\u00f3rshavn in small rowing boats. They stopped in [[Sk\u00favoy]] but were not so welcome there, so they continued to the island of [[Sandoy]], where they were warmly welcomed in the village [[Sk\u00e1lav\u00edk]]. From Sk\u00e1lav\u00edk they continued to the village [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]] in the south-western side of [[Streymoy]]. They were not welcome there and got neither food nor dry clothes, so they continued to T\u00f3rshavn. In T\u00f3rshavn two ships were ready to leave for [[Denmark]], and the plan was to get all these 80 men on board these two ships. But the captains of the two ships were afraid to take so many men with them and refused. Only 10 men were allowed to travel with them to Denmark. These were the last ships that year, so these 70 men had to stay all winter in the Faroe Islands, they stayed there for 9 months.\n\n== Faroese people descendant from the crew of Westerbeek ==\nThere are many stories about men from Westerbeek who stayed in the Faroes or sired children in the Faroes, but only a few of these stories can be verified. Joseph Gervording stayed in the Faroe Islands and married Marianna, the bailiff's daughter; they had three children, but no grandchildren. Then there was a woman from the village of [[Lamba (Faroe Islands)|Lamba]], the mother of twins fathered by one of the Westerbeek's crew, but both mother and children died in an [[avalanche]] in Ger\u00f0um in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in 1745. Finally there was a girl from the island of [[V\u00e1gar]], who had a daughter with Berent Schouten, the Westerbeek's carpenter. The daughter, Sunneva Berentsdatter, is an ancestor of many Faroese.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\">\nFile:Su\u00f0uroy.westcoast.1.jpg|The ship went between the four skerries and the steep sea cliff of Lopransei\u00f0i, just below the mountain (under the bird).\nFile:Lopransei\u00f0i.1.jpg|\"Some of the strongest of the men climbed up the hill to get help\". \nFile:30-08 2009 Lopransnsei\u00f0i.jpg|The accident with Westerbeek happened here south of Lopransei\u00f0i\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.vocsite.nl/schepen/detail.html?id=11170 |website=De VOC Site |title=Westerbeek 1722 |language=Dutch}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://forum.faroe-islands.de/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=957 |website=Faroe Islands |department=Diskussionsforum F\u00e4r\u00f6er |title=Diskussion p\u00e5 de nordiske sprog om F\u00e6r\u00f8erne |language=Danish}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.bataviawerf.nl/en/bezoekinformatie.html |website=Bataviawerft |title=Maritime Museum of Bataviawerft}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.stamps.fo/Files/Billeder/stamps.fo/Myndir/Tak%20ni\u00f0ur%20PDF/Posta%20Stamps%20nr.%2026_UK.pdf| title= Posta Stamps-Batavia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Westerbeek}}\n[[Category:History of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:Shipwrecks of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1742]]\n[[Category:Ships of the Dutch East India Company]]\n[[Category:Maritime accidents involving fog]]\n[[Category:Su\u00f0uroy]]\n[[Category:1720s ships]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}}\n \n{|{{Infobox ship begin |display title=ital |infobox caption=''Westerbeek''}} <!-- age of sail -->\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=\n|Ship caption=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=\n|Ship flag=\n|Ship name=\n|Ship owner=[[Dutch East India Company]]\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=\n|Ship original cost=\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=1722\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship commissioned=\n|Ship decommissioned=\n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship renamed=\n|Ship struck=\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship honours=\n|Ship honors=\n|Ship captured=\n|Ship fate=Wrecked 1742\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=\n|Ship tonnage=650 tons\n|Ship length={{convert|145|ft|abbr=on}}\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship hold depth=\n|Ship propulsion=\n|Ship sail plan=\n|Ship complement=\n|Ship armament=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\n[[File:Lopranseidi View to Beinisvord.JPG|thumb|250px|The accident with ''Westerbeek'' happened here south of [[Lopransei\u00f0i]], the ship went between the four [[skerry|skerries]] and the steep sea cliff of Lopransei\u00f0i, just below the mountain [[Kirvi]].]]\n[[File:Ship Batavia 2.jpg|thumb|250px|''Batavia'', which is a copy of VOC ''Batavia'', which was a sister-ship of ''Westerbeek''.
