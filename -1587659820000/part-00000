The story was allegedly inspired by the discovery of unusually warm water in Antarctica in 1947. It starred [[Jock Mahoney]] and [[Shirley Patterson]] and was directed by [[Virgil W. Vogel]]. The film is notable for its low-budget special effects, which include men in dinosaur suits, puppets and [[monitor lizard]]s standing in for dinosaurs. [[William Reynolds (actor)|William Reynolds]] recalled the studio spent so much money on their mechanical dinosaur that they could not afford to shoot the film in colour as they first planned.<ref>There's Always Tomorrow</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA small crew led by Commander Harold Roberts and reporter Maggie Hathaway are on an expedition into [[Antarctica]] for the [[United States Navy]]. During a [[Sikorsky H-5|helicopter]] flight, they are called back to their ship via radio because of an unexpected storm approaching. At first they try to fly around the storm, but low on fuel, they fly into the storm, where they almost collide in mid-air with a man-sizedwhole [[pterosaur]]. Their rotor breaks and unable to stay in the air they start to descend, and are surprised when they end up landing well below [[sea-level]] in a warm [[volcanic crater]]. Inside, they discover a steamy tropical jungle populated by living [[dinosaur]]s, giant flesh-eating plants, and fresh human footprints. The crew encounter many dangers and perils in the jungle in a fight for survival.\n\nThe crew meet Hunter, the lone survivor of a plane crash from the 1947 expedition. He has learned to survive in this land with the aid of a [[conch]] that drives off the animals and by raiding the dinosaurs' nests. He offers the remains of his airplane to repair the helicopter, but only if the crew agree to leave Maggie with him. The crew refuses, but they also know that after 25 days their ship will have to leave before the Antarctic winter sets in. Unsuccessful in finding the remains of the plane, hidden by Hunter, the crew debate leaving Maggie, or forcing the information out of Hunter by torture. Commander Roberts refuses to sink to either low. Maggie is later attacked by an [[Elasmosaurus]], but Hunter rescues her. After a fight and learning that the crew refuse to torture him for the location of the plane, Hunter gives them the map to its location.\n\nAfter repairing the helicopter, the crew take off in a hurry as a [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] attacks their base. They fly to pick up Maggie, who is with Hunter at the time. Hunter is ambushed by the Elasmosaurus, and the crew come to his rescue. They fly out of the lost world with him. Once clear of the crater, the crew are able to communicate again by radio with their ship; however, the helicopter runs out of fuel and crashes into the ocean before it reaches the vessel. The crew are rescued, and once safely on the ship Harold and Maggie declare their love for one another.\n\nThe [[animal]]s featured in this film include a [[Tyrannosaurus]], [[Elasmosaurus]], [[Stegosaurus]] [[Slurpasaur|live acted by monitor lizards]] (which would technically make them [[Megalania]]), a pair of [[Pterosaur]]s and a giant flesh-consuming plant. The mammal found by the crew then later eaten by the carnivorous plant is referred to as a [[tarsier]] but is actually a [[loris]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jock Mahoney]] as Cmndr.

The story was allegedly inspired by the discovery of unusually warm water in Antarctica in 1947. It starred [[Jock Mahoney]] and [[Shirley Patterson]] and was directed by [[Virgil W. Vogel]]. The film is notable for its low-budget special effects, which include men in dinosaur suits, puppets and [[monitor lizard]]s standing in for dinosaurs. [[William Reynolds (actor)|William Reynolds]] recalled the studio spent so much money on their mechanical dinosaur that they could not afford to shoot the film in colour as they first planned.<ref>There's Always Tomorrow</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA small crew led by Commander Harold Roberts and reporter Maggie Hathaway are on an expedition into [[Antarctica]] for the [[United States Navy]]. During a [[Sikorsky H-5|helicopter]] flight, they are called back to their ship via radio because of an unexpected storm approaching. At first they try to fly around the storm, but low on fuel, they fly into the storm, where they almost collide in mid-air with a man-sized [[pterosaur]]. Their rotor breaks and unable to stay in the air they start to descend, and are surprised when they end up landing well below [[sea-level]] in a warm [[volcanic crater]]. Inside, they discover a steamy tropical jungle populated by living [[dinosaur]]s, giant flesh-eating plants, and fresh human footprints. The crew encounter many dangers and perils in the jungle in a fight for survival.\n\nThe crew meet Hunter, the lone survivor of a plane crash from the 1947 expedition. He has learned to survive in this land with the aid of a [[conch]] that drives off the animals and by raiding the dinosaurs' nests. He offers the remains of his airplane to repair the helicopter, but only if the crew agree to leave Maggie with him. The crew refuses, but they also know that after 25 days their ship will have to leave before the Antarctic winter sets in. Unsuccessful in finding the remains of the plane, hidden by Hunter, the crew debate leaving Maggie, or forcing the information out of Hunter by torture. Commander Roberts refuses to sink to either low. Maggie is later attacked by an [[Elasmosaurus]], but Hunter rescues her. After a fight and learning that the crew refuse to torture him for the location of the plane, Hunter gives them the map to its location.\n\nAfter repairing the helicopter, the crew take off in a hurry as a [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] attacks their base. They fly to pick up Maggie, who is with Hunter at the time. Hunter is ambushed by the Elasmosaurus, and the crew come to his rescue. They fly out of the lost world with him. Once clear of the crater, the crew are able to communicate again by radio with their ship; however, the helicopter runs out of fuel and crashes into the ocean before it reaches the vessel. The crew are rescued, and once safely on the ship Harold and Maggie declare their love for one another.\n\nThe [[animal]]s featured in this film include a [[Tyrannosaurus]], [[Elasmosaurus]], [[Stegosaurus]] [[Slurpasaur|live acted by monitor lizards]] (which would technically make them [[Megalania]]), a pair of [[Pterosaur]]s and a giant flesh-consuming plant. The mammal found by the crew then later eaten by the carnivorous plant is referred to as a [[tarsier]] but is actually a [[loris]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jock Mahoney]] as Cmndr.

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo.

As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds.

However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]].

The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles.

Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo.

semi-finalists were each given one of five loglines, and had approximately twelve hours to expand the idea into a full story and [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] the idea to the judges. After all of the pitches were delivered, 14 contestants were eliminated.\n\nIn round two of the auditions, [[Jon Avnet]] filled in for judge [[Garry Marshall]]. The remaining contestants were given 24 hours to write, shoot, and edit a two-and-a-half-minute short film based on the theme \"out of time\". The contestants were asked to divide themselves into groups of three, and each of the group members was responsible for directing one of the three scenes of the film at one of the three filming locations. Each contestant was judged individually based on his or her movie scene. After this round, 14 contestants were eliminated.<ref name=\"semi\" />\n{{see also|List of On the Lot films#Semi-finals \u2013 \"Out of time\"}}\n\nIn round three, each of the 24 remaining contestants was given one hour with a professional set and film crew to shoot a given page of script. Almost none of this final challenge was aired on the televised episode, but short selections of the task and judgment footage were included in several outtake clips on the show's official site. After the announcement of the show's winner, all of these clips were posted on the website. The one-page shorts were categorized into four different scenarios: the rotunda, the law library, the cop bar and the bedroom. The eliminations went unaired, as the finalists had been chosen by the time the next episode aired live.\n\n===Final rounds===\n\n====Week 1====\n{{See also|List of On the Lot films#Final 18|l1=On the Lot Films \u2013 Final 18}}\nThe first challenge for the 18 finalists was to create one-minute comedy shorts. The Film Premiere episode aired each contestant's full short, as well as a short interview/bio shot during the filming of the short. The Box Office show will result in the three directors with the lowest vote totals being eliminated. The judges for week 1 of the finals were [[Garry Marshall]], [[Carrie Fisher]], and [[D. J. Caruso]].\n\n====Weeks 2\u20134====\n:''See also: [[List of On the Lot films#Week two|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Two]], [[List of On the Lot films#Week three|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Three]], and [[List of On the Lot films#Week four|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Four]]''\n''On the Lot'' was reduced to one episode per week beginning June 5, only appearing on Tuesdays. This move has been said to \"cut production costs.\"<ref>https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20040769_20040772_20041498,00.html Entertainment Weekly</ref>\n\nFor weeks 2\u20134, five of the remaining 15 contestants were selected to screen a short no longer than three minutes, filmed in five days; however, it has been disputed whether or not this is in fact true, as these films were the \"personal submission films\" from the auditions (which were passed off as new films without comment). The one of the five with the least audience votes was eliminated. The results were shown on the next week's episode, while the next set of five films were screened.\n\nIn week three, three of the five contestants from who showed films in week two were declared safe. Trever James and Hilary Graham had to wait until the end of the show to see who would be eliminated. In week four, the five contestants who showed films in week three were told, at the start of the show, who had been eliminated.\n\nJoining regular judges [[Carrie Fisher]] and [[Garry Marshall]], were [[Michael Bay]] for week two, [[David Frankel]] for week three, and [[Wes Craven]] for week four.\n\n====Weeks 5\u20136====\n:''See also: [[List of On the Lot films#Week five|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Five]] and [[List of On the Lot films#Week six|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Six]]''\nIn weeks five and six, the contestants were split into two groups of six. The first group was tasked with making two-minute comedy shorts in five days, while the second group's shorts were of the horror genre.\n\nIn contrast to the previous screenings, clips from the production of these films were aired showing fellow contestants visiting each set, thus ensuring that the films were in fact produced during the show period.\n\n[[Mark Waters (director)|Mark Waters]] was the guest judge for week five, and [[Eli Roth]] was the guest judge for week six.\n\n====Weeks 7\u20138====\n:''See also: [[List of On the Lot films#Week seven|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Seven]] and [[List of On the Lot films#Week eight|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week eight]]''\nIn weeks seven and eight, the contestants remained in the same groups as the previous weeks. The first group of five was tasked with making shorts based on the theme, \"when two worlds collide\". The second group's shorts were action films. Two contestants would be eliminated each of these two weeks.\n\n[[Luke Greenfield]] was the guest judge for week seven and [[Antoine Fuqua]] was the guest judge for week eight.\n\n====Week 9====\n{{See also|List of On the Lot films#Week nine|l1=On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Nine}}\nIn week nine, the final six contestants were tasked with making romantic comedies. [[Brad Silberling]] was the guest judge for week nine.\n\n====Week 10====\n{{See also|List of On the Lot films#Week ten|l1=On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Ten}}\nIn week ten, the final five contestants were tasked with making films featuring automobiles for \"Road Night.\" [[Jerry O'Connell]] was a special guest star, and [[Gary Ross]] was the guest judge. [[Penny Marshall]] filled in for regular judge [[Garry Marshall]].\n\n====Week 11====\n{{See also|List of On the Lot films#Week eleven|l1=On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Eleven}}\nIn week eleven, four remaining contestants were tasked with making films inspired by the contest-winning [[Log line|logline]]: \"A man wakes up, rolls out of bed and finds himself in a dress...but can't remember what happened the night before.\" This week's guest judge was [[F. Gary Gray]].\n\n====Season finale====\nIn the first half of the season finale, the three remaining contestants were each asked to choose two of their films to show (after the show had announced the week before that there would be new finale films). Jason Epperson showed ''Eternal Waters'' and ''Sweet''. Will Bigham showed ''Glass Eye'' and ''The Yes Men''. [[Adam Stein]] showed ''Dough: The Musical'' and ''Army Guy''.\n\nA week later, in the second half of the finale, all fifteen eliminated contestants returned and the three finalists each chose their favorite film by an eliminated contestant. Adam chose ''Die Hardly Working'' by [[Zach Lipovsky]]. Will chose ''Under the Gun'' by Hilary Graham. Jason chose ''Catch'' by Mateen Kemet. At one point, the host announced the crash of the voting website, which meant that only phoned-in votes would count. Then, Adam was eliminated. Host [[Adrianna Costa]] asked the judges who they thought should win the competition and [[Carrie Fisher]] chose Will, and [[Garry Marshall]] chose Jason. Will became the winner. The last minutes of the show showed Will arriving at the gates of [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] and being met there by [[Steven Spielberg]] himself. Spielberg praised a few of Will's films and it ended with them walking through the gates of DreamWorks together.\n\n==Cast==\nThe following actors have appeared in two or more short films over the course of the series:\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Tatyana Ali]]\n*[[David Burtka]]\n*[[Erin Cahill]]\n*[[Richard Carmen]]\n*Jonathan Chase\n*Greg Collins\n*Bayne Gibby\n*[[Mark Feuerstein]]\n*[[Patrick Kerr]]\n*[[Frederick Koehler]]\n*[[Joy Osmanski]]\n*[[Randall Park]]\n*Rich Pierrelouis\n*[[Kimberly Scott]]\n*[[Ben Seton]]\n*[[Lin Shaye]]\n*[[Eric Stonestreet]]\n*John Symonds\n*[[Jackie Tohn]]\n*[[Janet Varney]]\n*[[Reginald VelJohnson]]\n*[[Todd Waring]]\n*[[Travis Wester]]\n*Kirk Zipfel\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Ratings==\nThe premiere episode of ''On the Lot'' followed highly rated ''[[American Idol]]'', but failed to hold a majority of the ''Idol'' audience. Lot had a 6.2 rating/ 9 share from 9 to 10 p.m., retaining just 38 percent of ''Idol'''s audience, followed by a loss of 39 percent at 9:30&nbsp;p.m. (7.7/11 to 4.7/ 7).<ref>[http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003589073 Ratings Information] (Mediaweek)</ref>\n\nThe second episode followed another [[Fox network]] reality hit, ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (US)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''. However, like its premiere, the ratings did not hold up after the lead-in show ended, losing half of ''Dance'''s audience. ''On the Lot'' had a 2.1/6 share.<ref>[http://webcast.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=144616 Fox Dances Off with Thursday] (Broadcast Room)</ref>\n\nThe third episode was two hours long and did not have a lead-in show like the first two episodes. The [[Fox Network]] and [[Univision]] tied for fourth for the entire night at 1.8/3, behind [[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[NBC]], respectively, which mostly aired reruns. For the targeted audience, ''Lot'' averaged a 1.3 adults 18\u201349 rating, according to Nielsen overnights, placing fifth in its first airing in its regular timeslot, behind even Univision.<ref>[http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Overnights_50/For_Fox_s_On_the_Lot_it_s_off_the_map.asp On the Lot, Off the Map] (Mediaweek)</ref>\n\n[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] tried a different approach for the fourth episode, having it lead-in for the season finale of ratings hit, ''[[House (TV series)|House]].'' Viewership for ''Lot'' was 4 million, or a 1.8/6 share. Coupled with ''House,'' Fox had the highest viewership on Tuesday, averaging more than 10 million viewers.<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i7746aa910985f285480c126bafb0cdce Season Finale brings down ''House'' for Fox (The Hollywood Reporter)</ref>\n\nThe fifth episode was another attempt at coupling ''Lot'' with ''House,'' which resulted in worse ratings than the previous week. Fox averaged 5.6 million viewers for the night, third behind NBC, which was tops with ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' and ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', and CBS, which aired reruns of ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]''. ''Lot'' had 3.3 million viewers for its hour-long broadcast of five three-minute flicks.<ref>\nhttp://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2007/06/nbcs_got_rating.html NBC's got rating (Orlando Sentinel)</ref>\n\nThe sixth episode, which joined ''Lot'' with ''Hell's Kitchen'' was the first showing that had less than three million viewers. ''Lot'' had 1.2/4 share, or 2.8 million viewers, behind top-rated [[America's Got Talent]] and the [[NBA Finals]].<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3ia91b17b15e3f3af5f1517933a91afb14 Fox feasts on weekly demo (Hollywood Reporter)</ref>\n\nAccording to Nielsen overnights, ''Lot'' dipped even lower on its seventh episode, with only a 1.0 rating, tying it with ABC's shows ''[[Fast Cars and Superstars]]'' and ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]''. NBC had a commanding lead the entire night, thanks to hit show ''Talent.''<ref>http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Overnights_50/Swift_climb_for_America_s_Got_Talent.asp (Media Life Magazine)</ref>\n\nFor its finale and the announcement of the winner, the reality series saw a slight bump as it moved up to 1.1/4 in the 18\u201349 demo, although the net remained well behind the other major broadcasters in the 8 o'clock hour.\n<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970655.html?categoryid=1071&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=NBC's 'Talent' tops Tuesday | first=Rick | last=Kissell | date=August 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nCritics were harshly negative.  Variety wrote, \"it\u2019s hard to imagine this ill-conceived Fox reality show was sold on anything more than the \u201cSteven Spielberg meets Mark Burnett\u201d marquee billing. This awkward mish-mash owes as much to Burnett's \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d as to the little-seen \u201cProject Greenlight,\u201d and the premiere's weak opening ratings, despite an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d lead-in Tuesday, don't bode well for a boffo network run.\"<ref>[https://variety.com/2007/tv/reviews/on-the-lot-1200559057/ Review: \u2018On the Lot\u2019] (Variety)</ref>\n\nMatthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe's summary was typical:  \" \"On the Lot\" does what every knockoff reality contest does\u2014three judges, a lot of humiliation, a little bit of triumph, some product placement\u2014and it doesn't do it well.\"<ref>[http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2007/05/24/spielberg_adds_star_power_but_little_inspiration_to_on_the_lot/ Spielberg adds star power but little inspiration to 'On the Lot'] (Boston Globe)</ref>\n\nInitial criticism was that the show focused on director quarreling instead of broadcasting the directors' audition short films.<ref>[http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/05/25/on-the-lot-auditions-2/ On the Lot Auditions #2] TV Squad</ref> In addition, the judges were faulted for not providing helpful criticism.\nThe show host [[Adrianna Costa]] was criticized for not being engaging enough.

They appeared to be the three-minute films, made in a week, that originally got them cast in the Top 50. The reason behind this is unclear. According to an interview with Jason Epperson, the contestants already know who they are up against, and what week their film will be shown.<ref>[http://copiousnotes.typepad.com/weblog/2007/06/on_the_lot_inte.html] (Copius Notes)</ref>\n\nIn July 2007, Jeff Lippencott and Mark T.

BUSINESS\") CONFIRMED AS JUDGES}}</ref>{{better source|date=December 2016|reason=Reference made before show aired, need a reference that was made after show aired}}\n\nIn round one, the 50 semi-finalists were each given one of five loglines, and had approximately twelve hours to expand the idea into a full story and [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] the idea to the judges. After all of the pitches were delivered, 14 contestants were eliminated.\n\nIn round two of the auditions, [[Jon Avnet]] filled in for judge [[Garry Marshall]]. The remaining contestants were given 24 hours to write, shoot, and edit a two-and-a-half-minute short film based on the theme \"out of time\". The contestants were asked to divide themselves into groups of three, and each of the group members was responsible for directing one of the three scenes of the film at one of the three filming locations. Each contestant was judged individually based on his or her movie scene. After this round, 14 contestants were eliminated.<ref name=\"semi\" />\n{{see also|List of On the Lot films#Semi-finals \u2013 \"Out of time\"}}\n\nIn round three, each of the 24 remaining contestants was given one hour with a professional set and film crew to shoot a given page of script. Almost none of this final challenge was aired on the televised episode, but short selections of the task and judgment footage were included in several outtake clips on the show's official site. After the announcement of the show's winner, all of these clips were posted on the website. The one-page shorts were categorized into four different scenarios: the rotunda, the law library, the cop bar and the bedroom. The eliminations went unaired, as the finalists had been chosen by the time the next episode aired live.\n\n===Final rounds===\n\n====Week 1====\n{{See also|List of On the Lot films#Final 18|l1=On the Lot Films \u2013 Final 18}}\nThe first challenge for the 18 finalists was to create one-minute comedy shorts. The Film Premiere episode aired each contestant's full short, as well as a short interview/bio shot during the filming of the short. The Box Office show will result in the three directors with the lowest vote totals being eliminated. The judges for week 1 of the finals were [[Garry Marshall]], [[Carrie Fisher]], and [[D. J. Caruso]].\n\n====Weeks 2\u20134====\n:''See also: [[List of On the Lot films#Week two|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Two]], [[List of On the Lot films#Week three|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Three]], and [[List of On the Lot films#Week four|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Four]]''\n''On the Lot'' was reduced to one episode per week beginning June 5, only appearing on Tuesdays. This move has been said to \"cut production costs.\"<ref>https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20040769_20040772_20041498,00.html Entertainment Weekly</ref>\n\nFor weeks 2\u20134, five of the remaining 15 contestants were selected to screen a short no longer than three minutes, filmed in five days; however, it has been disputed whether or not this is in fact true, as these films were the \"personal submission films\" from the auditions (which were passed off as new films without comment). The one of the five with the least audience votes was eliminated. The results were shown on the next week's episode, while the next set of five films were screened.\n\nIn week three, three of the five contestants from who showed films in week two were declared safe. Trever James and Hilary Graham had to wait until the end of the show to see who would be eliminated. In week four, the five contestants who showed films in week three were told, at the start of the show, who had been eliminated.\n\nJoining regular judges [[Carrie Fisher]] and [[Garry Marshall]], were [[Michael Bay]] for week two, [[David Frankel]] for week three, and [[Wes Craven]] for week four.\n\n====Weeks 5\u20136====\n:''See also: [[List of On the Lot films#Week five|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Five]] and [[List of On the Lot films#Week six|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Six]]''\nIn weeks five and six, the contestants were split into two groups of six. The first group was tasked with making two-minute comedy shorts in five days, while the second group's shorts were of the horror genre.\n\nIn contrast to the previous screenings, clips from the production of these films were aired showing fellow contestants visiting each set, thus ensuring that the films were in fact produced during the show period.\n\n[[Mark Waters (director)|Mark Waters]] was the guest judge for week five, and [[Eli Roth]] was the guest judge for week six.\n\n====Weeks 7\u20138====\n:''See also: [[List of On the Lot films#Week seven|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Seven]] and [[List of On the Lot films#Week eight|On the Lot Films \u2013 Week eight]]''\nIn weeks seven and eight, the contestants remained in the same groups as the previous weeks. The first group of five was tasked with making shorts based on the theme, \"when two worlds collide\". The second group's shorts were action films. Two contestants would be eliminated each of these two weeks.\n\n[[Luke Greenfield]] was the guest judge for week seven and [[Antoine Fuqua]] was the guest judge for week eight.\n\n====Week 9====\n{{See also|List of On the Lot films#Week nine|l1=On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Nine}}\nIn week nine, the final six contestants were tasked with making romantic comedies. [[Brad Silberling]] was the guest judge for week nine.\n\n====Week 10====\n{{See also|List of On the Lot films#Week ten|l1=On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Ten}}\nIn week ten, the final five contestants were tasked with making films featuring automobiles for \"Road Night.\" [[Jerry O'Connell]] was a special guest star, and [[Gary Ross]] was the guest judge. [[Penny Marshall]] filled in for regular judge [[Garry Marshall]].\n\n====Week 11====\n{{See also|List of On the Lot films#Week eleven|l1=On the Lot Films \u2013 Week Eleven}}\nIn week eleven, four remaining contestants were tasked with making films inspired by the contest-winning [[Log line|logline]]: \"A man wakes up, rolls out of bed and finds himself in a dress...but can't remember what happened the night before.\" This week's guest judge was [[F. Gary Gray]].\n\n====Season finale====\nIn the first half of the season finale, the three remaining contestants were each asked to choose two of their films to show (after the show had announced the week before that there would be new finale films). Jason Epperson showed ''Eternal Waters'' and ''Sweet''. Will Bigham showed ''Glass Eye'' and ''The Yes Men''. [[Adam Stein]] showed ''Dough: The Musical'' and ''Army Guy''.\n\nA week later, in the second half of the finale, all fifteen eliminated contestants returned and the three finalists each chose their favorite film by an eliminated contestant. Adam chose ''Die Hardly Working'' by [[Zach Lipovsky]]. Will chose ''Under the Gun'' by Hilary Graham. Jason chose ''Catch'' by Mateen Kemet. At one point, the host announced the crash of the voting website, which meant that only phoned-in votes would count. Then, Adam was eliminated. Host [[Adrianna Costa]] asked the judges who they thought should win the competition and [[Carrie Fisher]] chose Will, and [[Garry Marshall]] chose Jason. Will became the winner. The last minutes of the show showed Will arriving at the gates of [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] and being met there by [[Steven Spielberg]] himself. Spielberg praised a few of Will's films and it ended with them walking through the gates of DreamWorks together.\n\n==Cast==\nThe following actors have appeared in two or more short films over the course of the series:\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Tatyana Ali]]\n*[[David Burtka]]\n*[[Erin Cahill]]\n*[[Richard Carmen]]\n*Jonathan Chase\n*Greg Collins\n*Bayne Gibby\n*[[Mark Feuerstein]]\n*[[Patrick Kerr]]\n*[[Frederick Koehler]]\n*[[Joy Osmanski]]\n*[[Randall Park]]\n*Rich Pierrelouis\n*[[Kimberly Scott]]\n*[[Ben Seton]]\n*[[Lin Shaye]]\n*[[Eric Stonestreet]]\n*John Symonds\n*[[Jackie Tohn]]\n*[[Janet Varney]]\n*[[Reginald VelJohnson]]\n*[[Todd Waring]]\n*[[Travis Wester]]\n*Kirk Zipfel\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Ratings==\nThe premiere episode of ''On the Lot'' followed highly rated ''[[American Idol]]'', but failed to hold a majority of the ''Idol'' audience. Lot had a 6.2 rating/ 9 share from 9 to 10 p.m., retaining just 38 percent of ''Idol'''s audience, followed by a loss of 39 percent at 9:30&nbsp;p.m. (7.7/11 to 4.7/ 7).<ref>[http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003589073 Ratings Information] (Mediaweek)</ref>\n\nThe second episode followed another [[Fox network]] reality hit, ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (US)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''. However, like its premiere, the ratings did not hold up after the lead-in show ended, losing half of ''Dance'''s audience. ''On the Lot'' had a 2.1/6 share.<ref>[http://webcast.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=144616 Fox Dances Off with Thursday] (Broadcast Room)</ref>\n\nThe third episode was two hours long and did not have a lead-in show like the first two episodes. The [[Fox Network]] and [[Univision]] tied for fourth for the entire night at 1.8/3, behind [[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[NBC]], respectively, which mostly aired reruns. For the targeted audience, ''Lot'' averaged a 1.3 adults 18\u201349 rating, according to Nielsen overnights, placing fifth in its first airing in its regular timeslot, behind even Univision.<ref>[http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Overnights_50/For_Fox_s_On_the_Lot_it_s_off_the_map.asp On the Lot, Off the Map] (Mediaweek)</ref>\n\n[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] tried a different approach for the fourth episode, having it lead-in for the season finale of ratings hit, ''[[House (TV series)|House]].'' Viewership for ''Lot'' was 4 million, or a 1.8/6 share. Coupled with ''House,'' Fox had the highest viewership on Tuesday, averaging more than 10 million viewers.<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i7746aa910985f285480c126bafb0cdce Season Finale brings down ''House'' for Fox (The Hollywood Reporter)</ref>\n\nThe fifth episode was another attempt at coupling ''Lot'' with ''House,'' which resulted in worse ratings than the previous week. Fox averaged 5.6 million viewers for the night, third behind NBC, which was tops with ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' and ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', and CBS, which aired reruns of ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]''. ''Lot'' had 3.3 million viewers for its hour-long broadcast of five three-minute flicks.<ref>\nhttp://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_tv_tvblog/2007/06/nbcs_got_rating.html NBC's got rating (Orlando Sentinel)</ref>\n\nThe sixth episode, which joined ''Lot'' with ''Hell's Kitchen'' was the first showing that had less than three million viewers. ''Lot'' had 1.2/4 share, or 2.8 million viewers, behind top-rated [[America's Got Talent]] and the [[NBA Finals]].<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3ia91b17b15e3f3af5f1517933a91afb14 Fox feasts on weekly demo (Hollywood Reporter)</ref>\n\nAccording to Nielsen overnights, ''Lot'' dipped even lower on its seventh episode, with only a 1.0 rating, tying it with ABC's shows ''[[Fast Cars and Superstars]]'' and ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]''. NBC had a commanding lead the entire night, thanks to hit show ''Talent.''<ref>http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Overnights_50/Swift_climb_for_America_s_Got_Talent.asp (Media Life Magazine)</ref>\n\nFor its finale and the announcement of the winner, the reality series saw a slight bump as it moved up to 1.1/4 in the 18\u201349 demo, although the net remained well behind the other major broadcasters in the 8 o'clock hour.\n<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970655.html?categoryid=1071&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=NBC's 'Talent' tops Tuesday | first=Rick | last=Kissell | date=August 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nCritics were harshly negative.  Variety wrote, \"it\u2019s hard to imagine this ill-conceived Fox reality show was sold on anything more than the \u201cSteven Spielberg meets Mark Burnett\u201d marquee billing. This awkward mish-mash owes as much to Burnett's \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d as to the little-seen \u201cProject Greenlight,\u201d and the premiere's weak opening ratings, despite an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d lead-in Tuesday, don't bode well for a boffo network run.\"<ref>[https://variety.com/2007/tv/reviews/on-the-lot-1200559057/ Review: \u2018On the Lot\u2019] (Variety)</ref>\n\nMatthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe's summary was typical:  \" \"On the Lot\" does what every knockoff reality contest does\u2014three judges, a lot of humiliation, a little bit of triumph, some product placement\u2014and it doesn't do it well.\"<ref>[http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2007/05/24/spielberg_adds_star_power_but_little_inspiration_to_on_the_lot/ Spielberg adds star power but little inspiration to 'On the Lot'] (Boston Globe)</ref>\n\nInitial criticism was that the show focused on director quarreling instead of broadcasting the directors' audition short films.<ref>[http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/05/25/on-the-lot-auditions-2/ On the Lot Auditions #2] TV Squad</ref> In addition, the judges were faulted for not providing helpful criticism.\nThe show host [[Adrianna Costa]] was criticized for not being engaging enough. It seemed to critics she had trouble reading her cue cards.<ref>[https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20040639,00.html They Didn't Kill Kenny!] (Entertainment Weekly)</ref>\n\nDifferent formats, seasonal issues, and the contestants' reactions made it clear that the three minute films featured in weeks two, three, and four were made before the Top 50 contestants were picked. They appeared to be the three-minute films, made in a week, that originally got them cast in the Top 50. The reason behind this is unclear. According to an interview with Jason Epperson, the contestants already know who they are up against, and what week their film will be shown.<ref>[http://copiousnotes.typepad.com/weblog/2007/06/on_the_lot_inte.html] (Copius Notes)</ref>\n\nIn July 2007, Jeff Lippencott and Mark T.
