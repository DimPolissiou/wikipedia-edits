It is in the [[London commuter belt]] and one of three towns in the [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] of [[Reigate and Banstead]]. It is sited at the foot of the [[North Downs]] and extends over part of the [[Greensand Ridge]]. Reigate has a medieval castle and has been a [[market town]] since the medieval period, when it also became a [[parliamentary borough]].\n\n[[Colley Hill]], one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) north-west of Reigate, is {{convert|722|ft|m}} high. Reigate Hill, {{convert|2.5|mi}} due east of Colley Hill, is {{convert|771|ft|m}} high, and they both have panoramas along the [[North Downs Way]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Reigate-Roman-tile-kiln 2004 thumb2.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Kiln fire channel]]\nThere are [[neolithic]] [[flint]] mines on the ridge of the North Downs above Reigate. [[Bronze Age]] settlement in the area is indicated by [[Tumulus|barrows]] on Reigate Heath. A Bronze Age spearhead was recovered on Park Hill in Reigate Priory Park. In 2004 a Roman tile kiln, dated from around AD 92 (pictured left), was recovered from the grounds of Rosehill in Doods Way. Tiles on the Rosehill site were first discovered in the 1880s. The tiles would have been used for important buildings in the area. The Rosehill find is the oldest recorded use of Reigate stone ([[ironstone]] of the Upper [[Greensand]]) for [[ashlar]] work.\n\nReigate was within the [[Reigate (hundred)|Reigate]] [[hundred (division)|hundred]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] administrative division.\nReigate appears in ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in 1086 as ''Cherchefelle'', which appears to mean \"the open space by the hill\". It was held by [[William the Conqueror]] as successor to [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]]'s widow Editha. Its Domesday assets were: 34 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s, 2 [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s worth 11s 10d, 29 [[plough]]s, {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of [[meadow]], [[pannage]] and herbage worth 183 [[hog (swine)|hog]]s.

Part of the site was excavated in the 1990s, and this revealed that the settlement moved during the earlier part of the 12th century when the present town was formed. [[William I of England|William I]] granted the land around Reigate to one of his supporters, [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey|William de Warenne]], who was created [[Earl of Surrey]] in 1088. It is believed that his son, [[William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey]], ordered that [[Reigate Castle]] be built, although the de Warennes had their southern base at [[Lewes]], Sussex, as well as castles in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Normandy]]. Around 1150 the Earl de Warenne laid out a new town below the castle. This town forms the basis of modern-day Reigate. Little is known of the castle, which has never been excavated on any great scale.

The Effingham branch of the Howard family, including the [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Earl of Nottingham]] (who as Lord High Admiral commanded the force which defeated the [[Spanish Armada]]), lived there until their heirs sold it to the wealthy London brewer, [[John Parsons (died 1717)|Sir John Parsons]], in 1681. Remains of the former monastery buildings lie beneath the lawns to the south of the present mainly 18th-century house, which is now used as a school.\n\nThe town developed a large trade in [[oatmeal]] during the 16th century<ref>Greenwood,J. Turnpikes and the economy. 2008</ref> but this had ceased by about 1720. There was a noted [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] at Linkfield Street which was expanded in the 19th century. It burnt down about 1930.\n\n[[File:The White Hart Reigate.jpg|thumb|right|The White Hart pub as depicted in a book on the London\u2013Brighton road from 1894.]]\nThe coming of the [[London and Brighton Railway]] in 1841 led to new buildings being built across the parish, resulting in a second town in the eastern fields around the railway station in an area that was previously uninhabited: this town at first had two names{{clarify|date=September 2015}} but since the early 20th century has been called [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]].\n\nReigate has two [[windmill]]s: a post mill on [[Reigate Heath Windmill|Reigate Heath]] and a tower mill on [[Wray Common Mill, Reigate|Wray Common]]. In the medieval period the parish had other windmills, about a dozen animal-powered mills for oatmeal and watermills on the southern parish boundary with the [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]] and Redhill Brook.<ref>Farries and Mason. Mills of Surrey</ref>\n\n;Administrative history\nThe non-corporate [[Reigate (UK Parliament constituency)|Borough of Reigate]], covering roughly the town centre, was formed in 1295. It elected two MPs until the Reform Act of 1832 when it lost one. In 1863 the whole parish was formally incorporated as a [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] with Thomas Dann as its first mayor. In 1867 Redhill gained its first of two [[vestry|vestry committees]] within the parish system that occupied the east of Reigate.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/20420/units A Vision of Britain: First mention of Redhill, units and statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107185645/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/20420/units |date=2015-01-07 }} [[University of Portsmouth]] and others</ref> In 1868 Reigate borough was disenfranchised for corruption but representation was revived in the Redistribution of Seats Act in 1885.

It is in the [[London commuter belt]] and one of three towns in the [[borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] of [[Reigate and Banstead]]. It is sited at the foot of the [[North Downs]] and extends over part of the [[Greensand Ridge]]. Reigate has a medieval castle and has been a [[market town]] since the medieval period, when it also became a [[parliamentary borough]].\n\n[[Colley Hill]], one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) north-west of Reigate, is {{convert|722|ft|m}} high. Reigate Hill, {{convert|2.5|mi}} due east of Colley Hill, is {{convert|771|ft|m}} high, and they both have panoramas along the [[North Downs Way]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Reigate-Roman-tile-kiln 2004 thumb2.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Kiln fire channel]]\nThere are [[neolithic]] [[flint]] mines on the ridge of the North Downs above Reigate. [[Bronze Age]] settlement in the area is indicated by [[Tumulus|barrows]] on Reigate Heath. A Bronze Age spearhead was recovered on Park Hill in Reigate Priory Park. In 2004 a Roman tile kiln, dated from around AD 92 (pictured left), was recovered from the grounds of Rosehill in Doods Way. Tiles on the Rosehill site were first discovered in the 1880s. The tiles would have been used for important buildings in the area. The Rosehill find is the oldest recorded use of Reigate stone ([[ironstone]] of the Upper [[Greensand]]) for [[ashlar]] work.\n\nReigate was within the [[Reigate (hundred)|Reigate]] [[hundred (division)|hundred]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] administrative division.\nReigate appears in ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in 1086 as ''Cherchefelle'', which appears to mean \"the open space by the hill\". It was held by [[William the Conqueror]] as successor to [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]]'s widow Editha. Its Domesday assets were: 34 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s, 2 [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s worth 11s 10d, 29 [[plough]]s, {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of [[meadow]], [[pannage]] and herbage worth 183 [[hog (swine)|hog]]s.

Part of the site was excavated in the 1990s, and this revealed that the settlement moved during the earlier part of the 12th century when the present town was formed. [[William I of England|William I]] granted the land around Reigate to one of his supporters, [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey|William de Warenne]], who was created [[Earl of Surrey]] in 1088. It is believed that his son, [[William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey]], ordered that [[Reigate Castle]] be built, although the de Warennes had their southern base at [[Lewes]], Sussex, as well as castles in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Normandy]]. Around 1150 the Earl de Warenne laid out a new town below the castle. This town forms the basis of modern-day Reigate. Little is known of the castle, which has never been excavated on any great scale.

The story however has no truth to it. The castle later fell into decay and the remains were demolished at the end of the 17th century, though the grounds remain as a public garden, and the caves are occasionally opened for tours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wcms.org.uk/pages/club/reigate_caves.shtml|title=Reigate Caves|publisher=Wealden Cave & Mine Society|accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of the name Reigate is uncertain, but appears to derive from Roe-deer Gate, as the town was situated near to the entrance to the de Warenne's [[Medieval deer park|deer park]].<ref name=\"Council\">[http://www.reigate-banstead.gov.uk/public/Learning/History/reigate.asp Reigate and Banstead Borough Council: A Brief History of Reigate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012234416/http://www.reigate-banstead.gov.uk/public/Learning/History/reigate.asp |date=2007-10-12 }}</ref> Another possibility is that Reigate derives from Rhie-gat, roughly translating to the River's Course.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Camden |first1=William |title=Britain, or A chorographicall description of the most flourishing kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of antiquitie beautified vvith mappes of the severall shires of England: vvritten first in Latine by William Camden Clarenceux K. of A.

The Effingham branch of the Howard family, including the [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Earl of Nottingham]] (who as Lord High Admiral commanded the force which defeated the [[Spanish Armada]]), lived there until their heirs sold it to the wealthy London brewer, [[John Parsons (died 1717)|Sir John Parsons]], in 1681. Remains of the former monastery buildings lie beneath the lawns to the south of the present mainly 18th-century house, which is now used as a school.\n\nThe town developed a large trade in [[oatmeal]] during the 16th century<ref>Greenwood,J. Turnpikes and the economy. 2008</ref> but this had ceased by about 1720. There was a noted [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] at Linkfield Street which was expanded in the 19th century. It burnt down about 1930.\n\n[[File:The White Hart Reigate.jpg|thumb|right|The White Hart pub as depicted in a book on the London\u2013Brighton road from 1894.]]\nThe coming of the [[London and Brighton Railway]] in 1841 led to new buildings being built across the parish, resulting in a second town in the eastern fields around the railway station in an area that was previously uninhabited: this town at first had two names{{clarify|date=September 2015}} but since the early 20th century has been called [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]].\n\nReigate has two [[windmill]]s: a post mill on [[Reigate Heath Windmill|Reigate Heath]] and a tower mill on [[Wray Common Mill, Reigate|Wray Common]]. In the medieval period the parish had other windmills, about a dozen animal-powered mills for oatmeal and watermills on the southern parish boundary with the [[River Mole, Surrey|Mole]] and Redhill Brook.<ref>Farries and Mason. Mills of Surrey</ref>\n\n;Administrative history\nThe non-corporate [[Reigate (UK Parliament constituency)|Borough of Reigate]], covering roughly the town centre, was formed in 1295. It elected two MPs until the Reform Act of 1832 when it lost one. In 1863 the whole parish was formally incorporated as a [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] with Thomas Dann as its first mayor. In 1867 Redhill gained its first of two [[vestry|vestry committees]] within the parish system that occupied the east of Reigate.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/20420/units A Vision of Britain: First mention of Redhill, units and statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107185645/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/20420/units |date=2015-01-07 }} [[University of Portsmouth]] and others</ref> In 1868 Reigate borough was disenfranchised for corruption but representation was revived in the Redistribution of Seats Act in 1885.

It was rated at up to {{convert|500|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but more usually in the {{convert|300|-|400|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} range.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Algol was a conventionally laid out [[radial engine]], with nine cylinders in a single row.  The [[crankcase]] was a barrel-shaped aluminium alloy casting, with an internal integral diaphragm which held the front crankshaft bearing.  Forward of the diaphragm there was an integrally cast [[cam-gear]] case for the double track [[cam-ring]].  The reduction gear was housed under a domed casing attached to the front of the crankcase.<ref name=\"JAWA38\"/>\n\nFlange-mounted steel barrels were bolted to the crankcase and enclosed with cast aluminium alloy, screwed-on, cylinder head with integral [[cooling fin]]s. The pistons were also made of aluminium alloy and had floating [[gudgeon pin]]s. The nine pistons drove the single throw crankshaft via one channel-section [[radial engine|master rod]] and eight circular section auxiliary rods.  The master rod had an integral, split type [[crankpin|big-end]]. The crankshaft was machined  from a single forging, with bolt-on balance weights.<ref name=\"JAWA38\"/>\n\nThe Algol had a single pair of [[overhead valve|overhead]] inlet and exhaust valves per cylinder. The cam-ring drove roller [[tappet]]s, mounted in the cam-case, which in turn operated [[rocker arm]]s, fitted with ball bearings, via [[pushrods]].

It was rated at up to {{convert|500|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but more usually in the {{convert|300|-|400|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} range.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Algol was a conventionally laid out [[radial engine]], with nine cylinders in a single row.  The [[crankcase]] was a barrel-shaped aluminium alloy casting, with an internal integral diaphragm which held the front crankshaft bearing.  Forward of the diaphragm there was an integrally cast [[cam-gear]] case for the double track [[cam-ring]].  The reduction gear was housed under a domed casing attached to the front of the crankcase.<ref name=\"JAWA38\"/>\n\nFlange-mounted steel barrels were bolted to the crankcase and enclosed with cast aluminium alloy, screwed-on, cylinder head with integral [[cooling fin]]s. The pistons were also made of aluminium alloy and had floating [[gudgeon pin]]s. The nine pistons drove the single throw crankshaft via one channel-section [[radial engine|master rod]] and eight circular section auxiliary rods.  The master rod had an integral, split type [[crankpin|big-end]]. The crankshaft was machined  from a single forging, with bolt-on balance weights.<ref name=\"JAWA38\"/>\n\nThe Algol had a single pair of [[overhead valve|overhead]] inlet and exhaust valves per cylinder. The cam-ring drove roller [[tappet]]s, mounted in the cam-case, which in turn operated [[rocker arm]]s, fitted with ball bearings, via [[pushrods]].  The cam-ring was concentric with the crankshaft and driven via [[epicyclic gear]]s.<ref name=\"JAWA38\"/>\n\nMost Algols were conventionally aspirated via a single [[carburetter]]<ref name=\"JAWA38\"/>\nbut at least one 1938 variant used a form of [[fuel injection]], where fuel was blown into the induction system rather than the cylinder head.<ref name=\"Flight\"/>\n <!-- ==Operational history== -->\n\n==Variants==\n;9A:\n;9Ab:\n;9Ac:\n;9Ad:\n;9N Algol: \n;9Na Algol:\n;9N Algol-Junior\n;9N Algol-Major\n;9N Algol-Amelior\u00e9\n;Type 120 500&nbsp;hp: A developed version with supercharger and reduction gear giving {{convert|500|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref name=SNCM>{{cite book|title=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Constructions de Moteurs: Argentuil|date=November 1938|publisher=SNCM|location=Argentuil|url=http://dev.museesafran.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1350047099-livres-espace-patrimoine-saf2012_0048826|accessdate=11 October 2014|language=French|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016180638/http://dev.museesafran.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1350047099-livres-espace-patrimoine-saf2012_0048826|archivedate=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n*[[ANF Les Mureaux 120]]\n*[[Bernard 160|Bernard 161]]\n*[[Bloch 120]]\n*[[Bloch 500]]\n*[[Caudron C.180]]\n*[[FBA 290]]\n*[[Loire 11]]\n*[[Potez 33]]\n*[[Potez 40]]\n*[[PWS-24]]\n*[[Romano R.16]]\n*[[SAB-SEMA 12]]\n* [[SAB LH-70]]\n*[[Weymann 66]]\n<!-- Survivors -->\n<!-- Engines on display== -->\n\n==Specifications==\n{{pistonspecs|\n<!-- Please include units where appropriate (main comes first, alt in parentheses).

He prefers playing games and being mischievous, but can be rather hasty and uncoordinated. He would rather look cool than follow directions, but cares about Valentino above anything else. Additionally, he is really bad at spelling, prefers being dirty and is easily duped into committing certain acts.\n* Valentino \"Val\" (voiced by [[Rico Rodriguez (actor)|Rico Rodriguez]] [pilot]; Sean-Ryan Petersen [series]): Victor's older half-brother who is more cautious and likes taking in the smaller things in life. He has better coordination than Victor and is smarter, but still looks out for him and cares for his well-being. He is overweight, but seems pretty nimble at times, and is very knowledgeable about ancient Mexican culture and its history.\n* Chata (voiced by Carla Tassara [pilot]; Laura Patalano [series]): the boys' grandmother, with whom they stay in Monte Macabre for the summer. She appears to be blind, is stern, yet kind. The pilot depicts her as an undead spirit that can take on a human form, while the series only implies her supernatural connections.\n* Maria Teresa (voiced by Frankie Qui\u00f1ones): Charlene and Pinapple's mean-spirited grandmother and Chata's rival. She owns her own taco establishment.\n** Charlene (voiced by Cristina Milizia): A strange and macabre little girl who picks on/hangs out with Vic and Val. She has connections to the supernatural and likes using them on the brothers. She has a crush on Victor and takes every chance to be involved with whatever he is doing.\n** Pineapple (voiced by Diego Molano): A large, lumbering, monosyllabic boy who is Charlene's brother. He acts as a stooge for her and, despite his intimidating appearance, is shown to like dancing and be sympathetic.\n* Julio \"Don\" Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by Jason Hightower): The local [[mini-mart]] owner who gets caught up in Vic and Val's antics, and is well-versed in Mexican and Latin-american folklore and cryptids. He seems to be attracted to Grandma Chata and sweats a lot in her presence.\n* Xochi Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by [[Cristina Vee]]): Don Jalape\u00f1o's teenage daughter who tends to the supernatural plants in the back of the store. She can be intimidating and takes Salsa dancing.\n\n== Broadcast ==\nThe show premiered on [[Cartoon Network (UK & Ireland)|Cartoon Network UK]] on 26 August 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RegularTweetsUK/status/1144233216569741318?s=21|title=1/ Cartoon Network UK August 2019 Highlights: Victor and Valentino premieres on Monday 26th August airs Weekdays at 10am and 5:30pm.

Singapore was the major British military base in [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]] and was [[Singapore strategy|the key]] to British imperial interwar defence planning for South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific. The fighting in Singapore lasted from 8 to 15 February 1942, after the two months during which Japanese forces [[Malayan Campaign|had advanced down the Malayan Peninsula]].\n\nThe campaign, including the final battle, was a decisive Japanese victory, resulting in the Japanese capture of Singapore and the largest British surrender in history.{{sfn|Corrigan|2010|p=280}} About 80,000 British, [[British Raj|Indian]] and Australian troops in Singapore became [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the earlier [[Malayan Campaign]].

Intelligence gained in late 1940 \u2013 early 1941 did not alter the basic plan, but confirmed it in the minds of Japanese decision makers.{{sfn|Drea|1991|p=204}} On 11 November 1940, the German raider ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' captured the British steamer [[SS Automedon|''Automedon'']] in the [[Indian Ocean]], which was carrying papers meant for Air Marshal Sir [[Robert Brooke-Popham]], the British commander in the Far East, which included much information about the weakness of the Singapore base.{{sfn|Drea|1991|p=203}} In December 1940, the Germans handed over copies of the papers to the Japanese.{{sfn|Drea|1991|p=203}} The Japanese had broken the British Army's codes and in January 1941, the Second Department (the intelligence-gathering arm) of the Imperial Army had interpreted and read a message from Singapore to London complaining in much detail about the weak state of \"Fortress Singapore\", a message that was so frank in its admission of weakness that the Japanese at first suspected it was a British plant, believing that no officer would be so open in admitting weaknesses to his superiors, and only believed it was genuine after cross-checking the message with the ''Automedon'' papers.{{sfn|Drea|1991|p=202}}\n\nAs Japan's oil reserves were rapidly depleted by the ongoing military operations in China as well as industrial consumption, in the latter half of 1941, the Japanese began preparing a military response to secure vital resources if diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation failed. As a part of this process, the Japanese planners determined a broad scheme of manoeuvre that incorporated simultaneous attacks on the territories of Britain, The Netherlands and the United States. This would see landings in Malaya and Hong Kong as part of a general move south to secure Singapore, which was connected to Malaya by the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway]], and then an invasion of the oil-rich area of Borneo and Java in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. In addition, strikes would be made against the United States naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, as well as landings in the Philippines, and attacks on Guam, Wake Island and the Gilbert Islands.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=72\u201373}}{{sfn|Costello|2009|p=98}} Following these attacks, a period of consolidation was planned, after which the Japanese planners intended to build up the defences of the territory that had been captured by establishing a strong perimeter around it stretching from the India\u2013Burma frontier through to Wake Island, and traversing Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea and New Britain, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. This perimeter would be used to block Allied attempts to regain the lost territory and defeat their will to fight.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=72\u201373}}\n\n===Invasion of Malaya===\n{{Main|Malayan Campaign}}\n{{History of Singapore}}\nThe [[Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)|Japanese 25th Army]] invaded from Indochina, moving into northern Malaya and [[Thailand]] by [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] on 8 December 1941.{{sfn|Brayley|2002|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Farrell|Pratten|2011|pp=91\u201392}} This was virtually simultaneous with the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] which precipitated the United States entry into the war. Thailand initially resisted, but soon had to yield. The Japanese then proceeded overland across the Thai\u2013Malayan border to attack Malaya. At this time, the Japanese began [[Bombing of Singapore (8 December 1941)|bombing strategic sites in Singapore]].{{sfn|Keogh|1962|pp=62\u201365}}\n\nThe Japanese 25th Army was resisted in northern Malaya by [[III Corps (India)|III Corps]] of the [[British Indian Army]]. Although the 25th Army was outnumbered by Allied forces in Malaya and Singapore, the Allies did not take the initiative with their forces, while Japanese commanders concentrated their forces. The Japanese were superior in [[close air support]], armour, co-ordination, tactics and experience. While conventional British military thinking was that the Japanese forces were inferior, and characterised the Malayan jungles as \"impassable\",{{sfn|Moreman|2005|p=13}} the Japanese were repeatedly able to use it to their advantage to outflank hastily established defensive lines.{{sfn|Brayley|2002|p=15}} Prior to the Battle of Singapore the most resistance was met at the [[Battle of Muar]],{{sfn|Mant|1995|p=23}} which involved the [[8th Division (Australia)|Australian 8th Division]] and the Indian 45th Brigade, as the British troops left in the city of Singapore were basically garrison troops.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=198}}\n\nAt the start of the campaign, the Allied forces had only 164 first-line aircraft on hand in Malaya and Singapore, and the only fighter type was the obsolete [[Brewster F2A Buffalo|Brewster 339E Buffalo]]. These aircraft were operated by two [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), two [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), and one [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) squadron.{{sfn|Gillison|1962|pp=204\u2013205}} Major shortcomings included a slow rate of climb and the aircraft's fuel system which required the pilot to hand pump fuel if flying above {{convert|6000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=115}} In contrast, the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] was more numerous and better trained than the second-hand assortment of untrained pilots and inferior allied equipment remaining in Malaya, Borneo and Singapore. Their fighter aircraft<!--', particularly the Zero,'- This part of the article is about the Japanese Army Air Force, so talk about the Zero is irrelevant as it was only used by the Naval Air Service.--> were superior to the Allied fighters, which helped the Japanese to gain [[air supremacy]].{{sfn|Farrell|Pratten|2011|pp=30, 98 & 101}} Although outnumbered and outclassed, the Buffalos were able to provide some resistance, with RAAF pilots alone managing to shoot down at least 20 Japanese aircraft before the few that survived were withdrawn.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=115}}\n\n[[File:Singapore causeway blown up.jpg|left|thumb|View of the blown up causeway, with the gap visible in the middle, which delayed the Japanese conquest for over a week to 8 February]]\n\n[[Force Z]], consisting of the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} and four [[destroyer]]s, sailed north out of Singapore on 8 December to oppose expected Japanese landings along the coast of Malaya.

Japanese forces quickly isolated, surrounded, and forced the surrender of Indian units defending the coast. Despite their numerical inferiority, they advanced down the Malayan Peninsula, overwhelming the defences. The Japanese forces also used [[bicycle infantry]] and [[light tank]]s, allowing swift movement through the jungle. The Allies, however, having thought the terrain made them impractical, had no tanks and only a few armoured vehicles, which put them at a severe disadvantage.{{sfn|Hall|1983|p=67}}\n\nAlthough more Allied units\u2014including some from the Australian 8th Division{{refn|Two brigades from the Australian 8th Division had been dispatched to Singapore and then Malaya in February 1941, while its third brigade had been dispersed to garrison [[Rabaul]], [[Timor]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]].{{sfn|Powell|2003|p=7}}|group=Note}}\u2014joined the campaign, the Japanese prevented the Allied forces from regrouping. They also overran cities and advanced toward Singapore. The city was an anchor for the operations of the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] (ABDACOM), the first Allied joint command of the Second World War. Singapore controlled the main shipping channel between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. An effective ambush was carried out by the [[2/30th Battalion (Australia)|Australian 2/30th Battalion]] on the main road at the Gemenceh River near Gemas on 14 January, causing heavy Japanese casualties.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=197}}{{refn|The number of Japanese killed and wounded is disputed.{{sfn|Murdoch|2012|}}|group=Note}}\n\nAt Bakri, from 18 to 22 January, Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Groves Wright Anderson|Charles Anderson]]'s [[2/19th Battalion (Australia)|Australian 2/19th Battalion]] and the [[2/29th Battalion (Australia)|Australian 2/29th Battalion]] repeatedly fought through Japanese positions before running out of ammunition near Parit Sulong.

Six of the United Kingdom battalions (in the 54th and 55th Brigades of the 18th Division) had only just landed in Malaya, and the other seven battalions were under-manned. Of the Australian battalions, three had drawn heavily upon recently-arrived, practically-untrained recruits. The Malay battalions had not been in action, and the Straits Settlements Volunteers were only sketchily trained. Further, losses on the mainland had resulted in a general shortage of equipment.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=290}}</blockquote>Percival gave Major-General [[Gordon Bennett (general)|Gordon Bennett]]'s two brigades from the Australian 8th Division responsibility for the western side of Singapore, including the prime invasion points in the northwest of the island.

In fact, most of the guns could be turned, and were indeed fired at the invaders. However, the guns\u2014which included [[Johore Battery|one battery of three]] {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} weapons and one with two {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns\u2014were supplied mostly with [[armor-piercing shell]]s (AP) and few [[High explosive#High explosives|high explosive]] (HE) shells.

To compound matters, Percival had ordered the Australians to defend forward so as to cover the waterway, yet this meant they were immediately fully committed to any fighting, limiting their flexibility, whilst also reducing their defensive depth.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=202}} The two Australian brigades were subsequently allocated a very wide frontage of over {{convert|18|km|mi}} and were separated by the Kranji River.{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}}\n\nYamashita had just over 30,000 men from three divisions: the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Imperial Guards]] Division under Lieutenant-General [[Takuma Nishimura]], the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|5th Division]] under Lieutenant-General [[Takuro Matsui]] and the [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th Division]] under Lieutenant-General [[Renya Mutaguchi]].{{sfn|Felton|2008|p=33}} Also in support was a light tank brigade.{{sfn|Murfett et al|2011|p=177}} In comparison, following the withdrawal, Percival had about 85,000 men at his disposal, although 15,000 were administrative personnel, while large numbers were semi-trained British, Indian and Australian reinforcements that had only recently arrived. Meanwhile, of those forces that had seen action during the previous fighting, the majority were under-strength and under-equipped.{{sfn|Keogh|1962|p=157}}\n\nIn the days leading up to the Japanese attack, patrols from the Australian 22nd Brigade were sent across the strait to Johor at night to gather intelligence. Three small patrols were sent on the evening of 6 February; one was spotted and withdrew after its leader was killed and their boat sunk, while two others managed to get ashore. Over the course of a day, they found large concentrations of troops, although they were unable to locate any landing craft.{{sfn|Hall|1983|p=163}} The Australians requested the shelling of these positions to disrupt the Japanese preparations,{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=286}} but the patrol reports were later ignored by Malaya Command as being insignificant,{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=287}} based upon the belief that the real assault would come in the north-eastern sector, not the north-west.{{sfn|Hall|1983|pp=162\u2013163}}{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Initial Japanese landings===\n{{Main|Battle of Sarimbun Beach}}\n\n[[File:Sarimbun battle.jpg|thumb|The Japanese landings on Singapore Island]]\nBlowing up the causeway had delayed the Japanese attack for over a week. Prior to the main assault, the Australians were subjected to an intense artillery bombardment. Over a period of 15 hours,{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}} starting at 23:00 on 8 February 1942, Yamashita's heavy guns laid down a barrage of 88,000 shells (200 rounds per tube){{sfn|Allen| 2013|p=169}} along the entire length of the straits, cutting telephone lines and effectively isolating forward units from rear areas.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|pp=308\u2013310}} Even at this stage, a counter artillery barrage as a response could have been mounted by the British on the coastline opposite the Australians that would have caused casualties and disruption among the Japanese assault troops.{{sfn|Costello|2009|p=199}} But the bombardment of the Australians was not seen as a prelude to imminent attack\u2014Malaya Command believed that it would last several days and would later switch its focus to the north-east, despite its ferocity exceeding anything the Allies had experienced thus far in the campaign; consequently, no order was passed to the Allied artillery units to begin targeting possible Japanese assembly areas.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=288}}\n\nShortly before 20:30 on 8 February, the first wave of Japanese troops from the 5th and 18th Divisions began crossing the Johor Strait. The main weight of the Japanese force, representing a total of about 13,000 men across 16 assault battalions, with five in reserve, was focused on assaulting Taylor's Australian 22nd Brigade, which totalled just three battalions.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=291}} The assault would be concentrated on the 2/18th and [[2/20th Battalion (Australia)|2/20th Battalions]]; with each division allocated 150 barges and collapsible boats, the Japanese could move approximately 4,000 men across the strait at any one time. In total, 13,000 Japanese troops landed throughout the first night; they were followed by another 10,000 after first light.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=297}} Against this the defenders numbered just 3,000 men and lacked any significant reserve.{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}}\n\nAs the landing craft closed on the Australian positions, machine gunners from the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion, interspersed amongst the deployed rifle companies, opened fire. Spotlights had been sited by a British unit on the beaches to enable the Australians to clearly see any attacking forces on the water in front of them, but many had been damaged by the earlier bombardment and no order was made to turn the others on.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=292}} The initial wave was concentrated against the positions occupied by the 2/18th and 2/20th Battalions,{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}} around the Buloh River, as well as one company from the 2/19th Battalion. Over the course of an hour, heavy fighting took place on the 2/19th Battalion's right flank, until these positions were overrun and the Japanese were able to push their way inland using cover and concealment provided by the darkness and the surrounding vegetation. The resistance put up by the company from the 2/19th pushed the follow-on waves of Japanese craft to land around the mouth of Murai River, which resulted in them creating a gap between the 2/19th and 2/18th. From there the Japanese launched two concerted attacks against the 2/18th, which were met with heavy fire before they eventually overwhelmed the defending Australians with weight of numbers. Urgent requests for fire support were sent out, and throughout the night the [[2/15th Field Regiment (Australia)|2/15th Field Regiment]] fired over 4,800 rounds.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|pp=293\u2013295}}\n\nFierce fighting raged throughout the evening, but due to the terrain and the darkness, the Japanese were able to disperse into the undergrowth; in many situations, they were able to either surround and destroy pockets of Australian resistance, or bypass them entirely, exploiting gaps in the thinly spread Allied lines due to the many rivers and creeks in the area. By midnight, the two Japanese divisions fired [[star shell|starshells]] to indicate to their commander that they had secured their initial objectives, and by 01:00&nbsp;they were well established. Over the course of two hours, the three Australian battalions that had been engaged sought to regroup, moving back east from the coast towards the centre of the island. Despite being in contact with the enemy, this was completed mainly in good order. The 2/20th managed to concentrate three of its four companies around the Namazie Estate, although one was left behind; the 2/18th was only able to concentrate half its strength at Ama Keng, while the 2/19th also moved back three companies, leaving a fourth to defend Tengah airfield. Further fighting followed throughout the early morning of 9 February, and the Australians were pushed back further, with the 2/18th being pushed out of Ama Keng and the 2/20th being forced to pull back to Bulim, west of Bukit Panjong. Meanwhile, bypassed elements attempted to break out and fall back to the Tengah airfield to rejoin their units and in doing so received heavy casualties. Bennett attempted to reinforce the 22nd Brigade by moving the [[2/29th Battalion (Australia)|2/29th Battalion]] from the 27th Brigade's area to Tengah, but before it could be used to recapture Ama Keng, the Japanese launched another attack around the airfield, and the 2/29th was forced to assume a defensive posture.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|pp=296\u2013300}} The initial fighting cost the Australians heavily, with one battalion alone, the 2/20th, losing 334 men killed and 214 wounded.{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=235}}\n\n===Air war===\n[[File:BrewsterBuffalosMkIRAAFSingaporeOctober1941.jpg|thumb|Brewster Buffalo fighters based at [[Sembawang Air Base|Sembawang Airfield]]]]\n\nThe aerial campaign for Singapore began at the outset of the invasion of Malaya. Early on 8 December 1941, Singapore was bombed for the first time by long-range Japanese aircraft, such as the [[Mitsubishi G3M]]2 \"Nell\" and the [[Mitsubishi G4M]]1 \"Betty\", based in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The bombers struck the city centre as well as the Sembawang Naval Base and the island's northern airfields. After this first raid, throughout the rest of December, there were a number of false alerts and several infrequent and sporadic hit-and-run attacks on outlying military installations such as the Naval Base, but no actual raids on Singapore City. The situation had become so desperate that one British soldier took to the middle of a road to fire his [[Vickers machine gun]] at any aircraft that passed. He could only say: \"The bloody bastards will never think of looking for me in the open, and I want to see a bloody plane brought down.\"{{sfn|Regan|1992|p=189}}\n\nThe next recorded raid on the city occurred on the night of 29 December, and nightly raids ensued for over a week, only to be accompanied by daylight raids from 12 January 1942 onward.{{sfn|Shores et al|1992|pp=276\u2013288}} In the days that followed, as the Japanese army drew ever nearer to Singapore Island, the day and night raids increased in frequency and intensity, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties, up to the time of the British surrender.{{sfn|Perry|2012|p=105}}\n\n[[File:Japanese air raid on singapore - February 8 1942.jpg|left|thumb|Firefighters battle the results of a Japanese air raid on 8 February 1942.]]\n\nDuring the month of December, a total of 51 [[Hawker Hurricane]] Mk II fighters were sent to Singapore, with 24 pilots, the nuclei of five squadrons.

These units reached Bennett around midday, and, shortly afterwards Percival allocated the composite 6th/15th Indian Infantry Brigade to reinforce Bennett's force to move from their position around the Singapore racecourse.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=325}} Throughout the day, the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade, still holding its position on the coast, began to feel pressure on its exposed flank,{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=324}} and after discussions between Percival and Bennett, it was decided that they would have to be pulled back east to maintain the southern part of the Allied line. Bennett decided to form a secondary defensive line, known as the \"Kranji-Jurong Switch Line\", oriented to the west, and positioned between the two rivers, with its centre around Bulim, east of Tengah Airfield\u2014which subsequently came under Japanese control\u2014and just north of [[Jurong]].{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=236}}{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=324}}\n\nTo the north, Maxwell's Australian 27th Brigade had not been engaged during the initial Japanese assaults on the first day. Possessing only two battalions, the [[2/26th Battalion (Australia)|2/26th]] and 2/30th, following the loss of the 2/29th Battalion to the 22nd Brigade, Maxwell sought to reorganise his force to deal with the threat posed to their western flank.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=305}} Late on 9 February, the Imperial Guards began assaulting the positions held by the 27th Brigade,{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=331}} concentrating on those held by the 2/26th Battalion. During the initial assault, the Japanese suffered severe casualties from Australian mortars and machine guns, and from burning oil which had been [[sluice]]d into the water following the demolition of several oil tanks by the defending Australians.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=333}} Some of the Guards reached the shore and maintained a tenuous [[beachhead]]; nevertheless, at the height of the assault, it is reported that the Guards commander, Nishimura, requested permission to cancel the attack due to the heavy casualties his troops had suffered from the fire.

The Jurong Line eventually collapsed, though, after the 12th Indian Brigade was withdrawn by its commander, Brigadier Archie Paris, to the road junction near Bukit Panjang, after he lost contact with the 27th Brigade on his right; the commander of the 44th Indian Brigade, Ballantine, commanding the extreme left of the line, also misinterpreted the orders in the same manner that Taylor had and withdrew.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|pp=310\u2013311}}\n\nOn the evening of 10 February, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], cabled Wavell, saying:\n\n{{quote|text=I think you ought to realise the way we view the situation in Singapore.

Singapore was the major British military base in [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]] and was [[Singapore strategy|the key]] to British imperial interwar defence planning for South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific. The fighting in Singapore lasted from 8 to 15 February 1942, after the two months during which Japanese forces [[Malayan Campaign|had advanced down the Malayan Peninsula]].\n\nThe campaign, including the final battle, was a decisive Japanese victory, resulting in the Japanese capture of Singapore and the largest British surrender in history.{{sfn|Corrigan|2010|p=280}} About 80,000 British, [[British Raj|Indian]] and Australian troops in Singapore became [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the earlier [[Malayan Campaign]]. The British prime minister, [[Winston Churchill]], called it the \"worst [[Military disaster|disaster]]\" in [[Military history of the United Kingdom|British military history]].{{sfn|Churchill|2002|p=518}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Singapore strategy}}\n\n===Outbreak of war===\n{{See also|Second Sino-Japanese War}}\nDuring 1940 and 1941, the Allies had imposed a trade [[embargo]] on Japan in response to its continued campaigns in [[China]] and its occupation of [[French Indochina]].{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=68}}{{sfn|Costello|2009|p=71}} The basic plan for taking Singapore was worked out in July 1940. Intelligence gained in late 1940 \u2013 early 1941 did not alter the basic plan, but confirmed it in the minds of Japanese decision makers.{{sfn|Drea|1991|p=204}} On 11 November 1940, the German raider ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' captured the British steamer [[SS Automedon|''Automedon'']] in the [[Indian Ocean]], which was carrying papers meant for Air Marshal Sir [[Robert Brooke-Popham]], the British commander in the Far East, which included much information about the weakness of the Singapore base.{{sfn|Drea|1991|p=203}} In December 1940, the Germans handed over copies of the papers to the Japanese.{{sfn|Drea|1991|p=203}} The Japanese had broken the British Army's codes and in January 1941, the Second Department (the intelligence-gathering arm) of the Imperial Army had interpreted and read a message from Singapore to London complaining in much detail about the weak state of \"Fortress Singapore\", a message that was so frank in its admission of weakness that the Japanese at first suspected it was a British plant, believing that no officer would be so open in admitting weaknesses to his superiors, and only believed it was genuine after cross-checking the message with the ''Automedon'' papers.{{sfn|Drea|1991|p=202}}\n\nAs Japan's oil reserves were rapidly depleted by the ongoing military operations in China as well as industrial consumption, in the latter half of 1941, the Japanese began preparing a military response to secure vital resources if diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation failed. As a part of this process, the Japanese planners determined a broad scheme of manoeuvre that incorporated simultaneous attacks on the territories of Britain, The Netherlands and the United States. This would see landings in Malaya and Hong Kong as part of a general move south to secure Singapore, which was connected to Malaya by the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway]], and then an invasion of the oil-rich area of Borneo and Java in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. In addition, strikes would be made against the United States naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, as well as landings in the Philippines, and attacks on Guam, Wake Island and the Gilbert Islands.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=72\u201373}}{{sfn|Costello|2009|p=98}} Following these attacks, a period of consolidation was planned, after which the Japanese planners intended to build up the defences of the territory that had been captured by establishing a strong perimeter around it stretching from the India\u2013Burma frontier through to Wake Island, and traversing Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea and New Britain, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. This perimeter would be used to block Allied attempts to regain the lost territory and defeat their will to fight.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=72\u201373}}\n\n===Invasion of Malaya===\n{{Main|Malayan Campaign}}\n{{History of Singapore}}\nThe [[Twenty-Fifth Army (Japan)|Japanese 25th Army]] invaded from Indochina, moving into northern Malaya and [[Thailand]] by [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] on 8 December 1941.{{sfn|Brayley|2002|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Farrell|Pratten|2011|pp=91\u201392}} This was virtually simultaneous with the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] which precipitated the United States entry into the war. Thailand initially resisted, but soon had to yield. The Japanese then proceeded overland across the Thai\u2013Malayan border to attack Malaya. At this time, the Japanese began [[Bombing of Singapore (8 December 1941)|bombing strategic sites in Singapore]].{{sfn|Keogh|1962|pp=62\u201365}}\n\nThe Japanese 25th Army was resisted in northern Malaya by [[III Corps (India)|III Corps]] of the [[British Indian Army]]. Although the 25th Army was outnumbered by Allied forces in Malaya and Singapore, the Allies did not take the initiative with their forces, while Japanese commanders concentrated their forces. The Japanese were superior in [[close air support]], armour, co-ordination, tactics and experience. While conventional British military thinking was that the Japanese forces were inferior, and characterised the Malayan jungles as \"impassable\",{{sfn|Moreman|2005|p=13}} the Japanese were repeatedly able to use it to their advantage to outflank hastily established defensive lines.{{sfn|Brayley|2002|p=15}} Prior to the Battle of Singapore the most resistance was met at the [[Battle of Muar]],{{sfn|Mant|1995|p=23}} which involved the [[8th Division (Australia)|Australian 8th Division]] and the Indian 45th Brigade, as the British troops left in the city of Singapore were basically garrison troops.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=198}}\n\nAt the start of the campaign, the Allied forces had only 164 first-line aircraft on hand in Malaya and Singapore, and the only fighter type was the obsolete [[Brewster F2A Buffalo|Brewster 339E Buffalo]]. These aircraft were operated by two [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), two [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), and one [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) squadron.{{sfn|Gillison|1962|pp=204\u2013205}} Major shortcomings included a slow rate of climb and the aircraft's fuel system which required the pilot to hand pump fuel if flying above {{convert|6000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=115}} In contrast, the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] was more numerous and better trained than the second-hand assortment of untrained pilots and inferior allied equipment remaining in Malaya, Borneo and Singapore. Their fighter aircraft<!--', particularly the Zero,'- This part of the article is about the Japanese Army Air Force, so talk about the Zero is irrelevant as it was only used by the Naval Air Service.--> were superior to the Allied fighters, which helped the Japanese to gain [[air supremacy]].{{sfn|Farrell|Pratten|2011|pp=30, 98 & 101}} Although outnumbered and outclassed, the Buffalos were able to provide some resistance, with RAAF pilots alone managing to shoot down at least 20 Japanese aircraft before the few that survived were withdrawn.{{sfn|Dennis et al|2008|p=115}}\n\n[[File:Singapore causeway blown up.jpg|left|thumb|View of the blown up causeway, with the gap visible in the middle, which delayed the Japanese conquest for over a week to 8 February]]\n\n[[Force Z]], consisting of the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} and four [[destroyer]]s, sailed north out of Singapore on 8 December to oppose expected Japanese landings along the coast of Malaya.

Japanese forces quickly isolated, surrounded, and forced the surrender of Indian units defending the coast. Despite their numerical inferiority, they advanced down the Malayan Peninsula, overwhelming the defences. The Japanese forces also used [[bicycle infantry]] and [[light tank]]s, allowing swift movement through the jungle. The Allies, however, having thought the terrain made them impractical, had no tanks and only a few armoured vehicles, which put them at a severe disadvantage.{{sfn|Hall|1983|p=67}}\n\nAlthough more Allied units\u2014including some from the Australian 8th Division{{refn|Two brigades from the Australian 8th Division had been dispatched to Singapore and then Malaya in February 1941, while its third brigade had been dispersed to garrison [[Rabaul]], [[Timor]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]].{{sfn|Powell|2003|p=7}}|group=Note}}\u2014joined the campaign, the Japanese prevented the Allied forces from regrouping. They also overran cities and advanced toward Singapore. The city was an anchor for the operations of the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command]] (ABDACOM), the first Allied joint command of the Second World War. Singapore controlled the main shipping channel between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. An effective ambush was carried out by the [[2/30th Battalion (Australia)|Australian 2/30th Battalion]] on the main road at the Gemenceh River near Gemas on 14 January, causing heavy Japanese casualties.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=197}}{{refn|The number of Japanese killed and wounded is disputed.{{sfn|Murdoch|2012|}}|group=Note}}\n\nAt Bakri, from 18 to 22 January, Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Groves Wright Anderson|Charles Anderson]]'s [[2/19th Battalion (Australia)|Australian 2/19th Battalion]] and the [[2/29th Battalion (Australia)|Australian 2/29th Battalion]] repeatedly fought through Japanese positions before running out of ammunition near Parit Sulong.

Lionel Wigmore, the [[Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945|Australian official historian]] of the Malayan Campaign, wrote<blockquote>Only one of the Indian battalions was up to numerical strength, three (in the 44th Brigade) had recently arrived in a semi-trained condition, nine had been hastily reorganised with a large intake of raw recruits, and four were being re-formed but were far from being fit for action. Six of the United Kingdom battalions (in the 54th and 55th Brigades of the 18th Division) had only just landed in Malaya, and the other seven battalions were under-manned. Of the Australian battalions, three had drawn heavily upon recently-arrived, practically-untrained recruits. The Malay battalions had not been in action, and the Straits Settlements Volunteers were only sketchily trained. Further, losses on the mainland had resulted in a general shortage of equipment.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=290}}</blockquote>Percival gave Major-General [[Gordon Bennett (general)|Gordon Bennett]]'s two brigades from the Australian 8th Division responsibility for the western side of Singapore, including the prime invasion points in the northwest of the island. This was mostly mangrove swamp and jungle, broken by rivers and creeks.{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=230}} In the heart of the \"Western Area\" was [[Tengah Air Base#RAF Tengah|RAF Tengah]], Singapore's largest airfield at the time.

To compound matters, Percival had ordered the Australians to defend forward so as to cover the waterway, yet this meant they were immediately fully committed to any fighting, limiting their flexibility, whilst also reducing their defensive depth.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=202}} The two Australian brigades were subsequently allocated a very wide frontage of over {{convert|18|km|mi}} and were separated by the Kranji River.{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}}\n\nYamashita had just over 30,000 men from three divisions: the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Imperial Guards]] Division under Lieutenant-General [[Takuma Nishimura]], the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|5th Division]] under Lieutenant-General [[Takuro Matsui]] and the [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th Division]] under Lieutenant-General [[Renya Mutaguchi]].{{sfn|Felton|2008|p=33}} Also in support was a light tank brigade.{{sfn|Murfett et al|2011|p=177}} In comparison, following the withdrawal, Percival had about 85,000 men at his disposal, although 15,000 were administrative personnel, while large numbers were semi-trained British, Indian and Australian reinforcements that had only recently arrived. Meanwhile, of those forces that had seen action during the previous fighting, the majority were under-strength and under-equipped.{{sfn|Keogh|1962|p=157}}\n\nIn the days leading up to the Japanese attack, patrols from the Australian 22nd Brigade were sent across the strait to Johor at night to gather intelligence. Three small patrols were sent on the evening of 6 February; one was spotted and withdrew after its leader was killed and their boat sunk, while two others managed to get ashore. Over the course of a day, they found large concentrations of troops, although they were unable to locate any landing craft.{{sfn|Hall|1983|p=163}} The Australians requested the shelling of these positions to disrupt the Japanese preparations,{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=286}} but the patrol reports were later ignored by Malaya Command as being insignificant,{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=287}} based upon the belief that the real assault would come in the north-eastern sector, not the north-west.{{sfn|Hall|1983|pp=162\u2013163}}{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===Initial Japanese landings===\n{{Main|Battle of Sarimbun Beach}}\n\n[[File:Sarimbun battle.jpg|thumb|The Japanese landings on Singapore Island]]\nBlowing up the causeway had delayed the Japanese attack for over a week. Prior to the main assault, the Australians were subjected to an intense artillery bombardment. Over a period of 15 hours,{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}} starting at 23:00 on 8 February 1942, Yamashita's heavy guns laid down a barrage of 88,000 shells (200 rounds per tube){{sfn|Allen| 2013|p=169}} along the entire length of the straits, cutting telephone lines and effectively isolating forward units from rear areas.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|pp=308\u2013310}} Even at this stage, a counter artillery barrage as a response could have been mounted by the British on the coastline opposite the Australians that would have caused casualties and disruption among the Japanese assault troops.{{sfn|Costello|2009|p=199}} But the bombardment of the Australians was not seen as a prelude to imminent attack\u2014Malaya Command believed that it would last several days and would later switch its focus to the north-east, despite its ferocity exceeding anything the Allies had experienced thus far in the campaign; consequently, no order was passed to the Allied artillery units to begin targeting possible Japanese assembly areas.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=288}}\n\nShortly before 20:30 on 8 February, the first wave of Japanese troops from the 5th and 18th Divisions began crossing the Johor Strait. The main weight of the Japanese force, representing a total of about 13,000 men across 16 assault battalions, with five in reserve, was focused on assaulting Taylor's Australian 22nd Brigade, which totalled just three battalions.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=291}} The assault would be concentrated on the 2/18th and [[2/20th Battalion (Australia)|2/20th Battalions]]; with each division allocated 150 barges and collapsible boats, the Japanese could move approximately 4,000 men across the strait at any one time. In total, 13,000 Japanese troops landed throughout the first night; they were followed by another 10,000 after first light.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=297}} Against this the defenders numbered just 3,000 men and lacked any significant reserve.{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}}\n\nAs the landing craft closed on the Australian positions, machine gunners from the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion, interspersed amongst the deployed rifle companies, opened fire. Spotlights had been sited by a British unit on the beaches to enable the Australians to clearly see any attacking forces on the water in front of them, but many had been damaged by the earlier bombardment and no order was made to turn the others on.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=292}} The initial wave was concentrated against the positions occupied by the 2/18th and 2/20th Battalions,{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=240}} around the Buloh River, as well as one company from the 2/19th Battalion. Over the course of an hour, heavy fighting took place on the 2/19th Battalion's right flank, until these positions were overrun and the Japanese were able to push their way inland using cover and concealment provided by the darkness and the surrounding vegetation. The resistance put up by the company from the 2/19th pushed the follow-on waves of Japanese craft to land around the mouth of Murai River, which resulted in them creating a gap between the 2/19th and 2/18th. From there the Japanese launched two concerted attacks against the 2/18th, which were met with heavy fire before they eventually overwhelmed the defending Australians with weight of numbers. Urgent requests for fire support were sent out, and throughout the night the [[2/15th Field Regiment (Australia)|2/15th Field Regiment]] fired over 4,800 rounds.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|pp=293\u2013295}}\n\nFierce fighting raged throughout the evening, but due to the terrain and the darkness, the Japanese were able to disperse into the undergrowth; in many situations, they were able to either surround and destroy pockets of Australian resistance, or bypass them entirely, exploiting gaps in the thinly spread Allied lines due to the many rivers and creeks in the area. By midnight, the two Japanese divisions fired [[star shell|starshells]] to indicate to their commander that they had secured their initial objectives, and by 01:00&nbsp;they were well established. Over the course of two hours, the three Australian battalions that had been engaged sought to regroup, moving back east from the coast towards the centre of the island. Despite being in contact with the enemy, this was completed mainly in good order. The 2/20th managed to concentrate three of its four companies around the Namazie Estate, although one was left behind; the 2/18th was only able to concentrate half its strength at Ama Keng, while the 2/19th also moved back three companies, leaving a fourth to defend Tengah airfield. Further fighting followed throughout the early morning of 9 February, and the Australians were pushed back further, with the 2/18th being pushed out of Ama Keng and the 2/20th being forced to pull back to Bulim, west of Bukit Panjong. Meanwhile, bypassed elements attempted to break out and fall back to the Tengah airfield to rejoin their units and in doing so received heavy casualties. Bennett attempted to reinforce the 22nd Brigade by moving the [[2/29th Battalion (Australia)|2/29th Battalion]] from the 27th Brigade's area to Tengah, but before it could be used to recapture Ama Keng, the Japanese launched another attack around the airfield, and the 2/29th was forced to assume a defensive posture.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|pp=296\u2013300}} The initial fighting cost the Australians heavily, with one battalion alone, the 2/20th, losing 334 men killed and 214 wounded.{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=235}}\n\n===Air war===\n[[File:BrewsterBuffalosMkIRAAFSingaporeOctober1941.jpg|thumb|Brewster Buffalo fighters based at [[Sembawang Air Base|Sembawang Airfield]]]]\n\nThe aerial campaign for Singapore began at the outset of the invasion of Malaya. Early on 8 December 1941, Singapore was bombed for the first time by long-range Japanese aircraft, such as the [[Mitsubishi G3M]]2 \"Nell\" and the [[Mitsubishi G4M]]1 \"Betty\", based in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The bombers struck the city centre as well as the Sembawang Naval Base and the island's northern airfields. After this first raid, throughout the rest of December, there were a number of false alerts and several infrequent and sporadic hit-and-run attacks on outlying military installations such as the Naval Base, but no actual raids on Singapore City. The situation had become so desperate that one British soldier took to the middle of a road to fire his [[Vickers machine gun]] at any aircraft that passed. He could only say: \"The bloody bastards will never think of looking for me in the open, and I want to see a bloody plane brought down.\"{{sfn|Regan|1992|p=189}}\n\nThe next recorded raid on the city occurred on the night of 29 December, and nightly raids ensued for over a week, only to be accompanied by daylight raids from 12 January 1942 onward.{{sfn|Shores et al|1992|pp=276\u2013288}} In the days that followed, as the Japanese army drew ever nearer to Singapore Island, the day and night raids increased in frequency and intensity, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties, up to the time of the British surrender.{{sfn|Perry|2012|p=105}}\n\n[[File:Japanese air raid on singapore - February 8 1942.jpg|left|thumb|Firefighters battle the results of a Japanese air raid on 8 February 1942.]]\n\nDuring the month of December, a total of 51 [[Hawker Hurricane]] Mk II fighters were sent to Singapore, with 24 pilots, the nuclei of five squadrons. They arrived on 3 January 1942, by which stage the [[Brewster F2A Buffalo|Brewster Buffalo]] squadrons had been overwhelmed. [[No. 232 Squadron RAF]] was formed and [[No. 488 Squadron RNZAF]], a Buffalo squadron, had converted to Hurricanes. 232 Squadron became operational on 20 January and destroyed three [[Nakajima Ki-43]] \"Oscars\" that day, for the loss of three Hurricanes.

However, many of the Hurricanes were subsequently destroyed on the ground by air raids.{{sfn|Gillison|1962|pp=387\u2013388}} Indeed, the lack of an effective air early warning system throughout the campaign meant that many Allied aircraft were lost in this manner during a series of Japanese attacks against airfields.{{sfn|Boyne|2002|p=391}}\n\n[[File:Hurricane singapore.jpg|thumb|[[Hawker Hurricane]] of No. 232 Squadron RAF shot down on 8 February, along the [[East Coast Park Service Road|East Coast Road]]]]\n\nBy the time of the invasion, only ten Hawker Hurricane fighters of No. 232 Squadron RAF, based at [[Kallang Airport#World War II|RAF Kallang]], remained to provide air cover to the Allied forces on Singapore.

By this time, Kallang Airfield was so pitted with bomb craters that it was no longer usable.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=}}\n\n===Second day===\n{{Main|Battle of Kranji}}\n[[File:Kranji War Memorial Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Inscription at Kranji War Memorial]]\nBelieving that further landings would occur in the northeast, Percival did not reinforce the 22nd Brigade until the morning of 9 February; when he did, the forces dispatched consisted of two half-strength battalions from the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade. These units reached Bennett around midday, and, shortly afterwards Percival allocated the composite 6th/15th Indian Infantry Brigade to reinforce Bennett's force to move from their position around the Singapore racecourse.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=325}} Throughout the day, the 44th Indian Infantry Brigade, still holding its position on the coast, began to feel pressure on its exposed flank,{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=324}} and after discussions between Percival and Bennett, it was decided that they would have to be pulled back east to maintain the southern part of the Allied line. Bennett decided to form a secondary defensive line, known as the \"Kranji-Jurong Switch Line\", oriented to the west, and positioned between the two rivers, with its centre around Bulim, east of Tengah Airfield\u2014which subsequently came under Japanese control\u2014and just north of [[Jurong]].{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=236}}{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=324}}\n\nTo the north, Maxwell's Australian 27th Brigade had not been engaged during the initial Japanese assaults on the first day. Possessing only two battalions, the [[2/26th Battalion (Australia)|2/26th]] and 2/30th, following the loss of the 2/29th Battalion to the 22nd Brigade, Maxwell sought to reorganise his force to deal with the threat posed to their western flank.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=305}} Late on 9 February, the Imperial Guards began assaulting the positions held by the 27th Brigade,{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=331}} concentrating on those held by the 2/26th Battalion. During the initial assault, the Japanese suffered severe casualties from Australian mortars and machine guns, and from burning oil which had been [[sluice]]d into the water following the demolition of several oil tanks by the defending Australians.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=333}} Some of the Guards reached the shore and maintained a tenuous [[beachhead]]; nevertheless, at the height of the assault, it is reported that the Guards commander, Nishimura, requested permission to cancel the attack due to the heavy casualties his troops had suffered from the fire. This request was denied by the Japanese commander, Yamashita, who ordered them to press on.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|pp=307\u2013309}}\n\n[[File:Burning oil fields.jpg|thumb|A column of smoke from burning oil tanks of [[Singapore Naval Base]]]]\nCommand and control problems caused further cracks in the Allied defence. Maxwell was aware that the 22nd Brigade was under increasing pressure, but was unable to contact Taylor and was wary of encirclement.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=329}} As parties of Japanese troops began to infiltrate the brigade's position from the west, exploiting the gap formed by the Kranji River, the 2/26th Battalion was forced to withdraw to a position east of the Bukit Timah Road; this move subsequently precipitated a sympathetic move by the 2/30th away from the causeway.{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=236}} The authority for this withdrawal would later be the subject of debate, with Bennett later stating that he had not given Maxwell authorisation to do so.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=329}} Regardless, the end result was that the Allies lost control of the beaches adjoining the west side of the causeway. In doing so, the high ground overlooking the causeway was given up, and the left flank of the 11th Indian Division exposed.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|pp=308\u2013309}} In addition, it provided the Japanese with a firm foothold, giving them the opportunity to \"build up their force unopposed\".{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=237}}\n\n===Japanese breakthrough===\n{{Main|Battle of Bukit Timah|Battle of Pasir Panjang}}\n\nThe opening at Kranji made it possible for Imperial Guards armoured units to land there unopposed,{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=309}} after which they were able to begin ferrying across their artillery and armour.{{sfn|Costello|2009|p=199}} After finding his left flank exposed by the 27th Brigade's withdrawal, the commander of the 11th Indian Infantry Division, Key, dispatched his reserve brigade, the 8th, to retake the high ground to the south of the Causeway.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=310}} Throughout the 10th, further fighting took place around along the Jurong Line, as orders were formulated to establish a secondary defensive line to the west of the Reformatory Road with troops not then employed in the Jurong Line; misinterpretation of these orders resulted in Taylor, the commander of the 22nd Brigade, prematurely withdrawing his troops to the east, where they were joined by a 200-strong ad hoc battalion of Australian reinforcements, known as 'X' Battalion. The Jurong Line eventually collapsed, though, after the 12th Indian Brigade was withdrawn by its commander, Brigadier Archie Paris, to the road junction near Bukit Panjang, after he lost contact with the 27th Brigade on his right; the commander of the 44th Indian Brigade, Ballantine, commanding the extreme left of the line, also misinterpreted the orders in the same manner that Taylor had and withdrew.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|pp=310\u2013311}}\n\nOn the evening of 10 February, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], cabled Wavell, saying:\n\n{{quote|text=I think you ought to realise the way we view the situation in Singapore.

It is doubtful whether the Japanese have as many in the whole [[Malay Peninsula]]&nbsp;... In these circumstances the defenders must greatly outnumber Japanese forces who have crossed the straits, and in a well-contested battle they should destroy them. There must at this stage be no thought of saving the troops or sparing the population. The battle must be fought to the bitter end at all costs. The 18th Division has a chance to make its name in history. Commanders and senior officers should die with their troops. The honour of the British Empire and of the British Army is at stake.

Percival made plans of his own for the counterattack, detailing a three-phased operation that involved the majority of the 22nd Brigade, and he subsequently passed this on to Bennett, who began implementing the plan, but forgot to call 'X' Battalion back. 'X' Battalion, consisting of poorly trained and equipped replacements, subsequently advanced to an assembly area near Bukit Timah.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|pp=312\u2013313}} In the early hours of 11 February, the Japanese, who had concentrated significant forces around the Tengah airfield and on the Jurong Road, began further offensive operations: the 5th Division aimed its advance towards Bukit Panjang, while the 18th struck out towards Bukit Timah. There, they fell upon 'X' Battalion, which had camped in its assembly area while waiting to launch its own attack, and in the ensuing fight two thirds of the battalion was killed or wounded.{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=314}} After brushing aside elements of the 6th/15th Indian Brigade, the Japanese again began attacking the Australian 22nd Brigade around the Reformatory Road.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|pp=348\u2013350}}\n\nLater on 11 February, with Japanese supplies running low, Yamashita attempted to bluff Percival, calling on him to \"give up this meaningless and desperate resistance\".{{sfn|Hall|1983|p=179}}{{sfn|Lloyd|2012|p=66}} By this stage, the fighting strength of the 22nd Brigade\u2014which had borne the brunt of the Japanese attacks\u2014had been reduced to a few hundred men, and the Japanese had captured the Bukit Timah area, including the Allies' main food and fuel supply depots.{{sfn|Perry|2012|p=104}} Nevertheless, Wavell subsequently told Percival that the ground forces were to fight on to the end, and that there should not be a general surrender in Singapore.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=509}}{{sfn|Thompson|2005|p=316}}{{sfn|Kirby|1954|p=410}} With the vital water supply of the reservoirs in the centre of the island threatened, the Australian 27th Brigade was later ordered to recapture Bukit Panjang as a preliminary move in retaking Bukit Timah.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=354}} The effort was beaten back by fierce resistance from Imperial Guards troops and the 27th was subsequently split in half either side of the Bukit Timah Road with elements spread as far as the Pierce Reservoir.{{sfn|Hall|1983|p=180}}\n\n{{Quote box|My attack on Singapore was a bluff&nbsp;\u2013 a bluff that worked.

The anti-aircraft guns were almost out of ammunition,{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=377}} and were unable to disrupt Japanese air attacks, which were causing heavy casualties in the city centre.

They are signed to [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall Records]] in Europe, and [[Eleven Seven Label Group|Eleven Seven Records]] in America and are widely known for their rise from the [[Street performance|street busking]] scene to the mainstream music industry.\n\n==History==\nAndrew Kavanagh (aka Kav) and Andrew Glover (aka Glover) are childhood friends who grew up in Artane, Dublin. Harry bellend Sullivan and James Lock were also friends who grew up in London, England and moved to Ireland in 2011 as full time members of the band. \n\nAfter the English members had joined the Irish, the band began their journey. Starting off by busking on the streets of Galway, Ireland, they cut their teeth singing cover songs in their own style while working hard writing their own material. \n\nThey soon had amassed enough original songs and enough street experience to start busking in Grafton Street, Dublin. This was where they forged their reputation in Ireland, gaining notable radio play and selling out theatre shows all while still performing on the street.\n\nAfter breaking through the Irish mainstream media Keywest began taking their show on the road, performing on streets around the UK, Europe and America, quickly building a modest but enthusiastic fanbase everywhere they went.\n\nHaving achieved over 20 million streams online, the band caught the attention of numerous record labels in 2018. They signed with Marshall Records in late 2018, subsequently linking with Eleven Seven Records for all things US.\n\n===2012: ''The Message''===\nThe band released their debut album ''The Message'' through Irish indie label Alphastar Records. The album peaked at No.15 in the Irish charts and No.2 on the iTunes chart. It was self produced and engineered by Mark Needham, whose credits include [[The Killers]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Neon Trees]] and Dan Frampton ([[The Script]]).\n\nThe album was a double CD debut release for the band with CD1 being the main album and CD2 being the ''Undelivered'' EP, which showcases the band's acoustic side.\n\n''The Message'' featured the singles \"Back Into Your Arms\", \"Feels So Cruel\", \"In the Fight for Love\" and \"Straight Through My Heart\". The singles did very well on Irish radio and soon earned Keywest the title of Ireland's most played Irish independent artist of 2012.\n\nThe Message is now a triple-platinum selling album in Ireland.\n\nIn 2012 Keywest were Nominated for Best New Act at the Meteor Awards and ''The Message'' (Keywest's debut album) was nominated for Best Debut Album in the Hotpress Hotties awards.\n\n2012 also saw the band sign a worldwide publishing deal in Los Angeles with publishing giants [[Peermusic]].\n\n===2013: ''Electric Love'' EP===\nThe band followed up their debut album with the ''Electric Love'' EP, which featured the title track and single \"Electric Love\".\n\n''Electric Love'' went straight to number one in the Irish charts and was released independently through the band's own label \"Sonic Realm\" records.\n\n===2015: ''Joyland''===\nKeywest released their second album '''Joyland'' on 25 September 2015 which went straight in at number 2 in the Official Irish Chart. It climbed to the top spot the following week going to Number 1.

They are signed to [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall Records]] in Europe, and [[Eleven Seven Label Group|Eleven Seven Records]] in America and are widely known for their rise from the [[Street performance|street busking]] scene to the mainstream music industry.\n\n==History==\nAndrew Kavanagh (aka Kav) and Andrew Glover (aka Glover) are childhood friends who grew up in Artane, Dublin. Harry Sullivan and James Lock were also friends who grew up in London, England and moved to Ireland in 2011 as full time members of the band. \n\nAfter the English members had joined the Irish, the band began their journey. Starting off by busking on the streets of Galway, Ireland, they cut their teeth singing cover songs in their own style while working hard writing their own material. \n\nThey soon had amassed enough original songs and enough street experience to start busking in Grafton Street, Dublin. This was where they forged their reputation in Ireland, gaining notable radio play and selling out theatre shows all while still performing on the street.\n\nAfter breaking through the Irish mainstream media Keywest began taking their show on the road, performing on streets around the UK, Europe and America, quickly building a modest but enthusiastic fanbase everywhere they went.\n\nHaving achieved over 20 million streams online, the band caught the attention of numerous record labels in 2018. They signed with Marshall Records in late 2018, subsequently linking with Eleven Seven Records for all things US.\n\n===2012: ''The Message''===\nThe band released their debut album ''The Message'' through Irish indie label Alphastar Records. The album peaked at No.15 in the Irish charts and No.2 on the iTunes chart. It was self produced and engineered by Mark Needham, whose credits include [[The Killers]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Neon Trees]] and Dan Frampton ([[The Script]]).\n\nThe album was a double CD debut release for the band with CD1 being the main album and CD2 being the ''Undelivered'' EP, which showcases the band's acoustic side.\n\n''The Message'' featured the singles \"Back Into Your Arms\", \"Feels So Cruel\", \"In the Fight for Love\" and \"Straight Through My Heart\". The singles did very well on Irish radio and soon earned Keywest the title of Ireland's most played Irish independent artist of 2012.\n\nThe Message is now a triple-platinum selling album in Ireland.\n\nIn 2012 Keywest were Nominated for Best New Act at the Meteor Awards and ''The Message'' (Keywest's debut album) was nominated for Best Debut Album in the Hotpress Hotties awards.\n\n2012 also saw the band sign a worldwide publishing deal in Los Angeles with publishing giants [[Peermusic]].\n\n===2013: ''Electric Love'' EP===\nThe band followed up their debut album with the ''Electric Love'' EP, which featured the title track and single \"Electric Love\".\n\n''Electric Love'' went straight to number one in the Irish charts and was released independently through the band's own label \"Sonic Realm\" records.\n\n===2015: ''Joyland''===\nKeywest released their second album '''Joyland'' on 25 September 2015 which went straight in at number 2 in the Official Irish Chart. It climbed to the top spot the following week going to Number 1. This was the same week that they appeared on the front cover of Irelands biggest music magazine ''Hot Press''.\n\nJoyland was very popular in Ireland, containing the singles \"All My Mistakes\", \"Carousel\", \"This Is Heartbreak\" and \"Apple Tree Hill\".\n\n2014 and 2015 saw the band win the 98fm award for Dublin's best street artist and in 2015 the band won the Hot Press Hotties award for Ireland's most promising artist.\n\n===2018: ''True North''===\nThe bands third album, titled ''True North'' was released on 30 March 2018.
