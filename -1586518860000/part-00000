Located at the confluence of the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and [[Wenatchee River|Wenatchee]] rivers near the eastern foothills of the [[Cascade Range]], Wenatchee lies on the western side of the Columbia River, across from the city of [[East Wenatchee, Washington|East Wenatchee]]. The [[Columbia River]] forms the boundary between Chelan and [[Douglas County, Washington|Douglas County]].  Wenatchee is the  principal city of the [[Wenatchee metropolitan area|Wenatchee\u2013East Wenatchee, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which encompasses all of Chelan and [[Douglas County, Washington|Douglas]] counties (total population around 110,884).  However, the \"Wenatchee Valley Area\" generally refers to the land between [[Rocky Reach Dam|Rocky Reach]] and [[Rock Island Dam]] on both banks of the Columbia, which includes [[East Wenatchee, Washington|East Wenatchee]], [[Rock Island, Washington|Rock Island]], and [[South Wenatchee, Washington|Malaga]].\n\nThe city was named for the nearby [[Wenatchi]] Indian tribe. The name is a [[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]] word that means \"river which comes [or whose source is] from canyons\" or \"robe of the rainbow\". ''Awenatchela'' means \"people at the source [of a river]\". The city of Wenatchee shares its name with the [[Wenatchee River]], [[Lake Wenatchee]] and the [[Wenatchee National Forest]].\n\nWenatchee is referred to as the \"Apple Capital of the World\" due to the valley's many orchards. The city is also sometimes referred to as the \"Buckle of the Power Belt of the Great Northwest\".  The \"Power Belt of the Great Northwest\" is a metaphor for the series of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River.  [[Rock Island Dam]] is located nearest to the middle of this \"belt\", and so was labeled the \"Buckle\". This saying is printed at the top of every issue of Wenatchee's newspaper, the ''Wenatchee World'', but is no longer in common use elsewhere.<ref>http://ret.wenworld.com/book/index.php</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistoric era===\n[[East Wenatchee Clovis Site|Archeological digs]] in nearby East Wenatchee have uncovered [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] stone and bone tools dating back more than 11,000 years, indicating that people migrating during the last Ice Age spent time in the Wenatchee area. The Columbia River and nearby mountains and sagebrush steppes provided an ample supply of food. Clovis points are on display at the [[Wenatchee Valley Museum & Cultural Center]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wvmcc.org|title=Home - Wenatchee Valley Museum & Cultural Center|publisher=}}</ref> and research findings are available through the ''Wenatchee World''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wenatcheeworld.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=CLOVIS|title=Wenatchee World}}</ref>\n\n===Indigenous villages and early settlers===\nSeveral indigenous villages existed in the area prior to and during Anglo American exploration. The village Nikwikwi'estku was a fishing and gathering camp located in present-day downtown Wenatchee. In 1811, [[North West Company]] surveyor David Thompson encountered a group of Native American horsemen at Wenatchee and was invited into a village with huts, the largest measuring 209 feet long. Fur traders document friendly relations through the mid 19th century, even during the smallpox epidemic of 1817 and food shortages in 1841.<ref name=\"Brown2007\">{{Cite book|title=Wenatchee's dark past: a history of race and race relations|last=Brown|first=Maureen E|publisher=Wenatchee World|year=2007|isbn=|location=Wenatchee, WA|pages=6\u20139|language=English|oclc=191853776}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Yakima War]] in 1856, US Army Colonel Wright intervened on a possible alliance between Yakama and Wenatchi tribes by removing the Wenatchi to Kittitas. The resulting march was estimated to include 1,000 horses and extend five miles long. A contigent stayed behind to fish at [[Wenatchapam Fishery]] in preparation for winter.<ref name=\"Brown2007\"/>\n\nIn 1863, Father Respari, a Catholic priest, began his missionary work with the Indians. He was followed some 20 years later by Father De Grassi, who built a log cabin on the Wenatchee River near the present town of [[Cashmere, Washington|Cashmere]]. Throughout the 19th century, other white settlers came to homestead the land. Wenatchee was platted in September 1888 and officially incorporated as a city on January 7, 1893. The 1900 U.S. Census counted 451 residents.\n\n[[File:Fruit field bin 5180.JPG|left|thumb|Apple field bins are stacked high at a [[Packing house|processing facility]] in Wenatchee.]]\n\n===Continued growth===\nThe Great Northern Railway completed its railroad line between [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], and [[Seattle]] in 1893. Its route through the Wenatchee Valley was significant to the development of this region. The railroad not only provided passenger travel to and from Wenatchee, but it provided for freight service for shipments of wheat, apples, and other products to out-of-state markets.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the Wenatchee Commercial Club, now the [[Wenatchee Valley Chamber of Commerce]], was advertising the region as the \"Home of the World's Best Apples.\" The tree fruit industry provided the economic backbone for the region for a century and still is an important source of revenue.\n\nOn May 22, 1910, the Wenatchee [[free speech fight]] occurred when members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) were arrested for [[soapboxing|speaking in the street]] in front of the local hall of the [[Socialist Party of America]].<ref name=\"IWWYearbook1910\">{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/iww/iwwyearbook1910.shtml |title=IWW Yearbook 1910 |last=Upton |first=Austin |website=IWW History Project |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |access-date=21 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"IW_1910_05_28\">{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=James P. |date=28 May 1910 |title=Wenatchee Denied Free Speech: Fight On |volume=2 |issue=10 |page=1 |newspaper=[[Industrial Worker]] |url=https://archive.org/details/v2n10-w62-may-28-1910-IW }}</ref> The town had freed imprisoned IWW members by June;<ref name=\"IW_1910_06_04\">{{cite news |author=<!-- No author listed. --> |date=4 June 1910 |title=Struggle for Free Speech in North and West |volume=2 |issue=11 |page=1 |newspaper=[[Industrial Worker]] |url=https://archive.org/details/v2n11-w63-jun-04-1910-IW }}</ref> however, tensions resumed in September 1911 when police raided a house rented by six IWW men and arrested twenty-five migrant workers found carrying IWW literature.

The reservoirs thus generated also made it possible to irrigate hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin.\n\n===Modern era===\nIn 1975, [[Stemilt Growers]] moved its headquarters from nearby Stemilt Hill to Olds Station, Wenatchee.

Nordic skiing is available at the Stevens Pass Nordic Center, Leavenworth (25 minute drive), and the Methow Valley (1 hour and 45 minute drive).\n\nThe city also offers a large system of parks and paved trails known as the [[Apple Capital Recreation Loop Trail]]. The {{Convert|10|mi|adj=on}} loop along both banks of the Columbia River is used by cyclists, walkers, joggers, and skaters. A project to extend the eastern segment of the trail {{Convert|5|mile}} north to Lincoln Rock State Park was completed on July 9, 2015. An additional {{Convert|3.2|mi|adj=on}} extension on the east side runs south to Kirby Billingsley Hydro Park. A short extension slated for completion in Fall 2017 is planned from the west end of the Odabashian bridge to the corner of Easy Street and the highway.  In the winter, cross-country skiers and snowshoers also use the trail. The trail connects in the south at the [[Columbia River Bridge (Wenatchee, Washington)|historic Columbia River Bridge]], also known as the pipeline bridge, and in the north at the [[Richard Odabashian Bridge]].  It passes through [[Wenatchee Confluence State Park]].

Located at the confluence of the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and [[Wenatchee River|Wenatchee]] rivers near the eastern foothills of the [[Cascade Range]], Wenatchee lies on the western side of the Columbia River, across from the city of [[East Wenatchee, Washington|East Wenatchee]]. The [[Columbia River]] forms the boundary between Chelan and [[Douglas County, Washington|Douglas County]].  Wenatchee is the  principal city of the [[Wenatchee metropolitan area|Wenatchee\u2013East Wenatchee, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which encompasses all of Chelan and [[Douglas County, Washington|Douglas]] counties (total population around 110,884).  However, the \"Wenatchee Valley Area\" generally refers to the land between [[Rocky Reach Dam|Rocky Reach]] and [[Rock Island Dam]] on both banks of the Columbia, which includes [[East Wenatchee, Washington|East Wenatchee]], [[Rock Island, Washington|Rock Island]], and [[South Wenatchee, Washington|Malaga]].\n\nThe city was named for the nearby [[Wenatchi]] Indian tribe. The name is a [[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]] word that means \"river which comes [or whose source is] from canyons\" or \"robe of the rainbow\". ''Awenatchela'' means \"people at the source [of a river]\". The city of Wenatchee shares its name with the [[Wenatchee River]], [[Lake Wenatchee]] and the [[Wenatchee National Forest]].\n\nWenatchee is referred to as the \"Apple Capital of the World\" due to the valley's many orchards. The city is also sometimes referred to as the \"Buckle of the Power Belt of the Great Northwest\".  The \"Power Belt of the Great Northwest\" is a metaphor for the series of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River.  [[Rock Island Dam]] is located nearest to the middle of this \"belt\", and so was labeled the \"Buckle\". This saying is printed at the top of every issue of Wenatchee's newspaper, the ''Wenatchee World'', but is no longer in common use elsewhere.<ref>http://ret.wenworld.com/book/index.php</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistoric era===\n[[East Wenatchee Clovis Site|Archeological digs]] in nearby East Wenatchee have uncovered [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] stone and bone tools dating back more than 11,000 years, indicating that people migrating during the last Ice Age spent time in the Wenatchee area. The Columbia River and nearby mountains and sagebrush steppes provided an ample supply of food. Clovis points are on display at the [[Wenatchee Valley Museum & Cultural Center]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wvmcc.org|title=Home - Wenatchee Valley Museum & Cultural Center|publisher=}}</ref> and research findings are available through the ''Wenatchee World''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wenatcheeworld.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=CLOVIS|title=Wenatchee World}}</ref>\n\n===Indigenous villages and early settlers===\nSeveral indigenous villages existed in the area prior to and during Anglo American exploration. The village Nikwikwi'estku was a fishing and gathering camp located in present-day downtown Wenatchee. In 1811, [[North West Company]] surveyor David Thompson encountered a group of Native American horsemen at Wenatchee and was invited into a village with huts, the largest measuring 209 feet long. Fur traders document friendly relations through the mid 19th century, even during the smallpox epidemic of 1817 and food shortages in 1841.<ref name=\"Brown2007\">{{Cite book|title=Wenatchee's dark past: a history of race and race relations|last=Brown|first=Maureen E|publisher=Wenatchee World|year=2007|isbn=|location=Wenatchee, WA|pages=6\u20139|language=English|oclc=191853776}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Yakima War]] in 1856, US Army Colonel Wright intervened on a possible alliance between Yakama and Wenatchi tribes by removing the Wenatchi to Kittitas. The resulting march was estimated to include 1,000 horses and extend five miles long. A contigent stayed behind to fish at [[Wenatchapam Fishery]] in preparation for winter.<ref name=\"Brown2007\"/>\n\nIn 1863, Father Respari, a Catholic priest, began his missionary work with the Indians. He was followed some 20 years later by Father De Grassi, who built a log cabin on the Wenatchee River near the present town of [[Cashmere, Washington|Cashmere]]. Throughout the 19th century, other white settlers came to homestead the land. Wenatchee was platted in September 1888 and officially incorporated as a city on January 7, 1893. The 1900 U.S. Census counted 451 residents.\n\n[[File:Fruit field bin 5180.JPG|left|thumb|Apple field bins are stacked high at a [[Packing house|processing facility]] in Wenatchee.]]\n\n===Continued growth===\nThe Great Northern Railway completed its railroad line between [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], and [[Seattle]] in 1893. Its route through the Wenatchee Valley was significant to the development of this region. The railroad not only provided passenger travel to and from Wenatchee, but it provided for freight service for shipments of wheat, apples, and other products to out-of-state markets.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the Wenatchee Commercial Club, now the [[Wenatchee Valley Chamber of Commerce]], was advertising the region as the \"Home of the World's Best Apples.\" The tree fruit industry provided the economic backbone for the region for a century and still is an important source of revenue.\n\nOn May 22, 1910, the Wenatchee [[free speech fight]] occurred when members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) were arrested for [[soapboxing|speaking in the street]] in front of the local hall of the [[Socialist Party of America]].<ref name=\"IWWYearbook1910\">{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/iww/iwwyearbook1910.shtml |title=IWW Yearbook 1910 |last=Upton |first=Austin |website=IWW History Project |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |access-date=21 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"IW_1910_05_28\">{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=James P. |date=28 May 1910 |title=Wenatchee Denied Free Speech: Fight On |volume=2 |issue=10 |page=1 |newspaper=[[Industrial Worker]] |url=https://archive.org/details/v2n10-w62-may-28-1910-IW }}</ref> The town had freed imprisoned IWW members by June;<ref name=\"IW_1910_06_04\">{{cite news |author=<!-- No author listed. --> |date=4 June 1910 |title=Struggle for Free Speech in North and West |volume=2 |issue=11 |page=1 |newspaper=[[Industrial Worker]] |url=https://archive.org/details/v2n11-w63-jun-04-1910-IW }}</ref> however, tensions resumed in September 1911 when police raided a house rented by six IWW men and arrested twenty-five migrant workers found carrying IWW literature.

The reservoirs thus generated also made it possible to irrigate hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin.\n\n===Modern era===\nIn 1975, [[Stemilt Growers]] moved its headquarters from nearby Stemilt Hill to Olds Station, Wenatchee.

There are several facilities including the WRAC tennis club, an Olympic size swimming pool, an ice arena, several 18-hole and 9-hole golf courses, a 9-hole disc golf course, and countless baseball diamonds and soccer fields as well as two skateboard parks. There are lots of places to hike, fish and hunt for both birds and larger game. Boating and water recreation are also quite common. Many kayak, windsurf and water-ski on the Columbia. Whitewater rafting and inner-tubing is frequent on the Wenatchee River. In the winter, the mountains near Wenatchee provide great snowmobiling, sledding at [[Squilchuck State Park]], as well as skiing and snowboarding at [[Mission Ridge Ski Area|Mission Ridge]] (30 minutes drive) and Stevens Pass (1 hour and a half drive).  Nordic skiing is available at the Stevens Pass Nordic Center, Leavenworth (25 minute drive), and the Methow Valley (1 hour and 45 minute drive).\n\nThe city also offers a large system of parks and paved trails known as the [[Apple Capital Recreation Loop Trail]]. The {{Convert|10|mi|adj=on}} loop along both banks of the Columbia River is used by cyclists, walkers, joggers, and skaters. A project to extend the eastern segment of the trail {{Convert|5|mile}} north to Lincoln Rock State Park was completed on July 9, 2015. An additional {{Convert|3.2|mi|adj=on}} extension on the east side runs south to Kirby Billingsley Hydro Park. A short extension slated for completion in Fall 2017 is planned from the west end of the Odabashian bridge to the corner of Easy Street and the highway.  In the winter, cross-country skiers and snowshoers also use the trail. The trail connects in the south at the [[Columbia River Bridge (Wenatchee, Washington)|historic Columbia River Bridge]], also known as the pipeline bridge, and in the north at the [[Richard Odabashian Bridge]].  It passes through [[Wenatchee Confluence State Park]]. Much of the hillside areas surrounding the city of Wenatchee have been purchased by or have their rights held by the Chelan-Douglas Land Trust which protects them as a natural resource and as a site for hiking in the foothills.  The foothills trail system along the western edge of Wenatchee provides numerous short trails of varying difficulty for walking, hiking and mountain biking.\n\nThe Wenatchee Youth Circus, founded in 1952, has non-animal shows with performers from 6 to 18 years old.

These classes employ use of Moodle and Blackboard software packages for managing the distance-learning program. All classes are designed by educators at Wenatchee High School and operated by local instructors within the Wenatchee School District.\n\nThe city also has several private schools, most of which are religious: Children's Gate Montessori School, Cascade Christian Academy, The River Academy, St. Joseph Catholic School, and St. Paul's Lutheran School.\n\n===Higher education===\n\nWenatchee is also the home of the North Central Educational Service District, serving all of north-central Washington, and the [[Wenatchee Valley College]], a two-year community college with its main campus in Wenatchee and a satellite campus in [[Omak, Washington]].

{"title_page": "Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra", "text_new": "[[File:Grieghallen concert hall.jpg|thumb|The [[Grieg Hall]] in May, 2016]]\nThe '''Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra''' is a Norwegian [[orchestra]] based in [[Bergen]].  Its principal concert venue is the [[Grieg Hall]].\n\n==History==\nEstablished in [[1765 in music|1765]] under the name ''Det Musicalske Selskab'' (The Musical Society), it later changed its name to ''Musikselskabet Harmonien''.  Bergen citizens often refer to the ensemble as \"Harmonien\" (the Harmony).\n\nAfter World War I, there was strong interest in the major Norwegian cities of Bergen and [[Kristiania]] (later [[Oslo]]) in having larger orchestras.  In 1919, the orchestra in Bergen was reorganized to employ 40 professional full-time musicians.  As of 2015, the orchestra has 101 musicians.\n\nThe orchestra has had a long tradition of playing contemporary music. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s second symphony was performed in Bergen in the year it was published, [[1804 in music|1804]], even before it was performed in Berlin. Bergen-born [[composer]] [[Edvard Grieg]] had close ties with the orchestra, and was artistic director from 1880 to 1882. He also bequeathed a portion of his estate to a fund which continues to provide financial support for the orchestra. Other composers have served as principal conductor of the orchestra, including [[Arvid Fladmoe]], [[Johan Halvorsen]], [[Iver Holter]], [[Richard Henneberg]], [[Olav Kielland]] and [[Per Winge]].

Its principal concert venue is the [[Grieg Hall]].\n\n==History==\nEstablished in [[1765 in music|1765]] under the name ''Det Musicalske Selskab'' (The Musical Society), it later changed its name to ''Musikselskabet Harmonien''.  Bergen citizens often refer to the ensemble as \"Harmonien\" (the Harmony).\n\nAfter World War I, there was strong interest in the major Norwegian cities of Bergen and [[Kristiania]] (later [[Oslo]]) in having larger orchestras.  In 1919, the orchestra in Bergen was reorganized to employ 40 professional full-time musicians.  As of 2015, the orchestra has 101 musicians.\n\nThe orchestra has had a long tradition of playing contemporary music. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s second symphony was performed in Bergen in the year it was published, [[1804 in music|1804]], even before it was performed in Berlin. Bergen-born [[composer]] [[Edvard Grieg]] had close ties with the orchestra, and was artistic director from 1880 to 1882. He also bequeathed a portion of his estate to a fund which continues to provide financial support for the orchestra. Other composers have served as principal conductor of the orchestra, including [[Arvid Fladmoe]], [[Johan Halvorsen]], [[Iver Holter]], [[Richard Henneberg]], [[Olav Kielland]] and [[Per Winge]]. Composer [[Harald S\u00e6verud]] was frequently invited to conduct his own works, and the orchestra continues to commission and perform new compositions on a regular basis. Other composers who have conducted their own works with the orchestra include [[Aaron Copland]], [[Carl Nielsen|Karl Nielsen]], [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]], [[Lukas Foss]], and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]. In 1953, the ''Festspillene i Bergen'' was started and [[Leopold Stokowski]] was contracted to conduct the orchestra. Other conductors at the Bergen Festival have included [[Eugene Ormandy]] and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]].\n\nAmerican [[conducting|conductor]] [[Andrew Litton]] became principal conductor in 2003 and artistic director in 2005. In 2002 the orchestra began to record the complete orchestral works of Edvard Grieg, the first Norwegian orchestra to do so. Norwegian conductor [[Ole Kristian Ruud]] and the orchestra recorded the final of the 7 CDs for [[BIS Records|BIS]]., in 2005.  Litton now has the title of conductor laureate with the orchestra.

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Agricultural University Gymnasium]].\n\nThis [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] competition consists of a single-elimination tournament, with a [[repechage]] used to determine the winner of two bronze medals. The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[China
