Golson is known for co-founding and co-leading [[The Jazztet]] with trumpeter [[Art Farmer]] in 1959. From the late 1960s through the 1970s Golson was in demand as an arranger for film and television and thus was less active as a performer, but he and Farmer reformed the Jazztet in 1982.\n\nIn addition to \"[[I Remember Clifford (song)|I Remember Clifford]]\", many of Golson's compositions have become [[jazz standards]] including \"[[Blues March]]\", \"[[Whisper Not (song)|Whisper Not]]\", and \"Killer Joe\".\n\n==Biography==\nWhile in high school in [[Philadelphia]], Golson played with several other promising young musicians, including [[John Coltrane]], [[Red Garland]], [[Jimmy Heath]], [[Percy Heath]], [[Philly Joe Jones]], and [[Red Rodney]]. After graduating from [[Howard University]], Golson joined [[Bull Moose Jackson]]'s [[rhythm and blues]] band; [[Tadd Dameron]], whom Golson came to consider the most important influence on his writing, was Jackson's pianist at the time.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1959 Golson played with Dameron's band and then with the bands of [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Johnny Hodges]], [[Earl Bostic]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Art Blakey#The Jazz Messengers|Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers]] with whom he recorded the classic ''Moanin''' in 1958.\n\nGolson was working with the Lionel Hampton band at the [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]] in 1956 when he learned that [[Clifford Brown]], a noted and well-liked jazz trumpeter who had done a stint with him in Dameron's band,<ref>{{cite web|title=Clifford Brown Discography|url=http://www.jazzdisco.org/clifford-brown/discography/|publisher=Jazz Discography Project}}</ref> had died in a car accident. Golson was so moved by the event that he composed the [[threnody]] \"[[I Remember Clifford (song)|I Remember Clifford]]\", as a tribute to a fellow musician and friend.\n\nIn addition to \"I Remember Clifford\", many of Golson's compositions have become [[jazz standard]]s. Songs such as \"[[Stablemates (song)|Stablemates]]\", \"[[Killer Joe (song)|Killer Joe]]\", \"[[Whisper Not (song)|Whisper Not]]\", \"[[Along Came Betty (song)|Along Came Betty]]\", and \"[[Are You Real?(song)|Are You Real?]]\" have been performed and recorded numerous times by many musicians.<ref>Bailey, Phil and Hancock, Benny (1979) ''Benny Golson: Eight Jazz Classics'', p. iii.

Golson then left jazz to concentrate on studio and orchestral work for 12 years.

Critic Scott Yannow of [[Allmusic]] wrote that Golson's sax style underwent a major shift with his performing comeback, more resembling avant-garde [[Archie Shepp]] than the swing-era [[Don Byas]] influence of Golson's youth.<ref>Yannow, Scott.

The Supreme Court found that the trial judge had misdirected himself and ordered a new trial on two counts of aggravated assault but in May 1999, the British Columbian Attorney-General announced that a new trial would not take place. The Court's ruling caused difficulty because even though it only concerned non-disclosure of HIV-positive status in sexual situations, it unanimously rejected the English authority of R. v Clarence, with L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 stating that any fraud could vitiate consent to all types of assault because the autonomy and physical integrity of the person has been violated. Thus, because the Canadian legislature has declined to criminalize the transmission of HIV, the judiciary must address the issues as and when they arise.\n\n''R. v Mabior''<ref>{{Cite CanLII|litigants=R. v Mabior|year=2012|num=47}}</ref> is the Supreme Court of Canada's most recent decision outlining criminal liability for [[serostatus]] nondisclosure. After being diagnosed with HIV in 2004, Clato Mabior underwent aggressive antiretroviral therapy and was adhering to treatment at the time of pursuing sexual relations with multiple partners between 2004\u20132006. Despite intermittent condom use, HIV was never transmitted to his partners. Ultimately, the Court convicted Mabior with six counts of aggravated sexual assault.\n\nSubsequent legal precedent<ref>[http://www.aidslaw.ca/publications/interfaces/downloadFile.php?ref=28] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114123916/http://www.aidslaw.ca/publications/interfaces/downloadFile.php?ref=28 |date=14 November 2007 }}</ref> has established that failure to disclose HIV-positive status, combined with failure to utilize protective measures (condom use), is sufficiently fraudulent behaviour to constitute turning \"consensual\" sex into aggravated sexual assault, since the other party has been denied the information necessary to give properly informed consent. The Court's vague justification for serostatus disclosure under circumstances that lead to \"significant risk of bodily harm\" remained a particularly contentious issue in the aftermath of ''Cuerrier''. Because ''Cuerrier'' did not expressly define \"significant risk\", lower courts inconsistently criminalized HIV-positive defendants based on varied interpretations of the clause. In large part, ''Mabior'' represents a response to ''Cuerrier'' and an attempt to sharpen the criteria. In ''Mabior'', the Court found that \"significant risk of bodily harm is negated if (i) the accused\u2019s viral load at the time of sexual relations was low or undetectable, and (ii) condom protection was used.\"\n\nOn 1 December 2005, [[Jian Ghomeshi]] filed a report on this issue for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. He asked whether there is a legal obligation to disclose HIV status. He held up the case of [[Johnson Aziga]], who was diagnosed in 1996 but then allegedly had unprotected sex with at least 13 women. Aziga was charged with two counts of murder and 11 counts of aggravated sexual assault; the prosecution claims that he did not disclose his status. On 4 April 2009, Aziga was found guilty of the two counts of first degree murder as well as the lesser counts. The current precedent in Canada stands as any person who has HIV, fails to disclose the fact to their sexual partner, and does not take some sort of protective measure (such as condom use), is guilty of aggravated sexual assault as per ''Cuerrier'' and subsequent cases. Aziga was convicted of first degree murder since under Canadian law; any death as a result of aggravated sexual assault (two of the women died as a result of the HIV infection received from intercourse with Aziga) is automatically first degree murder as per section 231 of the ''Criminal Code''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/04/04/aziga-verdict.html?ref=rss|title=Ontario man found guilty in HIV murder trial|date=2009-04-04|publisher=CBC |location=Canada }}</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VIII::bo-ga:l_IX/20090817/en?page=6&isPrinting=false#codese:231]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605061202/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga%3Al_VIII%3A%3Abo-ga%3Al_IX/20090817/en?page=6&isPrinting=false |date=5 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral Canadian courts had ruled that people who are not informed that a sexual partner is HIV-positive cannot truly give consent to sex. As a result, the death of Aziga's partners was automatically considered to be murder instead of the lesser charge of [[manslaughter]]. However, in ''Mabior'' the Supreme Court rejected the view that consent will always be vitiated by non-disclosure of HIV-positive status, substituting the rule that there will be no consent only if in addition to the non-disclosure there was a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV.{{citation needed||date=March 2015}}\n\n===Finland===\nThe first case of criminal HIV infection in Finland was that of Steven Thomas,<ref name=knightridder>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19283277.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611091305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19283277.html |date=11 June 2014 }}</ref>  a US citizen from New York, who was convicted in 1997 in Helsinki for knowingly infecting [[Finnish people|Finnish]] women with HIV during 1993\u20131996.

The Supreme Court found that the trial judge had misdirected himself and ordered a new trial on two counts of aggravated assault but in May 1999, the British Columbian Attorney-General announced that a new trial would not take place. The Court's ruling caused difficulty because even though it only concerned non-disclosure of HIV-positive status in sexual situations, it unanimously rejected the English authority of R. v Clarence, with L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 stating that any fraud could vitiate consent to all types of assault because the autonomy and physical integrity of the person has been violated. Thus, because the Canadian legislature has declined to criminalize the transmission of HIV, the judiciary must address the issues as and when they arise.\n\n''R. v Mabior''<ref>{{Cite CanLII|litigants=R. v Mabior|year=2012|num=47}}</ref> is the Supreme Court of Canada's most recent decision outlining criminal liability for [[serostatus]] nondisclosure. After being diagnosed with HIV in 2004, Clato Mabior underwent aggressive antiretroviral therapy and was adhering to treatment at the time of pursuing sexual relations with multiple partners between 2004\u20132006. Despite intermittent condom use, HIV was never transmitted to his partners. Ultimately, the Court convicted Mabior with six counts of aggravated sexual assault.\n\nSubsequent legal precedent<ref>[http://www.aidslaw.ca/publications/interfaces/downloadFile.php?ref=28] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114123916/http://www.aidslaw.ca/publications/interfaces/downloadFile.php?ref=28 |date=14 November 2007 }}</ref> has established that failure to disclose HIV-positive status, combined with failure to utilize protective measures (condom use), is sufficiently fraudulent behaviour to constitute turning \"consensual\" sex into aggravated sexual assault, since the other party has been denied the information necessary to give properly informed consent. The Court's vague justification for serostatus disclosure under circumstances that lead to \"significant risk of bodily harm\" remained a particularly contentious issue in the aftermath of ''Cuerrier''. Because ''Cuerrier'' did not expressly define \"significant risk\", lower courts inconsistently criminalized HIV-positive defendants based on varied interpretations of the clause. In large part, ''Mabior'' represents a response to ''Cuerrier'' and an attempt to sharpen the criteria. In ''Mabior'', the Court found that \"significant risk of bodily harm is negated if (i) the accused\u2019s viral load at the time of sexual relations was low or undetectable, and (ii) condom protection was used.\"\n\nOn 1 December 2005, [[Jian Ghomeshi]] filed a report on this issue for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. He asked whether there is a legal obligation to disclose HIV status. He held up the case of [[Johnson Aziga]], who was diagnosed in 1996 but then allegedly had unprotected sex with at least 13 women. Aziga was charged with two counts of murder and 11 counts of aggravated sexual assault; the prosecution claims that he did not disclose his status. On 4 April 2009, Aziga was found guilty of the two counts of first degree murder as well as the lesser counts. The current precedent in Canada stands as any person who has HIV, fails to disclose the fact to their sexual partner, and does not take some sort of protective measure (such as condom use), is guilty of aggravated sexual assault as per ''Cuerrier'' and subsequent cases. Aziga was convicted of first degree murder since under Canadian law; any death as a result of aggravated sexual assault (two of the women died as a result of the HIV infection received from intercourse with Aziga) is automatically first degree murder as per section 231 of the ''Criminal Code''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/04/04/aziga-verdict.html?ref=rss|title=Ontario man found guilty in HIV murder trial|date=2009-04-04|publisher=CBC |location=Canada }}</ref><ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VIII::bo-ga:l_IX/20090817/en?page=6&isPrinting=false#codese:231]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605061202/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga%3Al_VIII%3A%3Abo-ga%3Al_IX/20090817/en?page=6&isPrinting=false |date=5 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral Canadian courts had ruled that people who are not informed that a sexual partner is HIV-positive cannot truly give consent to sex. As a result, the death of Aziga's partners was automatically considered to be murder instead of the lesser charge of [[manslaughter]]. However, in ''Mabior'' the Supreme Court rejected the view that consent will always be vitiated by non-disclosure of HIV-positive status, substituting the rule that there will be no consent only if in addition to the non-disclosure there was a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV.{{citation needed||date=March 2015}}\n\n===Finland===\nThe first case of criminal HIV infection in Finland was that of Steven Thomas,<ref name=knightridder>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19283277.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611091305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19283277.html |date=11 June 2014 }}</ref>  a US citizen from New York, who was convicted in 1997 in Helsinki for knowingly infecting [[Finnish people|Finnish]] women with HIV during 1993\u20131996.

Memories are not recalled in neat chronological order; instead, they are recalled by the association of one thing with another, which means that any attempt to put memory on film cannot be told like a conventional narrative.  The film is thus made up of a series of related sequences whose scenes are interspersed between each other.  One of the primary themes involves war, with particular emphasis on the enormous losses the [[Soviet Union]] suffered on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]].  Several recurring characters and their interactions make up a large part of the film, such as the poet, the little girl and the bull, the little boy and the crows, the dancers and the [[soldiers]], and especially the little [[grey wolf]] ({{lang-ru|\u0441\u0435\u0301\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u0447\u043e\u0301\u043a}}, syeryenkiy volchok).

Memories are not recalled in neat chronological order; instead, they are recalled by the association of one thing with another, which means that any attempt to put memory on film cannot be told like a conventional narrative.  The film is thus made up of a series of related sequences whose scenes are interspersed between each other.  One of the primary themes involves war, with particular emphasis on the enormous losses the [[Soviet Union]] suffered on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]].  Several recurring characters and their interactions make up a large part of the film, such as the poet, the little girl and the bull, the little boy and the crows, the dancers and the [[soldiers]], and especially the little [[grey wolf]] ({{lang-ru|\u0441\u0435\u0301\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u0447\u043e\u0301\u043a}}, syeryenkiy volchok).
