Subunits of a MOF, called secondary building units (SBU), can be described by [[topologies]] common to several structures. Each topology, also called a net, is assigned a symbol, consisting of three lower-case letters in bold. [[MOF-5]], for example, has a '''pcu''' net. \n\nAttached to the SBUs are [[bridging ligand]]s.  For MOF's, typical bridging ligands are di- and tricarboxylic acids.  These ligands typically have rigid backbones.  Examples are benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (BDC or teraphthalic acid, biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (BPDC), and the tricarboxylic acid [[trimesic acid]].\n[[Image:BasicZnAcetate.png|200px|thumb|SBU's are often derived from basic zinc acetate structure, the acetates being replaced by rigid di- and tricarboxylates.]]\n\n==Synthesis==\n\n=== General Synthesis ===\nThe study of MOFs developed from the study of [[zeolite]]. Except for the use of preformed ligands, MOFs and zeolites are produced almost exclusively by [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal]] or solvothermal techniques, where crystals are slowly grown from a hot solution.

Solvothermal synthesis is useful for growing crystals suitable to structure determination, because crystals grow over the course of hours to days.

Such a reactor is sometimes referred to as a multiclav. The reactor block or reactor insert is made of stainless steel and contains 24 reaction chambers, which are arranged in four rows. With the miniaturized teflon reactors, volumes of up to 2 mL can be used. The reactor block is sealed in a stainless steel autoclave; for this purpose, the filled reactors are inserted into the bottom of the reactor, the teflon reactors are sealed with two teflon films and the reactor top side is put on. The autoclave is then closed in a hydraulic press. The sealed solvothermal reactor can then be subjected to a temperature-time program. The reusable teflon film serves to withstand the mechanical stress, while the disposable teflon film seals the reaction vessels. After the reaction, the products can be isolated and washed in parallel in a vacuum filter device. On the filter paper, the products are then present separately in a so-called sample library and can subsequently be characterized by automated X-ray powder diffraction.

There are two major strategies governing the design of MOFs for hydrogen storage:\n:1) to increase the theoretical storage capacity of the material, and\n:2) to bring the operating conditions closer to ambient temperature and pressure. Rowsell and [[Omar M. Yaghi|Yaghi]] have identified several directions to these ends in some of the early papers.<ref name=Rowsell05>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowsell JL, Yaghi OM | title = Strategies for hydrogen storage in metal--organic frameworks | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 44 | issue = 30 | pages = 4670\u20139 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16028207 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200462786 }}\n</ref><ref name=Rowsell06>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowsell JL, Yaghi OM | title = Effects of functionalization, catenation, and variation of the metal oxide and organic linking units on the low-pressure hydrogen adsorption properties of metal-organic frameworks | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 1304\u201315 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16433549 | doi = 10.1021/ja056639q }}\n</ref>\n\n====Surface area====\nThe general trend in MOFs used for hydrogen storage is that the greater the surface area, the more hydrogen the MOF can store. High surface area materials tend to exhibit increased micropore volume and inherently low bulk density, allowing for more hydrogen adsorption to occur.<ref name=Murray09/>\n\n====Hydrogen adsorption enthalpy====\nHigh hydrogen adsorption [[enthalpy]] is also important.

This may diminish their useful lifetimes as well.<ref name=Dinca08/><ref name=Murray09/>\n\n====Sensitivity to airborne moisture====\nMOFs are frequently sensitive to moisture in the air.

Room-temperature hydrogen uptake via bridged [[Adsorption spillover|spillover]] is mainly governed by structural defects, which can have two effects:\n:1) a partially collapsed framework can block access to pores; thereby reducing hydrogen uptake, and\n:2) lattice defects can create an intricate array of new pores and channels causing increased hydrogen uptake.<ref name=Tsao09>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsao CS, Yu MS, Wang CY, Liao PY, Chen HL, Jeng US, Tzeng YR, Chung TY, Wu HC | title = Nanostructure and hydrogen spillover of bridged metal-organic frameworks | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 131 | issue = 4 | pages = 1404\u20136 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19140765 | doi = 10.1021/ja802741b }}</ref>\nStructural defects can also leave metal-containing nodes incompletely coordinated.

In three dimensions, the maximum surface area will be obtained by a structure which is highly porous, such that atoms and molecules can access internal surfaces. This simple qualitative argument suggests that the highly porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) should be excellent candidates for hydrogen storage devices.\n\nAdsorption can be broadly classified as being one of two types: [[physisorption]] or [[chemisorption]]. Physisorption is characterized by weak [[van der Waals interactions]], and bond enthalpies typically less than 20&nbsp;kJ/mol. Chemisorption, alternatively, is defined by stronger [[covalent]] and [[ionic bond]]s, with bond enthalpies between 250 and 500&nbsp;kJ/mol. In both cases, the [[adsorbate]] atoms or molecules (i.e. the particles which adhere to the surface) are attracted to the adsorbent (solid) surface because of the surface energy that results from unoccupied bonding locations at the surface. The degree of [[orbital overlap]] then determines if the interactions will be physisorptive or chemisorptive.<ref name=McQuarrie97>{{cite book | vauthors = McQuarrie DA, Simon JD | title = Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach | edition =  | publisher = University Science Books | location = Sausalito, CA | year = 1997 | isbn =  }}\n</ref>\n\nAdsorption of molecular hydrogen in MOFs is physisorptive.

Fewer than 200 zeolites are known.  In contrast with this limited scope, MOFs exhibit more diverse [[coordination chemistry|coordination geometries]], polytopic linkers, and ancillary [[ligands]] (F<sup>\u2212</sup>, OH<sup>\u2212</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O among others). It is also difficult to obtain zeolites with pore sizes larger than 1&nbsp;nm, which limits the catalytic applications of zeolites to relatively small organic molecules (typically no larger than [[xylenes]]). Furthermore, mild synthetic conditions typically employed for MOF synthesis allow direct incorporation of delicate functionalities into the framework structures. Such a process would not be possible with zeolites or other microporous crystalline oxide-based materials because of the harsh conditions typically used for their synthesis (e.g., [[calcination]] at high temperatures to remove organic templates). Metal-Organic Framework MIL-101 is one of the most used MOFs for catalysis incorporating different transition metals such as Cr.<ref>Esmaeil Niknam \"Metal\u2013Organic Framework MIL-101 (Cr) as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Clean Synthesis of Benzoazoles\" ACS omega, 3(12), December 12, 2018</ref>\n\nZeolites still cannot be obtained in enantiopure form, which precludes their applications in catalytic [[asymmetric synthesis]], e.g., for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and fragrance industries. Enantiopure chiral ligands or their metal complexes have been incorporated into MOFs to lead to efficient asymmetric catalysts. Even some MOF materials may bridge the gap between zeolites and [[enzymes]] when they combine isolated polynuclear sites, [[wikt:dynamic|dynamic]] host\u2013guest responses, and a [[hydrophobic]] cavity environment. MOFs might be useful for making semi-conductors. Theoretical calculations show that MOFs are [[semiconductors]] or [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] with band gaps between 1.0 and 5.5 eV which can be altered by changing the degree of [[Conjugated system|conjugation]] in the ligands indicating its possibility for being photocatalysts.\n\n===Design ===\n[[File:IRMOF-1 wiki.png|thumb|Example of MOF-5]]\nLike other [[Heterogeneous catalysis|heterogeneous catalysts]], MOFs may allow for easier post-reaction separation and recyclability than [[Homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous catalysts]]. In some cases, they also give a highly enhanced catalyst stability. Additionally, they typically offer substrate-size selectivity. Nevertheless, while clearly important for reactions in living systems, selectivity on the basis of substrate size is of limited value in abiotic catalysis, as reasonably pure feedstocks are generally available.\n\n====Metal ions or metal clusters====\n[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|Example of zeolite catalyst]]\nAmong the earliest reports of MOF-based catalysis was the cyanosilylation of [[aldehydes]] by a 2D MOF (layered square grids) of formula Cd(4,4\u2019-bpy)<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Metal-Organic Frameworks: A Rapidly Growing Class of Versatile Nanoporous Material |year=1994 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=116 |pages=1151 |doi=10.1021/ja00082a055 |last1=Fujita |first1=Makoto |last2=Kwon |first2=Yoon Jung |last3=Washizu |first3=Satoru |last4=Ogura |first4=Katsuyuki | name-list-format = vanc |issue=3 }}</ref> This investigation centered mainly on size- and shape-selective clathration.

The latter obstacle addresses the limitation of the antenna effect. Smaller linkers tend to improve MOF stability, but have higher energy absorptions, predominantly in the ultraviolet (UV) and high-energy visible regions. A design strategy for MOFs with [[Bathochromic shift|redshifted]] absorption properties has been accomplished by using large, chromophoric linkers. These linkers are often composed of polyaromatic species, leading to large pore sizes and thus decreased stability. To circumvent the use of large linkers, other methods are required to redshift the absorbance of the MOF so lower energy excitation sources can be used. Post-synthetic modification (PSM) is one promising strategy. Luo et al. introduced a new family of lanthanide MOFs with functionalized organic linkers. The MOFs, deemed MOF-1114, MOF-1115, MOF-1130, and MOF-1131, are composed of octahedral SBUs bridged by amino functionalized dicarboxylate linkers. The amino groups on the linkers served as sites for covalent PSM reactions with either salicylaldehyde or 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxyaldehyde. Both of these reactions extend the \u03c0-conjugation of the linker, causing a redshift in the absorbance wavelength from 450&nbsp;nm to 650&nbsp;nm. The authors also propose that this technique could be adapted to similar MOF systems and, by increasing pore volumes with increasing linker lengths, larger pi-conjugated reactants can be used to further redshift the absorption wavelengths.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo TY, Liu C, Eliseeva SV, Muldoon PF, Petoud S, Rosi NL | title = 2+ Clusters: Rational Design, Directed Synthesis, and Deliberate Tuning of Excitation Wavelengths | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 139 | issue = 27 | pages = 9333\u20139340 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28618777 | doi = 10.1021/jacs.7b04532 }}</ref> Biological imaging using MOFs has been realized by several groups, namely Foucault-Collet and co-workers.

From there the group performed in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the applicability of CD-MOF-1 as a viable delivery method for ibuprofen and other NSAIDs. In vitro studies showed no toxicity or effect on cell viability up to 100 \u03bcM.

Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading method for capturing CO<sub>2</sub> from flue gas, have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water.  This high heat capacity contributes to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step, i.e., when the adsorbed CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the MEA solution.

Basically, there are two synthetic strategies within the HT-methods: On the one hand the combinatorial approach, here all reactions take place in one vessel, which leads to product mixtures and on the other hand the parallel synthesis, here the reactions take place in different vessels. Furthermore, a distinction is made between thin films and solvent-based methods.<ref name=\":Stock2007\">{{citation|surname1=Sebastian Bauer, Norbert Stock|periodical=Chemie in Unserer Zeit|title=Hochdurchsatz-Methoden in der Festk\u00f6rperchemie.

The use of a microwave oven changes, in part dramatically, the reaction parameters.\n\n==== High-throughput solvothermal synthesis ====\nIn high-throughput solvothermal synthesis, a solvothermal reactor with (eg) 24 cavities for teflon reactors is used. Such a reactor is sometimes referred to as a multiclav. The reactor block or reactor insert is made of stainless steel and contains 24 reaction chambers, which are arranged in four rows. With the miniaturized teflon reactors, volumes of up to 2 mL can be used. The reactor block is sealed in a stainless steel autoclave; for this purpose, the filled reactors are inserted into the bottom of the reactor, the teflon reactors are sealed with two teflon films and the reactor top side is put on. The autoclave is then closed in a hydraulic press. The sealed solvothermal reactor can then be subjected to a temperature-time program. The reusable teflon film serves to withstand the mechanical stress, while the disposable teflon film seals the reaction vessels. After the reaction, the products can be isolated and washed in parallel in a vacuum filter device. On the filter paper, the products are then present separately in a so-called sample library and can subsequently be characterized by automated X-ray powder diffraction. The informations obtained are then used to plan further syntheses.<ref>{{citation|surname1=Enrica Biemmi, Sandra Christian, Norbert Stock, Thomas Bein|periodical=Microporous and Mesoporous Materials|title=High-throughput screening of synthesis parameters in the formation of the metal-organic frameworks MOF-5 and HKUST-1|volume=117|issue=1\u20132|at=pp.&nbsp;111\u2013117|date=2009|language=German|doi=10.1016/j.micromeso.2008.06.040\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-synthetic Modification ===\nAlthough the three-dimensional structure and internal environment of the pores can be in theory controlled through proper selection of nodes and organic linking groups, the direct synthesis of such materials with the desired functionalities can be difficult due to the high sensitivity of MOF systems.

There are two major strategies governing the design of MOFs for hydrogen storage:\n:1) to increase the theoretical storage capacity of the material, and\n:2) to bring the operating conditions closer to ambient temperature and pressure. Rowsell and [[Omar M. Yaghi|Yaghi]] have identified several directions to these ends in some of the early papers.<ref name=Rowsell05>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowsell JL, Yaghi OM | title = Strategies for hydrogen storage in metal--organic frameworks | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 44 | issue = 30 | pages = 4670\u20139 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16028207 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200462786 }}\n</ref><ref name=Rowsell06>\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowsell JL, Yaghi OM | title = Effects of functionalization, catenation, and variation of the metal oxide and organic linking units on the low-pressure hydrogen adsorption properties of metal-organic frameworks | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 1304\u201315 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16433549 | doi = 10.1021/ja056639q }}\n</ref>\n\n====Surface area====\nThe general trend in MOFs used for hydrogen storage is that the greater the surface area, the more hydrogen the MOF can store. High surface area materials tend to exhibit increased micropore volume and inherently low bulk density, allowing for more hydrogen adsorption to occur.<ref name=Murray09/>\n\n====Hydrogen adsorption enthalpy====\nHigh hydrogen adsorption [[enthalpy]] is also important.

A problem with this approach is that MOFs with exposed metal surfaces have lower concentrations of linkers; this makes them difficult to synthesize, as they are prone to framework collapse. This may diminish their useful lifetimes as well.<ref name=Dinca08/><ref name=Murray09/>\n\n====Sensitivity to airborne moisture====\nMOFs are frequently sensitive to moisture in the air.

Room-temperature hydrogen uptake via bridged [[Adsorption spillover|spillover]] is mainly governed by structural defects, which can have two effects:\n:1) a partially collapsed framework can block access to pores; thereby reducing hydrogen uptake, and\n:2) lattice defects can create an intricate array of new pores and channels causing increased hydrogen uptake.<ref name=Tsao09>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsao CS, Yu MS, Wang CY, Liao PY, Chen HL, Jeng US, Tzeng YR, Chung TY, Wu HC | title = Nanostructure and hydrogen spillover of bridged metal-organic frameworks | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 131 | issue = 4 | pages = 1404\u20136 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19140765 | doi = 10.1021/ja802741b }}</ref>\nStructural defects can also leave metal-containing nodes incompletely coordinated.

In three dimensions, the maximum surface area will be obtained by a structure which is highly porous, such that atoms and molecules can access internal surfaces. This simple qualitative argument suggests that the highly porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) should be excellent candidates for hydrogen storage devices.\n\nAdsorption can be broadly classified as being one of two types: [[physisorption]] or [[chemisorption]]. Physisorption is characterized by weak [[van der Waals interactions]], and bond enthalpies typically less than 20&nbsp;kJ/mol. Chemisorption, alternatively, is defined by stronger [[covalent]] and [[ionic bond]]s, with bond enthalpies between 250 and 500&nbsp;kJ/mol. In both cases, the [[adsorbate]] atoms or molecules (i.e. the particles which adhere to the surface) are attracted to the adsorbent (solid) surface because of the surface energy that results from unoccupied bonding locations at the surface. The degree of [[orbital overlap]] then determines if the interactions will be physisorptive or chemisorptive.<ref name=McQuarrie97>{{cite book | vauthors = McQuarrie DA, Simon JD | title = Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach | edition =  | publisher = University Science Books | location = Sausalito, CA | year = 1997 | isbn =  }}\n</ref>\n\nAdsorption of molecular hydrogen in MOFs is physisorptive.

To obtain the total amount of hydrogen in the MOF, both the amount of hydrogen absorbed on its surface and the amount of hydrogen residing in its pores should be considered. To calculate the absolute absorbed amount (''N''<sub>abs</sub>), the surface excess amount (''N''<sub>ex</sub>) is added to the product of the bulk density of hydrogen (\u03c1<sub>bulk</sub>) and the pore volume of the MOF (''V''<sub>pore</sub>), as shown in the following equation:<ref name=Zhao08>{{cite journal | first = Dan | last = Zhao | first2 = Daqiang | last2 = Yan | first3 = Hong-Cai | last3 = Zhou | name-list-format = vanc | title = The current status of hydrogen storage in metal\u2013organic frameworks | journal = Energy & Environmental Science | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 225\u2013235 | year = 2008 | url =  https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6181e9c8b520e1db25a9ad6a0d1607f9b76eec3| doi = 10.1039/b808322n }}</ref>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"> <math>N_{\\rm abs} = N_{\\rm ex} + \\rho_{\\rm bulk} V_{\\rm pore} </math></div>\n\n====Gravimetric method====\nThe increased mass of the MOF due to the stored hydrogen is directly calculated by a highly sensitive microbalance.<ref name=Zhao08/> Due to [[buoyancy]], the detected mass of adsorbed hydrogen decreases again when a sufficiently high pressure is applied to the system because the density of the surrounding gaseous hydrogen becomes more and more important at higher pressures.

Fewer than 200 zeolites are known.  In contrast with this limited scope, MOFs exhibit more diverse [[coordination chemistry|coordination geometries]], polytopic linkers, and ancillary [[ligands]] (F<sup>\u2212</sup>, OH<sup>\u2212</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O among others). It is also difficult to obtain zeolites with pore sizes larger than 1&nbsp;nm, which limits the catalytic applications of zeolites to relatively small organic molecules (typically no larger than [[xylenes]]). Furthermore, mild synthetic conditions typically employed for MOF synthesis allow direct incorporation of delicate functionalities into the framework structures. Such a process would not be possible with zeolites or other microporous crystalline oxide-based materials because of the harsh conditions typically used for their synthesis (e.g., [[calcination]] at high temperatures to remove organic templates). Metal-Organic Framework MIL-101 is one of the most used MOFs for catalysis incorporating different transition metals such as Cr.<ref>Esmaeil Niknam \"Metal\u2013Organic Framework MIL-101 (Cr) as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Clean Synthesis of Benzoazoles\" ACS omega, 3(12), December 12, 2018</ref>\n\nZeolites still cannot be obtained in enantiopure form, which precludes their applications in catalytic [[asymmetric synthesis]], e.g., for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and fragrance industries. Enantiopure chiral ligands or their metal complexes have been incorporated into MOFs to lead to efficient asymmetric catalysts. Even some MOF materials may bridge the gap between zeolites and [[enzymes]] when they combine isolated polynuclear sites, [[wikt:dynamic|dynamic]] host\u2013guest responses, and a [[hydrophobic]] cavity environment. MOFs might be useful for making semi-conductors. Theoretical calculations show that MOFs are [[semiconductors]] or [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] with band gaps between 1.0 and 5.5 eV which can be altered by changing the degree of [[Conjugated system|conjugation]] in the ligands indicating its possibility for being photocatalysts.\n\n===Design ===\n[[File:IRMOF-1 wiki.png|thumb|Example of MOF-5]]\nLike other [[Heterogeneous catalysis|heterogeneous catalysts]], MOFs may allow for easier post-reaction separation and recyclability than [[Homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous catalysts]].

Nevertheless, at least for hydrogenation, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that catalysis is occurring at the surface of MOF-encapsulated palladium clusters/nanoparticles (i.e., partial decomposition sites) or defect sites, rather than at transiently labile, but otherwise intact, single-atom MOF nodes.  \"Opportunistic\" MOF-based catalysis has been described for the cubic compound, MOF-5.<ref>{{cite journal |title=MOFs as acid catalysts with shape selectivity properties |year=2008 |journal= New Journal of Chemistry |volume=32 |pages=937 |doi=10.1039/B803953B |last1=Ravon |first1=Ugo |last2=Domine |first2=Marcelo E. |last3=Gaudill\u00e8re |first3=Cyril |last4=Desmartin-Chomel |first4=Arnold |last5=Farrusseng |first5=David | name-list-format = vanc |issue=6 }}</ref> This material comprises coordinatively saturated Zn<sub>4</sub>O nodes and a fully complexed BDC struts (see above for abbreviation); yet it apparently catalyzes the Friedel\u2013Crafts tert-butylation of both [[toluene]] and [[biphenyl]].

The latter obstacle addresses the limitation of the antenna effect. Smaller linkers tend to improve MOF stability, but have higher energy absorptions, predominantly in the ultraviolet (UV) and high-energy visible regions. A design strategy for MOFs with [[Bathochromic shift|redshifted]] absorption properties has been accomplished by using large, chromophoric linkers. These linkers are often composed of polyaromatic species, leading to large pore sizes and thus decreased stability. To circumvent the use of large linkers, other methods are required to redshift the absorbance of the MOF so lower energy excitation sources can be used. Post-synthetic modification (PSM) is one promising strategy. Luo et al. introduced a new family of lanthanide MOFs with functionalized organic linkers. The MOFs, deemed MOF-1114, MOF-1115, MOF-1130, and MOF-1131, are composed of octahedral SBUs bridged by amino functionalized dicarboxylate linkers. The amino groups on the linkers served as sites for covalent PSM reactions with either salicylaldehyde or 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxyaldehyde. Both of these reactions extend the \u03c0-conjugation of the linker, causing a redshift in the absorbance wavelength from 450&nbsp;nm to 650&nbsp;nm. The authors also propose that this technique could be adapted to similar MOF systems and, by increasing pore volumes with increasing linker lengths, larger pi-conjugated reactants can be used to further redshift the absorption wavelengths.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo TY, Liu C, Eliseeva SV, Muldoon PF, Petoud S, Rosi NL | title = 2+ Clusters: Rational Design, Directed Synthesis, and Deliberate Tuning of Excitation Wavelengths | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 139 | issue = 27 | pages = 9333\u20139340 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28618777 | doi = 10.1021/jacs.7b04532 }}</ref> Biological imaging using MOFs has been realized by several groups, namely Foucault-Collet and co-workers.

The synthesis resulted in a cubic (\u03b3-CD)<small>6</small> repeating motif with a pore size of approximately 1&nbsp;nm. Subsequently, in 2017 Hartlieb et al. at Northwestern did further research with CD-MOF-1 involving the encapsulation of ibuprofen. The group studied different methods of loading the MOF with ibuprofen as well as performing related bioavailability studies on the ibuprofen-loaded MOF. They investigated two different methods of loading CD-MOF-1 with ibuprofen; crystallization using the potassium salt of ibuprofen as the alkali cation source for production of the MOF, and absorption and deprotonation of the free-acid of ibuprofen into the MOF. From there the group performed in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the applicability of CD-MOF-1 as a viable delivery method for ibuprofen and other NSAIDs. In vitro studies showed no toxicity or effect on cell viability up to 100 \u03bcM. In vivo studies in mice showed the same rapid uptake of ibuprofen as the ibuprofen potassium salt control sample with a peak plasma concentration observed within 20 minutes, and the cocrystal has the added benefit of double the half-life in blood plasma samples.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartlieb KJ, Ferris DP, Holcroft JM, Kandela I, Stern CL, Nassar MS, Botros YY, Stoddart JF | title = Encapsulation of Ibuprofen in CD-MOF and Related Bioavailability Studies | journal = Molecular Pharmaceutics | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 1831\u20131839 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28355489 | doi = 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00168 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The increase in half-life is due to CD-MOF-1 increasing the solubility of ibuprofen compared to the pure salt form.\n\nSince these developments many groups have done further research into drug delivery with water-soluble, biocompatible MOFs involving common over-the-counter drugs. In March 2018 Sara Rojas and her team at Paris-Saclay University published their research on drug incorporation and delivery with various biocompatible MOFs other than CD-MOF-1 through simulated cutaneous administration. The group studied the loading and release of ibuprofen (hydrophobic) and aspirin (hydrophilic) in three biocompatible MOFs (MIL-100(Fe), UiO-66(Zr), and MIL-127(Fe)). Under simulated cutaneous conditions (aqueous media at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C) the six different combinations of drug-loaded MOFs fulfilled \"the requirements to be used as topical drug-delivery systems, such as released payload between 1 and 7 days\" and delivering a therapeutic concentration of the drug of choice without causing unwanted side effects.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rojas S, Colinet I, Cunha D, Hidalgo T, Salles F, Serre C, Guillou N, Horcajada P | title = Toward Understanding Drug Incorporation and Delivery from Biocompatible Metal-Organic Frameworks in View of Cutaneous Administration | journal = ACS Omega | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 2994\u20133003 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29623304 | pmc = 5879486 | doi = 10.1021/acsomega.8b00185 }}</ref> The group discovered that the drug uptake is \"governed by the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance between cargo and matrix\" and \"the accessibility of the drug through the framework.\" The \"controlled release under cutaneous conditions follows different kinetics profiles depending on: (i) the structure of the framework, with either a fast delivery from the very open structure MIL-100 or a slower drug release from the narrow 1D pore system of MIL-127 or (ii) the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of the cargo, with a fast (Aspirin) and slow (Ibuprofen) release from the UiO-66 matrix.\"\n\nRecent research involving MOFs as a drug delivery method includes more than just the encapsulation of everyday drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin.

Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading method for capturing CO<sub>2</sub> from flue gas, have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water.  This high heat capacity contributes to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step, i.e., when the adsorbed CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the MEA solution.

Estimations showed that, if a similar system would be applied to a large scale power plant, the cost of energy would increase by 65%, while a U.S. [[National Energy Technology Laboratory|NETL]] baseline amine-based system would cause an increase of 81% (the U.S. DOE goal is 35%). The cost of capturing CO<sub>2</sub>  would be $57 / ton CO<sub>2</sub> captured, while for the amine system the cost is estimated to be $72 / ton CO<sub>2</sub> captured.

{"title_page": "Ivan Zajc", "text_new": "[[File:Ivan Zajc 1875 Mukarovsky.png|thumb|Ivan Zajc (1875)]]\n'''Ivan Zajc''' (also {{lang-hr|Ivan [[wikt:plemenit|plemeniti]] Zajc}}, {{lang-it|Giovanni de Zaytz}}; {{IPA-hr|\u01d0\u028ban z\u00e2jts|pron}}; August 3, 1832 &ndash; December 16, 1914), was a [[Croatia]]n composer, conductor, director, and teacher who dominated [[Croatia]]'s musical culture for over forty years.  Through his artistic and institutional reform efforts, he is credited with its revitalization and refinement, paving the way for new and significant Croatian musical achievements in the 20th century. He is often called the Croatian [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood years===\n[[Image:Rijeka Ivan Zajc monument 2005-08-01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A monument to Ivan Zajc in [[Rijeka]] ]]\nIvan Dragutin Stjepan Zajc was born in [[Fiume]], modern-day Rijeka, Croatia. His family migrated from [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]; his father, Johann Zaytz, was of Czech descent, and his mother, Anna Bodensteiner was of German descent. His musical talent was evident very early on in his life, as he began to study the [[piano]] and [[violin]] at the age of five, performed in public by the age of six, and even began to compose his own music by the age of twelve.  Nevertheless, despite his early musical success, his military bandmaster father was opposed to the idea of a career in music and wanted him to study law instead following the completion of his secondary education.  In the end, Zajc's professors prevailed and he entered the [[Milan Conservatory]] in 1850 with his father's consent.\n\n===Early success in Milan and Vienna===\n\nZajc studied in [[Milan]] from 1850 to 1855, under the supervision of [[Stefano Ronchetti-Monteviti]] (counterpoint and composition), [[Alberto Mazzucato]] (orchestration), and [[Lauro Rossi]] (dramatic music).  During this period, Zajc took his studies very seriously and regularly won prizes as one of the conservatory's most talented students.  He was awarded first prize at his graduation examination for the opera ''[[La Tirolese]]'' (1855), which was performed on stage in the same year.  Zajc's future as a composer and conductor in Milan was secure, but the death of his parents in the meantime forced him to return to Rijeka.\n\nBack home, he accepted the post of conductor and concert master of the Town Theatre Orchestra, taught stringed instruments at the Philharmonic Institute, and simultaneously wrote numerous compositions with his characteristic speed and ease.  In 1860, his opera ''[[Amelia ossia Il Bandito]]'' was met with great success, though two years later, after a prolonged illness, Zajc chose to move to [[Vienna]], where opera and theatre were flourishing.  His eight-year stay there (1862\u201370) was marked by further success, though he settled for composing operettas rather than operas.  His first Viennese work, ''[[Mannschaft an Bord]]'' (1863), was enormously well received and his later operettas only served to strengthen his growing reputation.  Yet it was in Vienna that Zajc became involved with the Croatian academic society [[Velebit]] and frequently met with young Croatian students.  Influenced by such Croatian cultural figures as bishop [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] and poets [[Petar Preradovi\u0107]], [[Ivan Trnski]], [[August Senoa|August \u0160enoa]], and [[Matija Divkovic|Matija Divkovi\u0107]], Zajc chose patriotism over world fame and returned to Croatia.\n\n===Return to Croatia===\n\nUpon his arrival in [[Zagreb]] in 1870, Zajc was presented with two posts:  director and conductor of the [[Croatian Opera]] and director and teacher at the [[Croatian Institute of Music]].  It was during this period that Zajc made his colossal contribution to Croatian musical culture, not only through his compositions, but also through his leadership in reorganizing Zagreb's musical institutions.  He was also an excellent vocal teacher and succeeded in training several prominent singers.  Zajc was an exceptionally prolific composer as evidenced by almost 1000 works, from Op. 234 to Op. 1202, produced during his time in Zagreb.  Included in this number are ''[[Mislav]]'' (1870), ''[[Ban Leget]]'' (1872), his masterpiece ''[[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski (opera)|Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]]'' (1876), and ''[[Lizinka]]'' (1878), in addition to [[operetta]]s, [[musical comedy|musical comedies]], [[cantata]]s, songs and choral compositions, [[concerto|concerti]], [[chamber music]], and many other works.\n\nZajc's appointment at the opera was held until 1889, when owing to financial difficulties the organization lapsed for a time, but Zajc retained his post at the school until 1908, when he finally retired.  He is credited with reviving Croatian music during a period of musical stagnation after the collapse of the [[Illyrian Movement]] and raising it to the artistic level where it stands today.  His efforts paved the way for new and significant Croatian musical achievements in the early 20th century, which Zajc himself lived to see until his death on December 16, 1914 in Zagreb.\n\n==List of major works==\n\nKurac\n\n==Sources==\n{{no footnotes|date=November 2011}}\n\n* Josip Andreis: <cite>Ivan Zajc</cite>, Encyclopedia of Music, No. 3, [[Miroslav Krle\u017ea Institute of Lexicography]], Zagreb.

Through his artistic and institutional reform efforts, he is credited with its revitalization and refinement, paving the way for new and significant Croatian musical achievements in the 20th century. He is often called the Croatian [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood years===\n[[Image:Rijeka Ivan Zajc monument 2005-08-01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A monument to Ivan Zajc in [[Rijeka]] ]]\nIvan Dragutin Stjepan Zajc was born in [[Fiume]], modern-day Rijeka, Croatia. His family migrated from [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]; his father, Johann Zaytz, was of Czech descent, and his mother, Anna Bodensteiner was of German descent. His musical talent was evident very early on in his life, as he began to study the [[piano]] and [[violin]] at the age of five, performed in public by the age of six, and even began to compose his own music by the age of twelve.  Nevertheless, despite his early musical success, his military bandmaster father was opposed to the idea of a career in music and wanted him to study law instead following the completion of his secondary education.  In the end, Zajc's professors prevailed and he entered the [[Milan Conservatory]] in 1850 with his father's consent.\n\n===Early success in Milan and Vienna===\n\nZajc studied in [[Milan]] from 1850 to 1855, under the supervision of [[Stefano Ronchetti-Monteviti]] (counterpoint and composition), [[Alberto Mazzucato]] (orchestration), and [[Lauro Rossi]] (dramatic music).  During this period, Zajc took his studies very seriously and regularly won prizes as one of the conservatory's most talented students.  He was awarded first prize at his graduation examination for the opera ''[[La Tirolese]]'' (1855), which was performed on stage in the same year.  Zajc's future as a composer and conductor in Milan was secure, but the death of his parents in the meantime forced him to return to Rijeka.\n\nBack home, he accepted the post of conductor and concert master of the Town Theatre Orchestra, taught stringed instruments at the Philharmonic Institute, and simultaneously wrote numerous compositions with his characteristic speed and ease.  In 1860, his opera ''[[Amelia ossia Il Bandito]]'' was met with great success, though two years later, after a prolonged illness, Zajc chose to move to [[Vienna]], where opera and theatre were flourishing.  His eight-year stay there (1862\u201370) was marked by further success, though he settled for composing operettas rather than operas.  His first Viennese work, ''[[Mannschaft an Bord]]'' (1863), was enormously well received and his later operettas only served to strengthen his growing reputation.  Yet it was in Vienna that Zajc became involved with the Croatian academic society [[Velebit]] and frequently met with young Croatian students.  Influenced by such Croatian cultural figures as bishop [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] and poets [[Petar Preradovi\u0107]], [[Ivan Trnski]], [[August Senoa|August \u0160enoa]], and [[Matija Divkovic|Matija Divkovi\u0107]], Zajc chose patriotism over world fame and returned to Croatia.\n\n===Return to Croatia===\n\nUpon his arrival in [[Zagreb]] in 1870, Zajc was presented with two posts:  director and conductor of the [[Croatian Opera]] and director and teacher at the [[Croatian Institute of Music]].  It was during this period that Zajc made his colossal contribution to Croatian musical culture, not only through his compositions, but also through his leadership in reorganizing Zagreb's musical institutions.  He was also an excellent vocal teacher and succeeded in training several prominent singers.  Zajc was an exceptionally prolific composer as evidenced by almost 1000 works, from Op. 234 to Op. 1202, produced during his time in Zagreb.  Included in this number are ''[[Mislav]]'' (1870), ''[[Ban Leget]]'' (1872), his masterpiece ''[[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski (opera)|Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]]'' (1876), and ''[[Lizinka]]'' (1878), in addition to [[operetta]]s, [[musical comedy|musical comedies]], [[cantata]]s, songs and choral compositions, [[concerto|concerti]], [[chamber music]], and many other works.\n\nZajc's appointment at the opera was held until 1889, when owing to financial difficulties the organization lapsed for a time, but Zajc retained his post at the school until 1908, when he finally retired.  He is credited with reviving Croatian music during a period of musical stagnation after the collapse of the [[Illyrian Movement]] and raising it to the artistic level where it stands today.  His efforts paved the way for new and significant Croatian musical achievements in the early 20th century, which Zajc himself lived to see until his death on December 16, 1914 in Zagreb.\n\n==List of major works==\n\n* ''La tirolese'', Premiered in [[Milan]] on May 4, 1855\n* ''Amelia ossia Il bandito'', [[Rijeka]], April 24, 1860\n* ''Mannschaft an Bord'', [[Vienna]], December 15, 1863\n* ''Fitzliputzli'', [[Vienna]], November 5, 1864\n* ''Die lazzaroni vom Stanzel'', [[Vienna]], May 4, 1865\n* ''Die Hexe von Boissy'', [[Vienna]], April 24, 1866\n* ''Nachtschw\u00e4rmer'', [[Vienna]], November 10, 1866\n* ''Das Rendezvous in der Schweiz'', [[Vienna]], April 3, 1867\n* ''Das Gaugericht'', [[Vienna]], September 14, 1867\n* ''Nach Mekka'', [[Vienna]], January 11, 1868\n* ''Somnambula'', [[Vienna]], January 21, 1868\n* ''Sch\u00fctzen von einst und jetzt'', [[Vienna]], July 25, 1868\n* ''Meister Puff'', [[Vienna]], May 22, 1869\n* ''Mislav'', [[Zagreb]], February 2, 1870\n* ''Ban Leget'', [[Zagreb]], July 16, 1872\n* ''Der gefangene Amor'', [[Vienna]], September 12, 1874\n* ''[[Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski (opera)|Nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 Zrinski]]'', [[Zagreb]], November 4, 1876\n* ''Lizinka'', [[Zagreb]], November 12, 1878\n* ''Der Wildling'', [[Zagreb]], September 23, 1905\n* ''Prvi grijeh'', [[Zagreb]], April 25, 1907; December 18, 1912\n* ''O\u010de na\u0161'', [[Zagreb]], December 16, 1911\n\n==Sources==\n{{no footnotes|date=November 2011}}\n\n* Josip Andreis: <cite>Ivan Zajc</cite>, Encyclopedia of Music, No. 3, [[Miroslav Krle\u017ea Institute of Lexicography]], Zagreb.

It was first specified in standard FEN 301-316, and has been used by German fire brigades since 1933. (See German [[:de:Feuerwehrkupplung|delivery hose]] article.) Amongst other uses, it has been widely employed on [[fire hose]]s in [[firefighting]] applications. It is the standard coupling on fire hoses in Portugal, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Israel, and Greece.<ref>T.O.T.E.E. 2451/86 ''\u0395\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1: \u039c\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b2\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc'', Technical Chamber of Greece, 1986, pp. 12, 15, 20.</ref>  It is also widely used in Australia and the United States.\n\nThe Storz coupling system is also widely used for filling of bulk wood pellet storage systems in Europe (Storz-A or 4\" size), although in France and Belgium the equivalent Guillemin coupling is more commonly employed.\n\nStorz connectors are usually made of brass or aluminium. They can be manufactured by [[casting]] for general hose connection and low pressure applications, but for firefighting, it is better to use [[forging]]s to guarantee the safety and durability of the coupling.\n\nIt is sometimes referred to as a [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|sexless coupling]], because rather than having a male and a female end connected by [[screw thread]]s, either identical end can be joined to any other end of the same diameter. This is also called [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] or two-way connection. To couple a Storz connection, the two opposing couplings are pressed together such that the hooks of each one are inserted into the slots in the flange of the other. Then they are rotated in opposite directions until they are tight, or latches engage. This creates a watertight connection between the internal packing gaskets.  To uncouple them, the latches are released and the connectors are turned in the opposite directions from coupling, and then separated when the hooks and slots are aligned. Special [[wrench]]es are designed for assisting with use of Storz connectors.\n\nThe main benefit to using Storz couplings is speed of hose connection, as a hose can be locked with a quarter-turn. By comparison, locking hoses using threaded couplings often takes several turns. Because of this, Storz couplings are widely viewed as a safer alternative to using threaded couplings. A secondary benefit over threaded couplings is that the connecting faces and hooks are less prone to damage if the coupling is dropped onto, or dragged over, a hard surface.\n\nStorz couplers are available commercially in the following non-DIN-specified sizes:<ref>{{cite web|title=Storz Coupling Sizes|url=https://pslfireandsafety.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Storz-Coupling-Sizes.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

U.S. [[Fire apparatus|fire engines]] typically carry LDH (large diameter hose) with Storz couplings on both ends for connections between fire hydrants and pumps.

They can be manufactured by [[casting]] for general hose connection and low pressure applications, but for firefighting, it is better to use [[forging]]s to guarantee the safety and durability of the coupling.\n\nIt is sometimes referred to as a [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|sexless coupling]], because rather than having a male and a female end connected by [[screw thread]]s, either identical end can be joined to any other end of the same diameter. This is also called [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] or two-way connection. To couple a Storz connection, the two opposing couplings are pressed together such that the hooks of each one are inserted into the slots in the flange of the other. Then they are rotated in opposite directions until they are tight, or latches engage. This creates a watertight connection between the internal packing gaskets.  To uncouple them, the latches are released and the connectors are turned in the opposite directions from coupling, and then separated when the hooks and slots are aligned. Special [[wrench]]es are designed for assisting with use of Storz connectors.\n\nThe main benefit to using Storz couplings is speed of hose connection, as a hose can be locked with a quarter-turn. By comparison, locking hoses using threaded couplings often takes several turns. Because of this, Storz couplings are widely viewed as a safer alternative to using threaded couplings. A secondary benefit over threaded couplings is that the connecting faces and hooks are less prone to damage if the coupling is dropped onto, or dragged over, a hard surface.\n\nStorz couplers are available commercially in the following non-DIN-specified sizes:<ref>{{cite web|title=Storz Coupling Sizes|url=https://pslfireandsafety.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Storz-Coupling-Sizes.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''A'''C Current (A), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''4'''th generation (4). WAM4 though an indigenously produced loco was heavily inspired by French box design and naturally favoured a French TM which was the Alstom made TAO TM.A total of 500 WAM-4 were built at CLW between 1978 and 1983, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive till it's successor the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5.]]\n\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later ([[Indian locomotive class WCAM 1|WCAM-1]], [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5A]], [[Indian locomotive class WCG-2|WCG-2]], and some [[Indian locomotive class WAP-1|WAP]] models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe history of WAM-4 begins in early 1970s with the aim of addressing the shortcomings of the previous [[Indian locomotive class WAM-1|WAM-1]]/[[Indian locomotive class WAM-2/3|2]] and [[Indian Railways WAG class|WAG(1-4)]] classes and remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from IR by a target date of 1990. The WAM1s were not great successes as some of their advanced features were unsuitable for Indian conditions \n\nso the designers at [[Research Design and Standards Organisation|RDSO]] and CLW decided to use the following\n\n* Instead of the Bo-Bo bogies of WAM-1/2, ALCO asymmetric Trimount bogies of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] were provided for better traction and power.\n* Silicon rectifiers with speed control by three series-parallel motor combinations and weak field operation.\n* Auxiliaries from Westinghouse and Kirloskar (compressors), S F India (blowers) and Northey (exhauster)\n* Air brakes for loco and vacuum train brakes fitted as original equipment with [[Rheostatic braking]] also provided\n* MU operation made possible up to 4 units possible.\n\nProduction of these locomotives started in 1970 with #20400 and exactly 500 WAM4s were built in 13 years with #21399 \u201cAnant\u201d being the last one. Production ended on August 3,1983.\n\n== Variants ==\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. Although the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. \n\nVariants include\n\n* '''WAM4B or G:''' Freight only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4D''' or '''DB:''' Dual Braked (Air and Vacuum)\n* '''WAM4E:''' Air Brake only (for both loco and train)\n* '''WAM4H:''' Hitachi Traction Motors instead of Alstom\n* '''WAM4P:''' Passenger only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4/2S3P:''' 2 TMs in Series, 3 in Parallel\n* '''WAM4/6P:''' 6 traction motors permanently in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PE:''' Air braked, 6 TMs perm. in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PDBHS:''' 6 Traction Motors permanently in parallel, Dual Brakes, High Speed\n* '''WAM-4P D:''' Passenger only (dual brakes)\n*'''WAM-4P DB 6P''' and '''WAM-4 6P D:''' These are for superfast trains\n*'''WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P:'''  some superfasts, passengers\n\nThe 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too.\n\nThe WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''A'''C Current (A), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''4'''th generation (4). WAM4 though an indigenously produced loco was heavily inspired by French box design and naturally favoured a French TM which was the Alstom made TAO TM.A total of 500 WAM-4 were built at CLW between 1978 and 1983, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive till it's successor the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5.]]\n\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later ([[Indian locomotive class WCAM 1|WCAM-1]], [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5A]], [[Indian locomotive class WCG-2|WCG-2]], and some [[Indian locomotive class WAP-1|WAP]] models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe history of WAM-4 begins in early 1970s with the aim of addressing the shortcomings of the previous [[Indian locomotive class WAM-1|WAM-1]]/[[Indian locomotive class WAM-2/3|2]] and [[Indian Railways WAG class|WAG(1-4)]] classes and remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from IR by a target date of 1990. The WAM1s were not great successes as some of their advanced features were unsuitable for Indian conditions \n\nso the designers at [[Research Design and Standards Organisation|RDSO]] and CLW decided to use the following\n\n* Instead of the Bo-Bo bogies of WAM-1/2, ALCO asymmetric Trimount bogies of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] were provided for better traction and power.\n* Silicon rectifiers with speed control by three series-parallel motor combinations and weak field operation.\n* Auxiliaries from Westinghouse and Kirloskar (compressors), S F India (blowers) and Northey (exhauster)\n* Air brakes for loco and vacuum train brakes fitted as original equipment with [[Rheostatic braking]] also provided\n* MU operation made possible up to 4 units possible.\n\nProduction of these locomotives started in 1970 with #20400 and exactly 500 WAM4s were built in 13 years with #21399 \u201cAnant\u201d being the last one. Production ended on August 3,1983.\n\n== Variants ==\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. Although the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. \n\nVariants include\n\n* '''WAM4B or G:''' Freight only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4D''' or '''DB:''' Dual Braked (Air and Vacuum)\n* '''WAM4E:''' Air Brake only (for both loco and train)\n* '''WAM4H:''' Hitachi Traction Motors instead of Alstom\n* '''WAM4P:''' Passenger only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4/2S3P:''' 2 TMs in Series, 3 in Parallel\n* '''WAM4/6P:''' 6 traction motors permanently in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PE:''' Air braked, 6 TMs perm. in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PDBHS:''' 6 Traction Motors permanently in parallel, Dual Brakes, High Speed\n* '''WAM-4P D:''' Passenger only (dual brakes)\n*'''WAM-4P DB 6P''' and '''WAM-4 6P D:''' These are for superfast trains\n*'''WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P:'''  some superfasts, passengers\n\nThe 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too.\n\nThe WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.Now, most of these are used exclusively for passenger traffic.\n\n== Livery ==\nThis loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery\n\nMost of the WAM-4 locos now have their MU capability disabled as [[Research Design and Standards Organization|RDSO]] disapproves of these locos running MU'd over 100&nbsp;km/h.\n<ref>http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html</ref>\n\n== Named Locos<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named&page=10|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster List|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Named Locos\n!Class\n!Loco Number\n!Name\n!Loco Shed\n!Current status\n!ref\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20401 \n|   <abbr>BIA</abbr>  \n|Rajatabha  \n|Condemned [07/08/2007]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4489?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20420   \n|BZA\n|Sukh Sagar Naveen \n|Scrapped\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4508?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20615    \n| <abbr>ASN</abbr>  \n|Surubhi \n|Condemned in November 2011\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4703?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21320 \n|<abbr>AJJ</abbr>\n|Garuda \n|Plinthed at Rail Soudha, SWR HQ, Hubli [January 2020]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4908?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21380 \n|<abbr>ASN</abbr> \n|Navchetna  \n|In Inferior service\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4968?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21399  \n| <abbr>BSL</abbr> \n|Anant \n|The last WAM-4 ever built.
