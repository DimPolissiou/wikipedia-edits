The [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] airplane was so severely damaged that it was shipped back to the [[United States|USA]]. On 16 April 1934 female aviator [[Laura Ingalls (aviator)|Laura Ingalls]] landed in a single engine airplane, the [[Lockheed Air Express]] at Zanderij in the first solo flight around [[South America]] in a landplane. The [[KLM]] tri-motor [[Fokker F.XVIII]], named the ''Snip'' (Snipe), made a trans-atlantic crossing from [[Amsterdam]] via [[Paramaribo]] to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], carrying mail. The trip of 12,200&nbsp;km (more than 4,000 over water) landed 8 days after take-off from [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol]], on 22 December 1934 at [[Cura\u00e7ao International Airport|Hato Airport]]. Captain was J.J. Hongdong, co-pilot/navigator J.J. van Balkom, engineer L.D. Stolk, wireless operator S. v.d. Molen. The route was from Amsterdam via Marseille, Alicante, Casablanca, Cabo Verde, Paramaribo and Caracas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vrcurassow.com/2dvrc/sscuracao/snip.html|title=Fokker/KLM F-XVIII SNIP 1934|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> The ''SNIP'' landed at Zanderij Field on 20 December 1934 after a first trans-atlantic crossing of 3600&nbsp;km, dubbed \"the Christmas Mail-flight\", directly from Porto [[Praia]]. However, the Snip flight did not inaugurate a regular KLM trans-Atlantic service. In January 1937 [[William Henry Vanderbilt III]] landed in a baby Clipper [[Sikorsky S-38]] at Zanderij with wife and friends [[George R. Hutchinson|The Flying Hutchinsons]]. On 3 June 1937 aviation pioneer [[Amelia Earhart]] landed at Zanderij with a [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra]] at local time 2:38 P.M.

[[Suriname]] was then the world's principal source of [[bauxite]] (for [[aluminium]] production) and needed protection. The first American armed forces arrived at the airport on 30 November 1941 and expanded the facilities to be a transport base for sending [[Lend-Lease]] supplies to [[England]] via air routes across the South [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The runways were constructed by the US Corps of Engineers. They also built the road from [[Onverwacht, Suriname|Onverwacht]] to Zanderij which was completed in 1942.\n\nWith the United States entry into the war in December 1941, the importance of Zandery Field increased drastically, becoming a major transport base on the South Atlantic route of [[Air Transport Command]] ferrying supplies and personnel to [[Lungi International Airport|Freetown Airport]], [[Sierra Leone]] and onwards to the European and African theaters of the war. In addition, antisubmarine patrols were flown from the airfield over the southern Caribbean and South Atlantic coastlines.\n\nMajor [[United States Army Air Forces|United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) units assigned to the airfield were:\n* [[35th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[25th Attack Group|25th Bombardment Group]]) 1 November 1941 \u2013 7 October 1943 ([[B-25 Mitchell]])\n: Detachment operated from: [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Atkinson Field]], [[British Guiana]], 1 November 1942 \u2013 7 October 1943\n: Detachment operated from: [[Piarco International Airport|Piarco Airport]], [[Trinidad]], 27 August-12 October 1943\n* [[99th Reconnaissance Squadron|99th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[9th Bombardment Group]]), 3 December 1941 \u2013 31 October 1942 ([[Douglas B-18 Bolo|B-18 Bolo]])\n*[[22nd Fighter Squadron]] ([[36th Wing|36th Fighter Group]]), 16 September 1942 \u2013 16 February 1943 ([[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39]] Airacobras, later [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] Thunderbolts)\n*[[23rd Flying Training Squadron|23d Antisubmarine Squadron]] (Trinidad Detachment, [[Antilles Air Command]]), 15 August \u2013 December 1943 ([[A-29 Hudson]])\n\nJust before the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor attack]], on 3 December, the 99th Squadron was ordered to distant Zandery Field, [[Dutch Suriname|Dutch Guiana]] (by way of [[Piarco]] Field, Trinidad) under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, by which the [[United States]] occupied the colony to protect bauxite mines. However, to the disappointment of the crews, the squadron had to leave its [[B-17]] behind. It was, however, reinforced with additional [[Douglas B-18 Bolo|B-18A Bolos]], bringing squadron strength up to six aircraft. On 2 October 1942, a B-18A, piloted by Captain Howard Burhanna Jr. of the 99th Bomb Squadron, depth charged and sank the {{GS|U-512}} north of [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]].<ref>[http://uboat.net/boats/u512.htm \"B-18 sinks U-512.\"] ''uboat.net''. Retrieved: 17 May 2010.</ref>\n\nAt Zandery, the unit shuttled from Zandery to Atkinson Field, [[British Guiana]] and, by January 1942, had eight [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants|Curtiss P-40C Warhawks]] assigned. The P-40s were, in actuality, detached for airfield defense by the Trinidad Base Command, under which the 99th fell at the time.<ref>* {{cite web|first=William |last=Conaway |url= http://www.planesandpilotsofww2.totalh.net/panama/panama.htm |title=VI Bomber Command In Defense Of The Panama Canal 1941 - 45 |work=Planes and Pilots of World War Two}}</ref>\n\nThe intensive flying of the first two months of the war soon took its toll, however, and by the end of February 1942, the Squadron was forced to report that it had but three B-18As operational at Zandery and that \" ... none of them are airworthy at this time.\" Apparently the unit was quickly reinforced and by 1 March strength was back up to six aircraft, and seven combat crews, all of whom had more than 12 months' experience.\n\nOperations from Zandery Field consisted of coastal, convoy and anti-submarine patrols until 31 October 1942. Just prior to which time the 4th Antisubmarine Squadron was attached to the Squadron between 9 and 16 October. At this point Antisubmarine Command took over the mission of the 99th and the men and aircraft of the squadron were reassigned.\n\nIn the middle of World War II, on 2 November 1943, Her Royal Highness [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Princess Juliana]] visited Suriname from [[Canada]]. She landed at Zanderij with [[KLM]] airplane [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra]] PJ-AIM ''Meeuw'' as the first ever member of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch Royal Family]]. After the landing of the ''Meeuw'' and escorting Dutch and US military planes, the Royal Princess was welcomed by [[List of colonial governors of Suriname|governor Kielstra]] and inspected the [[guard of honour]].\n\nWith the end of World War II Zandery Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff. It was closed as a military facility on 30 April 1946. And on 22 October 1947 the Zandery Air Force Base was turned over to Dutch authorities which returned it to a civil airport. At that time the value of the facility was estimated to be 400,000 [[Surinamese guilder]]s (''S\u0192'').\n\n===Highlights in the years after the second World War===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Disembarking, Johan Pengel Airport.jpg|thumb|Passengers disembarking from a KLM airliner (foreground) at Johan Pengel Airport.

In June 1959 pilots and missionaries Robert Price and Eugene Friesen arrived at Zandery with a single engine plane during [[Operation Grasshopper]]. They performed many medical treatment work in the interior and the Sipaliwini savannah. On 3 March 1960 American president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] landed at Zanderij on board [[Air Force One]] operated by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] with a [[Boeing 707]] jetliner.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJAfjUOZiyI</ref> He was accompanied by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Christian Herter]]. They left Suriname the same day. On 14 April 1967 American president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] arrived during a rainstorm at Zanderij on board [[Air Force One]], a [[Boeing 707]] jet. Security was tight around Zanderij Airport. An agreement was signed by the Dutch government and the US to use Zanderij Airport for [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC) usage. The USA paid US$22,000 for 400 landings per year. The crews stayed overnight at the [[Torarica Hotel]]. The [[North American X-15]] [[NASA]] [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was on exhibition at Zanderij Airport for an [[Airshow]] held from 8 to 13 November 1963. On 7 April 1972, the first-ever [[Boeing 747]] wide-body jetliner to land in South America, operated by [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]], landed at Zanderij Airport, Suriname.\n\nThe airport has officially been named after the popular Surinamese politician and former [[List of Prime Ministers of Suriname|Prime Minister of Suriname]] [[Johan Adolf Pengel]], but is locally still common named [[Zanderij]]. This is parallel to the small village and savannah where it is situated. The airport now has one runway of approximately 3.5&nbsp;km<ref name=\":0\" /> and sees an average of 100,000 passengers yearly, mainly on transatlantic flights between Paramaribo and Amsterdam from [[KLM]] and [[Surinam Airways]] and some regional flights to Belem, Georgetown, Cayenne, Miami and the Caribbean, also with [[Caribbean Airlines]] and [[Insel Air]], besides Surinam Airways.\n\n===Future===\nThe state will invest an extra US$70 million in expanding and modernizing the J.A.

For the time being, the arrival lounge, commercial center and parking lot have been handed over, while the runway has been repaved, the platform for planes has been renovated, the runway lights on the arrival side have been replaced and a backup system for electricity has been installed as well. This was all done prior to the 30 August 2013 [[Union of South American Nations|UNASUR]] heads-of-state summit, hosted by Suriname. The project, which was prepared during the previous administration, is insufficient to actually turn the airport into an international hub. The departure and arrival lounges are currently apart from each other, but plans are to connect them in the future with airbridges. Lights were placed on the departure side of the runway, and the platform was expanded to accommodate more planes. The fire department barracks were moved to a more central location. Plans are to have the airbridges installed in the future, while the other matters were finished by 2017. The expansion of the airport will not only include the construction of a new terminal, but also the construction of a 2.7&nbsp;km taxiway that will run parallel to the long 3.5&nbsp;km runway. The total investment involves an amount of approximately US$205 million and approval for the loan agreement will be put forward to the National Assembly (DNA) of the Surinamese government by airport management mid-2019.<ref>http://unitednews.sr/27-kilometer-lange-taxibaan-voor-meer-en-snellere-afhandeling-vliegtuigen-jap-airport</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Caribbean Airlines]] | [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Copa Airlines]] | [[Tocumen International Airport|Panama City]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Fly All Ways]] | [[Ignacio Agramonte International Airport|Camaguey]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport|Havana]], [[Antonio Maceo Airport|Santiago de Cuba]] <br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Hato International Airport|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Toussaint Louverture International Airport|Port-au-Prince]], [[Las Americas International Airport|Santo Domingo]], [[Princess Juliana International Airport|St. Maarten]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]] | [[Val de Cans International Airport|Bel\u00e9m]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[KLM]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Surinam Airways]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]], [[Val de Cans International Airport|Bel\u00e9m]], [[Hato International Airport|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Georgetown\u2013Cheddi Jagan]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]]<br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando/Sanford]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[TUI fly Netherlands]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]\n<!-- --> \n}}\n\n===Cargo===\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Amerijet International]] | [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Georgetown\u2013Cheddi Jagan]], [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]], [[Grantley Adams International Airport|Bridgetown]], [[Robert L.

The trip of 12,200&nbsp;km (more than 4,000 over water) landed 8 days after take-off from [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol]], on 22 December 1934 at [[Cura\u00e7ao International Airport|Hato Airport]]. Captain was J.J. Hongdong, co-pilot/navigator J.J. van Balkom, engineer L.D. Stolk, wireless operator S. v.d. Molen. The route was from Amsterdam via Marseille, Alicante, Casablanca, Cabo Verde, Paramaribo and Caracas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vrcurassow.com/2dvrc/sscuracao/snip.html|title=Fokker/KLM F-XVIII SNIP 1934|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> The ''SNIP'' landed at Zanderij Field on 20 December 1934 after a first trans-atlantic crossing of 3600&nbsp;km, dubbed \"the Christmas Mail-flight\", directly from Porto [[Praia]]. However, the Snip flight did not inaugurate a regular KLM trans-Atlantic service. In January 1937 [[William Henry Vanderbilt III]] landed in a baby Clipper [[Sikorsky S-38]] at Zanderij with wife and friends [[George R. Hutchinson|The Flying Hutchinsons]]. On 3 June 1937 aviation pioneer [[Amelia Earhart]] landed at Zanderij with a [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra]] at local time 2:38 P.M. The navigator was a retired [[Pan American World Airways|PAA]] aviator [[Fred Noonan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/stichtingsurinaamsmuseum/5438457151/|title=Amelia Earhart in Suriname|work=Flickr - Photo Sharing!|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> This was on their second attempt of a \"World Flight\" en route from [[Miami]] to [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] and then transatlantic to [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acepilots.com/earhart2.html|title=Amelia Earhart|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> They stayed overnight at the Palace Hotel in Paramaribo and left Zanderij again on Friday 4 June 1937 for [[Fortaleza]], [[Brazil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://werkgroepcaraibischeletteren.nl/amelia-earhart-in-suriname/|title=Amelia Earhart in Suriname|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> One month later they [[disappeared]] over the central [[Pacific Ocean]] near [[Howland Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tripline.net/trip/Amelia_Earhart's_Circumnavigation_Attempt-6410741502631003B225FC83C9742523|title=Amelia Earhart's Circumnavigation Attempt|work=Tripline|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> On 16 March 1938 two pilots [[Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney|Whitney]] and Harmon made an emergency landing with their Beechcraft on an airstrip near the Eerste Rijweg.

[[Suriname]] was then the world's principal source of [[bauxite]] (for [[aluminium]] production) and needed protection. The first American armed forces arrived at the airport on 30 November 1941 and expanded the facilities to be a transport base for sending [[Lend-Lease]] supplies to [[England]] via air routes across the South [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The runways were constructed by the US Corps of Engineers. They also built the road from [[Onverwacht, Suriname|Onverwacht]] to Zanderij which was completed in 1942.\n\nWith the United States entry into the war in December 1941, the importance of Zandery Field increased drastically, becoming a major transport base on the South Atlantic route of [[Air Transport Command]] ferrying supplies and personnel to [[Lungi International Airport|Freetown Airport]], [[Sierra Leone]] and onwards to the European and African theaters of the war. In addition, antisubmarine patrols were flown from the airfield over the southern Caribbean and South Atlantic coastlines.\n\nMajor [[United States Army Air Forces|United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) units assigned to the airfield were:\n* [[35th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[25th Attack Group|25th Bombardment Group]]) 1 November 1941 \u2013 7 October 1943 ([[B-25 Mitchell]])\n: Detachment operated from: [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Atkinson Field]], [[British Guiana]], 1 November 1942 \u2013 7 October 1943\n: Detachment operated from: [[Piarco International Airport|Piarco Airport]], [[Trinidad]], 27 August-12 October 1943\n* [[99th Reconnaissance Squadron|99th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[9th Bombardment Group]]), 3 December 1941 \u2013 31 October 1942 ([[Douglas B-18 Bolo|B-18 Bolo]])\n*[[22nd Fighter Squadron]] ([[36th Wing|36th Fighter Group]]), 16 September 1942 \u2013 16 February 1943 ([[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39]] Airacobras, later [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] Thunderbolts)\n*[[23rd Flying Training Squadron|23d Antisubmarine Squadron]] (Trinidad Detachment, [[Antilles Air Command]]), 15 August \u2013 December 1943 ([[A-29 Hudson]])\n\nJust before the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor attack]], on 3 December, the 99th Squadron was ordered to distant Zandery Field, [[Dutch Suriname|Dutch Guiana]] (by way of [[Piarco]] Field, Trinidad) under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, by which the [[United States]] occupied the colony to protect bauxite mines. However, to the disappointment of the crews, the squadron had to leave its [[B-17]] behind. It was, however, reinforced with additional [[Douglas B-18 Bolo|B-18A Bolos]], bringing squadron strength up to six aircraft. On 2 October 1942, a B-18A, piloted by Captain Howard Burhanna Jr. of the 99th Bomb Squadron, depth charged and sank the {{GS|U-512}} north of [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]].<ref>[http://uboat.net/boats/u512.htm \"B-18 sinks U-512.\"] ''uboat.net''. Retrieved: 17 May 2010.</ref>\n\nAt Zandery, the unit shuttled from Zandery to Atkinson Field, [[British Guiana]] and, by January 1942, had eight [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants|Curtiss P-40C Warhawks]] assigned. The P-40s were, in actuality, detached for airfield defense by the Trinidad Base Command, under which the 99th fell at the time.<ref>* {{cite web|first=William |last=Conaway |url= http://www.planesandpilotsofww2.totalh.net/panama/panama.htm |title=VI Bomber Command In Defense Of The Panama Canal 1941 - 45 |work=Planes and Pilots of World War Two}}</ref>\n\nThe intensive flying of the first two months of the war soon took its toll, however, and by the end of February 1942, the Squadron was forced to report that it had but three B-18As operational at Zandery and that \" ... none of them are airworthy at this time.\" Apparently the unit was quickly reinforced and by 1 March strength was back up to six aircraft, and seven combat crews, all of whom had more than 12 months' experience.\n\nOperations from Zandery Field consisted of coastal, convoy and anti-submarine patrols until 31 October 1942. Just prior to which time the 4th Antisubmarine Squadron was attached to the Squadron between 9 and 16 October. At this point Antisubmarine Command took over the mission of the 99th and the men and aircraft of the squadron were reassigned.\n\nIn the middle of World War II, on 2 November 1943, Her Royal Highness [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Princess Juliana]] visited Suriname from [[Canada]]. She landed at Zanderij with [[KLM]] airplane [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra]] PJ-AIM ''Meeuw'' as the first ever member of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch Royal Family]]. After the landing of the ''Meeuw'' and escorting Dutch and US military planes, the Royal Princess was welcomed by [[List of colonial governors of Suriname|governor Kielstra]] and inspected the [[guard of honour]].\n\nWith the end of World War II Zandery Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff. It was closed as a military facility on 30 April 1946. And on 22 October 1947 the Zandery Air Force Base was turned over to Dutch authorities which returned it to a civil airport. At that time the value of the facility was estimated to be 400,000 [[Surinamese guilder]]s (''S\u0192'').\n\n===Highlights in the years after the second World War===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Disembarking, Johan Pengel Airport.jpg|thumb|Passengers disembarking from a KLM airliner (foreground) at Johan Pengel Airport.

He had traveled from the aircraft factory [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in the United States. In June 1959 pilots and missionaries Robert Price and Eugene Friesen arrived at Zandery with a single engine plane. They performed many medical treatment work in the interior and the Sipaliwini savannah. On 3 March 1960 American president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] landed at Zanderij on board [[Air Force One]] operated by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] with a [[Boeing 707]] jetliner. He was accompanied by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Christian Herter]]. They left Suriname the same day. On 14 April 1967 American president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] arrived during a rainstorm at Zanderij on board [[Air Force One]], a [[Boeing 707]] jet. Security was tight around Zanderij Airport. An agreement was signed by the Dutch government and the US to use Zanderij Airport for [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC) usage. The USA paid US$22,000 for 400 landings per year. The crews stayed overnight at the [[Torarica Hotel]]. The [[North American X-15]] [[NASA]] [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was on exhibition at Zanderij Airport for an [[Airshow]] held from 8 to 13 November 1963. On 7 April 1972, the first-ever [[Boeing 747]] wide-body jetliner to land in South America, operated by [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]], landed at Zanderij Airport, Suriname.\n\nThe airport has officially been named after the popular Surinamese politician and former [[List of Prime Ministers of Suriname|Prime Minister of Suriname]] [[Johan Adolf Pengel]], but is locally still common named [[Zanderij]]. This is parallel to the small village and savannah where it is situated. The airport now has one runway of approximately 3.5&nbsp;km<ref name=\":0\" /> and sees an average of 100,000 passengers yearly, mainly on transatlantic flights between Paramaribo and Amsterdam from [[KLM]] and [[Surinam Airways]] and some regional flights to Belem, Georgetown, Cayenne, Miami and the Caribbean, also with [[Caribbean Airlines]] and [[Insel Air]], besides Surinam Airways.\n\n===Future===\nThe state will invest an extra US$70 million in expanding and modernizing the J.A.

For the time being, the arrival lounge, commercial center and parking lot have been handed over, while the runway has been repaved, the platform for planes has been renovated, the runway lights on the arrival side have been replaced and a backup system for electricity has been installed as well. This was all done prior to the 30 August 2013 [[Union of South American Nations|UNASUR]] heads-of-state summit, hosted by Suriname. The project, which was prepared during the previous administration, is insufficient to actually turn the airport into an international hub. The departure and arrival lounges are currently apart from each other, but plans are to connect them in the future with airbridges. Lights were placed on the departure side of the runway, and the platform was expanded to accommodate more planes. The fire department barracks were moved to a more central location. Plans are to have the airbridges installed in the future, while the other matters were finished by 2017. The expansion of the airport will not only include the construction of a new terminal, but also the construction of a 2.7&nbsp;km taxiway that will run parallel to the long 3.5&nbsp;km runway. The total investment involves an amount of approximately US$205 million and approval for the loan agreement will be put forward to the National Assembly (DNA) of the Surinamese government by airport management mid-2019.<ref>http://unitednews.sr/27-kilometer-lange-taxibaan-voor-meer-en-snellere-afhandeling-vliegtuigen-jap-airport</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Caribbean Airlines]] | [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Copa Airlines]] | [[Tocumen International Airport|Panama City]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Fly All Ways]] | [[Ignacio Agramonte International Airport|Camaguey]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport|Havana]], [[Antonio Maceo Airport|Santiago de Cuba]] <br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Hato International Airport|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Toussaint Louverture International Airport|Port-au-Prince]], [[Las Americas International Airport|Santo Domingo]], [[Princess Juliana International Airport|St. Maarten]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]] | [[Val de Cans International Airport|Bel\u00e9m]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[KLM]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Surinam Airways]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]], [[Val de Cans International Airport|Bel\u00e9m]], [[Hato International Airport|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Georgetown\u2013Cheddi Jagan]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]]<br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando/Sanford]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[TUI fly Netherlands]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]\n<!-- --> \n}}\n\n===Cargo===\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Amerijet International]] | [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Georgetown\u2013Cheddi Jagan]], [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]], [[Grantley Adams International Airport|Bridgetown]], [[Robert L.

Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the Union's District of West Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', pp. 856\u201357; McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512.</ref> In April 1862, Grant's troops survived a severe test in the bloody [[Battle of Shiloh]]. Then, during six months marked by discouragement and anxiety for Grant, his army first joined with two other Union armies to prosecute the relatively bloodless [[Siege of Corinth]] and then strained to hold Union positions in Tennessee and Mississippi. In October 1862, Grant's command was reconfigured and elevated to departmental status, as the Department of the Tennessee; the title of his command was thus officially aligned with that of his army.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref> Grant commanded these forces until after his critically important victory at [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] on July 4, 1863. Under other generals, starting with [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], the army marched and fought from the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], through the [[Siege of Knoxville|Relief of Knoxville]], the [[Battle of Meridian|Meridian Campaign]], the [[Atlanta Campaign]], the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]], the [[Carolinas Campaign]], and to the end of the war and disbandment. This article also discusses Grant's 1861\u20131862 commands \u2013 the District of Southeast Missouri and the District of Cairo \u2013 because the troops Grant led in the [[Battle of Belmont]] and the [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]]-[[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] campaign during that period became the nucleus of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref>\n\nA 2005 study of the army states that it \"was present at most of the great battles that became turning points of the war\u2014Fort Donelson, Vicksburg, and Atlanta\" and \"won the decisive battles in the decisive theater of the war.\"<ref name=\"Woodworth, Victory, p. ix\">Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. ix.</ref> More poetically, in 1867, apparently speaking of the Atlanta campaign, General Sherman said that the Army of the Tennessee was \"never checked\u2014always victorious; so rapid in motion\u2014so eager to strike; it deserved its name of the 'Whip-lash,' swung from one flank to the other, as danger called, night or day, sunshine or storm.\"<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/11/17/80252662.pdf NYT: General Sherman's November 13, 1867 Address to the Society of the Army of the Tennessee]; see Lewis, ''Sherman'', p. 381.</ref>\n\n==History==you are gay\nHistory remembers the Army of the Tennessee as one of the most important Union armies during the Civil War, an army intimately associated with the Union's two most celebrated generals, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. ix; Flood, ''Friendship'', pp. 4\u20136.</ref> It is thus rather ironic that frequent military reorganizations and looseness of usage during the war itself make it difficult to pinpoint the exact date at which this army formally came into existence. It should suffice to note that the \"nucleus [of troops] around which was to gather the... Army of the Tennessee\" first took shape in 1861\u20131862, while Grant was headquartered at [[Cairo, Illinois]].<ref>Rawlins, Address, pp. 27\u201328.</ref> Those troops continued under Grant in his next command, the distinct District of West Tennessee; they were then sometimes, and perhaps most appropriately, called the \"Army of West Tennessee.\"<ref>That usage appears, for example, in reports filed by various Union officers after the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh (''Official Records'' (''OR'') I, v. 10/1, pp. 165, 203, 240, 277, 280, 282, 284, 286\u201387) and can be found as late as October 1862 (Report of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Davies, October 18, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 17/1, p. 251). During the period September 28 \u2013 December 9, 1862, there was also a Confederate Army of West Tennessee, organized from the Confederate [[Army of the West (1862)|Army of the West]] and commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]]. Confederate authorities ruled that \"the name and function of this army [were] improper,\" and Van Dorn's forces were merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]]. See Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 892.</ref> However, army correspondence began using the term \"Army of the Tennessee\" in March 1862; that term soon became commonplace and naturally lived on when Grant's command was elevated to departmental status in October 1862, as the Department of the Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 857; see Halleck to Pope, March 21, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 8, p. 629 (\"I am preparing additional re-enforcements for the Army of the Tennessee\"); Phisterer, ''Statistical Record'', p. 54 (Grant's forces fought at Shiloh (April 1862) as \"the Army of the District of Western Tennessee\" and \"became the Army of the Tennessee upon the [post-Shiloh] concentration of troops at Pittsburg Landing\"); McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref> During the course of the war, elements of the Army of the Tennessee performed many tasks, and the army evolved with the addition and subtraction of many units. It is not feasible to chronicle every such development here, even at the [[corps]] level. Rather, this article traces the main thrust of the army's development and its most memorable activities. At any given time, substantial numbers of troops were engaged in activities not discussed here.

Paducah promptly became a separate Union command under Brig. Gen. [[Charles Ferguson Smith|Charles F.

Jeff Thompson]].<ref>Rawlins, Address, p. 27; Conger, ''U.S. Grant'', pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Grant's own first engagement came on November 7 at Belmont, Missouri, a Mississippi River landing opposite Columbus, Kentucky. Grant, accompanied by Brig. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], moved a force of approximately 3,000 to Belmont by water, cut his way into the Confederate camps there, and then had to fight his way back out to regain his transports. Grant's casualties in this first battle totaled about 500; Confederate casualties were similar. While Grant had suffered a repulse, he won favorable press coverage.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 124\u201332.</ref> This battle, reports Rawlins, \"confirmed General Grant in his views\" that he should \"give battle\" whenever \"he had what he thought a sufficient number of men.\"<ref>Rawlins, Address, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> Also in November, John Fremont lost his command at St. Louis, to be replaced by Maj.

At this time, the geographical limits of his district were \"not defined.\"  See General Orders No. 1, HQ, Dist. of West Tennessee, February 17, 1862, ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', 4:230.</ref> Over the next several months, Grant twice was in danger of losing his command, a development that doubtless would have changed the future course and character of the army and perhaps deprived it at this early stage of one source of its future success\u2014continuity of leadership.<ref>The leadership of the Army of the Tennessee was notably more stable than that of the Union's [[Army of the Potomac]]. The latter suffered the relief of several failed commanders: [[Irwin McDowell|McDowell]] (predecessor force), [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]], [[Ambrose E. Burnside|Burnside]], and [[Joseph Hooker|Hooker]]. There was no equally destabilizing event in the life of the Army of the Tennessee, although Grant could have fallen by the wayside in 1862 and some dislocation followed the death of [[James B. McPherson]] in 1864. Further, as Grant and Sherman in turn ascended to broader responsibilities, the Army of the Tennessee enjoyed virtually seamless transitions from Grant to Sherman (1863) and from Sherman to McPherson (1864). See Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 216, 420, 460, 490, 569\u201371; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 232\u201333.</ref>\n\nIn early March, Grant's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], then in command of the Department of the Missouri, assigned Grant to lead an expedition up the Tennessee River from the recently captured Fort Henry. On March 4, however, Halleck ordered Grant to give field command of the expedition to C.F. Smith; this order has been variously attributed to professional jealousy and to Halleck's lacking confidence in Grant due to certain administrative difficulties.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 219\u201320; Ballard, ''Grant'', pp. 40\u201343; Engle, ''Heartland'', pp. 105\u201306; Marszalek, ''Halleck'', pp. 116\u201320; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 128\u201332.</ref> Smith initially established the expedition at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], a town on the east side of the river approximately 100 river miles (160&nbsp;km) south of Fort Henry. He soon began staging troops at a point\u2014[[Pittsburg Landing]]\u2014nine miles (14&nbsp;km) further south and across the river.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 179\u201380.</ref> Meanwhile, Halleck's command was enlarged and renamed the [[Department of the Mississippi]], and Halleck restored Grant to field command, perhaps because of personal intervention by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Many authors see presidential pressure behind Grant's reinstatement to field command. See, e.g., Simpson, ''Triumph'', pp. 124\u201325; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 141\u201342. But there is room to question that conclusion. Halleck relieved Grant of field command of the expedition, but not his overall command, on March 4 (''OR'' I, v. 10/2, p. 3). On March 9 and 10, Halleck advised Grant to prepare himself to take the field. On March 10, the President and Secretary of War inquired about Grant's status, and on March 13, Halleck directed Grant to take the field. See Halleck to Grant, March 9, 10, 13, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 10/2, pp. 22, 27, 32; Thomas to Halleck, March 10, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 7, p. 683. This sequence suggests that Halleck may have decided to restore Grant to field command before receiving Lincoln's inquiry. See Smith, ''Grant'', p. 176: Halleck's \"reinstatement of Grant preceded by one day the bombshell that landed on his desk from the adjutant general [on behalf of the President and Secretary of War] in Washington.\"</ref> Grant joined his army in the field on March 17.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 179.</ref> By early April, Grant's army had grown to a total of roughly 50,000 men, organized into six divisions.<ref>Daniel, ''Shiloh'', p. 322.</ref> The three new divisions were commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Stephen A. Hurlbut]] (4th Division), Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman (5th), and Brig. Gen. [[Benjamin M. Prentiss]] (6th). In addition, Brig. Gen. [[W.H.L. Wallace]] took command of Smith's 2nd Division due to the latter's having suffered a debilitating leg injury.<ref>See Daniel, ''Shiloh'', p. 322; Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 226\u201327.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Shiloh - History of Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|300px|Shiloh: Crucible of the Army of the Tennessee]]\nOn April 6\u20137, Grant's forces fought the bloodiest battle of the Civil War to that time, the [[Battle of Shiloh]], when Confederate forces advanced largely undetected from [[Corinth, Mississippi]], and attacked the five Union divisions staged at Pittsburg Landing. On the first day of the battle, the surprised and unentrenched army fought desperately and suffered many casualties. However, long-expected elements of the [[Army of the Ohio]], under Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]], arrived to reinforce Grant late that day, with many more troops arriving overnight and the following day. Grant was also bolstered by the evening arrival of his own 3rd Division; Lew Wallace and his troops had been slow arriving at Pittsburg Landing from their separate position at Crump's Landing. Substantially reinforced by Buell and Wallace, Grant counterattacked the Confederate forces on April 7 and drove them from the field and back toward Corinth.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 187\u2013204.</ref>  \"Grant's victory at Shiloh,\" one historian has written, \"bloody and bitter though it was, doomed the Confederate cause in the Mississippi valley.\"<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 204.</ref> In the near term, however, the battle resulted in much criticism against Grant for lack of preparedness, swift promotion to major general of volunteers for Sherman, capture for Prentiss, a fatal wound for W.H.L. Wallace, and Grant's loss of confidence in Lew Wallace. In addition, C.F. Smith died later in April from complications due to his non-combat leg injury.<ref>For the varying impact of Shiloh on these officers, see Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 183\u201384, 198\u201399, 201; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 182; Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 493.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Shiloh came the second threat to Grant's leadership, as well as a preview of the multi-army operations that would feature prominently in the future of the Army of the Tennessee. Pursuant to previous plans, Grant's departmental superior, General Halleck, arrived at Pittsburg Landing to take command in the field. Intending to move against the Confederate forces concentrating at the rail hub at Corinth, Halleck proceeded to gather and organize what was in effect an army group of over 100,000 men.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 205\u201306; Ambrose, ''Halleck'', pp. 43\u201349.</ref> His force included Grant's Army of the Tennessee, Buell's Army of the Ohio, and Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s [[Army of the Mississippi]]. On April 30, Halleck divided this force into three corps (or \"wings\") and a reserve. The left wing was commanded by Pope, the center by Buell, the right wing by Maj. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]], and the reserve by John McClernand. Grant's 1st and 3rd Divisions constituted the reserve; the right wing contained Grant's 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions and Thomas's division from the Army of the Ohio. In other words, Halleck had drawn Thomas from division command in the Army of the Ohio and assigned to him, as commander of the right wing, most of Grant's troops.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 248; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 206.</ref>\n\nHalleck assigned Grant to be second-in-command of the entire 100,000-man force, but also expressly confirmed Grant in command of the \"Army Corps of the Tennessee\" (the right wing and the reserve).<ref>See Special Field Orders, No. 35, HQ, Dept. of the Mississippi, April 30, 1862, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0011%2F&tif=00146.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0011 ''OR'' I, v. 10/2, p. 144].</ref> It is unclear exactly why Halleck took these actions affecting Grant.<ref>See Nicolay, ''Lincoln'', 5:338.</ref> However, Grant was under severe public criticism about Shiloh at the time and soon complained that his second-in-command position constituted a \"sensure\" and was akin to an arrest; among his complaints was the fact that Halleck gave orders directly to Thomas and division commanders nominally subordinate to Grant.<ref>On May 11, Grant wrote Halleck privately that he considered his second-in-command assignment to be \"anomylous,\" to constitute a \"sensure,\" and to put him in a position that \"differs but little from that of one in arrest.\" ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', 5:114; see Smith, ''Grant'', p. 209.</ref> With this awkward command structure, embarrassing to Grant, Halleck's forces took the entire month of May, with constant entrenchments, to advance the twenty miles [32&nbsp;km] to Corinth. This Siege of Corinth culminated with the Confederate forces abandoning the town on the night of May 29\u201330.<ref>Marszalek, ''Halleck'', pp. 123\u201326.</ref> Grant later suggested that Halleck failed to accomplish all that he should have in this campaign and its aftermath.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 255\u201357.</ref> However, William Tecumseh Sherman, commanding a division in Thomas's right wing, considered the campaign to be an important period of training for Halleck's forces, including the Army of the Tennessee: \"[I]t served for the instruction of our men in guard and picket duty, and in habituating them to out-door life; and by the time we had reached Corinth I believe that army was the best then on this continent.\"<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 274.</ref>\n\nAfter Corinth was taken, Grant might have left his command in frustration, but Sherman intervened and encouraged him to remain.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 207\u201312; Schenker, \"Ulysses in His Tent,\" passim; Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 258; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 275\u201376.</ref> Grant's experiences during this period have been cited as one reason for his subsequent warm relations with Sherman and his cooler relations with George Thomas.<ref>Daniel, ''Shiloh'', pp. 309\u201310; Einolf, ''Thomas'', pp. 126\u201327.</ref> In turn, the trust between Grant and Sherman contributed importantly to the future effectiveness of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 420.</ref> More immediately, however, Halleck soon rescinded the multi-corps organization adopted for the Corinth campaign and began to disperse his large force. On June 10, Halleck restored Grant to straightforward command of the \"Army of the Tennessee\"; Buell was dispatched toward [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]; and, by incremental stages, George Thomas and his division were detached from the Army of the Tennessee and returned to service with Buell's army.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 213\u201314; Einolf, ''Thomas'', pp. 128\u201329; Special Field Orders, No. 90, HQ, Dept. of the Mississippi, June 10, 1862, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0011&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0011%2F&tif=00146.TIF&pagenum=288 ''OR'' I, v. 10/2, p. 288]; Halleck to Buell, June 22, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 16/2, pp. 48\u201349 (\"General Thomas has orders to report to you, but at present his division should not be moved beyond Tuscumbia [Alabama]\"); Halleck to Buell, July 15, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 16/2, p. 151 (\"Thomas ...

Sherman, intended to be operating against Vicksburg down the [[Mississippi River]] in concert with Grant's abandoned thrust, then suffered a repulse in the [[Battle of Chickasaw Bayou]].<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 221\u201325; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 203\u201308.</ref> Meanwhile, initially unbeknownst to Grant, his senior subordinate, John McClernand, had used his political influence with Abraham Lincoln to obtain authority for an expedition of his own against Vicksburg.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 222\u201323; Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 372.</ref> This development, which one historian has characterized as \"one of the more bizarre episodes of the Civil War,\" set McClernand up as a potential competitor to Grant, but also benefited the Army of the Tennessee in the long run because McClernand raised new troops in the Midwest to further his own purposes.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 222.</ref> In January 1863, shortly after Chickasaw Bayou, McClernand asserted control over the 30,000 men then under Sherman and redesignated those troops as the [[Army of the Mississippi]]; that force, under McClernand and Sherman, succeeded in capturing [[Battle of Fort Hindman|Fort Hindman]] on the [[Arkansas River]].<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 227; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 205; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 316\u201325.</ref> Grant considered this objective to constitute \"a wild-goose chase,\" and General-in-Chief Halleck authorized him to assume control over all Vicksburg operations. Hence, McClernand's briefly independent force was reincorporated into the Army of the Tennessee, and McClernand's further participation in the Vicksburg campaign was as XIII Corps commander under Grant.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 227\u201328.</ref>\n\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignAprilJuly63.png|thumb|400px|Grant's Operations against Vicksburg]]\nIn the early months of 1863, Grant pursued various futile operations seeking to capture Vicksburg from the north, causing one newspaper to complain that the \"army was being ruined in mud-turtle expeditions, under the leadership of a drunkard [Grant], whose confidential adviser [Sherman] was a lunatic.\"<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 228\u201334; Reid, ''Ohio'', 1:385.</ref> However, in April Grant proceeded to establish his troops well south of Vicksburg by marching them down the west side of the Mississippi and crossing it with the aid of the Navy. Working well with the [[Western Flotilla]] under Acting Rear Admiral [[David Dixon Porter|David D.

After capturing and briefly occupying [[Jackson, Mississippi]], on May 14, and winning the [[Battle of Champion Hill]] on May 16, Grant failed in initial assaults against the Confederate entrenchments at Vicksburg on May 19 and 22 and then settled in for siege operations rather than incur additional casualties.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 626\u201333; Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 234\u201353.</ref>\n\nDuring the siege, the army received significant reinforcements, from within and without the Department of the Tennessee, bringing Grant's total strength at Vicksburg above 70,000 soldiers out of a reported July 1863 total strength for the department of approximately 175,000.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 367; Departmental returns for July 1863, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0038%2F&tif=00569.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0038&coll=moa&frames=1&view=50 ''OR'' I, v. 24/3, pp. 567\u201368].

Sherman, Grant placed him in charge of a force drawn from the IX, XIII, XV, and XVII Corps to shield the siege operations against potential attack from the east by Joe Johnston's relief force. After Vicksburg fell, Sherman commanded a sizable Expeditionary Army (IX, XIII, and XV Corps) to drive Johnston beyond Jackson and then fell back toward Vicksburg. Maj. Gen. [[Frederick Steele]] led Sherman's XV Corps in this operation, which effectively concluded the roles of both the [[IX Corps (ACW)|IX Corps]] and [[XIII Corps (ACW)|XIII Corps]] in the Department of the Tennessee.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 227\u201330; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 158\u201362; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 354\u201357; Martin, ''Vicksburg'', pp. 205\u201306.</ref>\n\nGrant's capture of Vicksburg, achieved largely by long-established elements of the Army of the Tennessee, was one of the most important Union victories of the war.

Soon Grant would move on to expanded responsibilities, leaving the Army of the Tennessee in Sherman's hands. And the army itself would shift its operations eastward, closing the 1861\u20131863 chapter of riverine operations on the Cumberland, the Tennessee, and the Mississippi and beginning a series of epic marches.

To set the stage: In late September 1863, Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s [[Confederate Army of Tennessee|Army of Tennessee]] defeated William Rosecrans's [[Army of the Cumberland]] in the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]; Rosecrans retreated to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], and was besieged there by Bragg. To address this crisis, Washington elevated Grant, the celebrated victor of Vicksburg, to command of the newly created and geographically broad [[Military Division of the Mississippi]] and ordered him to travel to Chattanooga, assume command of all forces there, and defeat Bragg. The War Department gave Grant his choice between continuing Rosecrans as commander of the Army of the Cumberland or elevating corps commander George Thomas to head that army; Grant chose Thomas.<ref>See Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 262\u201366; Simpson, ''Triumph'', pp. 225\u201329; Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 403\u201304.</ref> Grant's forces at Chattanooga eventually included elements of three armies: 35,000 men from the Army of the Cumberland under Thomas; 20,000 men sent west from the Army of the Potomac under Maj.

He assigned Sherman to assault the right flank of Bragg's army, at the north end of [[Missionary Ridge]], with three of his four divisions and other troops; this attack was intended to play the major role for the Union. However, in the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]] on November 25, Sherman's attack gained no traction, and it fell to Thomas's Army of the Cumberland to break the Confederate line by assaulting directly up the middle of Missionary Ridge. On this occasion, then, the Army of the Tennessee ended up playing second fiddle to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>See McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 677\u201381; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 462\u201378; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 389\u201390.</ref>\n\nImmediately after Chattanooga, Grant ordered Sherman to take command of a mixed force, including part of the XV Corps, and proceed to break the siege that other Confederate forces had mounted against [[Ambrose Burnside]]'s command at [[Knoxville Campaign|Knoxville, Tennessee]].

This force, led by Sherman himself, consisted of two divisions from McPherson's corps and two from Hurlbut's corps. In February, after concentrating at Vicksburg, the force made a largely unopposed round-trip march of approximately {{convert|330|mi|km}} from Vicksburg to Meridian, Missisissippi, and back, in two columns.

In the West, Sherman succeeded Grant in command of the Military Division of the Mississippi. Command of the Army of the Tennessee now passed to the XVII Corps commander, Maj. Gen. James B.

As Sherman began his move southward, Johnston was entrenched at [[Dalton, Georgia]]. Hoping to threaten Johnston's rear from [[Resaca, Georgia|Resaca]], Sherman sent McPherson, on the Union right, to the west of Rocky Face Ridge and through the \"unoccupied, unguarded, unobstructed, and unobserved\" Snake Creek Gap to Resaca. McPherson did reach Johnston's rear, but assumed a defensive position there, rather than carrying through Sherman's plan to cut Johnston's railroad link to the south.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 54\u201366; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 505.</ref> After the rest of Sherman's forces moved up, the first significant battle of the campaign occurred at Resaca (May 13\u201315). While a much more decisive outcome might have been achieved, Sherman had to be satisfied with Johnston's falling back toward Adairsville.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 67\u201377.</ref>\n\nResaca set the tone for the first phase of the campaign, as Sherman's armies attempted to maneuver around Johnston, and Johnston continually fell back toward Atlanta.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 506\u201328; McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 72\u2013140.</ref> On June 27, Sherman departed from character and attempted a direct assault on Johnston's position at [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]].

McPherson himself was killed, and command temporarily passed to Maj. Gen. Logan, his senior corps commander.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 152\u201355.</ref> The July 22 battle, writes one historian, was \"the climax of the Army of the Tennessee's wartime career,\" as 27,000 men \"defeated the attacks of nearly 40,000 Confederates who had the advantages of surprise and position.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 568.</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding Logan's battlefield success that day, Sherman chose West Pointer Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]], imported from a corps command in Thomas's army, to become the new commander of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 570.</ref> Thereafter, Sherman refocused his efforts west of Atlanta, now swinging the Army of the Tennessee around to his right flank. This led to the [[Battle of Ezra Church]] on July 28, where Howard repulsed Hood's third attack in nine days \"with ease.\"<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 155\u201357.</ref> However, Sherman also suffered setbacks in cavalry operations at this juncture, and for a month his campaign became more static. He finally broke the impasse in late August, essentially abandoning his positions north and east of Atlanta, and wheeling the Army of the Tennessee well south of Atlanta to attack Hood's last rail communications. On August 31, Howard's army repulsed a final Confederate attack in the first day of the [[Battle of Jonesborough]] (August 31 and September 1). With all his rail communications finally severed, Hood evacuated Atlanta during the night of September 1\u20132.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 158\u201376.</ref> Sherman's capture of Atlanta, facilitated by the prowess of the Army of the Tennessee, \"was one of the great epochs of the war, on a level with the seizure of Vicksburg\" and contributed importantly to the November reelection of Abraham Lincoln.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 583.</ref> Sherman later estimated that the XV Corps had \"traversed in maneuvering\" approximately {{convert|178|mi|km}} during this campaign.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 872.

After losing Atlanta in early September, Confederate General Hood regrouped and then sought with some success to lure Sherman back northward by attacking his communications and threatening Tennessee; Sherman estimated that his own regression toward Chattanooga and subsequent return to Atlanta involved {{convert|270|mi|km}} of marching by the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Bailey, ''Chessboard'', pp. 26\u201347; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 288\u201393; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 872.</ref> During this period (September\u2013October), Sherman made many adjustments to his forces. One involved dividing Grenville Dodge's XVI Corps troops between the XV and XVII Corps; this ended the role of the XVI Corps with the main Army of the Tennessee.<ref>See Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 620; [http://www.civilwararchive.com/CORPS/16thcorp.htm Civil War Archives, XVI Corps History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184614/http://www.civilwararchive.com/CORPS/16thcorp.htm|date=2013-10-29}}. Dodge himself had been wounded in August and was replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Thomas E.G. Ransom]]. See Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 578.</ref>\n\nUltimately, Sherman received approval from his superiors to detach other forces under George Thomas and John Schofield to defend Tennessee, cut loose from his lines of communication back to Chattanooga, and march southeast to the sea with approximately 60,000 men.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 293\u201397; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 649\u201350.</ref> In November and December, then, the Army of the Tennessee constituted the right wing during the march of {{convert|280|mi|km}} to the sea; Howard's command at this stage consisted of the XV Corps (now under Maj. Gen. [[Peter J. Osterhaus]] in place of Logan) and the XVII Corps (Blair). Sherman's other column, designated the [[Army of Georgia]], was drawn from the Army of the Cumberland; its commander was Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Slocum]].<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 646, 872; Marszalek, ''Sherman's March'', pp. 37, 134\u201344 (detailed order of battle).</ref>\n\nSherman himself characterized his march to the sea as a largely unopposed \"'shift of base,' as the transfer of a strong army, which had no opponent, and had finished its then work, from the interior to a point on the sea-coast, from which it could achieve other important results.\"<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 697.</ref> As is well known, during the march, his troops lived off the land and demoralized the South by extensive destruction of property.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 297\u2013316.</ref> (On the eve of the march, one soldier wrote that \"[w]e understand... that Sherman intends to use us to Christianize this country.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 587.</ref>) In the final stage of the march, Sherman called upon his old Shiloh division, now in the Army of the Tennessee's XV Corps and under the command of Brig. Gen. [[William B. Hazen]], to subdue [[Second Battle of Fort McAllister|Fort McAllister]], outside [[Savannah, Georgia]].<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 306\u201307; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 603.</ref> On December 21, the march culminated with the capture of Savannah. The Army of the Tennessee and the Army of Georgia thereby allowed Sherman to present Savannah to Lincoln as a \"Christmas-gift ... with one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, also about twenty-five thousand bales of cotton.\"<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 307\u201309; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 711.</ref> Despite Sherman's deprecation of the operational significance of the March to the Sea, it \"was one of the major events of the Civil War\"; Sherman's virtually unopposed movement through Georgia showed that the Confederacy's \"days were numbered\" and demoralized the Confederate army in Virginia under [[Robert E. Lee]].<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 315.</ref>\n\n===Carolinas Campaign===\n{{See also|Bentonville Union order of battle}}\n[[File:Carolinas Campaign.png|thumb|250px|Sherman's Carolinas Campaign]]\nOn February 1, 1865, after a month in Savannah, Sherman resumed in force his destructive march, now northward into the Carolinas, with the ultimate objective of concentrating with Grant's forces in Virginia.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 607\u201309; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 749.</ref> Howard's Army of the Tennessee again constituted the right wing of a two-column advance, with John Logan now resuming command of the XV Corps and the XVII Corps continuing under Blair. The other column was again composed of Slocum's Army of Georgia.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 749\u201350; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 318.</ref> Resistance was scarce in South Carolina, and Sherman's troops worked much destruction on the cradle of secession.  (As Sherman exited the state in early March, one soldier observed that South Carolina \"has her 'rights' now.\")<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 317\u201327; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 627.</ref> Confederate opposition intensified in North Carolina, led by Sherman's erstwhile foe, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston. At Sherman's final significant battle, [[Battle of Bentonville|Bentonville]] in mid March, most of the fighting fell to Slocum's forces. Thereafter, Johnston slipped away to the northwest, and Sherman rendezvoused near [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]] with forces Grant had ordered east from Tennessee under John Schofield.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 327\u201331; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 785\u201388; Report of Lt.

Sherman entered Raleigh on April 13, and Johnston promptly opened what became prolonged and politically sensitive surrender discussions. On April 26, at Durham Station, Johnston finally surrendered to Sherman all of the Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 831\u201352; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 339\u201349; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 303\u201308; Eicher, ''Commands'', pp. 323, 875, 881\u201382; Johnston, ''Narrative'', pp. 412\u201317.</ref> The Army of the Tennessee and the Army of Georgia then marched some {{convert|250|mi|km}} to [[Washington, D.C.]] and on May 24 participated there with Sherman in the [[Grand Review]].<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 856, 864\u201369, 872; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 312\u201320.</ref>\n\nTo salve the injury he had inflicted in bypassing John A. Logan for Oliver Howard after McPherson's death, Sherman arranged in May for Logan to become the final commander of the Army of the Tennessee. Thus, while Howard rode with Sherman, Logan led the army in the Grand Review.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 351; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 317\u201318; Howard, ''Autobiography'', 2:210\u201312.</ref> On July 13, Logan issued a farewell address to the Army of the Tennessee: \"Four years have you struggled in the bloodiest and most destructive war that ever drenched the earth with human gore; step by step you have borne our standard, until to-day, over every fortress and arsenal that rebellion wrenched from us, and over city, town, and hamlet, from the Lakes to the Gulf, and from ocean to ocean, proudly floats the 'Starry emblem' of our national unity and strength.\"<ref>Dawson, ''Logan'', p. 100.</ref>  Taps sounded for the Army of the Tennessee on August 1, 1865.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 856.</ref>\n\n===Society===\nThe preliminary meeting for the formation of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee was held in the senate chamber at the state capitol in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], on April 14, 1865. Membership in the Society was restricted to officers who had served with the Army of the Tennessee. The Society erected in [[Washington, D.C.]], at a cost of $50,000, a bronze statue of Major General John A. Rawlins, and also placed a memorial, costing $23,000, over the grave of Major General James B. McPherson, at [[Clyde, Ohio]].

Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the Union's District of West Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', pp. 856\u201357; McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512.</ref> In April 1862, Grant's troops survived a severe test in the bloody [[Battle of Shiloh]]. Then, during six months marked by discouragement and anxiety for Grant, his army first joined with two other Union armies to prosecute the relatively bloodless [[Siege of Corinth]] and then strained to hold Union positions in Tennessee and Mississippi. In October 1862, Grant's command was reconfigured and elevated to departmental status, as the Department of the Tennessee; the title of his command was thus officially aligned with that of his army.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref> Grant commanded these forces until after his critically important victory at [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] on July 4, 1863. Under other generals, starting with [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], the army marched and fought from the [[Chattanooga Campaign]], through the [[Siege of Knoxville|Relief of Knoxville]], the [[Battle of Meridian|Meridian Campaign]], the [[Atlanta Campaign]], the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]], the [[Carolinas Campaign]], and to the end of the war and disbandment. This article also discusses Grant's 1861\u20131862 commands \u2013 the District of Southeast Missouri and the District of Cairo \u2013 because the troops Grant led in the [[Battle of Belmont]] and the [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]]-[[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] campaign during that period became the nucleus of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref>\n\nA 2005 study of the army states that it \"was present at most of the great battles that became turning points of the war\u2014Fort Donelson, Vicksburg, and Atlanta\" and \"won the decisive battles in the decisive theater of the war.\"<ref name=\"Woodworth, Victory, p. ix\">Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. ix.</ref> More poetically, in 1867, apparently speaking of the Atlanta campaign, General Sherman said that the Army of the Tennessee was \"never checked\u2014always victorious; so rapid in motion\u2014so eager to strike; it deserved its name of the 'Whip-lash,' swung from one flank to the other, as danger called, night or day, sunshine or storm.\"<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1867/11/17/80252662.pdf NYT: General Sherman's November 13, 1867 Address to the Society of the Army of the Tennessee]; see Lewis, ''Sherman'', p. 381.</ref>\n\n==History==\nHistory remembers the Army of the Tennessee as one of the most important Union armies during the Civil War, an army intimately associated with the Union's two most celebrated generals, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. ix; Flood, ''Friendship'', pp. 4\u20136.</ref> It is thus rather ironic that frequent military reorganizations and looseness of usage during the war itself make it difficult to pinpoint the exact date at which this army formally came into existence. It should suffice to note that the \"nucleus [of troops] around which was to gather the... Army of the Tennessee\" first took shape in 1861\u20131862, while Grant was headquartered at [[Cairo, Illinois]].<ref>Rawlins, Address, pp. 27\u201328.</ref> Those troops continued under Grant in his next command, the distinct District of West Tennessee; they were then sometimes, and perhaps most appropriately, called the \"Army of West Tennessee.\"<ref>That usage appears, for example, in reports filed by various Union officers after the April 1862 Battle of Shiloh (''Official Records'' (''OR'') I, v. 10/1, pp. 165, 203, 240, 277, 280, 282, 284, 286\u201387) and can be found as late as October 1862 (Report of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Davies, October 18, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 17/1, p. 251). During the period September 28 \u2013 December 9, 1862, there was also a Confederate Army of West Tennessee, organized from the Confederate [[Army of the West (1862)|Army of the West]] and commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]]. Confederate authorities ruled that \"the name and function of this army [were] improper,\" and Van Dorn's forces were merged into the [[Army of Mississippi]]. See Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 892.</ref> However, army correspondence began using the term \"Army of the Tennessee\" in March 1862; that term soon became commonplace and naturally lived on when Grant's command was elevated to departmental status in October 1862, as the Department of the Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 857; see Halleck to Pope, March 21, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 8, p. 629 (\"I am preparing additional re-enforcements for the Army of the Tennessee\"); Phisterer, ''Statistical Record'', p. 54 (Grant's forces fought at Shiloh (April 1862) as \"the Army of the District of Western Tennessee\" and \"became the Army of the Tennessee upon the [post-Shiloh] concentration of troops at Pittsburg Landing\"); McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', p. 512; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref> During the course of the war, elements of the Army of the Tennessee performed many tasks, and the army evolved with the addition and subtraction of many units. It is not feasible to chronicle every such development here, even at the [[corps]] level. Rather, this article traces the main thrust of the army's development and its most memorable activities. At any given time, substantial numbers of troops were engaged in activities not discussed here. For example, in April 1863, less than half of Grant's departmental strength was directly engaged in the Vicksburg Campaign.<ref name=\"OR I, v. 24/3, p. 249\">See Departmental returns for April 30, 1863, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0038%2F&tif=00251.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0038 ''OR'' I, v. 24/3, p. 249].</ref>\n\n===Cairo and the Battle of Belmont===\n{{See also|Belmont Union order of battle}}\n[[File:U.S. Grant and staff.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Brigadier General Grant and staff, Cairo, October 1861]]\nIn September 1861, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] Ulysses S. Grant, then subordinate to Maj. Gen. [[John Fremont]] in the Union's [[Western Department]], assumed command of the District of Southeast Missouri; Grant established his headquarters at [[Cairo, Illinois]].<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 264; Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 174.</ref> One of Grant's wartime aides, [[John A. Rawlins]], later stated that \"[f]rom this time... commenced the growth and organization of the Army of the Tennessee.\"<ref>John A. Rawlins, Address, Proceedings of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee.</ref> Just days later, prompted by Confederate occupation of [[Columbus, Kentucky]], on the [[Mississippi River]], Grant led a small force to seize [[Paducah, Kentucky]], where the [[Tennessee River]] joins the [[Ohio River]]; Grant thus forestalled a Confederate effort to occupy the strategically important town. Paducah promptly became a separate Union command under Brig. Gen. [[Charles Ferguson Smith|Charles F. Smith]], who soon occupied [[Smithland, Kentucky]], at the junction of the [[Cumberland River]] and the Ohio.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 118\u201321.</ref>\n\nAccording to Rawlins, the \"first affair dignified by the name of a battle\" for any of Grant's forces occurred at [[Battle of Fredericktown|Fredericktown, Missouri]], where some of Grant's troops helped defeat Confederate forces under [[M. Jeff Thompson]].<ref>Rawlins, Address, p. 27; Conger, ''U.S. Grant'', pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Grant's own first engagement came on November 7 at Belmont, Missouri, a Mississippi River landing opposite Columbus, Kentucky. Grant, accompanied by Brig. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], moved a force of approximately 3,000 to Belmont by water, cut his way into the Confederate camps there, and then had to fight his way back out to regain his transports. Grant's casualties in this first battle totaled about 500; Confederate casualties were similar. While Grant had suffered a repulse, he won favorable press coverage.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 124\u201332.</ref> This battle, reports Rawlins, \"confirmed General Grant in his views\" that he should \"give battle\" whenever \"he had what he thought a sufficient number of men.\"<ref>Rawlins, Address, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> Also in November, John Fremont lost his command at St. Louis, to be replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], whose command was designated the [[Department of the Missouri]].<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 134; Ballard, ''Grant'', pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n===Henry-Donelson Campaign===\n{{See also|Fort Donelson Union order of battle}}\nOn December 20, Grant's command was reconfigured to include C.F. Smith's and renamed the District of Cairo.<ref>See Special Orders, No. 78, HQ, Dept. of the Missouri, December 20, 1861, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0109%2F&tif=00209.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0109 ''OR'' I, v. 52/1, p. 201]; Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 189.

Grant'', 3:330.</ref> From that perch, in February 1862, Grant led the Union campaign against Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]], on the Cumberland River.<ref>For detailed discussion of the Henry-Donelson campaign, see Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 65\u2013120.</ref> His troops for this campaign eventually numbered approximately 27,000 men, divided into three divisions commanded, respectively, by John McClernand (1st Division), C.F.

Foote]], commander of the [[Western Flotilla]].<ref>Engle, ''Heartland'', pp. 53\u201359.</ref> Several days later, in winter conditions, most of Grant's two divisions marched overland to attack the more formidable Fort Donelson, situated on the Cumberland River but only {{convert|12|mi|km|spell=in}} away from Fort Henry.<ref>Engle, ''Heartland'', pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Additional Union [[regiment]]s arrived at Fort Donelson by water; these were formed into the new 3rd Division under Lew Wallace.<ref>Engle, ''Heartland'', p. 70; Wallace, ''Autobiography'', 1:387\u201389.</ref> The [[Battle of Fort Donelson]] began on February 13 and, after sharp fighting, concluded on February 16 with the unconditional surrender of the remaining Confederate garrison of approximately 15,000.<ref>Engle, ''Heartland'', pp. 68\u201381.</ref>\n  \nAlthough it would still be a month before the term \"Army of the Tennessee\" came into use, the three divisions that served under Grant in the Henry-Donelson campaign were the nucleus of that famous army and had now won an important victory that foreshadowed its later successes.<ref>Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 857; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. x.</ref> One historian describes their accomplishments in the Henry-Donelson campaign as the \"first significant Union triumph in the war\"; its fruits included breaking the Confederacy's western line of defense, securing Kentucky to the Union, and opening the South, especially Tennessee, to invasion.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 165.</ref> Another historian notes that Grant's troops \"had performed prodigies of valor and endurance during the campaign\" and had learned from it that \"hard fighting would bring success.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 119\u201320.</ref> As a result of the campaign's conspicuous success, Grant, McClernand, Smith, and Wallace were all promoted to the rank of major general of volunteers.<ref>See Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 773; Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 214.</ref> Grant in particular became a national celebrity\u2014\"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant\u2014for his refusal to allow any other terms of surrender.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 165\u201366.</ref>\n\n===Shiloh and the Siege of Corinth===\n{{See also|Shiloh Union order of battle|Siege of Corinth Union order of battle}}\n\nOn February 14, 1862, during the Donelson campaign, Grant was given command of the newly created District of West Tennessee; it appears that his troops soon came to be called the \"Army of the Tennessee\" more often than the \"Army of West Tennessee.\"<ref>General Orders, No. 37, HQ, Dept. of the Missouri, February 14, 1862, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0008%2F&tif=00567.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0008 ''OR'' I, v. 8, p. 555]; Eicher, ''Commands'', pp. 856\u201357. At this time, the geographical limits of his district were \"not defined.\"  See General Orders No. 1, HQ, Dist. of West Tennessee, February 17, 1862, ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', 4:230.</ref> Over the next several months, Grant twice was in danger of losing his command, a development that doubtless would have changed the future course and character of the army and perhaps deprived it at this early stage of one source of its future success\u2014continuity of leadership.<ref>The leadership of the Army of the Tennessee was notably more stable than that of the Union's [[Army of the Potomac]]. The latter suffered the relief of several failed commanders: [[Irwin McDowell|McDowell]] (predecessor force), [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]], [[Ambrose E. Burnside|Burnside]], and [[Joseph Hooker|Hooker]]. There was no equally destabilizing event in the life of the Army of the Tennessee, although Grant could have fallen by the wayside in 1862 and some dislocation followed the death of [[James B. McPherson]] in 1864. Further, as Grant and Sherman in turn ascended to broader responsibilities, the Army of the Tennessee enjoyed virtually seamless transitions from Grant to Sherman (1863) and from Sherman to McPherson (1864). See Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 216, 420, 460, 490, 569\u201371; Hirshson, ''White Tecumseh'', pp. 232\u201333.</ref>\n\nIn early March, Grant's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]], then in command of the Department of the Missouri, assigned Grant to lead an expedition up the Tennessee River from the recently captured Fort Henry. On March 4, however, Halleck ordered Grant to give field command of the expedition to C.F. Smith; this order has been variously attributed to professional jealousy and to Halleck's lacking confidence in Grant due to certain administrative difficulties.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 219\u201320; Ballard, ''Grant'', pp. 40\u201343; Engle, ''Heartland'', pp. 105\u201306; Marszalek, ''Halleck'', pp. 116\u201320; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 128\u201332.</ref> Smith initially established the expedition at [[Savannah, Tennessee]], a town on the east side of the river approximately 100 river miles (160&nbsp;km) south of Fort Henry. He soon began staging troops at a point\u2014[[Pittsburg Landing]]\u2014nine miles (14&nbsp;km) further south and across the river.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 179\u201380.</ref> Meanwhile, Halleck's command was enlarged and renamed the [[Department of the Mississippi]], and Halleck restored Grant to field command, perhaps because of personal intervention by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Many authors see presidential pressure behind Grant's reinstatement to field command. See, e.g., Simpson, ''Triumph'', pp. 124\u201325; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 141\u201342. But there is room to question that conclusion. Halleck relieved Grant of field command of the expedition, but not his overall command, on March 4 (''OR'' I, v. 10/2, p. 3). On March 9 and 10, Halleck advised Grant to prepare himself to take the field. On March 10, the President and Secretary of War inquired about Grant's status, and on March 13, Halleck directed Grant to take the field. See Halleck to Grant, March 9, 10, 13, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 10/2, pp. 22, 27, 32; Thomas to Halleck, March 10, 1862, ''OR'' I, v. 7, p. 683. This sequence suggests that Halleck may have decided to restore Grant to field command before receiving Lincoln's inquiry. See Smith, ''Grant'', p. 176: Halleck's \"reinstatement of Grant preceded by one day the bombshell that landed on his desk from the adjutant general [on behalf of the President and Secretary of War] in Washington.\"</ref> Grant joined his army in the field on March 17.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', p. 179.</ref> By early April, Grant's army had grown to a total of roughly 50,000 men, organized into six divisions.<ref>Daniel, ''Shiloh'', p. 322.</ref> The three new divisions were commanded by Brig. Gen. [[Stephen A. Hurlbut]] (4th Division), Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman (5th), and Brig. Gen. [[Benjamin M. Prentiss]] (6th). In addition, Brig. Gen. [[W.H.L. Wallace]] took command of Smith's 2nd Division due to the latter's having suffered a debilitating leg injury.<ref>See Daniel, ''Shiloh'', p. 322; Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 226\u201327.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Shiloh - History of Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|300px|Shiloh: Crucible of the Army of the Tennessee]]\nOn April 6\u20137, Grant's forces fought the bloodiest battle of the Civil War to that time, the [[Battle of Shiloh]], when Confederate forces advanced largely undetected from [[Corinth, Mississippi]], and attacked the five Union divisions staged at Pittsburg Landing. On the first day of the battle, the surprised and unentrenched army fought desperately and suffered many casualties. However, long-expected elements of the [[Army of the Ohio]], under Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]], arrived to reinforce Grant late that day, with many more troops arriving overnight and the following day. Grant was also bolstered by the evening arrival of his own 3rd Division; Lew Wallace and his troops had been slow arriving at Pittsburg Landing from their separate position at Crump's Landing.

Wallace, and Grant's loss of confidence in Lew Wallace. In addition, C.F. Smith died later in April from complications due to his non-combat leg injury.<ref>For the varying impact of Shiloh on these officers, see Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 183\u201384, 198\u201399, 201; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', p. 182; Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 493.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Shiloh came the second threat to Grant's leadership, as well as a preview of the multi-army operations that would feature prominently in the future of the Army of the Tennessee. Pursuant to previous plans, Grant's departmental superior, General Halleck, arrived at Pittsburg Landing to take command in the field. Intending to move against the Confederate forces concentrating at the rail hub at Corinth, Halleck proceeded to gather and organize what was in effect an army group of over 100,000 men.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 205\u201306; Ambrose, ''Halleck'', pp. 43\u201349.</ref> His force included Grant's Army of the Tennessee, Buell's Army of the Ohio, and Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s [[Army of the Mississippi]]. On April 30, Halleck divided this force into three corps (or \"wings\") and a reserve. The left wing was commanded by Pope, the center by Buell, the right wing by Maj. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]], and the reserve by John McClernand. Grant's 1st and 3rd Divisions constituted the reserve; the right wing contained Grant's 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions and Thomas's division from the Army of the Ohio. In other words, Halleck had drawn Thomas from division command in the Army of the Ohio and assigned to him, as commander of the right wing, most of Grant's troops.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 248; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 206.</ref>\n\nHalleck assigned Grant to be second-in-command of the entire 100,000-man force, but also expressly confirmed Grant in command of the \"Army Corps of the Tennessee\" (the right wing and the reserve).<ref>See Special Field Orders, No. 35, HQ, Dept. of the Mississippi, April 30, 1862, [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&coll=moa&view=50&root=%2Fmoa%2Fwaro%2Fwaro0011%2F&tif=00146.TIF&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DANU4519-0011 ''OR'' I, v. 10/2, p. 144].</ref> It is unclear exactly why Halleck took these actions affecting Grant.<ref>See Nicolay, ''Lincoln'', 5:338.</ref> However, Grant was under severe public criticism about Shiloh at the time and soon complained that his second-in-command position constituted a \"sensure\" and was akin to an arrest; among his complaints was the fact that Halleck gave orders directly to Thomas and division commanders nominally subordinate to Grant.<ref>On May 11, Grant wrote Halleck privately that he considered his second-in-command assignment to be \"anomylous,\" to constitute a \"sensure,\" and to put him in a position that \"differs but little from that of one in arrest.\" ''Papers of Ulysses S. Grant'', 5:114; see Smith, ''Grant'', p. 209.</ref> With this awkward command structure, embarrassing to Grant, Halleck's forces took the entire month of May, with constant entrenchments, to advance the twenty miles [32&nbsp;km] to Corinth. This Siege of Corinth culminated with the Confederate forces abandoning the town on the night of May 29\u201330.<ref>Marszalek, ''Halleck'', pp. 123\u201326.</ref> Grant later suggested that Halleck failed to accomplish all that he should have in this campaign and its aftermath.<ref>Grant, ''Memoirs'', pp. 255\u201357.</ref> However, William Tecumseh Sherman, commanding a division in Thomas's right wing, considered the campaign to be an important period of training for Halleck's forces, including the Army of the Tennessee: \"[I]t served for the instruction of our men in guard and picket duty, and in habituating them to out-door life; and by the time we had reached Corinth I believe that army was the best then on this continent.\"<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 274.</ref>\n\nAfter Corinth was taken, Grant might have left his command in frustration, but Sherman intervened and encouraged him to remain.<ref>Smith, ''Grant'', pp. 207\u201312; Schenker, \"Ulysses in His Tent,\" passim; Grant, ''Memoirs'', p. 258; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 275\u201376.</ref> Grant's experiences during this period have been cited as one reason for his subsequent warm relations with Sherman and his cooler relations with George Thomas.<ref>Daniel, ''Shiloh'', pp. 309\u201310; Einolf, ''Thomas'', pp. 126\u201327.</ref> In turn, the trust between Grant and Sherman contributed importantly to the future effectiveness of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 420.</ref> More immediately, however, Halleck soon rescinded the multi-corps organization adopted for the Corinth campaign and began to disperse his large force.

He assigned Sherman to assault the right flank of Bragg's army, at the north end of [[Missionary Ridge]], with three of his four divisions and other troops; this attack was intended to play the major role for the Union. However, in the [[Battle of Missionary Ridge]] on November 25, Sherman's attack gained no traction, and it fell to Thomas's Army of the Cumberland to break the Confederate line by assaulting directly up the middle of Missionary Ridge. On this occasion, then, the Army of the Tennessee ended up playing second fiddle to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>See McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 677\u201381; Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 462\u201378; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 389\u201390.</ref>\n\nImmediately after Chattanooga, Grant ordered Sherman to take command of a mixed force, including part of the XV Corps, and proceed to break the siege that other Confederate forces had mounted against [[Ambrose Burnside]]'s command at [[Knoxville Campaign|Knoxville, Tennessee]].

This force, led by Sherman himself, consisted of two divisions from McPherson's corps and two from Hurlbut's corps. In February, after concentrating at Vicksburg, the force made a largely unopposed round-trip march of approximately {{convert|330|mi|km}} from Vicksburg to Meridian, Missisissippi, and back, in two columns. Hurlbut led the left column, and McPherson, the right.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 417\u201323, 872; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 252\u201355.</ref> This force destroyed the transportation center at Meridian in mid-February.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 253\u201354.

Grant to the new rank of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant general]] and gave him command of all Union armies; to fulfill that role, Grant relocated to the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] and maintained his headquarters thereafter in the field with the Army of the Potomac. In the West, Sherman succeeded Grant in command of the Military Division of the Mississippi. Command of the Army of the Tennessee now passed to the XVII Corps commander, Maj. Gen. James B.

As Sherman began his move southward, Johnston was entrenched at [[Dalton, Georgia]]. Hoping to threaten Johnston's rear from [[Resaca, Georgia|Resaca]], Sherman sent McPherson, on the Union right, to the west of Rocky Face Ridge and through the \"unoccupied, unguarded, unobstructed, and unobserved\" Snake Creek Gap to Resaca. McPherson did reach Johnston's rear, but assumed a defensive position there, rather than carrying through Sherman's plan to cut Johnston's railroad link to the south.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 54\u201366; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 505.</ref> After the rest of Sherman's forces moved up, the first significant battle of the campaign occurred at Resaca (May 13\u201315). While a much more decisive outcome might have been achieved, Sherman had to be satisfied with Johnston's falling back toward Adairsville.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 67\u201377.</ref>\n\nResaca set the tone for the first phase of the campaign, as Sherman's armies attempted to maneuver around Johnston, and Johnston continually fell back toward Atlanta.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', pp. 506\u201328; McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 72\u2013140.</ref> On June 27, Sherman departed from character and attempted a direct assault on Johnston's position at [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]]. When that failed, Sherman swung McPherson from the left around to the right in order to resume his southward progress.<ref>Castel, ''Decision'', pp. 303\u201322; see McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 107\u201310; Hattaway, ''North'', pp. 596\u201399.</ref> On July 18, as the Army of the Tennessee completed a giant wheeling maneuver from Sherman's right to his left and cut the Georgia Railroad east of Decatur, John Bell Hood replaced Johnston as the Confederate commander.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 120, 139\u201341; Lewis, ''Fighting Prophet'', p. 381; Eicher, ''Commands'', p. 890.</ref> The aggressive Hood soon initiated the [[Battle of Peachtree Creek]] (July 20); his attack was intended to exploit a gap in the Union lines (between Thomas on the right and Schofield in the center) but ended unsuccessfully.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 146\u201352; Hattaway, ''North'', pp. 604\u201309.</ref> Then, in the [[Battle of Atlanta]] on July 22, Hood launched a strong assault against McPherson's army, on Sherman's left. McPherson himself was killed, and command temporarily passed to Maj. Gen. Logan, his senior corps commander.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 152\u201355.</ref> The July 22 battle, writes one historian, was \"the climax of the Army of the Tennessee's wartime career,\" as 27,000 men \"defeated the attacks of nearly 40,000 Confederates who had the advantages of surprise and position.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 568.</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding Logan's battlefield success that day, Sherman chose West Pointer Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]], imported from a corps command in Thomas's army, to become the new commander of the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 570.</ref> Thereafter, Sherman refocused his efforts west of Atlanta, now swinging the Army of the Tennessee around to his right flank. This led to the [[Battle of Ezra Church]] on July 28, where Howard repulsed Hood's third attack in nine days \"with ease.\"<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 155\u201357.</ref> However, Sherman also suffered setbacks in cavalry operations at this juncture, and for a month his campaign became more static. He finally broke the impasse in late August, essentially abandoning his positions north and east of Atlanta, and wheeling the Army of the Tennessee well south of Atlanta to attack Hood's last rail communications. On August 31, Howard's army repulsed a final Confederate attack in the first day of the [[Battle of Jonesborough]] (August 31 and September 1). With all his rail communications finally severed, Hood evacuated Atlanta during the night of September 1\u20132.<ref>McMurry, ''Atlanta'', pp. 158\u201376.</ref> Sherman's capture of Atlanta, facilitated by the prowess of the Army of the Tennessee, \"was one of the great epochs of the war, on a level with the seizure of Vicksburg\" and contributed importantly to the November reelection of Abraham Lincoln.<ref>Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 583.</ref> Sherman later estimated that the XV Corps had \"traversed in maneuvering\" approximately {{convert|178|mi|km}} during this campaign.<ref>Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 872.

Howard, was now fated to function as Sherman's right arm in the March to the Sea and the Carolinas Campaign, but not immediately. After losing Atlanta in early September, Confederate General Hood regrouped and then sought with some success to lure Sherman back northward by attacking his communications and threatening Tennessee; Sherman estimated that his own regression toward Chattanooga and subsequent return to Atlanta involved {{convert|270|mi|km}} of marching by the Army of the Tennessee.<ref>Bailey, ''Chessboard'', pp. 26\u201347; Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 288\u201393; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 872.</ref> During this period (September\u2013October), Sherman made many adjustments to his forces. One involved dividing Grenville Dodge's XVI Corps troops between the XV and XVII Corps; this ended the role of the XVI Corps with the main Army of the Tennessee.<ref>See Sherman, ''Memoirs'', p. 620; [http://www.civilwararchive.com/CORPS/16thcorp.htm Civil War Archives, XVI Corps History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184614/http://www.civilwararchive.com/CORPS/16thcorp.htm|date=2013-10-29}}.

See Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 578.</ref>\n\nUltimately, Sherman received approval from his superiors to detach other forces under George Thomas and John Schofield to defend Tennessee, cut loose from his lines of communication back to Chattanooga, and march southeast to the sea with approximately 60,000 men.<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 293\u201397; Sherman, ''Memoirs'', pp. 649\u201350.</ref> In November and December, then, the Army of the Tennessee constituted the right wing during the march of {{convert|280|mi|km}} to the sea; Howard's command at this stage consisted of the XV Corps (now under Maj.

Sherman's other column, designated the [[Army of Georgia]], was drawn from the Army of the Cumberland; its commander was Maj. Gen. [[Henry W.

Gen. [[William B. Hazen]], to subdue [[Second Battle of Fort McAllister|Fort McAllister]], outside [[Savannah, Georgia]].<ref>Marszalek, ''Sherman'', pp. 306\u201307; Woodworth, ''Victory'', p. 603.</ref> On December 21, the march culminated with the capture of Savannah.

Each sheet typically had a hole through which a string could pass, and with these the sheets were tied together with a string to bind like a book. A palm leaf text thus created would typically last between a few decades and about 600 years before it decayed due to dampness, insect activity, mold and fragility. Thus the document had to be copied onto new sets of dried palm leaves.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/>  The oldest surviving palm leaf Indian manuscripts have been found in colder, drier climates such as in parts of [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]] and [[central Asia]], the source of 1st-millennium CE manuscripts.<ref name=\"aghosheia\" />\n\nThe individual sheets of palm leaves were called ''Patra'' or ''Parna'' in Sanskrit (Pali/Prakrit: ''Panna''), and the medium when ready to write was called ''Tada-patra'' (or ''Tala-patra'', ''Tali'', ''Tadi'').<ref name=aghosheia>Amalananda Ghosh (1991), An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, BRILL Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004092648}}, pages 360-361</ref> The famous 5th-century CE Indian manuscript called the [[Bower Manuscript]] discovered in [[Chinese Turkestan]], was written on [[birch-bark]] sheets shaped in the form of treated palm leaves.<ref name=aghosheia/>\n\n[[Hindu temple]]s often served as centers where ancient manuscripts were routinely used for learning and where the texts were copied when they wore out.<ref>John Guy and Jorrit Britschgi (2011), Wonder of the Age: Master Painters of India, 1100-1900, The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], {{ISBN|978-1588394309}}, page 19</ref> In South India, temples and associated [[Matha|mutts]] served custodial functions, and a large number of manuscripts on [[Hindu philosophy]], [[poetry]], [[grammar]] and other subjects were written, multiplied and preserved inside the temples.<ref>Saraju Rath (2012), Aspects of Manuscript Culture in South India, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004219007}}, pages ix, 158-168, 252-259</ref> Archaeological and epigraphical evidence indicates existence of libraries called ''Sarasvati-bhandara'', dated possibly to early 12th-century and employing librarians, attached to Hindu temples.<ref>Hartmut Scharfe (2002), ''From Temple schools to Universities'', in Handbook of Oriental Studies, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004125568}}, pages 183-186</ref> Palm leaf manuscripts were also preserved inside Jain temples and in Buddhist monasteries.\n\nWith the spread of Indian culture to [[Southeast Asia]]n countries like as [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], and the [[Philippines]], these nations also became home to large collections.

The [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word is the modern form of [[Old Javanese]] ''rontal''. It is composed of two Old Javanese words, namely ''ron'' \"leaf\" and ''tal'' \"''Borassus flabellifer'', palmyra palm\". Due to the shape of the palmyra palm's leaves, which are spread like a fan, these trees are also known as \"fan trees\". The leaves of the rontal tree have always been used for many purposes, such as for the making of plaited mats, [[palm sugar]] wrappers, water scoops, ornaments, ritual tools, and writing material. Today, the art of writing in ''rontal'' still survives in [[Bali]], performed by Balinese Brahmin as a sacred duty to rewrite [[Hindu texts]].\n\n[[File:Arjunawiwaha canto 5.jpg|thumb|[[Bali]]nese palm-leaf manuscript of ''[[Arjunawiwaha|Kakawin Arjunawiw\u0101ha]]''.]]\nMany old manuscripts dated from ancient [[Java]], [[Indonesia]], were written on rontal palm-leaf manuscripts. Manuscripts dated from the 14th to 15th century during the [[Majapahit]] period. Some were found even earlier, like the ''[[Arjunawiwaha]]'', the ''[[Smaradahana]]'', the ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'' and the ''[[Kakawin Sutasoma]]'', which were discovered on the neighboring islands of [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]]. This suggested that the tradition of preserving, copying and rewriting palm-leaf manuscripts continued for centuries. Other palm-leaf manuscripts include [[Sundanese language]] works: the ''[[Carita Parahyangan]]'', the ''[[Sanghyang Siksakandang Karesian]]'' and the ''[[Bujangga Manik]]''.\n\n==Preparation and preservation==\nThe palm leaves are first cooked and dried. The writer then uses a [[stylus]] to inscribe letters. Natural colourings are applied to the surface so the ink will stick in the grooves. This process is similar to [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing. Afterwards, a clean cloth is used to wipe out the excess ink and the leaf manuscript is done.<ref>Padmakumar, P.

Each sheet typically had a hole through which a string could pass, and with these the sheets were tied together with a string to bind like a book. A palm leaf text thus created would typically last between a few decades and about 600 years before it decayed due to dampness, insect activity, mold and fragility. Thus the document had to be copied onto new sets of dried palm leaves.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/>  The oldest surviving palm leaf Indian manuscripts have been found in colder, drier climates such as in parts of [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]] and [[central Asia]], the source of 1st-millennium CE manuscripts.<ref name=\"aghosheia\" />\n\nThe individual sheets of palm leaves were called ''Patra'' or ''Parna'' in Sanskrit (Pali/Prakrit: ''Panna''), and the medium when ready to write was called ''Tada-patra'' (or ''Tala-patra'', ''Tali'', ''Tadi'').<ref name=aghosheia>Amalananda Ghosh (1991), An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, BRILL Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004092648}}, pages 360-361</ref> The famous 5th-century CE Indian manuscript called the [[Bower Manuscript]] discovered in [[Chinese Turkestan]], was written on [[birch-bark]] sheets shaped in the form of treated palm leaves.<ref name=aghosheia/>\n\n[[Hindu temple]]s often served as centers where ancient manuscripts were routinely used for learning and where the texts were copied when they wore out.<ref>John Guy and Jorrit Britschgi (2011), Wonder of the Age: Master Painters of India, 1100-1900, The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], {{ISBN|978-1588394309}}, page 19</ref> In South India, temples and associated [[Matha|mutts]] served custodial functions, and a large number of manuscripts on [[Hindu philosophy]], [[poetry]], [[grammar]] and other subjects were written, multiplied and preserved inside the temples.<ref>Saraju Rath (2012), Aspects of Manuscript Culture in South India, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004219007}}, pages ix, 158-168, 252-259</ref> Archaeological and epigraphical evidence indicates existence of libraries called ''Sarasvati-bhandara'', dated possibly to early 12th-century and employing librarians, attached to Hindu temples.<ref>Hartmut Scharfe (2002), ''From Temple schools to Universities'', in Handbook of Oriental Studies, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004125568}}, pages 183-186</ref> Palm leaf manuscripts were also preserved inside Jain temples and in Buddhist monasteries.\n\nWith the spread of Indian culture to [[Southeast Asia]]n countries like as [[Indonesia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], and the [[Philippines]], these nations also became home to large collections.

The graph gets arbitrarily close to the {{mvar|y}}-axis, but [[asymptotic|does not meet it]].]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''logarithm''' is the [[inverse function]] to [[exponentiation]]. That means the logarithm of a given number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is the [[exponent]] to which another fixed number, the ''[[base (exponentiation)|base]]''&nbsp;{{mvar|b}}, must be raised, to produce that number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}. In the simplest case, the logarithm counts the number of occurrences of the same factor in repeated multiplication; e.g., since {{math|1000 {{=}} 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u200910 {{=}} 10<sup>3</sup>}}, the \"logarithm base {{math|10}}\" of {{math|1000}} is {{math|3}}, or {{math|log<sub>10</sub>(1000) {{=}} 3}}. The logarithm of {{mvar|x}} to ''base'' {{mvar|b}} is denoted as {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}}, or without parentheses, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;''x''}}, or even without the explicit base, {{math|log&thinsp;''x''}}, when no confusion is possible, or when the base does not matter such as in [[big O notation]]. \n\nMore generally, exponentiation allows any positive [[real number]] as base to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}} for any two positive real numbers&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} and&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, where&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} is not equal to&nbsp;{{math|1}}, is always a unique real number&nbsp;{{mvar|y}}. More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:\n\n:<math> \\log_b(x) = y \\ </math> exactly if <math>\\ b^y = x\\ </math> and <math>\\ x > 0</math> and <math>\\ b > 0</math> and <math>\\ b \\ne 1</math>.\n\nFor example, {{math|1=log<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;64 = 6}}, as {{math|1=2<sup>6</sup> = 64}}.\n\nThe logarithm base {{math|10}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 10}}) is called the [[common logarithm]] and has many applications in science and engineering. The [[natural logarithm]] has the [[e (mathematical constant)|number {{mvar|e}}]]&nbsp;(that is {{math|''b'' \u2248 2.718}}) as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and [[physics]], because of its simpler [[integral]] and [[derivative]]. The [[binary logarithm]] uses base {{math|2}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}) and is commonly used in [[computer science]].  Logarithms are examples of [[concave function]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Logarithm \u2014 Theory & Applications|date=2016-05-08|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref>\n\nLogarithms were introduced by [[John Napier]] in 1614 as a means of simplifying calculations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/johnnapierinvent00hobsiala|title=John Napier and the invention of logarithms, 1614; a lecture|last=Hobson|first=Ernest William|date=1914|publisher=Cambridge : University Press|others=University of California Libraries}}</ref> They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, surveyors and others to perform high-accuracy computations more easily. Using [[Mathematical table|logarithm tables]], tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition. This is possible because of the fact\u2014important in its own right\u2014that the logarithm of a [[product (mathematics)|product]] is the [[summation|sum]] of the logarithms of the factors:\n:<math> \\log_b(xy) = \\log_b x + \\log_b y, \\,</math>\nprovided that {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are all positive and {{math|''b'' \u2260 1}}. The [[slide rule]], also based on logarithms, allows quick calculations without tables, but at lower precision.\nThe present-day notion of logarithms comes from [[Leonhard Euler]], who connected them to the [[exponential function]] in the 18th century, and who also introduced the letter {{mvar|e}} as the base of natural logarithms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theory of complex functions|last=Remmert, Reinhold.|date=1991|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0387971955|location=New York|oclc=21118309}}</ref>\n\n[[Logarithmic scale]]s reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes. For example, the [[decibel]] (dB) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] used to express [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|ratio as logarithms]], mostly for signal power and amplitude (of which [[sound pressure]] is a common example). In chemistry, [[pH]] is a logarithmic measure for the [[acid]]ity of an [[aqueous solution]]. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific [[formula]]e, and in measurements of the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity of algorithms]] and of geometric objects called [[fractal]]s. They help to describe [[frequency]] ratios of [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]], appear in formulas counting [[prime number]]s or [[Stirling's approximation|approximating]] [[factorial]]s, inform some models in [[psychophysics]], and can aid in [[forensic accounting]].\n\nIn the same way as the logarithm reverses [[exponentiation]], the [[complex logarithm]] is the [[inverse function]] of the exponential function applied to [[complex number]]s. The modular [[discrete logarithm]] is another variant; it has uses in [[public-key cryptography]].\n\n==Motivation and definition==\n\n[[Addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] are three of the most fundamental arithmetic operations. Addition, the simplest of these, is undone by subtraction: when you add {{math|5}} to {{mvar|x}} to get {{math|''x'' + 5}}, to reverse this operation you need to ''subtract'' {{math|5}} from {{math|''x'' + 5}}. Multiplication, the next-simplest operation, is undone by [[division (mathematics)|division]]: if you multiply {{mvar|x}} by {{math|5}} to get {{math|5''x''}}, you then must divide {{math|5''x''}} by {{math|5}} in order to return to the original expression {{mvar|x}}. Logarithms also undo a fundamental arithmetic operation, exponentiation.  Exponentiation is when you raise a number to a certain power. For example, raising {{math|2}} to the power {{math|3}} equals {{math|8}}:\n\n: <math>2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8</math>\n\nThe general case is when you raise a number {{Math|''b''}} to the power of {{Math|''y''}} to get {{Math|''x''}}:\n\n: <math>b^y=x</math>\n\nThe number {{Math|''b''}} is referred to as the base of this expression. The base is the number that is raised to a particular power\u2014in the above example, the base of the expression  <math>2^3=8</math> is {{Math|2}}. It is easy to make the base the subject of the expression: all you have to do is take the {{nowrap|{{mvar|y}}-th}} root of both sides. This gives:\n\n: <math>b=\\sqrt[y]{{x}}</math>\n\nIt is less easy to make {{Math|''y''|}} the subject of the expression. Logarithms allow us to do this:\n\n: <math>y=</math>{{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&nbsp;''x''}}\n\nThis expression means that {{mvar|y}} is equal to the power that you need to raise {{mvar|b}} to in order to get {{mvar|x|}}. This operation undoes exponentiation because the logarithm of {{mvar|''x''}} tells you the ''exponent'' that the base has been raised to.\n\n===Exponentiation===\nThis subsection contains a short overview of the exponentiation operation, which is fundamental to understanding logarithms.\nRaising {{mvar|b}} to the {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power, where {{mvar|n}} is a [[natural number]], is done by multiplying {{mvar|n}} factors equal to {{mvar|b}}. The {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power of {{mvar|b}} is written {{math|''b''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, so that\n\n: <math>b^n = \\underbrace{b \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times b}_{n \\text{ factors}}</math>\n\nExponentiation may be extended to {{math|''b''<sup>''y''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|b}} is a positive number and the ''exponent'' {{mvar|y}} is any [[real number]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Shirali| first1=Shailesh|title=A Primer on Logarithms|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-414-6|year=2002|location=Hyderabad|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0b0igbb3WaQC}}}}, esp. section 2</ref> For example, {{math|''b''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of {{mvar|b}}, that is, {{math|1/''b''}}. Raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to the power 1/2 is the [[square root]] of ''{{mvar|b}}''.\n\nMore generally, raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to a [[rational number|rational]] power {{math|''p''/''q''}}, where {{Mvar|p}} and {{Mvar|q}} are integers, is given by\n\n:<math>b^{p / q} = \\sqrt[q]{b^p},</math>\n\nthe {{Mvar|q}}-th root of <math>b^p\\!\\!</math>. \n\nFinally, any [[irrational number]] (a real number which is not rational) ''{{mvar|y}}'' can be approximated to arbitrary precision by rational numbers. This can be used to compute the ''{{mvar|y}}''-th power of ''{{mvar|b}}'': for example <math>\\sqrt 2 \\approx 1.414 ...</math> and <math>b^{\\sqrt 2}</math> is increasingly well approximated by <math>b^1, b^{1.4}, b^{1.41}, b^{1.414}, ...</math>.

Archimedes had written ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'' in the third century BC, but a quadrature for the hyperbola eluded all efforts until Saint-Vincent published his results in 1647. The relation that the logarithm provides between a [[geometric progression]] in its [[argument of a function|argument]] and an [[arithmetic progression]] of values, prompted [[A. A. de Sarasa]] to make the connection of Saint-Vincent's quadrature and the tradition of logarithms in [[prosthaphaeresis]], leading to the term \"hyperbolic logarithm\", a synonym for natural logarithm. Soon the new function was appreciated by [[Christiaan Huygens]], and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]]. The notation Log y was adopted by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in 1675,<ref>[[Florian Cajori]] (1913) \"History of the exponential and logarithm concepts\", [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 20: 5, 35, 75, 107, 148, 173, 205.</ref> and the next year he connected it to the [[integral calculus|integral]]\n<math>\\int \\frac{dy}{y} .</math>\n\n==Logarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications{{anchor|Antilogarithm}}==\n[[Image:Logarithms Britannica 1797.png|thumb|360px|right|The 1797 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' explanation of logarithms]]\n\nBy simplifying difficult calculations before calculators and computers became available, logarithms contributed to the advance of science, especially [[astronomy]].

Briggs' first table contained the [[common logarithm]]s of all integers in the range 1\u20131000, with a precision of 14 digits. Subsequently, tables with increasing scope were written. These tables listed the values of {{math|log<sub>10</sub>''x''}}  for any number {{mvar|x}} in a certain range, at a certain precision. Base-10 logarithms were universally used for computation, hence the name common logarithm, since numbers that differ by factors of 10 have logarithms that differ by integers. The common logarithm of {{mvar|x}} can be separated into an [[integer part]] and a [[fractional part]], known as the characteristic and [[mantissa (logarithm)|mantissa]]. Tables of logarithms need only include the mantissa, as the characteristic can be easily determined by counting digits from the decimal point.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Spiegel | first1=Murray R. | last2=Moyer | first2=R.E. | title=Schaum's outline of college algebra | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location=New York | series=Schaum's outline series | isbn=978-0-07-145227-4 | year=2006}}, p.&nbsp;264</ref> The characteristic of {{math|10 \u00b7 {{mvar|x}}}} is one plus the characteristic of {{mvar|x}}, and their mantissas are the same.  Thus using a three-digit log table, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542 = \\log_{10}(1000 \\cdot 3.542) = 3 + \\log_{10}3.542 \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 \\, </math>\n\nGreater accuracy can be obtained by [[interpolation]]:\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542  \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 + 0.2 (\\log_{10}3.55-\\log_{10}3.54)\\, </math>\n\nThe value of {{math| 10<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be determined by reverse look up in the same table, since the logarithm is a [[monotonic function]].\n\n===Computations===\nThe product and quotient of two positive numbers {{Mvar|c}} and ''{{Mvar|d}}'' were routinely calculated as the sum and difference of their logarithms. The product ''{{Mvar|cd}}'' or quotient {{Mvar|c/d}} came from looking up the antilogarithm of the sum or difference, via the same table:\n\n:<math> c d = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c} \\, 10^{\\ \\log_{10} d} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c + \\ \\log_{10} d} \\,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac c d = c d^{-1} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c - \\ \\log_{10} d}. \\,</math>\n\nFor manual calculations that demand any appreciable precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier methods such as [[prosthaphaeresis]], which relies on [[trigonometric identities]].\n\nCalculations of powers and [[nth root|roots]] are reduced to multiplications or divisions and look-ups by\n:<math>c^d = \\left(10^{\\ \\log_{10} c}\\right)^d =  10^{d \\ \\log_{10} c} \\,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\sqrt[d]{c} = c^\\frac{1}{d} = 10^{\\frac{1}{d} \\ \\log_{10} c}. \\,</math>\n\nTrigonometric calculations were facilitated by tables that contained the common logarithms of [[trigonometric function]]s.\n\n===Slide rules===\nAnother critical application was the [[slide rule]], a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation. The non-sliding logarithmic scale, [[Gunter's rule]], was invented shortly after Napier's invention. [[William Oughtred]] enhanced it to create the slide rule\u2014a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms, as illustrated here:\n\n[[Image:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|center|thumb|550px|Schematic depiction of a slide rule. Starting from 2 on the lower scale, add the distance to 3 on the upper scale to reach the product 6. The slide rule works because it is marked such that the distance from 1 to {{mvar|x}} is proportional to the logarithm of {{mvar|x}}.|alt=A slide rule: two rectangles with logarithmically ticked axes, arrangement to add the distance from 1 to 2 to the distance from 1 to 3, indicating the product 6.]]\n\nFor example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, at the expense of precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\n{{Harvard citations\n |last1=Maor |year=2009 |nb=yes |loc=sections 1, 13}}</ref>\n\n==Analytic properties==\nA deeper study of logarithms requires the concept of a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]''.

A function is ''continuous'' if it does not \"jump\", that is, if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.\n\nThis property can be shown to hold for the function {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}. Because ''{{mvar|f}}'' takes arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small positive values, any number {{math|''y'' > 0}} lies between {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} and {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>)}} for suitable {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}. Hence, the intermediate value theorem ensures that the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|y}}}} has a solution. Moreover, there is only one solution to this equation, because the function ''f'' is [[monotonic function|strictly increasing]] (for {{math|''b'' > 1}}), or strictly decreasing (for {{math|0 < {{mvar|b}} < 1}}).<ref name=LangIV.2>{{Harvard citations|last1=Lang|year=1997 |nb=yes|loc=section IV.2}}</ref>\n\nThe unique solution {{mvar|x}} is the logarithm of {{mvar|y}} to base {{mvar|b}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

Conversely, given a positive number {{mvar|y}}, the formula\n:<math>b^{\\log_b y} = y</math>\nsays that first taking the logarithm and then exponentiating gives back {{mvar|y}}. Thus, the two possible ways of combining (or [[function composition|composing]]) logarithms and exponentiation give back the original number. Therefore, the logarithm to base {{mvar|b}} is the ''[[inverse function]]'' of {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Stewart | first1=James | title=Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont|isbn=978-0-495-01169-9 | year=2007}}, section 1.6</ref>\n\nInverse functions are closely related to the original functions. Their [[graph of a function|graphs]] correspond to each other upon exchanging the {{mvar|x}}- and the {{mvar|y}}-coordinates (or upon reflection at the diagonal line {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}}), as shown at the right: a point {{math|1=(''t'', ''u'' = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''t''</sup>)}} on the graph of ''f'' yields a point {{math|1=(''u'', ''t'' = log<sub>''b''</sub>''u'')}} on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. As a consequence, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} [[divergent sequence|diverges to infinity]] (gets bigger than any given number) if {{mvar|x}} grows to infinity, provided that {{mvar|b}} is greater than one. In that case, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}}  is an [[increasing function]]. For {{math|''b'' < 1}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} tends to minus infinity instead. When {{mvar|x}} approaches zero, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''x''}} goes to minus infinity for {{math|''b'' > 1}} (plus infinity for {{math|''b'' < 1}}, respectively).\n\n===Derivative and antiderivative===\n[[File:Logarithm derivative.svg|right|thumb|220px|The graph of the [[natural logarithm]] (green) and its tangent at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1.5}} (black)|alt=A graph of the logarithm function and a line touching it in one point.]]\nAnalytic properties of functions pass to their inverses.<ref name=LangIII.3 /> Thus, as {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}} is a continuous and [[differentiable function]], so is {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

It converges more quickly than the Taylor series, especially if {{mvar|z}} is close to 1. For example, for {{math|1=''z'' = 1.5}}, the first three terms of the second series approximate {{math|ln(1.5)}} with an error of about {{val|3|e=-6}}. The quick convergence for {{mvar|z}} close to 1 can be taken advantage of in the following way: given a low-accuracy approximation {{math|''y'' \u2248 ln(''z'')}} and putting\n:<math>A = \\frac z{\\exp(y)}, \\,</math>\nthe logarithm of {{mvar|z}} is:\n:<math>\\ln (z)=y+\\ln (A). \\,</math>\nThe better the initial approximation {{mvar|y}} is, the closer {{mvar|A}} is to 1, so its logarithm can be calculated efficiently. {{mvar|A}} can be calculated using the [[exponential function|exponential series]], which converges quickly provided {{mvar|y}} is not too large. Calculating the logarithm of larger {{mvar|z}} can be reduced to smaller values of {{mvar|z}} by writing {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''a'' \u00b7 10<sup>''b''</sup>}}, so that {{math|ln(''z'') {{=}} ln(''a'') + {{mvar|b}} \u00b7 ln(10)}}.\n\nA closely related method can be used to compute the logarithm of integers.

The two numbers quickly converge to a common limit which is the value of {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}}. ''m'' is chosen such that\n\n:<math>x \\,2^m > 2^{p/2}.\\, </math>\n\nto ensure the required precision. A larger ''m'' makes the {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}} calculation take more steps (the initial x and y are farther apart so it takes more steps to converge) but gives more precision. The constants {{math|pi}} and {{math|ln(2)}} can be calculated with quickly converging series.\n\n===Feynman's algorithm===\nWhile at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] working on the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Richard Feynman]] developed a bit-processing algorithm that is similar to long division and was later used in the [[Connection Machine]]. The algorithm uses the fact that every real number <math> 1 < x < 2 </math> is representable as a product of distinct factors of the form <math> 1 + 2^{-k} </math>. The algorithm sequentially builds that product <math>P</math>: if <math>P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) < x</math>, then it changes <math>P</math> to <math> P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) </math>. It then increase <math>k</math> by one regardless. The algorithm stops when <math>k</math> is large enough to give the desired accuracy. Because <math>\\log(x)</math> is the sum of the terms of the form <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> corresponding to those <math>k</math> for which the factor <math>1 + 2^{-k}</math> was included in the product <math>P</math>, <math>\\log(x)</math> may be computed by simple addition, using a table of <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> for all <math>k</math>.

In [[equal temperament]], the frequency ratio depends only on the interval between two tones, not on the specific frequency, or [[pitch (music)|pitch]], of the individual tones. For example, the [[a (musical note)|note ''A'']] has a frequency of 440 [[Hertz|Hz]] and [[B\u266d (musical note)|''B-flat'']] has a frequency of 466&nbsp;Hz. The interval between ''A'' and ''B-flat'' is a [[semitone]], as is the one between ''B-flat'' and [[b (musical note)|''B'']] (frequency 493&nbsp;Hz). Accordingly, the frequency ratios agree:\n:<math>\\frac{466}{440} \\approx \\frac{493}{466} \\approx 1.059 \\approx \\sqrt[12]2.</math>\nTherefore, logarithms can be used to describe the intervals: an interval is measured in semitones by taking the {{math|base-2<sup>1/12</sup>}} logarithm of the [[frequency]] ratio, while the {{math|base-2<sup>1/1200</sup>}} logarithm of the frequency ratio expresses the interval in [[cent (music)|cents]], hundredths of a semitone.

That means the logarithm of a given number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is the [[exponent]] to which another fixed number, the ''[[base (exponentiation)|base]]''&nbsp;{{mvar|b}}, must be raised, to produce that number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}. In the simplest case, the logarithm counts the number of occurrences of the same factor in repeated multiplication; e.g., since {{math|1000 {{=}} 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u200910 {{=}} 10<sup>3</sup>}}, the \"logarithm base {{math|10}}\" of {{math|1000}} is {{math|3}}, or {{math|log<sub>10</sub>(1000) {{=}} 3}}. The logarithm of {{mvar|x}} to ''base'' {{mvar|b}} is denoted as {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}}, or without parentheses, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;''x''}}, or even without the explicit base, {{math|log&thinsp;''x''}}, when no confusion is possible, or when the base does not matter such as in [[big O notation]]. \n\nMore generally, exponentiation allows any positive [[real number]] as base to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}} for any two positive real numbers&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} and&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, where&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} is not equal to&nbsp;{{math|1}}, is always a unique real number&nbsp;{{mvar|y}}. More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:\n\n:<math> \\log_b(x) = y \\ </math> exactly if <math>\\ b^y = x\\ </math> and <math>\\ x > 0</math> and <math>\\ b > 0</math> and <math>\\ b \\ne 1</math>.\n\nFor example, {{math|1=log<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;64 = 6}}, as {{math|1=2<sup>6</sup> = 64}}.\n\nThe logarithm base {{math|10}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 10}}) is called the [[common logarithm]] and has many applications in science and engineering. The [[natural logarithm]] has the [[e (mathematical constant)|number {{mvar|e}}]]&nbsp;(that is {{math|''b'' \u2248 2.718}}) as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and [[physics]], because of its simpler [[integral]] and [[derivative]]. The [[binary logarithm]] uses base {{math|2}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}) and is commonly used in [[computer science]].  Logarithms are examples of [[concave function]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Logarithm \u2014 Theory & Applications|date=2016-05-08|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref>\n\nLogarithms were introduced by [[John Napier]] in 1614 as a means of simplifying calculations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/johnnapierinvent00hobsiala|title=John Napier and the invention of logarithms, 1614; a lecture|last=Hobson|first=Ernest William|date=1914|publisher=Cambridge : University Press|others=University of California Libraries}}</ref> They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, surveyors and others to perform high-accuracy computations more easily. Using [[Mathematical table|logarithm tables]], tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition. This is possible because of the fact\u2014important in its own right\u2014that the logarithm of a [[product (mathematics)|product]] is the [[summation|sum]] of the logarithms of the factors:\n:<math> \\log_b(xy) = \\log_b x + \\log_b y, \\,</math>\nprovided that {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are all positive and {{math|''b'' \u2260 1}}. The [[slide rule]], also based on logarithms, allows quick calculations without tables, but at lower precision.\nThe present-day notion of logarithms comes from [[Leonhard Euler]], who connected them to the [[exponential function]] in the 18th century, and who also introduced the letter {{mvar|e}} as the base of natural logarithms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theory of complex functions|last=Remmert, Reinhold.|date=1991|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0387971955|location=New York|oclc=21118309}}</ref>\n\n[[Logarithmic scale]]s reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes. For example, the [[decibel]] (dB) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] used to express [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|ratio as logarithms]], mostly for signal power and amplitude (of which [[sound pressure]] is a common example). In chemistry, [[pH]] is a logarithmic measure for the [[acid]]ity of an [[aqueous solution]]. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific [[formula]]e, and in measurements of the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity of algorithms]] and of geometric objects called [[fractal]]s. They help to describe [[frequency]] ratios of [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]], appear in formulas counting [[prime number]]s or [[Stirling's approximation|approximating]] [[factorial]]s, inform some models in [[psychophysics]], and can aid in [[forensic accounting]].\n\nIn the same way as the logarithm reverses [[exponentiation]], the [[complex logarithm]] is the [[inverse function]] of the exponential function applied to [[complex number]]s. The modular [[discrete logarithm]] is another variant; it has uses in [[public-key cryptography]].\n\n==Motivation and definition==\n\n[[Addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] are three of the most fundamental arithmetic operations. Addition, the simplest of these, is undone by subtraction: when you add {{math|5}} to {{mvar|x}} to get {{math|''x'' + 5}}, to reverse this operation you need to ''subtract'' {{math|5}} from {{math|''x'' + 5}}. Multiplication, the next-simplest operation, is undone by [[division (mathematics)|division]]: if you multiply {{mvar|x}} by {{math|5}} to get {{math|5''x''}}, you then must divide {{math|5''x''}} by {{math|5}} in order to return to the original expression {{mvar|x}}. Logarithms also undo a fundamental arithmetic operation, exponentiation.  Exponentiation is when you raise a number to a certain power. For example, raising {{math|2}} to the power {{math|3}} equals {{math|8}}:\n\n: <math>2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8</math>\n\nThe general case is when you raise a number {{Math|''b''}} to the power of {{Math|''y''}} to get {{Math|''x''}}:\n\n: <math>b^y=x</math>\n\nThe number {{Math|''b''}} is referred to as the base of this expression. The base is the number that is raised to a particular power\u2014in the above example, the base of the expression  <math>2^3=8</math> is {{Math|2}}. It is easy to make the base the subject of the expression: all you have to do is take the {{nowrap|{{mvar|y}}-th}} root of both sides. This gives:\n\n: <math>b=\\sqrt[y]{{x}}</math>\n\nIt is less easy to make {{Math|''y''|}} the subject of the expression. Logarithms allow us to do this:\n\n: <math>y=</math>{{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&nbsp;''x''}}\n\nThis expression means that {{mvar|y}} is equal to the power that you need to raise {{mvar|b}} to in order to get {{mvar|x|}}. This operation undoes exponentiation because the logarithm of {{mvar|''x''}} tells you the ''exponent'' that the base has been raised to.\n\n===Exponentiation===\nThis subsection contains a short overview of the exponentiation operation, which is fundamental to understanding logarithms.\nRaising {{mvar|b}} to the {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power, where {{mvar|n}} is a [[natural number]], is done by multiplying {{mvar|n}} factors equal to {{mvar|b}}. The {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power of {{mvar|b}} is written {{math|''b''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, so that\n\n: <math>b^n = \\underbrace{b \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times b}_{n \\text{ factors}}</math>\n\nExponentiation may be extended to {{math|''b''<sup>''y''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|b}} is a positive number and the ''exponent'' {{mvar|y}} is any [[real number]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Shirali| first1=Shailesh|title=A Primer on Logarithms|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-414-6|year=2002|location=Hyderabad|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0b0igbb3WaQC}}}}, esp. section 2</ref> For example, {{math|''b''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of {{mvar|b}}, that is, {{math|1/''b''}}. Raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to the power 1/2 is the [[square root]] of ''{{mvar|b}}''.\n\nMore generally, raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to a [[rational number|rational]] power {{math|''p''/''q''}}, where {{Mvar|p}} and {{Mvar|q}} are integers, is given by\n\n:<math>b^{p / q} = \\sqrt[q]{b^p},</math>\n\nthe {{Mvar|q}}-th root of <math>b^p\\!\\!</math>. \n\nFinally, any [[irrational number]] (a real number which is not rational) ''{{mvar|y}}'' can be approximated to arbitrary precision by rational numbers. This can be used to compute the ''{{mvar|y}}''-th power of ''{{mvar|b}}'': for example <math>\\sqrt 2 \\approx 1.414 ...</math> and <math>b^{\\sqrt 2}</math> is increasingly well approximated by <math>b^1, b^{1.4}, b^{1.41}, b^{1.414}, ...</math>.

Archimedes had written ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'' in the third century BC, but a quadrature for the hyperbola eluded all efforts until Saint-Vincent published his results in 1647. The relation that the logarithm provides between a [[geometric progression]] in its [[argument of a function|argument]] and an [[arithmetic progression]] of values, prompted [[A. A. de Sarasa]] to make the connection of Saint-Vincent's quadrature and the tradition of logarithms in [[prosthaphaeresis]], leading to the term \"hyperbolic logarithm\", a synonym for natural logarithm. Soon the new function was appreciated by [[Christiaan Huygens]], and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]]. The notation Log y was adopted by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in 1675,<ref>[[Florian Cajori]] (1913) \"History of the exponential and logarithm concepts\", [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 20: 5, 35, 75, 107, 148, 173, 205.</ref> and the next year he connected it to the [[integral calculus|integral]]\n<math>\\int \\frac{dy}{y} .</math>\n\n==Logarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications{{anchor|Antilogarithm}}==\n[[Image:Logarithms Britannica 1797.png|thumb|360px|right|The 1797 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' explanation of logarithms]]\n\nBy simplifying difficult calculations before calculators and computers became available, logarithms contributed to the advance of science, especially [[astronomy]].

Briggs' first table contained the [[common logarithm]]s of all integers in the range 1\u20131000, with a precision of 14 digits. Subsequently, tables with increasing scope were written. These tables listed the values of {{math|log<sub>10</sub>''x''}}  for any number {{mvar|x}} in a certain range, at a certain precision. Base-10 logarithms were universally used for computation, hence the name common logarithm, since numbers that differ by factors of 10 have logarithms that differ by integers. The common logarithm of {{mvar|x}} can be separated into an [[integer part]] and a [[fractional part]], known as the characteristic and [[mantissa (logarithm)|mantissa]]. Tables of logarithms need only include the mantissa, as the characteristic can be easily determined by counting digits from the decimal point.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Spiegel | first1=Murray R. | last2=Moyer | first2=R.E. | title=Schaum's outline of college algebra | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location=New York | series=Schaum's outline series | isbn=978-0-07-145227-4 | year=2006}}, p.&nbsp;264</ref> The characteristic of {{math|10 \u00b7 {{mvar|x}}}} is one plus the characteristic of {{mvar|x}}, and their mantissas are the same.  Thus using a three-digit log table, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542 = \\log_{10}(1000 \\cdot 3.542) = 3 + \\log_{10}3.542 \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 \\, </math>\n\nGreater accuracy can be obtained by [[interpolation]]:\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542  \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 + 0.2 (\\log_{10}3.55-\\log_{10}3.54)\\, </math>\n\nThe value of {{math| 10<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be determined by reverse look up in the same table, since the logarithm is a [[monotonic function]].\n\n===Computations===\nThe product and quotient of two positive numbers {{Mvar|c}} and ''{{Mvar|d}}'' were routinely calculated as the sum and difference of their logarithms. The product ''{{Mvar|cd}}'' or quotient {{Mvar|c/d}} came from looking up the antilogarithm of the sum or difference, via the same table:\n\n:<math> c d = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c} \\, 10^{\\ \\log_{10} d} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c + \\ \\log_{10} d} \\,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac c d = c d^{-1} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c - \\ \\log_{10} d}. \\,</math>\n\nFor manual calculations that demand any appreciable precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier methods such as [[prosthaphaeresis]], which relies on [[trigonometric identities]].\n\nCalculations of powers and [[nth root|roots]] are reduced to multiplications or divisions and look-ups by\n:<math>c^d = \\left(10^{\\ \\log_{10} c}\\right)^d =  10^{d \\ \\log_{10} c} \\,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\sqrt[d]{c} = c^\\frac{1}{d} = 10^{\\frac{1}{d} \\ \\log_{10} c}. \\,</math>\n\nTrigonometric calculations were facilitated by tables that contained the common logarithms of [[trigonometric function]]s.\n\n===Slide rules===\nAnother critical application was the [[slide rule]], a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation. The non-sliding logarithmic scale, [[Gunter's rule]], was invented shortly after Napier's invention. [[William Oughtred]] enhanced it to create the slide rule\u2014a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms, as illustrated here:\n\n[[Image:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|center|thumb|550px|Schematic depiction of a slide rule. Starting from 2 on the lower scale, add the distance to 3 on the upper scale to reach the product 6. The slide rule works because it is marked such that the distance from 1 to {{mvar|x}} is proportional to the logarithm of {{mvar|x}}.|alt=A slide rule: two rectangles with logarithmically ticked axes, arrangement to add the distance from 1 to 2 to the distance from 1 to 3, indicating the product 6.]]\n\nFor example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, at the expense of precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\n{{Harvard citations\n |last1=Maor |year=2009 |nb=yes |loc=sections 1, 13}}</ref>\n\n==Analytic properties==\nA deeper study of logarithms requires the concept of a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]''.

A function is ''continuous'' if it does not \"jump\", that is, if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.\n\nThis property can be shown to hold for the function {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}. Because ''{{mvar|f}}'' takes arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small positive values, any number {{math|''y'' > 0}} lies between {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} and {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>)}} for suitable {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}. Hence, the intermediate value theorem ensures that the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|y}}}} has a solution. Moreover, there is only one solution to this equation, because the function ''f'' is [[monotonic function|strictly increasing]] (for {{math|''b'' > 1}}), or strictly decreasing (for {{math|0 < {{mvar|b}} < 1}}).<ref name=LangIV.2>{{Harvard citations|last1=Lang|year=1997 |nb=yes|loc=section IV.2}}</ref>\n\nThe unique solution {{mvar|x}} is the logarithm of {{mvar|y}} to base {{mvar|b}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

Conversely, given a positive number {{mvar|y}}, the formula\n:<math>b^{\\log_b y} = y</math>\nsays that first taking the logarithm and then exponentiating gives back {{mvar|y}}. Thus, the two possible ways of combining (or [[function composition|composing]]) logarithms and exponentiation give back the original number. Therefore, the logarithm to base {{mvar|b}} is the ''[[inverse function]]'' of {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Stewart | first1=James | title=Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont|isbn=978-0-495-01169-9 | year=2007}}, section 1.6</ref>\n\nInverse functions are closely related to the original functions. Their [[graph of a function|graphs]] correspond to each other upon exchanging the {{mvar|x}}- and the {{mvar|y}}-coordinates (or upon reflection at the diagonal line {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}}), as shown at the right: a point {{math|1=(''t'', ''u'' = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''t''</sup>)}} on the graph of ''f'' yields a point {{math|1=(''u'', ''t'' = log<sub>''b''</sub>''u'')}} on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. As a consequence, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} [[divergent sequence|diverges to infinity]] (gets bigger than any given number) if {{mvar|x}} grows to infinity, provided that {{mvar|b}} is greater than one. In that case, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}}  is an [[increasing function]]. For {{math|''b'' < 1}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} tends to minus infinity instead.

''m'' is chosen such that\n\n:<math>x \\,2^m > 2^{p/2}.\\, </math>\n\nto ensure the required precision. A larger ''m'' makes the {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}} calculation take more steps (the initial x and y are farther apart so it takes more steps to converge) but gives more precision. The constants {{math|pi}} and {{math|ln(2)}} can be calculated with quickly converging series.\n\n===Feynman's algorithm===\nWhile at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] working on the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Richard Feynman]] developed a bit-processing algorithm that is similar to long division and was later used in the [[Connection Machine]]. The algorithm uses the fact that every real number <math> 1 < x < 2 </math> is representable as a product of distinct factors of the form <math> 1 + 2^{-k} </math>. The algorithm sequentially builds that product <math>P</math>: if <math>P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) < x</math>, then it changes <math>P</math> to <math> P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) </math>. It then increase <math>k</math> by one regardless. The algorithm stops when <math>k</math> is large enough to give the desired accuracy.

This discontinuity arises from jumping to the other boundary in the same branch, when crossing a boundary, i.e., not changing to the corresponding {{mvar|k}}-value of the continuously neighboring branch.
