{"title_page": "State Board of Equalization (California)", "text_new": "{{short description|Tax administration agency of California, United States}}\n{{update|date=April 2014}}\nThe '''State Board of Equalization''' (BOE) is a public agency charged with [[Tax|tax administration]] and [[Fee|fee collection]] in the state of [[California]] in the [[United States]]. The authorities of the Board fall into four broad areas: [[Sales tax|sales]] and [[use tax]]es, [[property tax]]es, special taxes, and acting as an appellate body for [[Franchise tax|franchise]] and [[income tax]] appeals (which are collected by the [[California Franchise Tax Board|Franchise Tax Board]]).<ref name=\"about\">State Board of Equalization, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/info/about.htm About BOE]</ref> The BOE is the only publicly elected tax commission in the United States.<ref name=\"members\">State Board of Equalization, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/members/board.htm Board Members]</ref> The board is made up of four directly elected members, each representing a [[Districts in California|district]] for four-year terms, along with the [[California State Controller|State Controller]], who is elected on a statewide basis, serving as the fifth member.  In June 2017, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed legislation stripping the Board of many of its powers, returning the agency to its original core responsibilities (originating in the State Constitution in 1879).\n\n==History==\nThe State Board of Equalization was created in 1879 by the ratification of the second [[Constitution of California]]. Its original mandate was to ensure that property [[tax assessment]]s were uniform and equal across all counties in the state.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nPrior to the creation of the state [[income tax]], [[sales tax]], and [[fuel tax]]es in the 1930s, California's state government was almost completely supported by [[property tax]]es, which were and still are assessed at the county level by elected tax assessors.  Assessors were tempted to boost their popularity with county voters by undervaluing voters' property (and thereby lowering their taxes).  This presented the risk of counties with honest assessors paying more than their fair share of the burden of operating the state government, so the Board of Equalization was created to equalize the burden.\n\nThe [[California Franchise Tax Board]] and the [[Employment Development Department]] are separately also responsible for collecting taxes.<ref name=SacBee23April17/> Some have criticized this as inefficient.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=lawreview Daniel L.

In 2004, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] released a 2,500-page report seeking to merge the Board with other agencies and then promoted a bill by Assemblywoman [[Lois Wolk]] to do just that. The effort failed.<ref name=SacBee23April17/> In 2008, the agency employed approximately 3,950 people throughout the state.<ref name=\"annual_report_districts_2008\">State Board of Equalization, 2007-2008 Annual Report, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/annual/pdf/2008/1-profile08.pdf Profile], \"Governance\" p. 3.</ref>\n\nBy 2017, the Board had expanded to collecting $60 billion a year. It collected sales and use taxes, hazardous waste fees, jet fuel taxes, marijuana taxes, and over 30 additional taxes. That year, the Board had 4,700 employees and a $617 million annual budget. Board members are paid a $137,000 annual salary and are each allowed to hire a 12-member staff. Each year, the Board spends at least $3 million on education events where elected members appear before their constituents.<ref name=SacBee23April17/>\n\nIn March 2017, an audit by the [[California Department of Finance]] revealed missing funds and signs of [[nepotism]], leading to calls for the governor to put the Board under a public trustee.<ref name=SacBee24March17>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=Audit: California tax collectors on \u2018parking lot duty\u2019 for promotional events as politicos push boundaries|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article140474853.html|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=24 March 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=Here\u2019s the audit shaking up the Board of Equalization|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article142026614.html|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=31 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>  In June 2017, the [[California Department of Justice]] began a criminal investigation into the members of the Board.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=Criminal investigation targets California tax board leaders|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article157058439.html|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=20 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn June 27, 2017, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed into law legislation stripping the Board of many of its powers.

of California, United States}}\n{{update|date=April 2014}}\nThe '''State Board of Equalization''' (BOE) is a public agency charged with [[Tax|tax administration]] and [[Fee|fee collection]] in the state of [[California]] in the [[United States]]. The authorities of the Board fall into four broad areas: [[Sales tax|sales]] and [[use tax]]es, [[property tax]]es, special taxes, and acting as an appellate body for [[Franchise tax|franchise]] and [[income tax]] appeals (which are collected by the [[California Franchise Tax Board|Franchise Tax Board]]).<ref name=\"about\">State Board of Equalization, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/info/about.htm About BOE]</ref> The BOE is the only publicly elected tax commission in the United States.<ref name=\"members\">State Board of Equalization, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/members/board.htm Board Members]</ref> The board is made up of four directly elected members, each representing a [[Districts in California|district]] for four-year terms, along with the [[California State Controller|State Controller]], who is elected on a statewide basis, serving as the fifth member.  In June 2017, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed legislation stripping the Board of many of its powers, returning the agency to its original core responsibilities (originating in the State Constitution in 1879).\n\n==History==\nThe State Board of Equalization was created in 1879 by the ratification of the second [[Constitution of California]]. Its original mandate was to ensure that property [[tax assessment]]s were uniform and equal across all counties in the state.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nPrior to the creation of the state [[income tax]], [[sales tax]], and [[fuel tax]]es in the 1930s, California's state government was almost completely supported by [[property tax]]es, which were and still are assessed at the county level by elected tax assessors.  Assessors were tempted to boost their popularity with county voters by undervaluing voters' property (and thereby lowering their taxes).  This presented the risk of counties with honest assessors paying more than their fair share of the burden of operating the state government, so the Board of Equalization was created to equalize the burden.\n\nThe [[California Franchise Tax Board]] and the [[Employment Development Department]] are separately also responsible for collecting taxes.<ref name=SacBee23April17/> Some have criticized this as inefficient.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=lawreview Daniel L. Simmons, ''California Tax Collection: Time for Reform''], 48 Santa Clara L. Rev. 279 (2008).</ref>  Efforts to reform the Board were made in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1990s, and 2000s.<ref name=SacBee23April17>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=For 90 years, Californians have tried to kill this tax board.

In 2004, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] released a 2,500-page report seeking to merge the Board with other agencies and then promoted a bill by Assemblywoman [[Lois Wolk]] to do just that. The effort failed.<ref name=SacBee23April17/> In 2008, the agency employed approximately 3,950 people throughout the state.<ref name=\"annual_report_districts_2008\">State Board of Equalization, 2007-2008 Annual Report, [http://www.boe.ca.gov/annual/pdf/2008/1-profile08.pdf Profile], \"Governance\" p. 3.</ref>\n\nBy 2017, the Board had expanded to collecting $60 billion a year. It collected sales and use taxes, hazardous waste fees, jet fuel taxes, marijuana taxes, and over 30 additional taxes. That year, the Board had 4,700 employees and a $617 million annual budget. Board members are paid a $137,000 annual salary and are each allowed to hire a 12 member staff. Each year, the Board spends at least $3 million on education events where elected members appear before their constituents.<ref name=SacBee23April17/>\n\nIn March 2017, an audit by the [[California Department of Finance]] revealed missing funds and signs of [[nepotism]], leading to calls for the governor to put the Board under a public trustee.<ref name=SacBee24March17>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=Audit: California tax collectors on \u2018parking lot duty\u2019 for promotional events as politicos push boundaries|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article140474853.html|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=24 March 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=Here\u2019s the audit shaking up the Board of Equalization|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/the-state-worker/article142026614.html|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=31 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>  In June 2017, the [[California Department of Justice]] began a criminal investigation into the members of the Board.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=Adam|title=Criminal investigation targets California tax board leaders|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article157058439.html|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=20 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn June 27, 2017, Governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed into law legislation stripping the Board of many of its powers.

Formed in 1981 with the line-up of Bannister (guitar & vocals), David Pine (guitar & vocals), Kat Tyrie (bass guitar & vocals) and Martin Durrant (drums & vocals), Tyrie was replaced by Kelcher in 1983. Durrant was temporarily replaced by [[Ross Burge]] from 1988-1992 but later returned, maintaining the line up of Bannister, Pine, Kelcher and Durrant which continues. \n\nSneaky Feelings are unusual among [[Dunedin sound]] bands in that all four members of the band sing and write songs. The jangle sound of the guitars and layered vocals drew their influence from the music of [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beatles]], and comparisons can be made with some of California's [[Paisley Underground]] bands. \n\nThe band's name comes from a song by [[Elvis Costello]], \"Sneaky Feelings\", which is on his first album ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (1977).\n\n==History==\nSneaky Feelings were one of four [[Dunedin]] bands to reap the benefits of the newly formed Flying Nun label with the release of the ''[[Dunedin Double (EP)|Dunedin Double]]'' EP in 1982, alongside [[the Stones (New Zealand band)|the Stones]], [[the Verlaines]] and [[the Chills]]. Sneaky Feelings were drawn to a wider variety of musical styles than most early Flying Nun bands and were one of the first to experiment in the recording studio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELING Progress Junction Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However the multi-voiced harmonies of the band's sound were not well-suited to the primitive recording conditions of early Flying Nun, so it is rarely captured at its best on the albums they released. The band's biggest hit has been their single \"Husband House\" in 1985, which reached #16 on NZ charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyingnun.co.nz/news/sneaky-feelings-announce-new-album-the-mercury-moment/2020?rq=Sneaky%20Feelings|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS ANNOUNCE NEW ALBUM 'THE MERCURY MOMENT'|last=|first=|date=17 February 2020|website=Flying Nun Records|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the demise of Sneaky Feelings in 1989, Bannister moved to Auckland where he founded the [[Dribbling Darts of Love|Dribbling Darts]]. He later worked briefly with [[the Mutton Birds]] alongside Ross Burge. Subsequently Bannister formed the band [[The Weather (band)|The Weather]]. He also wrote a book about the experience of being in a band during the heyday of the Dunedin sound movement - ''Positively George Street''. Pine has returned sporadically to music, notably in the Dunedin-based band Death Ray Cafe in the late 1980s, but his involvement in music has been largely curtailed by his work in the New Zealand diplomatic corps ({{As of|2012|lc=y}} he is New Zealand's [[List of High Commissioners from New Zealand to Malaysia|High Commissioner in Malaysia]]). Sneaky Feelings briefly re-formed in 1992 to record several extra tracks and to tour to promote the CD release of ''[[Send You]]''. They also re-formed to perform a one-off concert as part of a celebration of Dunedin music, held in that city in 2006. In early 2008, Kelcher formed The South Tonight with Richard James, who had also been in an early Flying Nun group, Mainly Spaniards. Kelcher later stood as a candidate for the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]] in the [[2014 New Zealand general election]], for the Christchurch seat of [[Ilam (New Zealand electorate)|Ilam]].\n\nWhile Sneaky Feelings may have not played much over the years, the individual members have continued to hone their songwriting skills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS Progress Junction Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After a 29 year hiatus, the band released Progress Junction in 2017. It was recorded over two years in bass player John Kelcher\u2019s Christchurch studio, with each band member contributing three tracks. They experimented with weaving in snippets of audio from New Zealand radio archives and voices from the past started talking to the present.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS\nProgress Junction\nFlying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Progress Junction received wide praise from critics at home, including Sunday Star Time\u2019s Jack Barlow who dubbed it ''\u201ca vibrant and fresh offering from one of New Zealand\u2019s finest\u201d'' to William Dart (RNZ New Horizons ) who referred to the album as ''\u201cthe unexpected renaissance of one of my favourite bands of all time.\u201d'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyingnun.co.nz/news|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS ANNOUNCE NEW ALBUM 'THE MERCURY MOMENT'|last=|first=|date=17 February 2020|website=Flying Nun Records|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Nick Bollinger of RNZ wrote \"David Pine and Matthew Bannister, who wrote the first and second song respectively, were always the chief songwriters in the Sneakies and as these opening tracks show, neither has lost their touch.

It was released 17th April 2020 on Flying Nun Records and the quartet's Bandcamp page. They announced the forthcoming 12 song LP after a rare performance on [[Waitangi Day]] 2020. The Mercury Moment is a \"...potent exploration of extinction, redundancy and disappointed dreams as the four songwriters cast their attention on the current state of the world. Over a songbook of twelve songs, Matthew Bannister, David Pine, Martin Durrant and John Kelcher ruminate on the \u201cludicrous hopes and bleak future\u201d of humanity that is being avoided. As stark realities are shared, a nonchalant musical backdrop accompanies the songs with chilling indifference.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sneakyfeelings.bandcamp.com/album/the-mercury-moment|title=The Mercury Moment|last=|first=|date=17 April 2020|website=bandcamp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Date\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Title\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Label\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Charted\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Country\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Catalog number\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"\n| colspan=7 align=center | '''Albums'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1983\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Send You]]''<ref>released on CD with extra tracks in 1992</ref>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FEEL 1\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1986\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Sentimental Education (Sneaky Feelings album)|Sentimental Education]]''\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FEEL 6; FNE 14CD\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1986\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Waiting for Touchdown]]'' (compilation)\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FN ANDA62\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1988\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Hard Love Stories]]''\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FN112; FNE 26 CD\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1999\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Positively George Street]]'' (compilation)\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FNCD441\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|2017\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''Progress Junction''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS \u2013 Progress Junction (CD) \u2013 Flying Out|work=[[Flying Nun Records]]|accessdate=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|FN579LP\n|-\n|2020\n|''The Mercury Moment'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/collections/all/products/sneaky-feelings-the-mercury-moment|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS The Mercury Moment Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=17 February 2020|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n| -\n|Aotearoa / NZ\n|FN592\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"\n| colspan=7 align=center | '''EPs'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1982\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Dunedin Double (EP)|Dunedin Double]]''<ref>along with [[The Chills]], [[The Stones (New Zealand band)|The Stones]] and [[The Verlaines]]</ref>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FN DUN 1/2\n|-\n|}\n\n===Featured appearances===\nThe group appeared on several compilations over the years in New Zealand.

Formed in 1981 with the line-up of Bannister (guitar & vocals), David Pine (guitar & vocals), Kat Tyrie (bass guitar & vocals) and Martin Durrant (drums & vocals), Tyrie was replaced by Kelcher in 1983. Durrant was temporarily replaced by [[Ross Burge]] from 1988-1992 but later returned, maintaining the line up of Bannister, Pine, Kelcher and Durrant which continues. \n\nSneaky Feelings are unusual among [[Dunedin sound]] bands in that all four members of the band sing and write songs. The jangle sound of the guitars and layered vocals drew their influence from the music of [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beatles]], and comparisons can be made with some of California's [[Paisley Underground]] bands. \n\nThe band's name comes from a song by [[Elvis Costello]], \"Sneaky Feelings\", which is on his first album ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (1977).\n\n==History==\nSneaky Feelings were one of four [[Dunedin]] bands to reap the benefits of the newly formed Flying Nun label with the release of the ''[[Dunedin Double (EP)|Dunedin Double]]'' EP in 1982, alongside [[the Stones (New Zealand band)|the Stones]], [[the Verlaines]] and [[the Chills]]. Sneaky Feelings were drawn to a wider variety of musical styles than most early Flying Nun bands and were one of the first to experiment in the recording studio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELING Progress Junction Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However the multi-voiced harmonies of the band's sound were not well-suited to the primitive recording conditions of early Flying Nun, so it is rarely captured at its best on the albums they released. The band's biggest hit has been their single \"Husband House\" in 1985, which reached #16 on NZ charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyingnun.co.nz/news/sneaky-feelings-announce-new-album-the-mercury-moment/2020?rq=Sneaky%20Feelings|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS ANNOUNCE NEW ALBUM 'THE MERCURY MOMENT'|last=|first=|date=17 February 2020|website=Flying Nun Records|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the demise of Sneaky Feelings in 1989, Bannister moved to Auckland where he founded the [[Dribbling Darts of Love|Dribbling Darts]]. He later worked briefly with [[the Mutton Birds]] alongside Ross Burge. Subsequently Bannister formed the band [[The Weather (band)|The Weather]]. He also wrote a book about the experience of being in a band during the heyday of the Dunedin sound movement - ''Positively George Street''. Pine has returned sporadically to music, notably in the Dunedin-based band Death Ray Cafe in the late 1980s, but his involvement in music has been largely curtailed by his work in the New Zealand diplomatic corps ({{As of|2012|lc=y}} he is New Zealand's [[List of High Commissioners from New Zealand to Malaysia|High Commissioner in Malaysia]]). Sneaky Feelings briefly re-formed in 1992 to record several extra tracks and to tour to promote the CD release of ''[[Send You]]''. They also re-formed to perform a one-off concert as part of a celebration of Dunedin music, held in that city in 2006. In early 2008, Kelcher formed The South Tonight with Richard James, who had also been in an early Flying Nun group, Mainly Spaniards. Kelcher later stood as a candidate for the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]] in the [[2014 New Zealand general election]], for the Christchurch seat of [[Ilam (New Zealand electorate)|Ilam]].\n\nWhile Sneaky Feelings may have not played much over the years, the individual members have continued to hone their songwriting skills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS Progress Junction Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After a 29 year hiatus, the band released Progress Junction in 2017. It was recorded over two years in bass player John Kelcher\u2019s Christchurch studio, with each band member contributing three tracks. They experimented with weaving in snippets of audio from New Zealand radio archives and voices from the past started talking to the present.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS\nProgress Junction\nFlying Nun|last=|first=|date=2017|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Progress Junction received wide praise from critics at home, including Sunday Star Time\u2019s Jack Barlow who dubbed it ''\u201ca vibrant and fresh offering from one of New Zealand\u2019s finest\u201d'' to William Dart (RNZ New Horizons) who referred to the album as ''\u201cthe unexpected renaissance of one of my favourite bands of all time.\u201d'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://flyingnun.co.nz/news|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS ANNOUNCE NEW ALBUM 'THE MERCURY MOMENT'|last=|first=|date=17 February 2020|website=Flying Nun Records|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSneaky Feelings latest LP is The Mercury Moment. It was released 17th April 2020 on Flying Nun Records and the quartet's Bandcamp page. They announced the forthcoming 12 song LP after a rare performance on [[Waitangi Day]] 2020. The Mercury Moment is a \"...potent exploration of extinction, redundancy and disappointed dreams as the four songwriters cast their attention on the current state of the world. Over a songbook of twelve songs, Matthew Bannister, David Pine, Martin Durrant and John Kelcher ruminate on the \u201cludicrous hopes and bleak future\u201d of humanity that is being avoided. As stark realities are shared, a nonchalant musical backdrop accompanies the songs with chilling indifference.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sneakyfeelings.bandcamp.com/album/the-mercury-moment|title=The Mercury Moment|last=|first=|date=17 April 2020|website=bandcamp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Date\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Title\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Label\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Charted\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Country\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|Catalog number\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"\n| colspan=7 align=center | '''Albums'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1983\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Send You]]''<ref>released on CD with extra tracks in 1992</ref>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FEEL 1\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1986\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Sentimental Education (Sneaky Feelings album)|Sentimental Education]]''\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FEEL 6; FNE 14CD\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1986\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Waiting for Touchdown]]'' (compilation)\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FN ANDA62\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1988\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Hard Love Stories]]''\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FN112; FNE 26 CD\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1999\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Positively George Street]]'' (compilation)\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FNCD441\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|2017\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''Progress Junction''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/products/progress-junction|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS \u2013 Progress Junction (CD) \u2013 Flying Out|work=[[Flying Nun Records]]|accessdate=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| Aotearoa / NZ\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|FN579LP\n|-\n|2020\n|''The Mercury Moment'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyingout.co.nz/collections/all/products/sneaky-feelings-the-mercury-moment|title=SNEAKY FEELINGS The Mercury Moment Flying Nun|last=|first=|date=17 February 2020|website=Flying Out|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n| -\n|Aotearoa / NZ\n|FN592\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"\n| colspan=7 align=center | '''EPs'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|1982\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|''[[Dunedin Double (EP)|Dunedin Double]]''<ref>along with [[The Chills]], [[The Stones (New Zealand band)|The Stones]] and [[The Verlaines]]</ref>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"|[[Flying Nun Records]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| -\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"center\"| FN DUN 1/2\n|-\n|}\n\n===Featured appearances===\nThe group appeared on several compilations over the years in New Zealand.

The series stars [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]. The show was a companion piece of sorts to the radio drama ''[[I Was a Communist for the FBI]]'', which dealt with a similar subject and was also syndicated by Ziv from 1952 to 1954.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe series was loosely based on the life of [[Herbert Philbrick]], a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] advertising executive who infiltrated the [[Communist Party USA|U.S. Communist Party]] on behalf of the [[FBI]] in the 1940s and wrote a bestselling book on the topic, ''I Led Three Lives: Citizen, 'Communist', Counterspy'' (1952). The part of Philbrick was played by Richard Carlson. The \"three lives\" in the title are Philbrick's outward life as a [[white-collar worker]], his secret life as a Communist agent, and his even more secret life as an FBI operative helping to foil Communist plots.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |title=Herbert Philbrick, 78, F.B.I.

The series stars [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]. The show was a companion piece of sorts to the radio drama ''[[I Was a Communist for the FBI]]'', which dealt with a similar subject and was also syndicated by Ziv from 1952 to 1954.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe series was loosely based on the life of [[Herbert Philbrick]], a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] advertising executive who infiltrated the [[Communist Party USA|U.S. Communist Party]] on behalf of the [[FBI]] in the 1940s and wrote a bestselling book on the topic, ''I Led Three Lives: Citizen, 'Communist', Counterspy'' (1952). The part of Philbrick was played by Richard Carlson. The \"three lives\" in the title are Philbrick's outward life as a [[white-collar worker]], his secret life as a Communist agent, and his even more secret life as an FBI operative helping to foil Communist plots.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |title=Herbert Philbrick, 78, F.B.I.

{"title_page": "Technology acceptance model", "text_new": "[[File:Technology Acceptance Model.png|250px|thumb|The Technology Acceptance Model, version 1. ({{harvnb|Davis|Bagozzi|Warshaw|1989}})]]\n\nThe '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.  \n\nThe '''actual system use''' is the end-point where we want everyone to be able to do with technology, so we have to form '''Behavioral Intention''', which is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The behavioral intention (BI) is influenced by the '''attitude''' (A) which is the general impression of the technology.\n\nThe model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:\n\n*'''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) \u2013 This was defined by Fred Davis as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]\". It means whether or not someone perceives that technology to be useful for what they want to do.\n*'''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) \u2013 Davis defined this as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort\" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}). If the technology is easy to use, then the barriers conquered. If it's not easy to use and the interface is complicated, no one has a positive attitudes towards it.\n\n'''External variables''' such as social influence is an important factor to determine the attitude. When these things (TAM) are in place, people will have the attitude and intention to use the technology.However, the perception may change depending on age and gender because everyone is different.\n\nThe TAM has been continuously studied and expanded\u2014the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} & {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).\n\n==Background==\n\nTAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)\nis the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology\n(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747\u2013768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}</ref>). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).\n\nBagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:\n\n:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})\n\nEarlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms \"task fit\" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.\n\n==Usage==\nSeveral researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.\n\nSegars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.\n\nMark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2\u00d72 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).\nThe TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604\u2013634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}</ref>\n\nVenkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n\n* '''Subjective norm''' \u2013 An individual's perception that other individuals who are important to him/she consider if he/she could perform a behavior. This was consistent with the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA).\n* '''Voluntariness''' \u2013 This was defined by Venkatesh & Davis as \"extent to which potential adopters perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory\" ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Image''' \u2013 This was defined by Moore & Benbasat as \"the degree to which use of an innovation perceived to enhance one's status in one's social system\" ({{Harvnb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gary C.|last2=Benbasat|first2=Izak|date=1991-09-01|title=Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=192\u2013222|doi=10.1287/isre.2.3.192|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>).\n* '''Job relevance''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perspective on the extent to which the target system is suitable for the job ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Output quality''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perception of the system's ability to perform specific tasks ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Result demonstrability''' \u2013 The production of tangible results will directly influence the system's usefulness ({{Harnvb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}).\n\nIn an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.<ref name=hf2010>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Huser | first1 = V. \n| last2 = Narus | first2 = S. P. \n| last3 = Rocha | first3 = R.

The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), \"Living in the State of Stuck\", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.\n# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.\n# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments\n|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238\u2013247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nTAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a \"theory\" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM \"has diverted researchers' attention away from other \nimportant research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the \nindependent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion\" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29\u201347|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).\n\nLegris et al.<ref>Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.</ref> claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.\n\nBased on more fundamental models, Li <ref name=\"Li2020\">Li, Jerry  (2020), Blockchain technology adoption: Examining the Fundamental Drivers, ''Conference Proceedings, 2020 International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering'',  https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.30288.25602 (preprint version)</ref> demonstrated that better predictive power can be achieved by proper initial screening. The results provide insights for research design under real business settings. \n\nPerceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}). Li <ref name=\"Li2020\"/> also reported similar observations when investigating the adoption of Blockchain technology.\n\nA study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. & Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]]\n* [[Diffusion of innovations]]\n* [[Domestication theory]]\n* [[Lazy user model]]\n* [[List of marketing topics]]\n* [[New product development]]\n* [[Product life cycle management]]\n* [[Research and development]]\n* [[Technology adoption lifecycle]]\n* [[Technology lifecycle]]\n* [[Theory of planned behavior]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* {{citation|last1=Adams|first1=D.

({{harvnb|Davis|Bagozzi|Warshaw|1989}})]]\n\nThe '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.  \n\nThe '''actual system use''' is the end-point where we want everyone to be able to do with technology, so we have to form '''Behavioral Intention''', which is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The behavioral intention (BI) is influenced by the '''attitude''' (A) which is the general impression of the technology.\n\nThe model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:\n\n*'''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) \u2013 This was defined by Fred Davis as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]\". It means whether or not someone perceives that technology to be useful for what they want to do.\n*'''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) \u2013 Davis defined this as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort\" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}). If the technology is easy to use, then the barriers conquered. If it's not easy to use and the interface is complicated, no one has a positive attitudes towards it.\n\n'''External variables''' such as social influence is an important factor to determine the attitude. When these things (TAM) are in place, people will have the attitude and intention to use the technology.However, the perception may change depending on age and gender because everyone is different.\n\nThe TAM has been continuously studied and expanded\u2014the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} & {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).\n\n==Background==\n\nTAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)\nis the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology\n(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747\u2013768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}</ref>). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).\n\nBagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:\n\n:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})\n\nEarlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms \"task fit\" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.\n\n==Usage==\nSeveral researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.\n\nSegars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.\n\nMark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2\u00d72 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).\nThe TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604\u2013634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}</ref>\n\nVenkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n\n* '''Subjective norm''' \u2013 An individual's perception that other individuals who are important to him/she consider if he/she could perform a behavior. This was consistent with the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA).\n* '''Voluntariness''' \u2013 This was defined by Venkatesh & Davis as \"extent to which potential adopters perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory\" ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Image''' \u2013 This was defined by Moore & Benbasat as \"the degree to which use of an innovation perceived to enhance one's status in one's social system\" ({{Harvnb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gary C.|last2=Benbasat|first2=Izak|date=1991-09-01|title=Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=192\u2013222|doi=10.1287/isre.2.3.192|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>).\n* '''Job relevance''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perspective on the extent to which the target system is suitable for the job ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Output quality''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perception of the system's ability to perform specific tasks ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Result demonstrability''' \u2013 The production of tangible results will directly influence the system's usefulness ({{Harnvb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}).\n\nIn an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.<ref name=hf2010>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Huser | first1 = V. \n| last2 = Narus | first2 = S. P. \n| last3 = Rocha | first3 = R.

The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), \"Living in the State of Stuck\", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.\n# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.\n# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments\n|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238\u2013247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nTAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a \"theory\" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM \"has diverted researchers' attention away from other \nimportant research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the \nindependent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion\" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29\u201347|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).\n\nLegris et al.<ref>Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.</ref> claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.\n\nBased on more fundamental models, Li <ref name=\"Li2020\">Li, Jerry  (2020), Blockchain technology adoption: Examining the Fundamental Drivers, ''Conference Proceedings, 2020 International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering'',  https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.17226.93123 (preprint version)</ref> demonstrated that better predictive power can be achieved by proper initial screening. The results provide insights for research design under real business settings. \n\nPerceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}). Li <ref name=\"Li2020\"/> also reported similar observations when investigating the adoption of Blockchain technology.\n\nA study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. & Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future.
