The SCASD does not explain its 97.5 graduation rate.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Education introduced cohort graduation rates in 2010\u20132011. The cohort graduation rates are a calculation of the percentage of students who have graduated with a regular high school diploma within a designated number of years since the student first entered high school. The rate is determined for a cohort of students who all entered any high school for the first time during the same school year.   The Pennsylvania Department of Education, Division of Data Quality, compiles statistical information covering the 4-Year, 5-Year, and 6-Year Graduation Rates for Pennsylvania public schools. Pennsylvania's public high schools provide the graduate and enrollment data through the Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS), which is used to calculate the above rates. However, for three sequential audits, 2010, 2013, and 2015 by the Pennsylvania Auditor General, the SCASD has been cited for PIMS deficiencies.

USN&WR used Pennsylvania Department of Education data: https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools)\n\n==State High Renovation Controversy==\nThere is a debate between school board members and an organization named State High Vision (SHV).  The school board plans [http://www.scasd.org/2497_10012214422/blank/browse.asp?A=383&BMDRN=2000&BCOB=0&C=53203&2497Nav=|&NodeID=409 High School Facilities Plan] to demolish one of the high school buildings and disintegrate the other.  The school board believes this is the most cost effective option and that they have looked at all of the options.  State High Vision, an organization of some community citizens, claims that the plan was decided on with little community input.  SHV also does not like the creation of what they deem a mega-school (3,400 students in one building), claiming that students learn better in a smaller environment.  About 200 students held walk outs in protest of the renovation project in 2007. Eric Topp provides a comprehensive description of the hullabaloo and opined incompetence by the school board at: http://www.erictopp.net/5.html  State College Area School District in Pennsylvania several years ago abandoned plans to build a new high school.    In May 2011 the district received  notice that it owed $10 million to the Royal Bank of Canada for skipping an interest payment on money it never borrowed for a school it didn't build. The State College case has an unusual twist reported by the Wall Street Journal. the district agreed to swap interest rates before it borrowed the money, called a forward swap; it filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court saying their ignorance made the contract void. The district skipped its first payment\u2014for $978,000. Royal Bank of Canada says the school authorized the debt\u2014even if it never borrowed money for the project\u2014and that the swap is valid. The court agreed. The SCASD earned the distinction of approving the only forward SWAP  by a school district in Pennsylvania and probably in the nation.  It was a failed attempt to circumvent the then new Pennsylvania Act 1 (2006) requiring public referendum for excessive constructive spending.. They did this despite advice from financial advisors not to.

The school board committed during public meetings urging support of the referendum that the cost would not exceed $115 million ($85 million debt plus $30 million capital reserve). During a March 28, 2016 school board meeting the total project cost was stated as $137,249,182, an increase of $7 million before construction has begun. http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article68731897.html#navlink=SecList Other estimates projected a total cost of $143 million. In June 2016, with construction only beginning, the actual cost increased to $140 million (22 percent over budget). http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/article85942462.html#navlink=Lead    Other estimates, by State College Watchdog, project a total cost of $150 million (30 percent over budget). The district superintendent Robert O'Donnell reportedly explained during a school board meeting on July 25 that the referendum was approved to pay for a concept not a project plan commitment of $115 million. The local newspaper, the Centre Daily Times printed an opinion article, \"Don't Be Fooled\" which accused the school district of strategic misrepresentation with respect to financial planning.http://www.centredaily.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article115985388.html#navlink=Lead\n\n==Elementary schools==\nThe SCASD has nine elementary schools. Here are the ratings at Nich.com based on Pennsylvania Department of Education reports.

Community emphasis and preference was to retain and refurbish neighborhood elementary schools as the top priority.  Despite the excellence and wide acceptance of the 2008 Master Plan.  District administrators and school board members had the plan rewritten in 2013 to favor closing smaller neighborhood schools, such as Corl Street and Lemont, in order to create larger consolidated elementary schools. The new plan was met with fierce opposition from the community. The local newspaper, the Centre Daily Times, archives provide details. Many residents contended that the proposals for mega elementary schools were costly, wasteful of valuable resources, and poorly envisioned for its historic properties. In particular, the proposal to close Lemont Elementary School [http://www.scasd.org/lemont/site/default.asp], a splendid limestone structure from the 1930s in the historic village of Lemont,  garnered community involvement. A group opposed to its closing has formed as the [http://www.friendsoflemontschool.roundtablelive.org/ Friends of Lemont School] to convince the District to remain committed to neighborhood schools and be respectful of its historic schools through rehabilitating them rather than abandoning them. In June 2016 the school board announced it will most likely close (called \"repurpose\" in education speak)  neighborhood schools again despite protests from parents and teachers.  Advocates speaking at high attendance public meetings emphasized that consolidating neighborhood schools contravened the 2008\u20132009 District Wide Facilities Master Plan in which refurbishment of neighborhood schools was afforded top priority.  Instead, in 2013, the priority was changed to building a mostly new high school (again exceeding the announced cost).  Architects and new consultants were hired to sell the revised master plan. As of June, 2014 with construction only beginning, the announced cost  increased from $115 to $140 million (an increase of $25 million or 22 percent). http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/article85942462.html#navlink=SecList\n\nThe $25 million high school cost overrun, as of June 2016, is more than half of the funds needed to refurbish all the elementary schools.\n\n==Special education==\nThe SCASD has not reported information for this section since 2010.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010\u20132011 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.  For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines, 2010</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the State College Area School District 2006\u20132007 through 2011\u20132016\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqCAjQ6eteArdFFCaWRjMUhzSkl5RTYxMjNJN1RQemc&hl=en#gid=0 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for  2006-2007 through 2010-2011, |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n*2006\u20132007 - 3.9%, Base 3.9%\n*2007\u20132008 - 3.4%, Base 3.4%\n*2008\u20132009 - 4.4%, Base 4.4%\n*2009\u20132010 - 4.1%, Base 4.1%\n*2010\u20132011 - 2.9%, Base 2.9%\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n*2011\u20132012 - 1.4%, Base 1.4% <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol40/40-38/1760.html |title=Index Calculation Required by the Taxpayer Relief Act |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=Sep 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Data Elements}}</ref>\n*2012\u20132013 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, September 2011</ref>\n*2013\u20132014 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, September 2012</ref>\n*2014\u20132015 - 2.1%, Base 2.1% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-2015 School District Adjusted Index, September 2013</ref>\n*2015\u20132016 - 5.5%, Base 1.9%\n*2016\u20132017 - 4.3%, Base 2.4%\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''For the 2015\u201316, and 2015\u20132017''' '''budget years,''' the State College Area School board levied the maxim Act 1 permitted tax increase with exceptions of 5.5 and 4.32 percent respectively.\n\n'''For the 2015\u201316 and 2015\u20132017 budget years,''' the State College Area School board did not evidence any attempt to restrain increased spending.\n\n'''For the 2013\u20132014 budget year''', State College Area School Board applied for one exception to exceed their Act 1 Index limit due to rapidly escalating teacher pension costs.

So are many parents. In plain English, the SCASD has a graduation rate of 91 percent for those students attending four years of high school. The SCASD does not explain its 97.5 graduation rate.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Education introduced cohort graduation rates in 2010\u20132011. The cohort graduation rates are a calculation of the percentage of students who have graduated with a regular high school diploma within a designated number of years since the student first entered high school. The rate is determined for a cohort of students who all entered any high school for the first time during the same school year.   The Pennsylvania Department of Education, Division of Data Quality, compiles statistical information covering the 4-Year, 5-Year, and 6-Year Graduation Rates for Pennsylvania public schools. Pennsylvania's public high schools provide the graduate and enrollment data through the Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS), which is used to calculate the above rates. However, for three sequential audits, 2010, 2013, and 2015 by the Pennsylvania Auditor General, the SCASD has been cited for PIMS deficiencies.

The school board plans [http://www.scasd.org/2497_10012214422/blank/browse.asp?A=383&BMDRN=2000&BCOB=0&C=53203&2497Nav=|&NodeID=409 High School Facilities Plan] to demolish one of the high school buildings and disintegrate the other.  The school board believes this is the most cost effective option and that they have looked at all of the options.  State High Vision, an organization of some community citizens, claims that the plan was decided on with little community input.  SHV also does not like the creation of what they deem a mega-school (3,400 students in one building), claiming that students learn better in a smaller environment.  About 200 students held walk outs in protest of the renovation project in 2007. Eric Topp provides a comprehensive description of the hullabaloo and opined incompetence by the school board at: http://www.erictopp.net/5.html  State College Area School District in Pennsylvania several years ago abandoned plans to build a new high school.    In May 2011 the district received  notice that it owed $10 million to the Royal Bank of Canada for skipping an interest payment on money it never borrowed for a school it didn't build. The State College case has an unusual twist reported by the Wall Street Journal. the district agreed to swap interest rates before it borrowed the money, called a forward swap; it filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court saying their ignorance made the contract void. The district skipped its first payment\u2014for $978,000. Royal Bank of Canada says the school authorized the debt\u2014even if it never borrowed money for the project\u2014and that the swap is valid. The court agreed. The SCASD earned the distinction of approving the only forward SWAP  by a school district in Pennsylvania and probably in the nation.  It was a failed attempt to circumvent the then new Pennsylvania Act 1 (2006) requiring public referendum for excessive constructive spending.. They did this despite advice from financial advisors not to.

The school board committed during public meetings urging support of the referendum that the cost would not exceed $115 million ($85 million debt plus $30 million capital reserve). During a March 28, 2016 school board meeting the total project cost was stated as $137,249,182, an increase of $7 million before construction has begun. http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article68731897.html#navlink=SecList Other estimates projected a total cost of $143 million. In June 2016, with construction only beginning, the actual cost increased to $140 million (22 percent over budget). http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/article85942462.html#navlink=Lead    Other estimates, by State College Watchdog, project a total cost of $150 million (30 percent over budget). The district superintendent Robert O'Donnell reportedly explained during a school board meeting on July 25 that the referendum was approved to pay for a concept not a project plan commitment of $115 million. The local newspaper, the Centre Daily Times printed an opinion article, \"Don't Be Fooled\" which accused the school district of strategic misrepresentation with respect to financial planning.http://www.centredaily.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article115985388.html#navlink=Lead\n\n==Elementary schools==\nThe SCASD has nine elementary schools.

Community emphasis and preference was to retain and refurbish neighborhood elementary schools as the top priority.  Despite the excellence and wide acceptance of the 2008 Master Plan.  District administrators and school board members had the plan rewritten in 2013 to favor closing smaller neighborhood schools, such as Corl Street and Lemont, in order to create larger consolidated elementary schools. The new plan was met with fierce opposition from the community. The local newspaper, the Centre Daily Times, archives provide details. Many residents contended that the proposals for mega elementary schools were costly, wasteful of valuable resources, and poorly envisioned for its historic properties. In particular, the proposal to close Lemont Elementary School [http://www.scasd.org/lemont/site/default.asp], a splendid limestone structure from the 1930s in the historic village of Lemont,  garnered community involvement. A group opposed to its closing has formed as the [http://www.friendsoflemontschool.roundtablelive.org/ Friends of Lemont School] to convince the District to remain committed to neighborhood schools and be respectful of its historic schools through rehabilitating them rather than abandoning them. In June 2016 the school board announced it will most likely close (called \"repurpose\" in education speak)  neighborhood schools again despite protests from parents and teachers.  Advocates speaking at high attendance public meetings emphasized that consolidating neighborhood schools contravened the 2008\u20132009 District Wide Facilities Master Plan in which refurbishment of neighborhood schools was afforded top priority.  Instead, in 2013, the priority was changed to building a mostly new high school (again exceeding the announced cost).  Architects and new consultants were hired to sell the revised master plan. As of June, 2014 with construction only beginning, the announced cost  increased from $115 to $140 million (an increase of $25 million or 22 percent). http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/article85942462.html#navlink=SecList\n\nThe $25 million high school cost overrun, as of June 2016, is more than half of the funds needed to refurbish all the elementary schools.\n\n==Special education==\nThe SCASD has not reported information for this section since 2010.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010\u20132011 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.  For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines, 2010</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the State College Area School District 2006\u20132007 through 2011\u20132016\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqCAjQ6eteArdFFCaWRjMUhzSkl5RTYxMjNJN1RQemc&hl=en#gid=0 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for  2006-2007 through 2010-2011, |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n*2006\u20132007 - 3.9%, Base 3.9%\n*2007\u20132008 - 3.4%, Base 3.4%\n*2008\u20132009 - 4.4%, Base 4.4%\n*2009\u20132010 - 4.1%, Base 4.1%\n*2010\u20132011 - 2.9%, Base 2.9%\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n*2011\u20132012 - 1.4%, Base 1.4% <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol40/40-38/1760.html |title=Index Calculation Required by the Taxpayer Relief Act |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=Sep 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Data Elements}}</ref>\n*2012\u20132013 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, September 2011</ref>\n*2013\u20132014 - 1.7%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, September 2012</ref>\n*2014\u20132015 - 2.1%, Base 2.1% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-2015 School District Adjusted Index, September 2013</ref>\n*2015\u20132016 - 5.5%, Base 1.9%\n*2016\u20132017 - 4.3%, Base 2.4%\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''For the 2015\u201316, and 2015\u20132017''' '''budget years,''' the State College Area School board levied the maxim Act 1 permitted tax increase with exceptions of 5.5 and 4.32 percent respectively.\n\n'''For the 2015\u201316 and 2015\u20132017 budget years,''' the State College Area School board did not evidence any attempt to restrain increased spending.\n\n'''For the 2013\u20132014 budget year''', State College Area School Board applied for one exception to exceed their Act 1 Index limit due to rapidly escalating teacher pension costs.

In some versions, the arm is raised upward at an angle; in others, it is held out parallel to the ground. In contemporary times, the former is widely considered a symbol of [[fascism]] that is commonly perceived to be based on a custom in [[ancient Rome]].<ref name=\"Winkler\">Winkler (2009), p. 2</ref> However, no [[Latin literature|Roman text]] gives this description, and the [[Roman art|Roman works of art]] that display salutational gestures bear little resemblance to the modern Roman salute.<ref name=\"Winkler\" />\n\nBeginning with [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1784), an association of the gesture with Roman republican and imperial culture emerged.  The gesture and its identification with [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] were further developed in other [[Neoclassicism|neoclassic artworks]]. This was further elaborated upon in [[popular culture]] during the late 19th and [[Early 20th century|early 20th]] centuries in plays and films that portrayed the salute as an ancient Roman custom. These included a 1914 [[Italy|Italian]] [[Italian cinema|film]] called ''[[Cabiria]]'' whose intertitles were written by the nationalist poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. In 1919, d'Annunzio adopted the cinematographically depicted salute as a neo-imperial ritual when [[Italian Regency of Carnaro#Impresa di Fiume|he led the occupation of]] [[Fiume]].\n\nThrough d'Annunzio's influence, the gesture soon became part of the rising [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] movement's symbolic repertoire. In 1923 the salute was gradually adopted by the Italian Fascist regime. It was then adopted and made compulsory within the [[Nazi Party]] in 1926, and gained national prominence in the German state when the Nazis took power in 1933. It was also adopted by other fascist, [[Far-right politics|far right]] and [[Ultranationalism|ultranationalist]] movements.\n\nSince the end of [[World War II]], displaying the [[Nazi salute|Nazi variant of the salute]] has been a [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|criminal offence]] in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Poland]]. Legal restrictions on its use in [[Italy]] are more nuanced and use there has generated controversy.<ref>  Since the historicity of the salute has never been properly questioned, performing it is prosecutable only when \"meant to exalt exponents, principles, events and methods\" of the extinct [[National Fascist Party]].</ref><ref>{{cite news | date = 2018-02-20 | title = Saluto fascista, la Cassazione: \"Non \u00e8 reato se commemorativo\" e conferma due assoluzioni a Milano | trans-title = Fascist salute, Supreme Court of Cassation: \"Not a crime if memorial\" and confirms two acquittals in Milan | url = https://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/02/20/news/saluto_fascista_per_la_cassazione_non_e_reato_se_commemorativo-189320383/ | language = Italian | work = [[La Repubblica]] | location = Milan | access-date = 2020-01-03}}</ref> The gesture and its variations continue to be used in [[neo-fascist]], [[neo-Nazi]], and [[Falangism|Falangist]] contexts.\n\n==Early Roman sources and images==\n[[File:062 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianss\u00e4ule, Tafel LXII.jpg|thumb|[[Column of Trajan|Trajan's Column]], Plate LXII. Onlookers raise their arms to acclaim the emperor]]\nThe modern gesture consists of stiffly extending the right arm frontally and raising it roughly 135 degrees from the body's vertical axis, with the palm of the hand facing down and the fingers stretched out and touching each other.<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> According to common perceptions, this salute was based on an ancient Roman custom.<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> However, this description is unknown in Roman literature and is never mentioned by ancient historians of Rome.<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> Not a single Roman work of art, be it sculpture, coinage, or painting, displays a salute of this kind.<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> The gesture of the raised right arm or hand in Roman and other ancient cultures that ''does'' exist in surviving literature and art generally had a significantly different function and is never identical with the modern straight-arm salute.<ref name=\"Winkler\" />\n\nThe right hand (Lat. ''dextera'', ''dextra''; Gr. \u03b4\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ac - ''dexia'') was commonly used in antiquity as a symbol of pledging trust, friendship or loyalty.<ref>K.E. Georges, ''Ausf\u00fchrliches lateinisch-deutsches Handw\u00f6rterbuch'', Leipzig, Hahn'sche Verlags-buchhandlung Lateinisch-deutscher theil. 1879\u201380. 2 v.--Deutsch-lateinischer theil 1882 2 v (reprint Berlin 2007), s.v. \"dexter\"; cf. ''Lewis-Short'' s.v. \"dextera\"; cf. ''LSJ'' s.v. \"\u03b4\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ac\".</ref> For example, [[Cicero]]  reported that [[Augustus|Octavian]] pledged an oath to [[Julius Caesar]] while outstretching his right hand: \"Although that youth [the young Caesar Octavian] is powerful and has told [[Mark Antony|Antony]] off nicely: yet, after all, we must wait to see the end.\" But what a speech! He swore his oath with the words: \"so may I achieve the honours of my father!\", and at the same time he stretched out his right hand in the direction of his statue.<ref>It is unknown if Octavian's specific oath salute was a pre-existing Roman custom or if he modified a similar pledging gesture for his ''contio'', but Cicero clearly disapproved of Octavian's performance, exclaiming: \"I don't want to be saved by such a man\"; cf. Cic. ''Att.'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/att16.shtml#15 16.15.3.6]: ''Quamquam enim \u2020postea\u2020 in praesentia belle iste puer retundit Antonium, tamen exitum exspectare debemus. at quae contio! nam est missa mihi. iurat \"ita sibi parentis honores consequi liceat\" et simul dextram intendit ad statuam. \u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u1f72 \u03c3\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b7\u03bd \u1f50\u03c0\u03cc \u03b3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5!

Unlike modern custom, in which both the leader and the people he addresses raise their arms, most of these scenes show only the senior official raising his hand.<ref name=\"Winkler2021\">Winkler (2009), pp. 20\u201321</ref> Occasionally it is a sign of [[greeting]] or benevolence, but usually it is used as an indication of power.<ref name=\"Winkler2021\" /> An opposite depiction is the ''salutatio'' of a ''diogmites'', a military police officer, who raises his right arm to greet his commander during his ''adventus'' on a relief from 2nd-century [[Ephesus]].<ref>Probably as an ''acclamatio''; note palm is perpendicular to the ground and thumb is sticking up cf. Graham Sumner, ''Roman military clothing: 100 BC \u2013 AD 200'', Oxford 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Co4IB3zPAmYC&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 47], pl. G3 (''Diogmitoi'' [sic! correct plural: ''diogmitai'']).</ref>\n\nAn example of a salutational gesture of imperial power can be seen in the statue of [[Augustus of Prima Porta]] which follows certain guidelines set out by oratory scholars of his day.<ref name=\"Moon\" /> In ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' the anonymous author states that the orator \"will control himself in the entire frame of his body and in the manly angle of his flanks, with the extension of the arm in the impassioned moments of speech, and by drawing in the arm in relaxed moods\".<ref name=\"Moon\">{{cite book|last=Moon|first=Warren G.|title=Polykleitos, the Doryphoros, and tradition|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=1995|edition=illustrated|series=Wisconsin studies in classics|pages=271\u2013272|isbn=978-0-299-14310-7}}</ref> [[Quintilian]] states in his ''Institutio Oratoria'': \"Experts do not permit the hand to be raised above the level of the eyes or lowered beneath the breast; to such a degree is this true that it is considered a fault to direct the hand above the head or lower it to the lower part of the belly.

Not until ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' did the Roman epic return to the cinema.<ref name=\"Winkler164\">Winkler (2009), p. 164</ref>  In this movie, the salute is notably absent in most scenes, for example when [[Commodus]] enters Rome or when the Senate salutes the Emperor by head-bowing.<ref name=\"Winkler164\" />\n\nVariations on the salute also appear in [[neo-fascist]] contexts. For example, The Christian Falangist Party, founded in 1985, uses a \"[[Zogist salute|pectoral salute]]\", in which the right arm, bent at the elbow, is extended from the heart, palm down.<ref>Winkler (2009), p. 6</ref> This gesture was used in [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s [[1966 in film|1966 film]] ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]''.<ref name=\"Winkler176\">Winkler (2009), p. 176</ref>  The film portrays a futuristic totalitarian society modeled after the fascist state, including black uniforms, [[book burning]]s, and thought control.<ref name=\"Winkler176\" />  In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]\", the salute begins with the right fist being placed over the heart, as in a pectoral salute, and then the arm is stretched out (usually up) before the body, open palm down, as in a traditional Roman salute.<ref name=\"Winkler169\">Winkler (2009), p. 169</ref>  In the episode, [[Captain Kirk]] and members of his crew are transported to a parallel universe in which the [[United Federation of Planets]] has been replaced by [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|an empire]] characterized by sadistic violence and torture, genocide, and unquestioning obedience to authority.<ref name=\"Winkler169\" /> A modified Roman salute is commonly used in the British-American series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''.<ref name=\"Winkler174\">Winkler (2009), p. 174</ref>  Here the salute avoids similarity to the Fascist salute, as the series seeks not to depict these Romans as stereotypical conquerors.<ref name=\"Winkler174\" />  Therefore, the salute is not the familiar straight arm salute but rather resembles a pectoral salute, with the right hand is placed over the heart and then extended to the front of the body.<ref name=\"Winkler174\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin|width=50%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]]\n* [[1972 Olympics Black Power

In some versions, the arm is raised upward at an angle; in others, it is held out parallel to the ground. In contemporary times, the former is widely considered a symbol of [[fascism]] that is commonly perceived to be based on a custom in [[ancient Rome]].<ref name=\"Winkler\">Winkler (2009), p. 2</ref> However, no [[Latin literature|Roman text]] gives this description, and the [[Roman art|Roman works of art]] that display salutational gestures bear little resemblance to the modern Roman salute.<ref name=\"Winkler\" />\n\nBeginning with [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s painting ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1784), an association of the gesture with Roman republican and imperial culture emerged.  The gesture and its identification with [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] were further developed in other [[Neoclassicism|neoclassic artworks]]. This was further elaborated upon in [[popular culture]] during the late 19th and [[Early 20th century|early 20th]] centuries in plays and films that portrayed the salute as an ancient Roman custom. These included a 1914 [[Italy|Italian]] [[Italian cinema|film]] called ''[[Cabiria]]'' whose intertitles were written by the nationalist poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. In 1919, d'Annunzio adopted the cinematographically depicted salute as a neo-imperial ritual when [[Italian Regency of Carnaro#Impresa di Fiume|he led the occupation of]] [[Fiume]].\n\nThrough d'Annunzio's influence, the gesture soon became part of the rising [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] movement's symbolic repertoire. In 1923 the salute was gradually adopted by the Italian Fascist regime. It was then adopted and made compulsory within the [[Nazi Party]] in 1926, and gained national prominence in the German state when the Nazis took power in 1933. It was also adopted by other fascist, [[Far-right politics|far right]] and [[Ultranationalism|ultranationalist]] movements.\n\nSince the end of [[World War II]], displaying the [[Nazi salute|Nazi variant of the salute]] has been a [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|criminal offence]] in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Poland]]. Legal restrictions on its use in [[Italy]] are more nuanced and use there has generated controversy.<ref>  Since the historicity of the salute has never been properly questioned, performing it is prosecutable only when \"meant to exalt exponents, principles, events and methods\" of the extinct [[National Fascist Party]].</ref><ref>{{cite news | date = 2018-02-20 | title = Saluto fascista, la Cassazione: \"Non \u00e8 reato se commemorativo\" e conferma due assoluzioni a Milano | trans-title = Fascist salute, Supreme Court of Cassation: \"Not a crime if memorial\" and confirms two acquittals in Milan | url = https://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/02/20/news/saluto_fascista_per_la_cassazione_non_e_reato_se_commemorativo-189320383/ | language = Italian | work = [[La Repubblica]] | location = Milan | access-date = 2020-01-03}}</ref> The gesture and its variations continue to be used in [[neo-fascist]], [[neo-Nazi]], and [[Falangism|Falangist]] contexts.\n\n==Early Roman sources and images==\n[[File:062 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianss\u00e4ule, Tafel LXII.jpg|thumb|[[Column of Trajan|Trajan's Column]], Plate LXII. Onlookers raise their arms to acclaim the emperor]]\nThe modern gesture consists of stiffly extending the right arm frontally and raising it roughly 135 degrees from the body's vertical axis, with the palm of the hand facing down and the fingers stretched out and touching each other.<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> According to common perceptions, this salute was based on an ancient Roman custom.<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> However, this description is unknown in Roman literature and is never mentioned by ancient historians of Rome.<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> Not a single Roman work of art, be it sculpture, coinage, or painting, displays a salute of this kind.<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> The gesture of the raised right arm or hand in Roman and other ancient cultures that ''does'' exist in surviving literature and art generally had a significantly different function and is never identical with the modern straight-arm salute.<ref name=\"Winkler\" />\n\nThe right hand (Lat. ''dextera'', ''dextra''; Gr. \u03b4\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ac - ''dexia'') was commonly used in antiquity as a symbol of pledging trust, friendship or loyalty.<ref>K.E.

He swore his oath with the words: \"so may I achieve the honours of my father!\", and at the same time he stretched out his right hand in the direction of his statue.<ref>It is unknown if Octavian's specific oath salute was a pre-existing Roman custom or if he modified a similar pledging gesture for his ''contio'', but Cicero clearly disapproved of Octavian's performance, exclaiming: \"I don't want to be saved by such a man\"; cf. Cic. ''Att.''

The \"Hail Caesar\" of antiquity (although at the time of the Horatii a Caesar had yet to be born) was transformed into the \"Heil Hitler\" of the modern period.

Not until ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' did the Roman epic return to the cinema.<ref name=\"Winkler164\">Winkler (2009), p. 164</ref>  In this movie, the salute is notably absent in most scenes, for example when [[Commodus]] enters Rome or when the Senate salutes the Emperor by head-bowing.<ref name=\"Winkler164\" />\n\nVariations on the salute also appear in [[neo-fascist]] contexts. For example, The Christian Falangist Party, founded in 1985, uses a \"[[Zogist salute|pectoral salute]]\", in which the right arm, bent at the elbow, is extended from the heart, palm down.<ref>Winkler (2009), p. 6</ref> This gesture was used in [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s [[1966 in film|1966 film]] ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]''.<ref name=\"Winkler176\">Winkler (2009), p. 176</ref>  The film portrays a futuristic totalitarian society modeled after the fascist state, including black uniforms, [[book burning]]s, and thought control.<ref name=\"Winkler176\" />  In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]\", the salute begins with the right fist being placed over the heart, as in a pectoral salute, and then the arm is stretched out (usually up) before the body, open palm down, as in a traditional Roman salute.<ref name=\"Winkler169\">Winkler (2009), p. 169</ref>  In the episode, [[Captain Kirk]] and members of his crew are transported to a parallel universe in which the [[United Federation of Planets]] has been replaced by [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|an empire]] characterized by sadistic violence and torture, genocide, and unquestioning obedience to authority.<ref name=\"Winkler169\" /> A modified Roman salute is commonly used in the British-American series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''.<ref name=\"Winkler174\">Winkler (2009), p. 174</ref>  Here the salute avoids similarity to the Fascist salute, as the series seeks not to depict these Romans as stereotypical conquerors.<ref name=\"Winkler174\" />  Therefore, the salute is not the familiar straight arm salute but rather resembles a pectoral salute, with the right hand is placed over the heart

{"title_page": "Integral equation", "text_new": "{{for|equations of [[integer]] unknowns|Diophantine equation}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''integral equations''' are equations in which an unknown [[function (mathematics)|function]] appears under an [[integral]] sign. \n\nThere is a close connection between [[differential equation|differential]] and integral equations, and some problems may be formulated either way. See, for example, [[Green's function]], [[Fredholm theory]], and [[Maxwell's equations]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe most basic type of integral equation is called a ''[[Fredholm integral equation|Fredholm equation]] of the first type'',\n:<math> f(x) = \\int_a^b K(x,t)\\,\\varphi(t)\\,dt. </math>\n\nThe notation follows [[George B. Arfken|Arfken]]. Here {{mvar|\u03c6}} is an unknown function, {{math|&thinsp;''f''&thinsp;}} is a known function,\nand {{mvar|K}} is another known function of two variables, often called the [[Kernel (integral operator)|kernel]] function. Note that the limits of integration are constant: this is what characterizes a Fredholm equation.\n\nIf the unknown function occurs both inside and outside of the integral, the equation is known as a ''Fredholm equation of the second type'',\n:<math> \\varphi(x) =  f(x)+ \\lambda \\int_a^b K(x,t)\\,\\varphi(t)\\,dt. </math>\n\nThe parameter {{mvar|\u03bb}} is an unknown factor, which plays the same role as the [[eigenvalue]] in [[linear algebra]].\n\nIf one limit of integration is a variable, the equation is called a [[Volterra integral equation|Volterra equation]].
