In 1990, after she graduated from the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD) with a Bachelor in Fine Arts with honors, LaMonte was awarded a fellowship at the Creative Glass Center of America, in [[Millville, New Jersey|Millville]], New Jersey. Following that, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, and worked at [[UrbanGlass]], a not-for-profit public access glass studio. During this period, she pursued artwork in blown and cast glass, pieces of which were exhibited at fine art galleries.\n\nIn 1999, LaMonte won a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] scholarship to study at the [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague]], where, in 2000, she created her first major work, ''Vestige''. She soon gained critical acclaim; among the accolades she received were [[The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation]] Biennial Award in 2001 and the UrbanGlass Award for New Talent in Glass in 2002. In 2006, the Japan United States Friendship Commission awarded her a seven-month fellowship to study in Kyoto, Japan; this trip inspired her ''Floating World'' series of works.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.petersprojects.com/karen-lamonteembodied|title=Karen LaMonte|website=Gerald Peters Contemporary|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, LaMonte began a collaboration with the Kholer Artist Center at the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] where she was named to the museum's Joint Artist-In-Residence Program. In 2017, the Corning Museum and [[Corning Inc.]] appointed her the Specialty Glass Artist-In-Residence at Corning's scientific research laboratory. Several of her works are part of the Corning Museum's permanent collection.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmog.org/bio/karen-lamonte|title=Artists and Instructors {{!}} Corning Museum of Glass|website=www.cmog.org|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpgallery.com/artists/karen-lamonte|title=Gerald Peters Gallery|website=www.gpgallery.com|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, LaMonte received the Masters of the Medium award from the James Renwick Alliance.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jra.org/masters-of-medium|title=Masters Of Medium|last=|first=|date=|website=James Renwick Alliance|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> Her works have been exhibited at museums including the Czech Museum of Fine Art in [[Prague]], the [[Chrysler Museum of Art]] in Norfolk, Virginia, and the [[Museum of Glass]] in Tacoma, Washington.

In these studios, she developed ''Vestige'', a cast glass life-size sculpture of a dress with the wearer absent; the work took one year to complete and required the development of special technologies, including the introduction of the [[lost wax technique]] to Czech glass casting studios.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/creativeglasscenteramerica/criticresidency/robinrice/lamontekaren |title=\"Robin Rice Essays \u2013 Karen LaMonte\", ''Wheaton Arts and Cultural Center'', March 4, 2008 |access-date=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040832/http://www.wheatonarts.org/creativeglasscenteramerica/criticresidency/robinrice/lamontekaren |archive-date=July 19, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Vestige'' would later be seen as a seminal and influential artwork in the field of contemporary art and glass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cerebralboinkfest.blogspot.com/2011/07/beyond-glass-slippers.html|title=Beyond Glass Slippers|last=Hedrick|first=Linda|date=2011-07-12|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphicdesigndegreehub.com/30-most-amazing-glass-artists-alive-today/|title=30 Most Amazing Glass Artists Alive Today|last=|first=|date=|website=Graphic Design Degree Hub|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\nLaMonte's art addresses themes of beauty and loss; her works use a sartorial lens to explore the fragility of the human condition.\n\nLaMonte's sculptural work has received critical acclaim from art critics such as [[Arthur Danto]]. In his 2005 essay \"The Poetry of Meaning and Loss: The Glass Dresses of Karen LaMonte\", Danto wrote about ''Vestige'':<ref>{{cite web |last=Danto |first=Arthur |title=The Poetry of Meaning and Loss: The Glass Dresses of Karen LaMonte |edition=1st |location=Tacoma, WA |publisher=Museum of Glass, International Center for Contemporary Art |year=2005 |url=http://karenlamonte.com/media/Danto%20Poetry%20of%20Meaning%20and%20Loss.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713134902/http://karenlamonte.com/media/Danto%20Poetry%20of%20Meaning%20and%20Loss.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-13 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The dress belonged to a moment when the wearer was, to use an expression of Proust's, ''en fleur''. The dress belonged to a certain moment of history, which it preserves\u2014it shows how women dressed for certain occasions at a certain moment. The wearer will have aged. She looked like that then, but, if she is still alive, it is certain she will not look that way now. There is a double melancholy\u2014the melancholy of fashion, and the melancholy of bodily change, from nubility to decrepitude. The breasts have fallen, the waist thickened, the skin has lost it transparency and luminescence. The poignancy of LaMonte's dresses is a product of two modes of change in which we participate as human beings, composed, as we are, of flesh and meaning. Their poetry is the poetry of beauty and loss.</blockquote>\n\nDuring LaMonte's 2006 fellowship to Japan, she explored how clothing serves as a societal language. Her research in Japan focused on the construction and meaning of the traditional [[kimono]], hundreds of which she brought back to her Prague studio. LaMonte then used [[Biometrics|biometric]] data from Japanese women to build kimono forms in glass, bronze, rusted iron, and ceramic. Like her previous works, these full-sized kimono sculptures depict only garments and not their wearers. LaMonte entitled this series of sculptures ''Floating World'', a name inspired by both [[Ukiyo-e]] woodblock prints and by the storied, arts-themed pleasure quarters of [[Edo period|Edo-era]] Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpgallery.com/ny/exhibitions/karen-lamonte-embodied-beauty|title=Karen LaMonte: Embodied Beauty|last=|first=|date=|website=Gerald Peters Gallery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\nLaMonte continued her examination of the female form with ''Nocturnes'', a series of works informed by the night-themed paintings of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Abbot McNeill Whistler]] and by the [[nocturne]] musical compositions of [[John Field (composer)|John Field]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Frederic Chopin]]. LaMonte built these sculptures from evening gowns of her own design, then cast them in white bronze, rusted iron, and blue glass. By focusing her work on the clothing and not the wearer, LaMonte says, \u201cI subverted the tradition of the [[Odalisque]]\u2014the idealized recumbent female nude\u2014by taking away the body.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/110018/Gerald-Peters-represents-Karen-LaMonte#.XUhmiC2ZNn4|title=Gerald Peters Represents Karen Lamonte|last=|first=|date=|website=artdaily.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2013, LaMonte spoke with the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] about her creative process and research techniques:<blockquote>The research is definitely part of the appeal, but the thing that comes first is the conceptualization: the idea for the sculptures. That\u2019s one layer of research, which I adore. And then usually it takes months and months for the ideas to come together and a vision becomes clear. Then the second phase is realization and that usually entails a bunch of material research and material studies. Definitely if the ideas I\u2019m working with push me into a new material, I\u2019m always thrilled at the challenges, because I do love learning. And I think it\u2019s very very healthy to access your creative mind to solve technical problems as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crystalbridges.org/blog/a-short-chat-with-karen-lamonte/|title=A Short Chat with Karen LaMonte|date=2013-09-12|website=Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref></blockquote>In 2017, LaMonte displayed her large-scale sculpture ''Cumulus'' at the [[Glasstress]] exhibition, in conjunction with the 2017 [[Venice Biennale]]. Unlike most of her previous works which focused on the absence of the human body, ''Cumulus'' depicts a [[cumulus cloud]]. She described her inspiration to ''Caltech Magazine'':<blockquote>What struck me was the fascinating and completely unexpected weight of clouds. We see them floating in the air. We think of them as fluffy cotton balls, like helium balloons. But when you learn a bit more, you realize they're actually amazingly heavy. I thought, wouldn't it be amazing if we could get a 'real' cloud and carve it in marble?</blockquote>LaMonte worked with [[Tapio Schneider]], a climate scientist from the [[California Institute of Technology]], to calculate and model the dimensions needed for ''Cumulus''. She used robots to carve a 15-ton block of marble, and then spent four weeks hand-finishing the sculpture. ''Cumulus'' shares a common thread with LaMonte's previous garment-focused work. \u201cMy cloud is baroque in its physicality,\u201d she told ''Caltech Magazine''. \u201cIt looks like folds of fabric or flesh tumbling through space.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/cloud-sourcing|title=Cloud Sourcing|website=Caltech Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\n== Major works ==\n[[File:Reclining Dress with Drapery.jpg|thumb|''Reclining Dress Impression with Drapery'' by Karen LaMonte.]]\n\n=== Dress sculptures ===\nLaMonte's first dress sculpture, ''Vestige'' (2000), is an influential work of cast glass. It was described by Habatat Galleries as a \u201cglass sculpture that changed the course of art history.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.habatat.com/4-glass-sculptures-changed-course-art-history/|title=4 Glass Sculptures That Changed the Course of Art History \u2013 Habatat Galleries|website=www.habatat.com|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n''Vestige'' depicts a life-sized woman's dress, from which the wearer is absent. This sculpture and LaMonte's related works have received international acclaim for their uniqueness and beauty. Her ''Reclining Dress Impression with Drapery'' (2009) is part of the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Smithsonian American Art Museum and Renwick Gallery]]\u2019s permanent collection. The [[de Young Museum]] in San Francisco\u2019s permanent collection contains ''Dress 3'' (2001).\n\n=== ''Floating World'' kimono sculptures ===\n[[File:Floating World 01.jpg|thumb|Sculptures from Karen LaMonte's ''Floating World'' series.]]\nLaMonte\u2019s ''Floating World'' series evolved from her dress sculptures; these Japan-influenced works depict [[kimono]]s without their wearers. The sculptures are life-sized and created in iron, cast glass, bronze, and ceramic. Some works in the series also feature elements of ''[[kintsugi]]'', a technique which uses gold to repair damaged or broken ceramic.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Elman|first=Leslie Gilbert|date=July\u2013August 2019|title=Karen LaMonte: Monumental Femininity|url=https://www.gpgallery.com/imgs/Todays_Master_LaMonte_finished_5_29_19.pdf|journal=Fine Art Connoisseur|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nLaMonte was inspired to create this series during her research fellowship in Kyoto, which was awarded by the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission. LaMonte writes about living \u201cin the traditional kimono-making district of [[Nishijin]]\":<blockquote>Even at night, my neighborhood hummed with the sounds of kimono production. I studied all aspects of the craft, from weaving fabric to drawing imagery. Fortunately, many people devoted to the preservation of traditional methods took me under their wing. . . . In all cultures, clothing is an unspoken language; but the Kimono is perhaps the most codified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karenlamonte.com/Contemporary-Scultpures-Prints/Kimono-Sculptures-Fine-Art|title=Kimono Sculptures \u2013 Karen LaMonte|website=www.karenlamonte.com|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref></blockquote>Sculptures from LaMonte\u2019 ''Floating World'' are in the permanent collection of many museums including: ''Maiko'' (2010) at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]; ''Odoriko'' (2012, bronze), ''Kabuki'' (2012, ceramic), and ''Hanako'' (2012, cast glass) at the [[Chazen Museum of Art]]; and ''Chado'' (2010, cast glass) at the [[Knoxville Museum of Art]].\n\n=== ''Etudes'' ===\n[[File:\"Etudes\" by Karen LaMonte.jpg|thumb|''Etudes'': one-third scale dress sculptures in white bronze, rusted iron, cast glass, and other materials by Karen LaMonte.]]\n\nLaMonte's ''Etudes'' are smaller than the life-sized dress sculptures that first gained her widespread recognition and are crafted from [[white bronze]], rusted iron, cast glass, and other materials. She writes:<blockquote>I began to develop my one-third-scale models into a stand-alone group of sculptures that I called ''Etudes'', a reference to my inspiration from the field of music from composers such as [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]. The ''Etudes'' are much more than studies for larger works. They celebrate the power of human optimism and our enduring need for beauty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karenlamonte.com/Contemporary-Scultpures-Prints/Etudes|title=Etudes \u2013 Karen LaMonte|website=www.karenlamonte.com|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref></blockquote>LaMonte's ''Etudes'' sculptures are featured in the permanent collections of the Imagine Museum.\n[[File:Karen LaMonte - Nocturnes - Cast Glass - Glasstress 2017.jpg|thumb|Sculptures from Karen LaMonte's ''Nocturnes'' series.]]\n\n=== ''Nocturnes'' ===\nLaMonte describes her ''Nocturnes'' series as \u201cA new body of work inspired by the beauty of night . . . dark, seductive, and sublime. They are absent of female forms \u2013 rising from penumbral garments as figurations of dusk. They build on the tradition of the female nude and probe the tension between humanism and eroticism, the physical and the ethereal, the body and the spirit. The figures are at once intensely physical \u2013 muscles and flesh strain against clinging fabric \u2013 and yet insubstantial: the figures are absent, implied only by the shapes pressing against the clothing.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karenlamonte.com/Contemporary-Scultpures-Prints/Nocturnes-Monumental-Sculpture|title=Nocturnes \u2013 Monumental Sculptures \u2013 Karen LaMonte|website=www.karenlamonte.com|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>[[File:Sartoriotype print by Karen LaMonte.jpg|thumb|Visitors to the [[Museum of Glass]] in Tacoma, Washington look at a Sartoriotype print by Karen LaMonte.]]\n\nThe ''Nocturnes'' have been written about extensively, including a monograph published in 2019 with an essay by Dr. Steven Nash, who wrote:<blockquote>Despite these associations with the past, LaMonte\u2019s sculptures are very much of our own time. They take their place in the resurgence of figurative art following [[Minimalism]]\u2019s banishment of the human figure in favor of elemental abstract forms, and help underline the importance that sculpture has played in that development. Many contemporary sculptors have adopted the human body as an important vehicle for study of different aspects of the human condition, including [[Kiki Smith]], [[Jaume Plensa]], [[Thomas Sch\u00fctte]], [[Huma Bhabha]], [[Juan Mu\u00f1oz]], and [[Georg Baselitz]]. LaMonte\u2019s contributions in this arena involve both her inventive treatment of materials and form and her investigations of female identity and self-expression, which, as we have seen, strike us in both sensuous and abstract ways. Each sculpture is an individual construction of visual, haptic, and intellectual experience, totally integrated. As the acclaimed British painter [[Cecily Brown]] has opined, \u201cPainting is very good at saying more than one thing at once.\u201d LaMonte\u2019s ''Nocturnes'' affirm that sculpture is as well.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Karen LaMonte Nocturnes|last=LaMonte|first=Karen|last2=Nash|first2=Steven|publisher=Art Works Publishing|year=2019|isbn=0988928418|location=|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>Sculptures of the ''Nocturnes'' series are in the permanent collections of [[Corning Museum of Glass|The Corning Museum]], [[Knoxville Museum of Art]], Iowa State University Museums, and Imagine Museum.\n\n=== Sartoriotype prints ===\nIn addition to her sculpture work, LaMonte creates vivid, graphical, gray-scale [[monotype]] prints that depict clothing. \u00a0\u201cBlind to colour but hypersensitive to texture, the paper on which the monotypes are printed renders an almost X-ray-like image of the garment,\u201d wrote Richard Drury in the ''Sculptures and Sartoriotypes'' monograph, \u201ca view through the layers of fabric - and through the tissue of time, to when the ripples and crumples we see in the prints were created by the active limbs of a unique human experience.

In 1990, after she graduated from the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD) with a Bachelor in Fine Arts with honors, LaMonte was awarded a fellowship at the Creative Glass Center of America, in [[Millville, New Jersey|Millville]], New Jersey. Following that, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, and worked at [[UrbanGlass]], a not-for-profit public access glass studio. During this period, she pursued artwork in blown and cast glass, pieces of which were exhibited at fine art galleries.\n\nIn 1999, LaMonte won a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] scholarship to study at the [[Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague]], where, in 2000, she created her first major work, ''Vestige''. She soon gained critical acclaim; among the accolades she received were [[The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation]] Biennial Award in 2001 and the UrbanGlass Award for New Talent in Glass in 2002. In 2006, the Japan United States Friendship Commission awarded her a seven-month fellowship to study in Kyoto, Japan; this trip inspired her ''Floating World'' series of works.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.petersprojects.com/karen-lamonteembodied|title=Karen LaMonte|website=Gerald Peters Contemporary|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, LaMonte began a collaboration with the Kholer Artist Center at the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] where she was named to the museum\u2019s Joint Artist-In-Residence Program. In 2017, the Corning Museum and [[Corning Inc.]] appointed her the Specialty Glass Artist-In-Residence at Corning\u2019s scientific research laboratory. Several of her works are part of the Corning Museum\u2019s permanent collection.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmog.org/bio/karen-lamonte|title=Artists and Instructors {{!}} Corning Museum of Glass|website=www.cmog.org|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpgallery.com/artists/karen-lamonte|title=Gerald Peters Gallery|website=www.gpgallery.com|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, LaMonte received the Masters of the Medium award from the James Renwick Alliance.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jra.org/masters-of-medium|title=Masters Of Medium|last=|first=|date=|website=James Renwick Alliance|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref> Her works have been exhibited at museums including the Czech Museum of Fine Art in [[Prague]], the [[Chrysler Museum of Art]] in Norfolk, Virginia, and the [[Museum of Glass]] in Tacoma, Washington.

In these studios, she developed ''Vestige'', a cast glass life-size sculpture of a dress with the wearer absent; the work took one year to complete and required the development of special technologies, including the introduction of the [[lost wax technique]] to Czech glass casting studios.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/creativeglasscenteramerica/criticresidency/robinrice/lamontekaren |title=\"Robin Rice Essays - Karen LaMonte\", ''Wheaton Arts and Cultural Center'', March 4, 2008 |access-date=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040832/http://www.wheatonarts.org/creativeglasscenteramerica/criticresidency/robinrice/lamontekaren |archive-date=July 19, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Vestige'' would later be seen as a seminal and influential artwork in the field of contemporary art and glass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cerebralboinkfest.blogspot.com/2011/07/beyond-glass-slippers.html|title=Beyond Glass Slippers|last=Hedrick|first=Linda|date=2011-07-12|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.graphicdesigndegreehub.com/30-most-amazing-glass-artists-alive-today/|title=30 Most Amazing Glass Artists Alive Today|last=|first=|date=|website=Graphic Design Degree Hub|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\nLaMonte\u2019s art addresses themes of beauty and loss; her works use a sartorial lens to explore the fragility of the human condition.\n\nLaMonte\u2019s sculptural work has received critical acclaim from art critics such as [[Arthur Danto]]. In his 2005 essay \"The Poetry of Meaning and Loss: The Glass Dresses of Karen LaMonte\", Danto wrote about ''Vestige'':<ref>{{cite web |last=Danto |first=Arthur |title=The Poetry of Meaning and Loss: The Glass Dresses of Karen LaMonte |edition=1st |location=Tacoma, WA |publisher=Museum of Glass, International Center for Contemporary Art |year=2005 |url=http://karenlamonte.com/media/Danto%20Poetry%20of%20Meaning%20and%20Loss.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713134902/http://karenlamonte.com/media/Danto%20Poetry%20of%20Meaning%20and%20Loss.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-13 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The dress belonged to a moment when the wearer was, to use an expression of Proust's, ''en fleur''. The dress belonged to a certain moment of history, which it preserves\u2014it shows how women dressed for certain occasions at a certain moment. The wearer will have aged. She looked like that then, but, if she is still alive, it is certain she will not look that way now. There is a double melancholy\u2014the melancholy of fashion, and the melancholy of bodily change, from nubility to decrepitude. The breasts have fallen, the waist thickened, the skin has lost it transparency and luminescence. The poignancy of LaMonte's dresses is a product of two modes of change in which we participate as human beings, composed, as we are, of flesh and meaning. Their poetry is the poetry of beauty and loss.</blockquote>\n\nDuring LaMonte\u2019s 2006 fellowship to Japan, she explored how clothing serves as a societal language. Her research in Japan focused on the construction and meaning of the traditional [[kimono]], hundreds of which she brought back to her Prague studio. LaMonte then used [[Biometrics|biometric]] data from Japanese women to build kimono forms in glass, bronze, rusted iron, and ceramic. Like her previous works, these full-sized kimono sculptures depict only garments and not their wearers. LaMonte entitled this series of sculptures ''Floating World'', a name inspired by both [[Ukiyo-e]] woodblock prints and by the storied, arts-themed pleasure quarters of [[Edo period|Edo-era]] Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpgallery.com/ny/exhibitions/karen-lamonte-embodied-beauty|title=Karen LaMonte: Embodied Beauty|last=|first=|date=|website=Gerald Peters Gallery|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\nLaMonte continued her examination of the female form with ''Nocturnes'', a series of works informed by the night-themed paintings of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Abbot McNeill Whistler]] and by the [[nocturne]] musical compositions of [[John Field (composer)|John Field]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Frederic Chopin]]. LaMonte built these sculptures from evening gowns of her own design, then cast them in white bronze, rusted iron, and blue glass. By focusing her work on the clothing and not the wearer, LaMonte says, \u201cI subverted the tradition of the [[Odalisque]]\u2014the idealized recumbent female nude\u2014by taking away the body.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/110018/Gerald-Peters-represents-Karen-LaMonte#.XUhmiC2ZNn4|title=Gerald Peters Represents Karen Lamonte|last=|first=|date=|website=artdaily.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2013, LaMonte spoke with the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] about her creative process and research techniques:<blockquote>The research is definitely part of the appeal, but the thing that comes first is the conceptualization: the idea for the sculptures. That\u2019s one layer of research, which I adore. And then usually it takes months and months for the ideas to come together and a vision becomes clear. Then the second phase is realization and that usually entails a bunch of material research and material studies. Definitely if the ideas I\u2019m working with push me into a new material, I\u2019m always thrilled at the challenges, because I do love learning. And I think it\u2019s very very healthy to access your creative mind to solve technical problems as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crystalbridges.org/blog/a-short-chat-with-karen-lamonte/|title=A Short Chat with Karen LaMonte|date=2013-09-12|website=Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref></blockquote>In 2017, LaMonte displayed her large-scale sculpture ''Cumulus'' at the [[Glasstress]] exhibition, in conjunction with the 2017 [[Venice Biennale]]. Unlike most of her previous works which focused on the absence of the human body, ''Cumulus'' depicts a [[cumulus cloud]]. She described her inspiration to ''Caltech Magazine'':<blockquote>What struck me was the fascinating and completely unexpected weight of clouds. We see them floating in the air. We think of them as fluffy cotton balls, like helium balloons. But when you learn a bit more, you realize they're actually amazingly heavy. I thought, wouldn't it be amazing if we could get a 'real' cloud and carve it in marble?</blockquote>LaMonte worked with [[Tapio Schneider]], a climate scientist from the [[California Institute of Technology]], to calculate and model the dimensions needed for ''Cumulus''. She used robots to carve a 15-ton block of marble, and then spent four weeks hand-finishing the sculpture. ''Cumulus'' shares a common thread with LaMonte\u2019s previous garment-focused work. \u201cMy cloud is baroque in its physicality,\u201d she told ''Caltech Magazine''. \u201cIt looks like folds of fabric or flesh tumbling through space.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/cloud-sourcing|title=Cloud Sourcing|website=Caltech Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\n== Major Works ==\n[[File:Reclining Dress with Drapery.jpg|thumb|''Reclining Dress Impression with Drapery'' by Karen LaMonte.]]\n\n=== Dress sculptures ===\nLaMonte\u2019s first dress sculpture, ''Vestige'' (2000), is an influential work of cast glass. It was described by Habatat Galleries as a \u201cglass sculpture that changed the course of art history.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.habatat.com/4-glass-sculptures-changed-course-art-history/|title=4 Glass Sculptures That Changed the Course of Art History - Habatat Galleries|website=www.habatat.com|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n''Vestige'' depicts a life-sized woman\u2019s dress, from which the wearer is absent. This sculpture and LaMonte's related works have received international acclaim for their uniqueness and beauty. Her ''Reclining Dress Impression with Drapery'' (2009) is part of the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Smithsonian American Art Museum and Renwick Gallery]]\u2019s permanent collection. The [[de Young Museum]] in San Francisco\u2019s permanent collection contains ''Dress 3'' (2001).\n\n=== ''Floating World'' kimono sculptures ===\n[[File:Floating World 01.jpg|thumb|Sculptures from Karen LaMonte's ''Floating World'' series.]]\nLaMonte\u2019s ''Floating World'' series evolved from her dress sculptures; these Japan-influenced works depict [[kimono]]s without their wearers. The sculptures are life-sized and created in iron, cast glass, bronze, and ceramic. Some works in the series also feature elements of ''[[kintsugi]]'', a technique which uses gold to repair damaged or broken ceramic.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Elman|first=Leslie Gilbert|date=July\u2013August 2019|title=Karen LaMonte: Monumental Femininity|url=https://www.gpgallery.com/imgs/Todays_Master_LaMonte_finished_5_29_19.pdf|journal=Fine Art Connoisseur|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nLaMonte was inspired to create this series during her research fellowship in Kyoto, which was awarded by the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission. LaMonte writes about living \u201cin the traditional kimono-making district of [[Nishijin]]\":<blockquote>Even at night, my neighborhood hummed with the sounds of kimono production. I studied all aspects of the craft, from weaving fabric to drawing imagery. Fortunately, many people devoted to the preservation of traditional methods took me under their wing. . . . In all cultures, clothing is an unspoken language; but the Kimono is perhaps the most codified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karenlamonte.com/Contemporary-Scultpures-Prints/Kimono-Sculptures-Fine-Art|title=Kimono Sculptures - Karen LaMonte|website=www.karenlamonte.com|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref></blockquote>Sculptures from LaMonte\u2019 ''Floating World'' are in the permanent collection of many museums including: ''Maiko'' (2010) at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]; ''Odoriko'' (2012, bronze), ''Kabuki'' (2012, ceramic), and ''Hanako'' (2012, cast glass) at the [[Chazen Museum of Art]]; and ''Chado'' (2010, cast glass) at the [[Knoxville Museum of Art]].\n\n=== ''Etudes'' ===\n[[File:\"Etudes\" by Karen LaMonte.jpg|thumb|''Etudes'': one-third scale dress sculptures in white bronze, rusted iron, cast glass, and other materials by Karen LaMonte.]]\n\nLaMonte\u2019s ''Etudes'' are smaller than the life-sized dress sculptures that first gained her widespread recognition and are crafted from [[white bronze]], rusted iron, cast glass, and other materials. She writes:<blockquote>I began to develop my one-third-scale models into a stand-alone group of sculptures that I called ''Etudes'', a reference to my inspiration from the field of music from composers such as [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]. The ''Etudes'' are much more than studies for larger works. They celebrate the power of human optimism and our enduring need for beauty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karenlamonte.com/Contemporary-Scultpures-Prints/Etudes|title=Etudes - Karen LaMonte|website=www.karenlamonte.com|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref></blockquote>LaMonte\u2019s ''Etudes'' sculptures are featured in the permanent collections of the Imagine Museum.\n[[File:Karen LaMonte - Nocturnes - Cast Glass - Glasstress 2017.jpg|thumb|Sculptures from Karen LaMonte's ''Nocturnes'' series.]]\n\n=== ''Nocturnes'' ===\nLaMonte describes her ''Nocturnes'' series as \u201cA new body of work inspired by the beauty of night . . . dark, seductive, and sublime. They are absent of female forms \u2013 rising from penumbral garments as figurations of dusk. They build on the tradition of the female nude and probe the tension between humanism and eroticism, the physical and the ethereal, the body and the spirit. The figures are at once intensely physical \u2013 muscles and flesh strain against clinging fabric \u2013 and yet insubstantial: the figures are absent, implied only by the shapes pressing against the clothing.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karenlamonte.com/Contemporary-Scultpures-Prints/Nocturnes-Monumental-Sculpture|title=Nocturnes \u2014 Monumental Sculptures - Karen LaMonte|website=www.karenlamonte.com|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>[[File:Sartoriotype print by Karen LaMonte.jpg|thumb|Visitors to the [[Museum of Glass]] in Tacoma, Washington look at a Sartoriotype print by Karen LaMonte.]]\n\nThe ''Nocturnes'' have been written about extensively, including a monograph published in 2019 with an essay by Dr. Steven Nash, who wrote:<blockquote>Despite these associations with the past, LaMonte\u2019s sculptures are very much of our own time. They take their place in the resurgence of figurative art following [[Minimalism]]\u2019s banishment of the human figure in favor of elemental abstract forms, and help underline the importance that sculpture has played in that development. Many contemporary sculptors have adopted the human body as an important vehicle for study of different aspects of the human condition, including [[Kiki Smith]], [[Jaume Plensa]], [[Thomas Sch\u00fctte]], [[Huma Bhabha]], [[Juan Mu\u00f1oz]], and [[Georg Baselitz]]. LaMonte\u2019s contributions in this arena involve both her inventive treatment of materials and form and her investigations of female identity and self-expression, which, as we have seen, strike us in both sensuous and abstract ways. Each sculpture is an individual construction of visual, haptic, and intellectual experience, totally integrated.

Treichler also played the guitar on those albums and ''Data Mirage Tangram''.<ref name=\"decibel-interview\"/><ref name=\"chaos-control-interview\"/>\n\nTreichler's lyrics are mostly sung in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. ''The Young Gods'' and ''L'eau rouge'' largely featured French vocals while 1991's ''T.V. Sky'' became the band's first English-language record. On the subsequent records Treichler mixed the two languages; in 2005, he stated: \"I hope to find a solution in between. But they're very different to sing; they both have their rules.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> Lyricwise, Treichler often uses [[double entendre]]s: the track \"L'Amourir\" from ''L'eau rouge'' can be interpreted as \"an intense love song or the end of a love affair.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> The title track from ''L'eau rouge'' is regarded as \"a celebration of <nowiki>'red water'</nowiki>\" and is a reference to [[menstruation]].<ref name=\"allmusic-1989\"/> The track \"Lucidogen\" from ''Second Nature'' illustrates \"a fictitious drug which would make people more [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]\" and was inspired by an anti-[[World Trade Organization]] riot that Treichler witnessed in Geneva in 1998.<ref name=\"spike-second-nature\"/> On ''The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion and Rock 'n' Roll'', authors [[Simon Reynolds]] and [[Joy Press]] argued: \"Treichler's lyrics brought out all the militaristic, fascistic tendencies inherent in [[Romanticism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] et al., only to transcend and transfigure them;\"<ref name=\"sex-revolts\"/> in a 1995 interview, Treichler dismissed Reynolds's and Press's Nietzschean interpretation of his lyrics.<ref name=\"mtv-young-gods\"/>\n{{Quote box\n |title = \n |width=340px\n |align=left\n |quote = I thought they had some extraordinary ideas, by taking one chunk guitar riff and then sampling it, looping it, and having that as the consistent pattern through a piece of music.

Records, which released their early work, for the record's North American release, which was turned down by the label.<ref name=\"decibel-wax-trax\"/>\n\n==Musical style and legacy==\nThe Young Gods's sound has been described as [[industrial rock]],<ref name=\"decibel-interview\"/><ref name=\"skinny-ipecac\"/> [[Industrial music|industrial]],<ref name=\"cmj-only-heaven\"/> [[experimental rock|avant-rock]]<ref name=\"indepedent-super-ready\"/> and [[post-industrial music]];<ref name=\"exclaim-rouyn\"/> Treichler favours the term \"[[electronic rock]] music.\"<ref name=\"rpmonline-interview\"/> \nSince their early career, the band have used sampling as a compositional and performance tool,<ref name=\"allmusic-1987\"/> constructing tracks electronically with treated electric guitar samples, [[musique concr\u00e8te]], [[classical music|classical]] vignettes and [[electronica]].<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> ''[[Trouser Press]]'' remarked that The Young Gods's \"unusual vocals/sampler/drums configuration reconstructs rock from the ground up, producing a fiery collage of roaring guitars, blistering rhythms and [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] orchestras, all presided over by Franz Treichler's leering, guttural voice.\"<ref name=\"trouserpress\" /> Treichler has regarded \"abstraction\" and \"element of surprise\" as important factors for using the sampler, since they rendered the listeners to \"the first time you\u2019re listening to music because you don\u2019t know what it is.\"<ref name=\"redbull\" /> He has cited [[Psychedelic music#1960s: Original psychedelic era|60s psychedelia]], [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[punk rock]] movement and [[post-punk]] acts such as [[Killing Joke]] and [[Wire]] as influences on The Young Gods.<ref name=\"redbull\" /><ref name=\"rpmonline-interview\"/> Kurt Weill, whose compositions were covered on 1991's ''The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill'', is also an influence:<ref name=\"redbull\" /><ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> Treichler has credited him as a model for the band's \"experiments with music but still in a song format.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/>\n\nThe band has infused various styles of music to their sound through sampling:<ref name=\"decibel-interview\"/> 1987's ''The Young Gods'' made use of classical and [[heavy metal music|metal]] guitar samples,<ref name=\"allmusic-1987\"/> while their second album, ''L{{'}}eau rouge'', incorporated [[cabaret]] and [[chanson]] influences.<ref name=\"rough-guide-rock\"/><ref name=\"allmusic-1989\"/> 1995's ''Only Heaven'' delved into ambient territories while \"being cherished equally by heavy metal, [[indie rock|indie]], [[techno]] and industrial\";<ref name=\"rough-guide-rock\"/> the ambient elements were explored on instrumental albums such as ''Heaven Deconstruction''.<ref name=\"quietus\"/> Focusing on [[Synthesizer|synthesized]], [[Found object (music)|found sounds]] and [[Audio plug-in|computer plug-in]]s on 2000's ''Second Nature'',<ref name=\"spike-second-nature\"/><ref name=\"chaos-control-interview\"/> The Young Gods also occasionally strayed away from their sampler-based formula: multi-instrumentalist Vincent H\u00e4nni was employed for the recording of ''Everybody Knows'' and the acoustic record ''Knock on Wood''. Treichler also played the guitar on those albums and ''Data Mirage Tangram''.<ref name=\"decibel-interview\"/><ref name=\"chaos-control-interview\"/>\n\nTreichler's lyrics are mostly sung in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. ''The Young Gods'' and ''L'eau rouge'' largely featured French vocals while 1991's ''T.V. Sky'' became the band's first English-language record. On the subsequent records Treichler mixed the two languages; in 2005, he stated: \"I hope to find a solution in between. But they're very different to sing; they both have their rules.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> Lyricwise, Treichler often uses [[double entendre]]s: the track \"L'Amourir\" from ''L'eau rouge'' can be interpreted as \"an intense love song or the end of a love affair.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> The title track from ''L'eau rouge'' is regarded as \"a celebration of <nowiki>'red water'</nowiki>\" and is a reference to [[menstruation]].<ref name=\"allmusic-1989\"/> The track \"Lucidogen\" from ''Second Nature'' illustrates \"a fictitious drug which would make people more [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]\" and was inspired by an anti-[[World Trade Organization]] riot that Treichler witnessed in Geneva in 1998.<ref name=\"spike-second-nature\"/> On ''The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion and Rock 'n' Roll'', authors [[Simon Reynolds]] and [[Joy Press]] argued: \"Treichler's lyrics brought out all the militaristic, fascistic tendencies inherent in [[Romanticism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] et al., only to transcend and transfigure them;\"<ref name=\"sex-revolts\"/> in a 1995 interview, Treichler dismissed Reynolds's and Press's Nietzschean interpretation of his lyrics.<ref name=\"mtv-young-gods\"/>\n{{Quote box\n |title = \n |width=340px\n |align=left\n |quote = I thought they had some extraordinary ideas, by taking one chunk guitar riff and then sampling it, looping it, and having that as the consistent pattern through a piece of music.
