Truman]] to [[Bill Clinton]]{{spaced ndash}}on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the [[Franck Report]] and contributed to the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]], the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the [[Eisenhower administration]], he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]], he was a key contributor to its 1983 report \"[[A Nation at Risk]]\".\n\nSeaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: [[plutonium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], [[californium]], [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]] and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named [[seaborgium]] in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 [[isotope]]s of transuranium elements and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the [[Fat Man|second atomic bomb]]. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in [[nuclear medicine]] and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including [[iodine-131]], which is used in the treatment of [[thyroid]] disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the [[lanthanide]] series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the [[transactinide]] and [[superactinide]] series.\n\nAfter sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with [[Edwin McMillan]], he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other [[Glenn T. Seaborg (awards and honors)|awards and honors]]. The [[list of things named after Glenn T. Seaborg|list of things named after Seaborg]] ranges from the chemical element [[seaborgium]] to the asteroid [[4856 Seaborg]]. He was a [[Glenn T. Seaborg (Publications)|prolific author]], penning numerous books and 500 journal articles, often in collaboration with others. He  was once listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the person with the longest entry in ''[[Who's Who in America]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nGlenn Theodore Seaborg was born in [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], on April 19, 1912, the son of Herman Theodore (Ted) and Selma Olivia Erickson Seaborg. He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to [[Los Angeles County, California]], settling in a subdivision called [[Seaborg Home (South Gate, California)|Home Gardens]], later annexed to the City of [[South Gate, California]]. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from Glen to Glenn.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }}\n\nSeaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=336 }} As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at [[Jordan High School (Los Angeles, California)|David Starr Jordan High School]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nSeaborg graduated from Jordan in 1929 at the top of his class and received a bachelor  of arts (AB) degree in chemistry at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], in 1933.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }} He worked his way through school as a stevedore and a laboratory assistant at [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=15, 29}} Seaborg received his PhD in chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1937 with a doctoral thesis on the \"Interaction of Fast Neutrons with Lead\",{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=40}}<ref name=\"thesis-seaborg-1937\">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/301774846/ |title=The interaction of fast neutrons with lead |date=1937 |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Seaborg |first=Glenn T. |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription  |oclc=21609796}}</ref> in which he coined the term \"nuclear [[spallation]]\".<ref name=\"Argonne\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dep.anl.gov/postdocs/seaborg_bio.htm |title=Scientific and Luminary Biography \u2013 Glenn Seaborg |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate=June 16, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSeaborg was a member of the professional chemistry fraternity [[Alpha Chi Sigma]].

For several years, Seaborg conducted important research in artificial [[radioactivity]] using the Lawrence [[cyclotron]] at UC Berkeley.  He was excited to learn from others that [[nuclear fission]] was possible\u2014but also chagrined, as his own research might have led him to the same discovery.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nSeaborg also became an adept interlocutor of Berkeley physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation and often answered a junior colleague's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=26}}\n\n==Pioneering work in nuclear chemistry==\n[[File:Seaborg in lab - restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg in 1950, with the [[Ion exchange|ion exchanger]] illusion column of [[actinide]] elements.]]\nSeaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed [[Frederick Soddy]]'s work investigating [[isotope]]s and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, [[iron-59]] in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the [[hemoglobin]] in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of [[iodine]], [[iodine-131]], which is still used to treat [[thyroid]] disease.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last=Heilbron\n |first=J.

In November, he was persuaded to leave Berkeley temporarily to assist with urgent research in [[radar]] technology.

The first hypothesis for this [[alpha particle]] accumulation was contamination by uranium, which produces alpha-decay particles; analysis of alpha-decay particles ruled this out. Seaborg then postulated that a distinct alpha-producing element was being formed from element 93.<ref name=\"An Elementary Problem\"/>\n\nIn February 1941, Seaborg and his collaborators produced [[plutonium-239]] through the bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with [[deuteron]]s, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium.<ref name=\"An Elementary Problem\">\n{{cite journal\n |url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/read/spring-2001/an-elementary-problem/\n |last=Farmer |first=Delphine\n |year=2001\n |title=An Elementary Problem\n |journal=Berkeley Science Review\n |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=32\u201337\n |issn=1538-6449\n}}</ref>  Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] and Berkeley chemist [[Joseph W.

Seaborg's role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of [[uranium]]. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the [[Clinton Engineering Works]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and then entered full-scale production at the [[Hanford Engineer Works]], in [[Richland, Washington]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Glenn Seaborg's Greatest Hits\n |url         = http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/hits.htm\n |publisher   = [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]\n |accessdate  = 2012-08-26\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20041015051852/http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/hits.htm\n |archivedate = October 15, 2004\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nSeaborg's theoretical development of the [[actinide concept]] resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the [[actinide series]] appearing below the [[lanthanide series]]. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household [[smoke detectors]] and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the [[Franck Report]] (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=320, 340\u201343, 348, 354, 369, 377, 395}}\n\n==Professor and Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley==\n[[File:NNSA-NSO-403.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg (second from left) during [[Operation Plumbbob]]]]\nAfter the conclusion of World War II and the Manhattan Project, Seaborg was eager to return to academic life and university research free from the restrictions of wartime secrecy. In 1946, he added to his responsibilities as a professor by heading the nuclear chemistry research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory operated by the University of California on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Seaborg was named one of the \"Ten Outstanding Young Men in America\" by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1947 (along with [[Richard Nixon]] and others). Seaborg was elected a [[Member of the National Academy of Sciences]] in 1948. From 1954 to 1961 he served as associate director of the radiation laboratory.

Truman]] to [[Bill Clinton]]{{spaced ndash}}on nuclear policy and was Chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1961 to 1971, where he pushed for commercial [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and the peaceful applications of nuclear science. Throughout his career, Seaborg worked for arms control. He was a signatory to the [[Franck Report]] and contributed to the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]], the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. He was a well-known advocate of science education and federal funding for pure research. Toward the end of the [[Eisenhower administration]], he was the principal author of the Seaborg Report on academic science, and, as a member of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]], he was a key contributor to its 1983 report \"[[A Nation at Risk]]\".\n\nSeaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: [[plutonium]], [[americium]], [[curium]], [[berkelium]], [[californium]], [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[mendelevium]], [[nobelium]] and element 106, which, while he was still living, was named [[seaborgium]] in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 [[isotope]]s of transuranium elements and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the [[Manhattan Project]] where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the [[Fat Man|second atomic bomb]]. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in [[nuclear medicine]] and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, including [[iodine-131]], which is used in the treatment of [[thyroid]] disease. In addition to his theoretical work in the development of the actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the [[lanthanide]] series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the [[transactinide]] and [[superactinide]] series.\n\nAfter sharing the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with [[Edwin McMillan]], he received approximately 50 honorary doctorates and numerous other [[Glenn T. Seaborg (awards and honors)|awards and honors]]. The [[list of things named after Glenn T. Seaborg|list of things named after Seaborg]] ranges from the chemical element [[seaborgium]] to the asteroid [[4856 Seaborg]]. He was a [[Glenn T. Seaborg (Publications)|prolific author]], penning numerous books and 500 journal articles, often in collaboration with others. He  was once listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the person with the longest entry in ''[[Who's Who in America]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nGlenn Theodore Seaborg was born in [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], on April 19, 1912, the son of Herman Theodore (Ted) and Selma Olivia Erickson Seaborg. He had one sister, Jeanette, who was two years younger. His family spoke Swedish at home. When Glenn Seaborg was a boy, the family moved to [[Los Angeles County, California]], settling in a subdivision called [[Seaborg Home (South Gate, California)|Home Gardens]], later annexed to the City of [[South Gate, California]]. About this time he changed the spelling of his first name from Glen to Glenn.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }}\n\nSeaborg kept a daily journal from 1927 until he suffered a stroke in 1998.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=336 }} As a youth, Seaborg was both a devoted sports fan and an avid movie buff. His mother encouraged him to become a bookkeeper as she felt his literary interests were impractical. He did not take an interest in science until his junior year when he was inspired by Dwight Logan Reid, a chemistry and physics teacher at [[Jordan High School (Los Angeles, California)|David Starr Jordan High School]] in [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nSeaborg graduated from Jordan in 1929 at the top of his class and received a bachelor  of arts (AB) degree in chemistry at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], in 1933.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|p=330 }} He worked his way through school as a stevedore and a laboratory assistant at [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]].{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=15, 29}} Seaborg received his PhD in chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1937 with a doctoral thesis on the \"Interaction of Fast Neutrons with Lead\",{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=40}}<ref name=\"thesis-seaborg-1937\">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/301774846/ |title=The interaction of fast neutrons with lead |date=1937 |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Seaborg |first=Glenn T. |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription  |oclc=21609796}}</ref> in which he coined the term \"nuclear [[spallation]]\".<ref name=\"Argonne\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dep.anl.gov/postdocs/seaborg_bio.htm |title=Scientific and Luminary Biography \u2013 Glenn Seaborg |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate=June 16, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSeaborg was a member of the professional chemistry fraternity [[Alpha Chi Sigma]].

For several years, Seaborg conducted important research in artificial [[radioactivity]] using the Lawrence [[cyclotron]] at UC Berkeley.  He was excited to learn from others that [[nuclear fission]] was possible\u2014but also chagrined, as his own research might have led him to the same discovery.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|pp=57\u201359}}\n\nSeaborg also became an adept interlocutor of Berkeley physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation and often answered a junior colleague's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.{{sfn|Seaborg|Seaborg|2001|p=26}}\n\n==Pioneering work in nuclear chemistry==\n[[File:Seaborg in lab - restoration.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg in 1950, with the [[Ion exchange|ion exchanger]] illusion column of [[actinide]] elements.]]\nSeaborg remained at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed [[Frederick Soddy]]'s work investigating [[isotope]]s and contributed to the discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, [[iron-59]] in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the [[hemoglobin]] in human blood. In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of [[iodine]], [[iodine-131]], which is still used to treat [[thyroid]] disease.<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last=Heilbron\n |first=J.

In November, he was persuaded to leave Berkeley temporarily to assist with urgent research in [[radar]] technology.

McMillan agreed to the collaboration.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Jackson |first=D. J.\n |last2=Panofsky |first2=W. K.

The first hypothesis for this [[alpha particle]] accumulation was contamination by uranium, which produces alpha-decay particles; analysis of alpha-decay particles ruled this out. Seaborg then postulated that a distinct alpha-producing element was being formed from element 93.<ref name=\"An Elementary Problem\"/>\n\nIn February 1941, Seaborg and his collaborators produced [[plutonium-239]] through the bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with [[deuteron]]s, they observed the creation of neptunium, element 93. But it then underwent beta-decay, forming a new element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Plutonium is fairly stable, but undergoes alpha-decay, which explained the presence of alpha particles coming from neptunium.<ref name=\"An Elementary Problem\">\n{{cite journal\n |url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/read/spring-2001/an-elementary-problem/\n |last=Farmer |first=Delphine\n |year=2001\n |title=An Elementary Problem\n |journal=Berkeley Science Review\n |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=32\u201337\n |issn=1538-6449\n}}</ref>  Thus, on March 28, 1941, Seaborg, physicist [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] and Berkeley chemist [[Joseph W.

He shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1951 with Edwin McMillan for \"their discoveries in the chemistry of the first transuranium elements.\"<ref name=\"Nobel Prize\"/>\n\n==Scientific contributions during the Manhattan Project==\nOn April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago and joined the chemistry group at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] of the Manhattan Project at the [[University of Chicago]], where [[Enrico Fermi]] and his group would later convert [[uranium-238]] to plutonium-239 in a controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Seaborg's role was to figure out how to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of [[uranium]]. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the [[Clinton Engineering Works]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and then entered full-scale production at the [[Hanford Engineer Works]], in [[Richland, Washington]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Glenn Seaborg's Greatest Hits\n |url         = http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/hits.htm\n |publisher   = [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]\n |accessdate  = 2012-08-26\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20041015051852/http://isswprod.lbl.gov/Seaborg/hits.htm\n |archivedate = October 15, 2004\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nSeaborg's theoretical development of the [[actinide concept]] resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the [[actinide series]] appearing below the [[lanthanide series]]. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household [[smoke detectors]] and thus provided a good source of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the [[Franck Report]] (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=320, 340\u201343, 348, 354, 369, 377, 395}}\n\n==Professor and Chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley==\n[[File:NNSA-NSO-403.jpg|thumb|right|Seaborg (second from left) during [[Operation Plumbbob]]]]\nAfter the conclusion of World War II and the Manhattan Project, Seaborg was eager to return to academic life and university research free from the restrictions of wartime secrecy. In 1946, he added to his responsibilities as a professor by heading the nuclear chemistry research at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory operated by the University of California on behalf of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Seaborg was named one of the \"Ten Outstanding Young Men in America\" by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce in 1947 (along with [[Richard Nixon]] and others). Seaborg was elected a [[Member of the National Academy of Sciences]] in 1948. From 1954 to 1961 he served as associate director of the radiation laboratory.

Seaborg received a letter dated August 16, 1966, from industry engineers expressing these concerns at the time of the licensing of New York's Indian Point reactor. This letter advised Seaborg and other AEC senior members of these containment concerns which would later become known as the \"China Syndrome\" resulting from uncontained core meltdowns. Seaborg directed this letter not be released to the public as he feared it would be misunderstood and therefore damage the nuclear industry in the public's view, even though the law required such letters be released for public disclosure. This disclosure first came to light for public view in the BBC documentary series, \"Pandora's Box, A Is For Atom\" dealing with the early history of commercial nuclear development. -->\n\nSeaborg enjoyed a close relationship with President [[Lyndon B.

The lower receiver holds the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]] assembly including the [[Hammer (firearms)|hammer]], and is the attachment point for the [[buttstock]]. The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires the removal of these pins. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a [[hinge]].<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe upper receiver contains the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier assembly and is attached to the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] assembly. [[Sight (device)|Sights]] will be attached to the upper receiver or the barrel assembly. A handguard usually encloses the barrel and a [[gas-operated reloading]] device using burnt powder gas vented from a hole (or port) in the barrel near the forward end of the handguard. The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel.<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the buttstock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting un-burned [[smokeless powder]] residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions.

These carbines have become popular for police use in confined urban spaces, and the collapsible buttstock compensates for the additional thickness of [[body armor]]. The shorter barrel reduced bullet velocity by about five percent, and bullet energy by about ten percent. The shorter barrel required moving the gas port closer to the chamber exposing the self-loading system to higher pressures and temperatures which increase stress on moving parts like the bolt lugs and extractor. Although Colt offered a heavier 20-inch barrel for improved accuracy beginning in 1986, increased barrel weight may impair [[ergonomic]] balance; so shorter barrels have dominated recent rifle production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knupp |first=Jeremiah |year=2019 |title=This Is My Rifle: The Case For The 20\"-Barreled AR-15 |journal=American Rifleman |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201345 & 70\u201372 |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver (M4 variant) which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/> While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled.<ref name=\"Sweeney2016bm\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing the AR-15, the Bench Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88WdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 August 2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4660-9|pages=7\u20139}}</ref> From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Makes the AR-15 So Appealing to Mass Shooters? |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/ar-15-mass-murderer-link/ |first=Meghan |last=O\u2019Dea |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 15, 2018 |quote=While Colt alone makes the official AR-15, variants and knock-offs are made by a huge number of gun manufactures, including Bushmaster, Les Baer, Remington, Smith & Wesson (swhc, +0.00%), and Sturm & Ruger (rgr, -2.04%), just to name a few.

The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions often requires the removal of these pins. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a [[hinge]].<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe upper receiver contains the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] carrier assembly and is attached to the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] assembly. [[Sight (device)|Sights]] will be attached to the upper receiver or the barrel assembly.

The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel.<ref name=colt/>\n\nThe initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the buttstock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting un-burned [[smokeless powder]] residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions. A more recent alternative design has a metal operating rod pushing against the bolt carrier from a gas piston under the handguard near the barrel port.

Most components are interchangeable between semi-auto and select fire rifles including magazines, sights, upper receiver, barrels and accessories.<ref name=\"Bartocci1\">{{cite web|last1=Bartocci|first1=Christopher|title=AR-15/M16: The Rifle That Was Never Supposed to Be|url=https://gundigest.com/reviews/the-ar-16m16-the-rifle-that-was-never-supposed-to-be|website=GunDigest|publisher=Gun Digest Media|accessdate=March 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310200746/https://gundigest.com/reviews/the-ar-16m16-the-rifle-that-was-never-supposed-to-be|archive-date=March 10, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Zimba|first1=Jeff|title=The Evolution of the Black Rifle|date=2014|publisher=Prepper Press|isbn=0692317260}}</ref> The military [[M4 carbine]] typically uses a {{convert|14.5|in|cm|adj=on}} barrel.

Parts changed include the lower receiver, bolt carrier, hammer, trigger, disconnector, and safety/mode selector. The semi-automatic bolt carrier has a longer lightening slot to prevent the bolt's engagement with an automatic sear. Due to a decrease in mass, the buffer spring is heavier. On the select-fire version, the hammer has an extra spur which interacts with the additional auto-sear that holds it back until the bolt carrier group is fully in battery, when the automatic fire is selected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hanks|first1=D.

These carbines have become popular for police use in confined urban spaces, and the collapsible buttstock compensates for the additional thickness of [[body armor]]. The shorter barrel reduced bullet velocity by about five percent, and bullet energy by about ten percent. The shorter barrel required moving the gas port closer to the chamber exposing the self-loading system to higher pressures and temperatures which increase stress on moving parts like the bolt lugs and extractor. Although Colt offered a heavier 20-inch barrel for improved accuracy beginning in 1986, increased barrel weight may impair [[ergonomic]] balance; so shorter barrels have dominated recent rifle production.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knupp |first=Jeremiah |year=2019 |title=This Is My Rifle: The Case For The 20\"-Barreled AR-15 |journal=American Rifleman |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201345 & 70\u201372 |publisher=[[National Rifle Association]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver (M4 variant) which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/> While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled.<ref name=\"Sweeney2016bm\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing the AR-15, the Bench Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88WdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|date=30 August 2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4660-9|pages=7\u20139}}</ref> From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Makes the AR-15 So Appealing to Mass Shooters? |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/ar-15-mass-murderer-link/ |first=Meghan |last=O\u2019Dea |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=February 15, 2018 |quote=While Colt alone makes the official AR-15, variants and knock-offs are made by a huge number of gun manufactures, including Bushmaster, Les Baer, Remington, Smith & Wesson (swhc, +0.00%), and Sturm & Ruger (rgr, -2.04%), just to name a few.
