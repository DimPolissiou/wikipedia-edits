The work, in [[E&nbsp;minor]] takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}} (ABA)\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]''. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre. According to [[Philipp Spitta]], [[Johann Michael Bach]]'s motet {{ill|Halt, was du hast|choralwiki|Halt, was du hast (Johann Michael Bach)|lt=''Halt, was du hast''}}, [[ABA&nbsp;I,&nbsp;10]], which contains a setting of the \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" chorale, may have been on Johann Sebastian's mind when he composed his motet named after the chorale, in E&nbsp;minor like his ancestor's.{{sfn|Spitta|1899|p=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastianb02spituoft#page/601 601]}}\n\nBach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|pp=228\u2013233, 459, 467}}{{sfn|Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um BWV deest (BC C 8) at Bach Digital}} ''Jesu, meine Freude'' is one of only five (BWV&nbsp;225\u2013229) which, without exception, have always been considered as belonging in that category.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} In eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} \n\n===Epistle text and chorale===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], 8:1\u20132 and 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers each take one verse from the Epistle as their text.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn's first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of its last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\n[[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s chorale melody for the hymn, [[Zahn number|Zahn]]&nbsp;8032, was published for the first time in his ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'' of 1653, after which several variants of the [[hymn tune]] were published in other hymnals over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}} The tune is in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} In the version of [[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch|Vopelius's ''Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch'']] of 1682, the hymnal used in Leipzig, the melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Vopelius|1682|p=[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch#p. 780|780]]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The hymn tune appears in several variants in the uneven movements of the motet.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\nAs a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images.

Jones]] several movements of the motet show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, so that the final arrangement of the work likely happened in the late 1720s, around the time when two other motets which can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]], were written.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet: the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Structure and scoring ==\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. Only the alto, the middle voice in the motet's SSATB setting, sings in all movements. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing ''colla parte'' in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}\n\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas (indicated with stanza numbers 1 and 6 in the diagram below). The second (Rom.&nbsp;8:1) and penultimate (Rom.&nbsp;8:11) movements use the same themes in [[Fugue (music)|fugal writing]]. The third (stanza 2) and fifth (stanza 3) movements, both five-part, mirror the seventh (stanza 4) and ninth (stanza 5) movements, both four-part. The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices.

All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe structure of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been regarded as unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\nPerformers of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small vocal ensemble or a larger choir, a continuo group, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Wolf (score)|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}}\n\n=== 18th and 19th centuries ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, there is no extant [[autograph (music)|autograph]] of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}.

The work takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}} (ABA)\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]''. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre. According to [[Philipp Spitta]], [[Johann Michael Bach]]'s motet {{ill|Halt, was du hast|choralwiki|Halt, was du hast (Johann Michael Bach)|lt=''Halt, was du hast''}}, [[ABA&nbsp;I,&nbsp;10]], which contains a setting of the \"[[Jesu, meine Freude]]\" chorale, may have been on Johann Sebastian's mind when he composed his motet named after that chorale.{{sfn|Spitta|1899|p=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastianb02spituoft#page/601 601]}}\n\nBach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|pp=228\u2013233, 459, 467}}{{sfn|Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um BWV deest (BC C 8) at Bach Digital}} ''Jesu, meine Freude'' is one of only five (BWV&nbsp;225\u2013229) which, without exception, have always been considered as belonging in that category.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} In eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} \n\n===Epistle text and chorale===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], 8:1\u20132 and 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers each take one verse from the Epistle as their text.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn's first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of its last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\n[[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s chorale melody for the hymn, [[Zahn number|Zahn]]&nbsp;8032, was published for the first time in his ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'' of 1653, after which several variants of the [[hymn tune]] were published in other hymnals over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}} The tune is in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} In the version of [[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch|Vopelius's ''Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch'']] of 1682, the hymnal used in Leipzig, the melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Vopelius|1682|p=[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch#p. 780|780]]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The hymn tune appears in several variants in the uneven movements of the motet.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\nAs a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images.

Jones]] several movements of the motet show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, so that the final arrangement of the work likely happened in the late 1720s, around the time when two other motets which can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]], were written.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet: the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Structure and scoring ==\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. Only the alto, the middle voice in the motet's SSATB setting, sings in all movements. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing ''colla parte'' in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}\n\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas (indicated with stanza numbers 1 and 6 in the diagram below). The second (Rom.&nbsp;8:1) and penultimate (Rom.&nbsp;8:11) movements use the same themes in [[Fugue (music)|fugal writing]]. The third (stanza 2) and fifth (stanza 3) movements, both five-part, mirror the seventh (stanza 4) and ninth (stanza 5) movements, both four-part. The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices.

It concealed a number of facts.\"<ref name=\"exodus\"/>\n\nPresident [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] and (after some hesitation) Prime Minister [[V\u00e1clav Klaus]] attempted to convince the Romanies not to leave. With the help of Romani leaders like [[Emil Scuka]], Chairman of the [[Roma Civic Initiative]], they urged Romanies to remain in country and work to solve their problems with the larger Czech population.\n\nThe movement of Romanies to Canada had been fairly easy because [[Visa (document)|visa]] requirements for Czech citizens had been lifted by the [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada|Canadian government]] in April 1996.

Prior to this issue, Spawn was an assassin who worked for the government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no real direction in his actions. In Angela, a cruel and malicious angel, Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawn's existence, as well as providing a moral opposite. Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction, providing guidance. Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self-serving or evil, giving additional character development to [[Malebolgia]], the demon that creates Hellspawn.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nAs intended,<ref>See Judge Shabaz's ruling for the legal reasoning: \"As a co-owner, McFarlane was not violating the Copyright Act by unilaterally publishing the jointly owned work, but, as in any other case of conversion or misappropriation, he would have to account to the other joint owner for the latter's share of the profits.\"</ref> all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider Spawn universe.

Prior to this issue, Spawn was an assassin who worked for the government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no real direction in his actions. In Angela, a cruel and malicious angel, Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawn's existence, as well as providing a moral opposite. Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction, providing guidance. Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self-serving or evil, giving additional character development to [[Malebolgia]], the demon that creates Hellspawn.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nAs intended,<ref>See Judge Shabaz's ruling for the legal reasoning: \"As a co-owner, McFarlane was not violating the Copyright Act by unilaterally publishing the jointly owned work, but, as in any other case of conversion or misappropriation, he would have to account to the other joint owner for the latter's share of the profits.\"</ref> all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider Spawn universe.

The site grew very rapidly after the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway]] (Rock Island) built a line from [[Liberal, Kansas]] to [[Texhoma, Texas]] in 1901. A community, first named '''Sanford''' by the U.S. Post Office Department, was situated along the line. It was renamed '''Guymon''' a month later by postal officials to avoid confusion with the town of [[Stratford, Texas]], which was further down the line.  Guymon incorporated in 1901. The town [[plat]] was filed in Beaver County, Oklahoma Territory, in 1904.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nGuymon's growth was helped when most of the businesses moved there from the nearby town of [[Hardesty, Oklahoma|Hardesty]]. One of these was the newspaper, ''Hardesty Herald'', which owner Richard B. Quinn quickly renamed as the ''Guymon Herald''. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, Guymon claimed 839 residents, and was named county seat of the newly created Texas County. By the 1910 U.S. census, the town had 1,342 residents. It also had three banks, three hotels, four doctors,  a flour mill, a grain company and several retail establishments. A second newspaper, the ''Guymon Democrat'', was in business. Agriculture became the basis of Guymon's economy. The 1920 census recorded 1,507 residents, which grew to 2,181 in 1930.  By 1932, the town had two cream stations and five grain elevators.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s had a negative effect on Guymon. Some old-time residents remember \"[[Black Sunday (storm)|Black Sunday]]\", April 14, 1935, as the day of the worst dust storm in the area's history. However, discovery of the nearby [[Hugoton Gas Field|Hugoton-Panhandle gas field]] created many new jobs, and brought Guymon's population to 2,290 in 1940.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nThe Guymon Pioneer Days Rodeo has offered tributes to the community's pioneer spirit every May since 1933.  In 2014 the rodeo was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame of the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA).  In 2006, the rodeo had over 900 contestants with over $385,000 in prize money.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guymonrodeo.com|title= Guymon Pioneer Days Rodeo|accessdate=2008-04-23 |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated on the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] of the central [[Oklahoma Panhandle]] Guymon sits {{convert|122|mi|km|0}} north of [[Amarillo, Texas]] and {{convert|120|mi|km|0}} west-northwest of [[Woodward, Oklahoma]].

The site grew very rapidly after the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway]] (Rock Island) built a line from [[Liberal, Kansas]] to [[Texhoma, Texas]] in 1901. A community, first named '''Sanford''' by the U.S. Post Office Department, was situated along the line. It was renamed '''Guymon''' a month later by postal officials to avoid confusion with the town of [[Stratford, Texas]], which was further down the line.  Guymon incorporated in 1901. The town [[plat]] was filed in Beaver County, Oklahoma Territory, in 1904.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nGuymon's growth was helped when most of the businesses moved there from the nearby town of [[Hardesty, Oklahoma|Hardesty]]. One of these was the newspaper, ''Hardesty Herald'', which owner Richard B. Quinn quickly renamed as the ''Guymon Herald''. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, Guymon claimed 839 residents, and was named county seat of the newly created Texas County. By the 1910 U.S. census, the town had 1,342 residents. It also had three banks, three hotels, four doctors,  a flour mill, a grain company and several retail establishments. A second newspaper, the ''Guymon Democrat'', was in business. Agriculture became the basis of Guymon's economy. The 1920 census recorded 1,507 residents, which grew to 2,181 in 1930.  By 1932, the town had two cream stations and five grain elevators.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s had a negative effect on Guymon. Some old-time residents remember \"[[Black Sunday (storm)|Black Sunday]]\", April 14, 1935, as the day of the worst dust storm in the area's history. However, discovery of the nearby [[Hugoton Gas Field|Hugoton-Panhandle gas field]] created many new jobs, and brought Guymon's population to 2,290 in 1940.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nThe Guymon Pioneer Days Rodeo has offered tributes to the community's pioneer spirit every May since 1933.  In 2014 the rodeo was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame of the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA).  In 2006, the rodeo had over 900 contestants with over $385,000 in prize money.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guymonrodeo.com|title= Guymon Pioneer Days Rodeo|accessdate=2008-04-23 |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated on the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] of the central [[Oklahoma Panhandle]] Guymon sits {{convert|122|mi|km|0}} north of [[Amarillo, Texas]] and {{convert|120|mi|km|0}} west-northwest of [[Woodward, Oklahoma]].

The African [[slave rebellion]]s in 1763 and 1823 were seminal moments in the nation's history. Africans were enslaved and transported to Guyana as [[slave]]s; in contrast, East Indians came as [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers.]] Guyana's recent history is characterized in particular by the struggle to free itself from colonial rule, and from the lingering effects of [[colonialism]].\n\nOn May 26, 1966, Guyana gained independence from Britain.\n\n== Pre-colonial Guyana and first contacts ==\nThe first people to reach Guyana made their way from Asia, perhaps as far back as 35,000 years ago. These first inhabitants were [[nomads]] who slowly migrated south into Central and South America. At the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages, Guyana's inhabitants were divided into two groups, the [[Arawaks|Arawak]] along the coast and the [[Kalina people|Carib]] in the interior. One of the legacies of the indigenous peoples was the word Guiana, often used to describe the region encompassing modern Guyana as well as [[Suriname]] (former Dutch Guiana) and [[French Guiana]]. The word, which means \"land of waters\", is appropriate considering the area's multitude of rivers and streams.\n\nHistorians speculate that the Arawaks and Caribs originated in the South American [[hinterland]] and migrated northward, first to the present-day Guianas and then to the [[Caribbean islands]]. The Arawak, mainly cultivators, hunters, and fishermen, migrated to the Caribbean islands before the Carib and settled throughout the region. The tranquility of Arawak society was disrupted by the arrival of the bellicose Carib from the South American interior. The warlike behavior of the Carib and their violent migration north made an impact. By the end of the 15th century, the Carib had displaced the Arawak throughout the islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. The Carib settlement of the Lesser Antilles also affected Guyana's future development. The Spanish explorers and settlers who came after Columbus found that the Arawak proved easier to conquer than the Carib, who fought hard to maintain their independence. This fierce resistance, along with a lack of gold in the Lesser Antilles, contributed to the Spanish emphasis on conquest and settlement of the [[Greater Antilles]] and the mainland. Only a weak Spanish effort was made at consolidating Spain's authority in the Lesser Antilles (with the arguable exception of [[Trinidad]]) and the Guianas.\n\n==Colonial-Guyana==\n[[File:Guiana and Amazon Region - 1649.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A map created circa 1649 depicting the Guiana region. Territory claimed by Spain in red to the west, Dutch Guiana highlighted in yellow and Portuguese territory in red to the southeast. The mythical Lake Parime is also visible.]]\n\n===Early colonisation===\n[[File:LocationNetherlandsGuiana.png|thumb|right|250px|A map of Dutch Guiana 1667\u20131814 CE.]]\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle modern day Guyana. The Netherlands had [[Dutch Revolt|obtained independence from Spain]] in the late 16th century and by the early 17th century had emerged as a major commercial power, trading with the fledgling English and French colonies in the Lesser Antilles. In 1616 the Dutch established the first European settlement in the area of Guyana, a trading post twenty-five kilometers upstream from the mouth of the [[Essequibo River]]. Other settlements followed, usually a few kilometers inland on the larger rivers. The initial purpose of the Dutch settlements was trade with the indigenous people. The Dutch aim soon changed to acquisition of territory as other European powers gained colonies elsewhere in the Caribbean. Although Guyana was claimed by the Spanish, who sent periodic patrols through the region, the Dutch gained control over the region early in the 17th century. Dutch sovereignty was officially recognized with the signing of the [[Peace of M\u00fcnster|Treaty of Munster]] in 1648.\n\nIn 1621 the government of the Netherlands gave the newly formed [[Dutch West India Company]] complete control over the trading post on the Essequibo. This Dutch commercial concern administered the colony, known as [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]], for more than 170 years. The company established a second colony, on the [[Berbice River]] southeast of [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]], in 1627. Although under the general jurisdiction of this private group, the settlement, named [[Berbice]], was governed separately. [[Demerara]], situated between Essequibo and Berbice, was settled in 1741 and emerged in 1773 as a separate colony under direct control of the Dutch West India Company.\n\nAlthough the Dutch colonizers initially were motivated by the prospect of trade in the Caribbean, their possessions became significant producers of crops. The growing importance of agriculture was indicated by the export of 15,000 kilograms of [[tobacco]] from Essequibo in 1623. But as the agricultural productivity of the Dutch colonies increased, a labor shortage emerged. The indigenous populations were poorly adapted for work on [[plantations]], and many people died from [[Population history of American indigenous peoples#Depopulation from disease|diseases introduced by the Europeans]]. The Dutch West India Company turned to the importation of [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]]<nowiki/>, who rapidly became a key element in the colonial economy. By the 1660s, the enslaved population numbered about 2,500; the number of indigenous people was estimated at 50,000, most of whom had retreated into the vast hinterland. Although enslaved Africans were considered an essential element of the colonial economy, their working conditions were brutal. The mortality rate was high, and the dismal conditions led to more than half a dozen rebellions led by the enslaved Africans.\n\nThe most famous uprising of the enslaved Africans, the [[Berbice Slave Uprising]], began in February 1763. On two plantations on the [[Canje River]] in Berbice, the enslaved Africans rebelled, taking control of the region. As plantation after plantation fell to the enslaved Africans, the European population fled; eventually only half of the whites who had lived in the colony remained. Led by [[Cuffy (person)|Cuffy]] (now the national hero of Guyana), the escaped enslaved Africans came to number about 3,000 and threatened European control over the Guianas. The rebels were defeated with the assistance of troops from neighbouring European colonies like from the British, French, [[Sint Eustatius]] and overseas from the [[Dutch Republic]]. The 1763 Monument on Square of the Revolution in Georgetown, Guyana commemorates the uprising.\n\n===Transition to British rule===\n[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of British Guiana.]]\nEager to attract more settlers, in 1746 the Dutch authorities opened the area near the [[Demerara River]] to British immigrants. British plantation owners in the Lesser Antilles had been plagued by poor soil and erosion, and many were lured to the Dutch colonies by richer soils and the promise of landownership. The influx of British citizens was so great that by 1760 the English constituted a majority of the European population of Demerara.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} By 1786 the internal affairs of this Dutch colony were effectively under British control,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} though two-thirds of the plantation owners were still Dutch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20720/VdKreeke,%20Essequebo%20en%20Demerary%201741-1781.pdf\n|title=Essequebo en Demerary, 1741-1781: beginfase van de Britse overname |author=Kreeke, Frank van de |year=2013 |accessdate=2015-03-23|publisher= Leiden University Master Thesis}}</ref>\n\nAs economic growth accelerated in Demerara and Essequibo, strains began to appear in the relations between the planters and the Dutch West India Company. Administrative reforms during the early 1770s had greatly increased the cost of government. The company periodically sought to raise taxes to cover these expenditures and thereby provoked the resistance of the planters. In 1781 a [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|war]] broke out between the Netherlands and Britain, which resulted in the British occupation of Berbice, Essequibo, and Demerara. Some months later, France, allied with the Netherlands, seized control of the colonies. The French governed for two years, during which they constructed a new town, Longchamps, at the mouth of the Demerara River. When the Dutch regained power in 1784, they moved their colonial capital to Longchamps, which they renamed Stabroeck. The capital was in 1812 renamed [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] by the British.\n\nThe return of Dutch rule reignited conflict between the planters of Essequibo and Demerara and the Dutch West India Company. Disturbed by plans for an increase in the slave tax and a reduction in their representation on the colony's judicial and policy councils, the colonists petitioned the Dutch government to consider their grievances. In response, a special committee was appointed, which proceeded to draw up a report called the [[Concept Plan of Redress]]. This document called for far-reaching constitutional reforms and later became the basis of the British governmental structure. The plan proposed a decision-making body to be known as the [[Court of Policy]]. The judiciary was to consist of two courts of justice, one serving Demerara and the other Essequibo. The membership of the Court of Policy and of the courts of justice would consist of company officials and planters who owned more than twenty-five slaves. The Dutch commission that was assigned the responsibility of implementing this new system of government returned to the Netherlands with extremely unfavorable reports concerning the Dutch West India Company's administration. The company's charter therefore was allowed to expire in 1792 and the Concept Plan of Redress was put into effect in Demerara and Essequibo. Renamed the [[United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo]], the area then came under the direct control of the Dutch government. Berbice maintained its status as a separate colony.\n\nThe catalyst for formal British takeover was the [[French Revolution]] and the subsequent [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1795 the French occupied the Netherlands. The British declared war on France and in 1796 launched an expeditionary force from [[Barbados]] to occupy the Dutch colonies. The British takeover was bloodless, and local Dutch administration of the colony was left relatively uninterrupted under the constitution provided by the Concept Plan of Redress.\n\nBoth Berbice and the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo were under British control from 1796 to 1802. By means of the [[Treaty of Amiens]], both were returned to Dutch control. Peace was short-lived, however. War between Britain and France resumed in less than a year, and in 1803 the United Colony and Berbice were seized once more by British troops. At the [[London Convention of 1814]], both colonies were formally ceded to Britain. In 1831, Berbice and the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo were unified as [[British Guiana]]. The colony would remain under British control until independence in 1966.\n\n===Origins of the border dispute with Venezuela===\n[[File:Gran Colombia map.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of [[Gran Colombia]] (1819) including the Essequibo border.]]\nWhen Britain gained formal control over what is now Guyana in 1814, it also became involved in one of Latin America's most persistent border disputes. At the London Convention of 1814, the Dutch surrendered the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo and Berbice to the British, a colony which had the Essequibo river as its west border with the Spanish colony of Venezuela. Although Spain still claimed the region, the Spanish did not contest the treaty because they were preoccupied with their own colonies' struggles for independence. In 1835 the British government asked German explorer [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk]] to map British Guiana and mark its boundaries. As ordered by the British authorities, Schomburgk began British Guiana's western boundary with [[Venezuela]] at the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]], although all the Venezuelan maps showed the Essequibo river as the east border of the country. A map of the British colony was published in 1840. Venezuela protested, claiming the entire area west of the Essequibo River. Negotiations between Britain and Venezuela over the boundary began, but the two nations could reach no compromise. In 1850 both agreed not to occupy the disputed zone.\n\nThe discovery of gold in the contested area in the late 1850s reignited the dispute. British settlers moved into the region and the [[British Guiana Mining Company]] was formed to mine the deposits. Over the years, Venezuela made repeated protests and proposed arbitration, but the British government was uninterested. Venezuela finally broke diplomatic relations with Britain in 1887 and appealed to the United States for help. The British at first rebuffed the United States government's suggestion of arbitration, but when President [[Grover Cleveland]] threatened to intervene according to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], Britain agreed to let an international tribunal arbitrate the boundary in 1897.\n\nFor two years, the tribunal consisting of two Britons, two Americans, and a Russian studied the case in Paris (France).<ref>https://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXVIII/331-340.pdf</ref> Their three-to-two decision, handed down in 1899, awarded 94 percent of the disputed territory to British Guiana. Venezuela received only the mouths of the Orinoco River and a short stretch of the Atlantic coastline just to the east. Although Venezuela was unhappy with the decision, a commission surveyed a new border in accordance with the award, and both sides accepted the boundary in 1905. The issue was considered settled for the next half-century.\n\n===The early British Colony and the labour  problem===\n[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Georgetown in 1823 CE.]]\nPolitical, economic, and social life in the 19th century was dominated by a European planter class. Although the smallest group in terms of numbers, members of the [[plantocracy]] had links to British commercial interests in London and often enjoyed close ties to the governor, who was appointed by the monarch. The plantocracy also controlled exports and the working conditions of the majority of the population. The next social stratum consisted of a small number of [[freed slaves]], many of mixed African and European heritage, in addition to some [[Portugal|Portuguese]] merchants. At the lowest level of society was the majority, the African slaves who lived and worked in the countryside, where the plantations were located. Unconnected to colonial life, small groups of Amerindians lived in the hinterland.\n\nColonial life was changed radically by the demise of slavery. Although the international slave trade was [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished]] in the [[British Empire]] in 1807, slavery itself continued. In what is known as the [[Demerara rebellion of 1823]] 10\u201313,000 slaves in [[Demerara-Essequibo]] rose up against their oppressors.{{sfn|R\u00e9vauger|2008|pp=105\u2013106}} Although the rebellion was easily crushed,{{sfn|R\u00e9vauger|2008|pp=105\u2013106}} the momentum for abolition remained, and by 1838 total emancipation had been effected. The end of slavery had several ramifications. Most significantly, many former slaves rapidly departed the plantations. Some ex-slaves moved to towns and villages, feeling that field labor was degrading and inconsistent with freedom, but others pooled their resources to purchase the abandoned estates of their former masters and created village communities. Establishing small settlements provided the new Afro-Guyanese communities an opportunity to grow and sell food, an extension of a practice under which slaves had been allowed to keep the money that came from the sale of any surplus produce. The emergence of an independent-minded Afro-Guyanese peasant class, however, threatened the planters' political power, inasmuch as the planters no longer held a near-monopoly on the colony's economic activity.\n\nEmancipation also resulted in the introduction of new ethnic and cultural groups into British Guiana. The departure of the Afro-Guyanese from the sugar plantations soon led to labor shortages. After unsuccessful attempts throughout the 19th century to attract Portuguese workers from [[Madeira]], the estate owners were again left with an inadequate supply of labor. The Portuguese had not taken to plantation work and soon moved into other parts of the economy, especially retail business, where they became competitors with the new Afro-Guyanese middle class. Some 14,000 Chinese came to the colony between 1853 and 1912. Like their Portuguese predecessors, the Chinese forsook the plantations for the retail trades and soon became assimilated into Guianese society.\n\nConcerned about the plantations' shrinking labor pool and the potential decline of the [[sugar]] sector, British authorities, like their counterparts in Dutch Guiana, began to contract for the services of poorly paid [[indentured workers from India]]. The East Indians, as this group was known locally, signed on for a certain number of years, after which, in theory, they would return to India with their savings from working in the sugar fields. The introduction of indentured East Indian workers alleviated the labor shortage and added another group to Guyana's ethnic mix. A majority of the East Indian workers had their origins in eastern Uttar Pradesh, with a smaller amount coming from Tamil and Telugu speaking areas in southern India. A small minority of these workers came from other areas such as Bengal, Punjab, and Gujarat. Areas of India that were under British occupation had been devastated over decades by famines caused by [[Famine in India| British policies]] leading to the wide availability of workers willing to emigrate.\n\n== Political and social awakenings ==\n\n=== Nineteenth-century British Guiana ===\n\nThe constitution of the British colony favored the white planters. Planter political power was based in the Court of Policy and the two courts of justice, established in the late 18th century under Dutch rule. The Court of Policy had both legislative and administrative functions and was composed of the governor, three colonial officials, and four colonists, with the governor presiding. The courts of justice resolved judicial matters, such as licensing and civil service appointments, which were brought before them by petition.\n\nThe Court of Policy and the courts of justice, controlled by the plantation owners, constituted the center of power in British Guiana. The colonists who sat on the Court of Policy and the courts of justice were appointed by the governor from a list of nominees submitted by two electoral colleges. In turn, the seven members of each [[College of Electors]] were elected for life by those planters possessing twenty-five or more slaves. Though their power was restricted to nominating colonists to fill vacancies on the three major governmental councils, these electoral colleges provided a setting for political agitation by the planters.\n\nRaising and disbursing revenue was the responsibility of the [[Combined Court]], which included members of the Court of Policy and six additional financial representatives appointed by the College of Electors. In 1855 the Combined Court also assumed responsibility for setting the salaries of all government officials. This duty made the Combined Court a center of intrigues resulting in periodic clashes between the governor and the planters.\n\nOther Guyanese began to demand a more representative political system in the 19th century. By the late 1880s, pressure from the new Afro-Guyanese middle class was building for constitutional reform. In particular, there were calls to convert the Court of Policy into an assembly with ten elected members, to ease voter qualifications, and to abolish the College of Electors. Reforms were resisted by the planters, led by [[Henry K. Davson]], owner of a large plantation. In London the planters had allies in the [[West India Committee]] and also in the [[West India Association of Glasgow]], both presided over by proprietors with major interests in British Guiana.\n\nConstitutional revisions in 1891 incorporated some of the changes demanded by the reformers. The planters lost political influence with the abolition of the College of Electors and the relaxation of voter qualification. At the same time, the Court of Policy was enlarged to sixteen members; eight of these were to be elected members whose power would be balanced by that of eight appointed members. The Combined Court also continued, consisting, as previously, of the Court of Policy and six financial representatives who were now elected. To ensure that there would be no shift of power to elected officials, the governor remained the head of the Court of Policy; the executive duties of the Court of Policy were transferred to a new [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]], which the governor and planters dominated. The 1891 revisions were a great disappointment to the colony's reformers. As a result of the [[British Guiana general election, 1892|1892 elections]], the membership of the new Combined Court was almost identical to that of the previous one.\n\nThe next three decades saw additional, although minor, political changes. In 1897 the [[secret ballot]] was introduced. A reform in 1909 expanded the limited British Guiana electorate, and for the first time, Afro-Guyanese constituted a majority of the eligible voters.\n\nPolitical changes were accompanied by social change and jockeying by various ethnic groups for increased power. The British and Dutch planters refused to accept the Portuguese as equals and sought to maintain their status as aliens with no rights in the colony, especially voting rights. The political tensions led the Portuguese to establish the [[Reform Association]]. After the [[anti-Portuguese riots of 1898]], the Portuguese recognized the need to work with other disenfranchised elements of Guyanese society, in particular the Afro-Guyanese. By around the start of the 20th century, organizations including the Reform Association and the [[Reform Club]] began to demand greater participation in the colony's affairs. These organizations were largely the instruments of a small but articulate emerging middle class. Although the new middle class sympathized with the working class, the middle-class political groups were hardly representative of a national political or social movement. Indeed, working-class grievances were usually expressed in the form of riots.\n\n=== Political and social changes in the early twentieth century ===\n\nThe 1905 [[Ruimveldt Riots (1905)|Ruimveldt Riots]] rocked British Guiana. The severity of these outbursts reflected the workers' widespread dissatisfication with their standard of living. The uprising began in late November 1905 when the Georgetown [[stevedores]] went on strike, demanding higher wages. The strike grew confrontational, and other workers struck in sympathy, creating the country's first urban-rural worker alliance. On November 30, crowds of people took to the streets of Georgetown, and by December 1, 1905, now referred to as Black Friday, the situation had spun out of control. At the [[Plantation Ruimveldt]], close to Georgetown, a large crowd of porters refused to disperse when ordered to do so by a police patrol and a detachment of artillery. The colonial authorities opened fire, and four workers were seriously injured.\n\nWord of the shootings spread rapidly throughout Georgetown and hostile crowds began roaming the city, taking over a number of buildings. By the end of the day, seven people were dead and seventeen badly injured. In a panic, the British administration called for help. Britain sent troops, who finally quelled the uprising. Although the stevedores' strike failed, the riots had planted the seeds of what would become an organized trade union movement.\n\nEven though [[World War I]] was fought far beyond the borders of British Guiana, the war altered Guyanese society. The Afro-Guyanese who joined the British military became the nucleus of an elite Afro-Guyanese community upon their return. World War I also led to the end of East Indian indentured service. British concerns over political stability in India and criticism by Indian nationalists that the program was a form of human bondage caused the British government to outlaw indentured labor in 1917.\n\nIn the closing years of World War I, the colony's first trade union was formed. The [[British Guiana Labour Union]] (BGLU) was established in 1917 under the leadership of [[H.N. Critchlow]] and led by [[Alfred A. Thorne]]. Formed in the face of widespread business opposition, the BGLU at first mostly represented Afro-Guyanese [[dockworkers]]. Its membership stood around 13,000 by 1920, and it was granted legal status in 1921 under the [[Trades Union Ordinance]]. Although recognition of other unions would not come until 1939, the BGLU was an indication that the working class was becoming politically aware and more concerned with its rights.\n\nThe second trade union, the British Guiana Workers' League, was established in 1931 by [[Alfred A. Thorne]], who served as the League's leader for 22 years. The League sought to improve the working conditions for people of all ethnic backgrounds in the colony. Most workers were of West African, East Indian, Chinese and Portuguese descent, and had been brought to the country under a system of forced or indentured labor.\n\nAfter World War I, new economic interest groups began to clash with the Combined Court. The country's economy had come to depend less on sugar and more on rice and [[bauxite]], and producers of these new commodities resented the sugar planters' continued domination of the Combined Court. Meanwhile, the planters were feeling the effects of lower sugar prices and wanted the Combined Court to provide the necessary funds for new drainage and irrigation programs.\n\nTo stop the bickering and resultant legislative paralysis, in 1928 the [[Colonial Office]] announced a new constitution that would make British Guiana a [[crown colony]] under tight control of a governor appointed by the Colonial Office. The Combined Court and the Court of Policy were replaced by a [[Legislative Council]] with a majority of appointed members. To middle-class and working-class political activists, this new constitution represented a step backward and a victory for the planters. Influence over the governor, rather than the promotion of a particular public policy, became the most important issue in any political campaign.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s brought economic hardship to all segments of Guyanese society. All of the colony's major exports\u2014sugar, rice and bauxite\u2014were affected by low prices, and unemployment soared. As in the past, the working class found itself lacking a political voice during a time of worsening economic conditions. By the mid-1930s, British Guiana and the whole British Caribbean were marked by labor unrest and violent demonstrations. In the aftermath of riots throughout the [[British West Indies]], a royal commission under [[Lord Moyne]] was established to determine the reasons for the riots and to make recommendations.\n\nIn British Guiana, the [[Moyne Commission]] questioned a wide range of people, including trade unionists, Afro-Guyanese professionals, and representatives of the Indo-Guyanese community. The commission pointed out the deep division between the country's two largest ethnic groups, the Afro-Guyanese and the Indo-Guyanese. The largest group, the Indo-Guyanese, consisted primarily of rural rice producers or merchants; they had retained the country's traditional culture and did not participate in national politics. The Afro-Guyanese were largely urban workers or bauxite miners; they had adopted European culture and dominated national politics. To increase representation of the majority of the population in British Guiana, the Moyne Commission called for increased democratization of government as well as economic and social reforms.\n\nThe Moyne Commission report in 1938 was a turning point in British Guiana. It urged extending the franchise to women and persons not owning land and encouraged the emerging trade union movement. However, many of the Moyne Commission's recommendations were not immediately implemented because of the outbreak of [[World War II]] and because of British opposition.\n\nWith the fighting far away, the period of World War II in British Guiana was marked by continuing political reform and improvements to the national infrastructure. The governor, Sir [[Gordon Lethem]], created the country's first Ten-Year Development Plan (led by Sir Oscar Spencer, the Economic Adviser to the Governor and [[Alfred P. Thorne]], Assistant to the Economic Adviser), reduced property qualifications for office holding and voting, and made elective members a majority on the Legislative Council in 1943. Under the aegis of the [[Lend-Lease Act of 1941]], a modern air base (now [[Timehri Airport]]) was constructed by United States troops. By the end of World War II, British Guiana's political system had been widened to encompass more elements of society and the economy's foundations had been strengthened by increased demand for bauxite.\n\n== Pre-independence government==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Development of political parties===\nAt the end of World War II, political awareness and demands for independence grew in all segments of society. The immediate postwar period witnessed the founding of Guyana's major political parties. The [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) was founded on January 1, 1950. Internal conflicts developed in the PPP, and in 1957 the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] (PNC) was created as a split-off. These years also saw the beginning of a long and acrimonious struggle between the country's two dominant political personalities\u2014[[Cheddi Jagan]] and [[Linden Forbes Burnham]].\n\n====Cheddi Jagan====\n[[File:Cheddi_Jagan_Anefo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Cheddi Jagan]]]]\n[[Cheddi Jagan]] had been born in Guyana in 1918. His parents were immigrants from India. His father was a driver, a position considered to be on the lowest rung of the middle stratum of Guyanese society. Jagan's childhood gave him a lasting insight into rural poverty. Despite their poor background, the senior Jagan sent his son to [[Queen's College, Guyana|Queen's College]] in Georgetown. After his education there, Jagan went to the United States to study dentistry, graduating from [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] in 1942.\n\nJagan returned to British Guiana in October 1943 and was soon joined by his American wife, the former [[Janet Rosenberg]], who was to play a significant role in her new country's political development. Although Jagan established his own dentistry clinic, he was soon enmeshed in politics. After a number of unsuccessful forays into Guyana's political life, Jagan became treasurer of the [[Manpower Citizens' Association]] (MPCA) in 1945. The MPCA represented the colony's sugar workers, many of whom were Indo-Guyanese. Jagan's tenure was brief, as he clashed repeatedly with the more moderate union leadership over policy issues. Despite his departure from the MPCA a year after joining, the position allowed Jagan to meet other union leaders in British Guiana and throughout the English-speaking Caribbean.\n\n====Linden Forbes Sampson Burnham====\n[[File:Forbes_Burnham_(1966).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7| [[Forbes Burnham]] ]]\nBorn in 1923, [[Forbes Burnham]] was the sole son in a family that had three children. His father was headmaster of [[Kitty Methodist Primary School]], which was located just outside Georgetown. As part of the colony's educated class, young Burnham was exposed to political viewpoints at an early age. He did exceedingly well in school and went to London to obtain a law degree. Although not exposed to childhood poverty as was Jagan, Burnham was acutely aware of racial discrimination.\n\nThe social strata of the urban Afro-Guyanese community of the 1930s and 1940s included a mulatto or \"coloured\" elite, a black professional middle class, and, at the bottom, the black working class. Unemployment in the 1930s was high. When war broke out in 1939, many Afro-Guyanese joined the military, hoping to gain new job skills and escape poverty. When they returned home from the war, however, jobs were still scarce and discrimination was still a part of life.\n\n====Founding of the PAC and PPP====\nThe springboard for Jagan's political career was the Political Affairs Committee (PAC), formed in 1946 as a discussion group. The new organization published the ''[[PAC Bulletin]]'' to promote its [[Marxist]] ideology and ideas of liberation and decolonization. The PAC's outspoken criticism of the colony's poor living standards attracted followers as well as detractors.\n\nIn the November 1947 general elections, the PAC put forward several members as independent candidates. The PAC's major competitor was the newly formed  [[British Guiana Labour Party]], which, under [[J.B. Singh]], won six of fourteen seats contested. Jagan won a seat and briefly joined the Labour Party. But he had difficulties with his new party's center-right ideology and soon left its ranks. The Labour Party's support of the policies of the British governor and its inability to create a grass-roots base gradually stripped it of liberal supporters throughout the country. The Labour Party's lack of a clear-cut reform agenda left a vacuum, which Jagan rapidly moved to fill. Turmoil on the colony's sugar plantations gave him an opportunity to achieve national standing. After the June 16, 1948 police shootings of five Indo-Guyanese workers at [[Enmore, Guyana|Enmore]], close to Georgetown, the PAC and the [[Guiana Industrial Workers' Union]] (GIWU) organized a large and peaceful demonstration, which clearly enhanced Jagan's standing with the Indo-Guyanese population.\n\nAfter the PAC, Jagan's next major step was the founding of the [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) in January 1950. Using the PAC as a foundation, Jagan created from it a new party that drew support from both the Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese communities. To increase support among the Afro-Guyanese, Forbes Burnham was brought into the party.\n\nThe PPP's initial leadership was multi-ethnic and left of center, but hardly revolutionary. Jagan became the leader of the PPP's parliamentary group, and Burnham assumed the responsibilities of party chairman. Other key party members included Janet Jagan, [[Brindley Benn]]<ref>\"[http://www.guyanachronicle.com/site/index.php/news/courts/images/banners/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7323%3Aformer-deputy-prime-minister-brindley-benn-dies-at-86&Itemid=12 Former Deputy Prime Minister Brindley Benn dies at 86]\", ''Guyana Chronicle'', December 12, 2009</ref>  and [[Ashton Chase]], both PAC veterans. The new party's first victory came in the 1950 municipal elections, in which Janet Jagan won a seat. Cheddi Jagan and Burnham failed to win seats, but Burnham's campaign made a favorable impression on many Afro-Guyanese citizens.\n\nFrom its first victory in the 1950 municipal election, the PPP gathered momentum. However, the party's often strident [[anticapitalist]] and [[socialist]] message made the British government uneasy. Colonial officials showed their displeasure with the PPP in 1952 when, on a regional tour, the Jagans were designated prohibited immigrants in [[Trinidad]] and [[Grenada]].\n\nA British commission in 1950 recommended universal adult suffrage and the adoption of a [[ministerial system]] for British Guiana. The commission also recommended that power be concentrated in the [[executive branch]], that is, the office of the governor. These reforms presented British Guiana's parties with an opportunity to participate in national elections and form a government, but maintained power in the hands of the British-appointed chief executive. This arrangement rankled the PPP, which saw it as an attempt to curtail the party's political power.\n\n=== The first PPP government ===\n\nOnce the new constitution was adopted, elections were set for 1953. The PPP's coalition of lower-class Afro-Guyanese and rural Indo-Guyanese workers, together with elements of both ethnic groups' middle sectors, made for a formidable constituency. Conservatives branded the PPP as [[communist]], but the party campaigned on a center-left platform and appealed to a growing nationalism. The other major party participating in the election, the [[National Democratic Party (Guyana)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP), was a spin-off of the [[League of Coloured Peoples]] and was largely an Afro-Guyanese middle-class organization, sprinkled with middle-class Portuguese and Indo-Guyanese. The NDP, together with the poorly organized [[United Farmers and Workers Party]] and the [[United National Party]], was soundly defeated by the PPP. Final results gave the PPP eighteen of twenty-four seats compared with the NDP's two seats and four seats for independents.\n\nThe PPP's first administration was brief. The legislature opened on May 30, 1953. Already suspicious of Jagan and the PPP's radicalism, conservative forces in the business community were further distressed by the new administration's program of expanding the role of the state in the economy and society. The PPP also sought to implement its reform program at a rapid pace, which brought the party into confrontation with the governor and with high-ranking civil servants who preferred more gradual change. The issue of civil service appointments also threatened the PPP, in this case from within. Following the 1953 victory, these appointments became an issue between the predominantly Indo-Guyanese supporters of Jagan and the largely Afro-Guyanese backers of Burnham. Burnham threatened to split the party if he were not made sole leader of the PPP. A compromise was reached by which members of what had become Burnham's faction received ministerial appointments.\n\nThe PPP's introduction of the [[Labour Relations Act]] provoked a confrontation with the British. This law ostensibly was aimed at reducing intraunion rivalries, but would have favored the GIWU, which was closely aligned with the ruling party. The opposition charged that the PPP was seeking to gain control over the colony's economic and social life and was moving to stifle the opposition. The day the act was introduced to the legislature, the GIWU went on strike in support of the proposed law. The British government interpreted this intermingling of party politics and labor unionism as a direct challenge to the constitution and the authority of the governor. The day after the act was passed, on October 9, 1953, London suspended the colony's constitution and, under pretext of quelling disturbances, sent in troops.\n\n=== The interim government ===\n\nFollowing the suspension of the constitution, British Guiana was governed by an interim administration consisting of a small group of conservative politicians, businessmen, and civil servants that lasted until 1957. Order in the colonial government masked a growing rift in the country's main political party as the personal conflict between the PPP's Jagan and Burnham widened into a bitter dispute. In 1955 Jagan and Burnham formed rival wings of the PPP. Support for each leader was largely, but not totally, along ethnic lines. [[Joseph P. Lachmansingh|J. P. Lachmansingh]], a leading Indo-Guyanese and head of the GIWU, supported Burnham, whereas Jagan retained the loyalty of a number of leading Afro-Guyanese radicals, such as [[Sydney King]]. Burnham's wing of the PPP moved to the right, leaving Jagan's wing on the left, where he was regarded with considerable apprehension by Western governments and the colony's conservative business groups.\n\n=== The second PPP government===\n\nThe [[British Guiana general election, 1957|1957 elections]] held under a [[Constitution of Guyana|new constitution]] demonstrated the extent of the growing ethnic division within the Guyanese electorate. The revised constitution provided limited [[self-government]], primarily through the Legislative Council. Of the council's twenty-four delegates, fifteen were elected, six were nominated, and the remaining three were to be [[ex officio]] members from the interim administration. The two wings of the PPP launched vigorous campaigns, each attempting to prove that it was the legitimate heir to the original party. Despite denials of such motivation, both factions made a strong appeal to their respective ethnic constituencies.\n\nThe 1957 elections were convincingly won by [[Cheddi Jagan|Jagan]]'s [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|PPP]] faction. Although his group had a secure parliamentary majority, its support was drawn more and more from the [[Indo-Guyanese]] community. The faction's main planks were increasingly identified as Indo-Guyanese: more rice land, improved union representation in the sugar industry, and improved business opportunities and more government posts for Indo-Guyanese.\n\nJagan's veto of [[British Guiana]]'s participation in the [[West Indies Federation]] resulted in the complete loss of [[Afro-Guyanese]] support. In the late 1950s, the British Caribbean colonies had been actively negotiating establishment of a West Indies Federation. The PPP had pledged to work for the eventual political union of British Guiana with the Caribbean territories. The Indo-Guyanese, who constituted a majority in Guyana, were apprehensive of becoming part of a federation in which they would be outnumbered by people of African descent. Jagan's veto of the federation caused his party to lose all significant Afro-Guyanese support.\n\nBurnham learned an important lesson from the 1957 elections. He could not win if supported only by the lower-class, urban Afro-Guyanese. He needed [[middle-class]] allies, especially those Afro-Guyanese who backed the moderate [[United Democratic Party (Guyana)|United Democratic Party]]. From 1957 onward, Burnham worked to create a balance between maintaining the backing of the more radical Afro-Guyanese lower classes and gaining the support of the more capitalist middle class. Clearly, Burnham's stated preference for [[socialism]] would not bind those two groups together against Jagan, an avowed [[Marxist]]. The answer was something more basic: [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]. Burnham's appeals to race proved highly successful in bridging the schism that divided the Afro-Guyanese along class lines. This strategy convinced the powerful Afro-Guyanese middle class to accept a leader who was more of a radical than they would have preferred to support. At the same time, it neutralized the objections of the black working class to entering an alliance with those representing the more moderate interests of the middle classes. Burnham's move toward the right was accomplished with the merger of his PPP faction and the United Democratic Party into a new organization, the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] (PNC).\n\nFollowing the 1957 elections, Jagan rapidly consolidated his hold on the Indo-Guyanese community. Though candid in expressing his admiration for [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], and, later, [[Fidel Castro Ruz]], Jagan in power asserted that the PPP's Marxist-[[Leninist]] principles must be adapted to Guyana's own particular circumstances. Jagan advocated [[nationalization]] of foreign holdings, especially in the sugar industry. British fears of a communist takeover, however, caused the British governor to hold Jagan's more radical policy initiatives in check.\n\n=== PPP re-election and debacle ===\n\nThe 1961 elections were a bitter contest between the PPP, the PNC, and the United Force (UF), a conservative party representing big business, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and Amerindian, Chinese, and Portuguese voters. These elections were held under yet another new constitution that marked a return to the degree of self-government that existed briefly in 1953. It introduced a [[bicameral]] system boasting a wholly elected thirty-five-member Legislative Assembly and a thirteen-member Senate to be appointed by the governor. The post of prime minister was created and was to be filled by the majority party in the Legislative Assembly. With the strong support of the Indo-Guyanese population, the PPP again won by a substantial margin, gaining twenty seats in the Legislative Assembly, compared to eleven seats for the PNC and four for the UF. Jagan was named prime minister.\n\nJagan's administration became increasingly friendly with communist and leftist regimes; for instance, Jagan refused to observe the United States embargo on communist [[Cuba]]. After discussions between Jagan and Cuban revolutionary [[Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara]] in 1960 and 1961, Cuba offered British Guiana loans and equipment. In addition, the Jagan administration signed trade agreements with [[Hungary]] and the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany).\n\nFrom 1961 to 1964, Jagan was confronted with a destabilization campaign conducted by the PNC and UF. In addition to domestic opponents of Jagan, an important role was played by the [[American Institute for Free Labor Development]] (AIFLD), which was alleged to be a front for the [[CIA]]. Various reports say that AIFLD, with a budget of US$800,000, maintained anti-Jagan labor leaders on its payroll, as well as an AIFLD-trained staff of 11 activists who were assigned to organize riots and destabilize the Jagan government. Riots and demonstrations against the PPP administration were frequent, and during disturbances in 1962 and 1963 mobs destroyed part of Georgetown, doing $40 million in damage.<ref>Hirsch, Fred, ''The Labour Movement: Penetration Point for U.S. Intelligence and Transnationals'', Spokesman Books, 1977</ref><ref>Brereton, Bridget, ''General History of the Caribbean: The Caribbean in the Twentieth Century'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rGSCOTc90WUC&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=AIFLD+guyana+riots&source=bl&ots=O9d5B61giL&sig=bn7nJoWHuL-tC31I3lGD8DVBDu8&hl=en&ei=HuZRToetBKTUiALn0eWDAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=AIFLD%20guyana%20riots&f=false], UNESCO 2004</ref>\n\nTo counter the MPCA with its link to Burnham, the PPP formed the [[Guyanese Agricultural Workers Union]]. This new union's political mandate was to organize the Indo-Guyanese sugarcane field-workers. The MPCA immediately responded with a one-day strike to emphasize its continued control over the sugar workers.\n\nThe PPP government responded to the strike in March 1964 by publishing a new [[Labour Relations Bill]] almost identical to the 1953 legislation that had resulted in British intervention. Regarded as a power play for control over a key labor sector, introduction of the proposed law prompted protests and rallies throughout the capital. Riots broke out on April 5; they were followed on April 18 by a general strike. By May 9, the governor was compelled to declare a state of emergency. Nevertheless, the strike and violence continued until July 7, when the Labour Relations Bill was allowed to lapse without being enacted. To bring an end to the disorder, the government agreed to consult with union representatives before introducing similar bills. These disturbances exacerbated tension and animosity between the two major ethnic communities and made a reconciliation between Jagan and Burnham an impossibility.\n\nJagan's term had not yet ended when another round of labor unrest rocked the colony. The pro-PPP GIWU, which had become an umbrella group of all labor organizations, called on sugar workers to strike in January 1964. To dramatize their case, Jagan led a march by sugar workers from the interior to Georgetown. This demonstration ignited outbursts of violence that soon escalated beyond the control of the authorities. On May 22, the governor finally declared another state of emergency. The situation continued to worsen, and in June the governor assumed full powers, rushed in British troops to restore order, and proclaimed a moratorium on all political activity. By the end of the turmoil, 160 people were dead and more than 1,000 homes had been destroyed.\n\nIn an effort to quell the turmoil, the country's political parties asked the British government to modify the constitution to provide for more proportional representation. The colonial secretary proposed a fifty-three member unicameral legislature. Despite opposition from the ruling PPP, all reforms were implemented and new elections set for October 1964.\n\nAs Jagan feared, the PPP lost the general elections of 1964. The politics of ''[[apan jhaat]]'', [[Hindi]] for \"vote for your own kind\", were becoming entrenched in Guyana. The PPP won 46 percent of the vote and twenty-four seats, which made it the largest single party but short of an overall majority. However, the PNC, which won 40 percent of the vote and twenty-two seats, and the UF, which won 11 percent of the vote and seven seats, formed a coalition. The socialist PNC and unabashedly capitalist UF had joined forces to keep the PPP out of office for another term. Jagan called the election fraudulent and refused to resign as prime minister. The constitution was amended to allow the governor to remove Jagan from office. Burnham became prime minister on December 14, 1964.\n\n== Independence and the Burnham era ==\n\n=== Burnham in power ===\n\nIn the first year under [[Forbes Burnham]], conditions in the colony began to stabilize. The new coalition administration broke diplomatic ties with [[Cuba]] and implemented policies that favored local investors and foreign industry. The colony applied the renewed flow of Western [[Development aid|aid to further development]] of its infrastructure. A constitutional conference was held in [[London]]; the conference set May 26, 1966 as the date for the colony's independence. By the time independence was achieved, the country was enjoying economic growth and relative domestic peace.\n\nThe newly independent Guyana at first sought to improve relations with its neighbors. For instance, in December 1965 the country had become a charter member of the [[Caribbean Free Trade Association]] (Carifta). Relations with [[Venezuela]] were not so placid, however. In 1962 Venezuela had announced that it was rejecting the 1899 boundary and would renew its claim to all of Guyana west of the [[Essequibo River]]. In 1966, Venezuela seized the Guyanese half of [[Ankoko Island]], in the [[Cuyuni River]], and two years later claimed a strip of sea along Guyana's western coast.\n\nAnother challenge to the newly independent government came at the beginning of January 1969, with the [[Rupununi Uprising]]. In the [[Rupununi]] region in southwest Guyana, along the Venezuelan border, white settlers and [[Amerindians]] rebelled against the central government. Several Guyanese policemen in the area were killed, and spokesmen for the rebels declared the area independent and asked for Venezuelan aid. Troops arrived from Georgetown within days, and the rebellion was quickly put down. Although the rebellion was not a large affair, it exposed underlying tensions in the new state and the Amerindians' marginalized role in the country's political and social life.\n\n=== The cooperative republic ===\n\nThe [[Guyanese general election, 1968|1968 elections]] allowed the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|PNC]] to rule without the [[The United Force|UF]]. The PNC won thirty seats, the [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|PPP]] nineteen seats, and the UF four seats. However, many observers claimed the elections were marred by manipulation and coercion by the PNC. The PPP and UF were part of Guyana's political landscape but were ignored as Burnham began to convert the machinery of state into an instrument of the PNC.\n\nAfter the 1968 elections, Burnham's policies became more leftist as he announced he would lead Guyana to socialism. He consolidated his dominance of domestic policies through [[gerrymandering]], manipulation of the balloting process, and politicalization of the [[civil service]]. A few Indo-Guyanese were co-opted into the PNC, but the ruling party was unquestionably the embodiment of the Afro-Guyanese political will. Although the Afro-Guyanese middle class was uneasy with Burnham's leftist leanings, the PNC remained a shield against Indo-Guyanese dominance. The support of the Afro-Guyanese community allowed the PNC to bring the economy under control and to begin organizing the country into [[cooperatives]].\n\nOn February 23, 1970, Guyana declared itself a \"cooperative republic\" and cut all ties to the [[British monarchy]]. The [[governor general]] was replaced as head of state by a ceremonial [[President (government title)|president]]. Relations with Cuba were improved, and Guyana became a force in the [[Nonaligned Movement]]. In August 1972, Burnham hosted the [[Conference of Foreign Ministers of Nonaligned Countries]] in Georgetown. He used this opportunity to address the evils of [[imperialism]] and the need to support [[African liberation movement]]s in southern Africa. Burnham also let Cuban troops use Guyana as a transit point on their way to the [[Angolan Civil War|war]] in [[Angola]] in the mid-1970s.\n\nIn the early 1970s, electoral fraud became blatant in Guyana. PNC victories always included overseas voters, who consistently and overwhelmingly voted for the ruling party. The police and military intimidated the Indo-Guyanese. The army was accused of tampering with ballot boxes.\n\nConsidered a low point in the democratic process, the [[Guyanese general election, 1973|1973 elections]] were followed by an amendment to the constitution that abolished legal appeals to the [[Privy Council]] in London. After consolidating power on the legal and electoral fronts, Burnham turned to mobilizing the masses for what was to be Guyana's cultural revolution. A program of [[national service]] was introduced that placed an emphasis on self-reliance, loosely defined as Guyana's population feeding, clothing, and housing itself without outside help.\n\nGovernment [[authoritarianism]] increased in 1974 when Burnham advanced the \"paramountcy of the party\". All organs of the state would be considered agencies of the ruling PNC and subject to its control. The state and the PNC became interchangeable; PNC objectives were now public policy.\n\nBurnham's consolidation of power in Guyana was not total; opposition groups were tolerated within limits. For instance, in 1973 the [[Working People's Alliance]] (WPA) was founded. Opposed to Burnham's authoritarianism, the WPA was a multi-ethnic combination of politicians and intellectuals that advocated racial harmony, free elections, and democratic socialism. Although the WPA did not become an official political party until 1979, it evolved as an alternative to Burnham's PNC and Jagan's PPP.\n\nJagan's political career continued to decline in the 1970s. Outmaneuvered on the parliamentary front, the PPP leader tried another tactic. In April 1975, the PPP ended its [[boycott]] of parliament with Jagan stating that the PPP's policy would change from noncooperation and civil resistance to critical support of the Burnham regime. Soon after, Jagan appeared on the same platform with Prime Minister Burnham at the celebration of ten years of Guyanese independence, on May 26, 1976.\n\nDespite Jagan's conciliatory move, Burnham had no intention of sharing powers and continued to secure his position. When overtures intended to bring about new elections and PPP participation in the government were brushed aside, the largely Indo-Guyanese sugar work force went on a bitter [[strike action|strike]]. The strike was broken, and sugar production declined steeply from 1976 to 1977. The PNC postponed the 1978 elections, opting instead for a referendum to be held in July 1978, proposing to keep the incumbent assembly in power.\n\nThe July [[Guyanese constitutional referendum, 1978|1978 national referendum]] was poorly received. Although the PNC government proudly proclaimed that 71 percent of eligible voters participated and that 97 percent approved the referendum, other estimates put turnout at 10 to 14 percent. The low turnout was caused in large part by a boycott led by the PPP, WPA, and other opposition forces.\n\n==== The Jonestown massacre ====\n\n{{Main|Jonestown}}\n{{Location map many\n| Guyana\n| label = [[Jonestown]]\n| label_size = 100\n| pos = bottom\n| lat = 7.66\n| long = -60.187\n| marksize = 8\n| label2 = [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]]\n| label2_size = 70\n| lat2 = 6.807\n| long2 = -58.159\n| mark2size = 7\n| label3 = [[Port Kaituma]]\n| label3_size = 70\n| pos3 = right\n| lat3 = 7.84\n| long3 = -60.01\n| mark3size = 7\n| width = 200\n| float = right\n| background = #FFFFDD\n| caption = Peoples Temple Agricultural Project (\"Jonestown\", Guyana)\n}}\n\nBurnham's control over Guyana began to weaken when the [[Jonestown massacre]] brought unwanted international attention. In the 1970s, [[Jim Jones]], leader of the [[People's Temple of Christ]], moved more than 1,000 of his followers from [[San Francisco]] to form [[Jonestown]], a [[utopian]] agricultural community near [[Port Kaituma]] in western Guyana. The People's Temple of Christ was regarded by members of the Guyanese government as a model agricultural community that shared its vision of settling the hinterland and its view of cooperative socialism. The fact that the People's Temple was well equipped with openly flaunted weapons hinted that the community had the approval of members of the PNC's inner circle. Complaints of abuse by leaders of the cult prompted United States congressman [[Leo Ryan]] to fly to Guyana to investigate. The San Francisco-area representative was shot and killed by members of the People's Temple as he was boarding an airplane in Port Kaituma to return to Georgetown. Fearing further publicity, Jones and more than 900 of his followers died in a massive communal murder and suicide. The November 1978 Jonestown massacre suddenly put the Burnham government under intense foreign scrutiny, especially from the United States. Investigations into the massacre led to allegations that the Guyanese government had links to the fanatical cult.\n\n===The Last 6 Years of Burnham===\nAlthough the bloody memory of Jonestown faded, Guyanese politics experienced a violent year in 1979. Some of this violence was directed against the WPA, which had emerged as a vocal critic of the state and of Burnham in particular. One of the party's leaders, [[Walter Rodney]], and several professors at the [[University of Guyana]] were arrested on [[arson]] charges. The professors were soon released, and Rodney was granted bail. WPA leaders then organized the alliance into Guyana's most vocal opposition party.\n\nAs 1979 wore on, the level of violence continued to escalate. In October Minister of Education [[Vincent Teekah]] was mysteriously shot to death. The following year, Rodney was killed by a car bomb. The PNC government quickly accused Rodney of being a terrorist who had died at the hands of his own bomb and charged his brother [[Donald]] with being an accomplice. Later investigation implicated the Guyanese government, however. Rodney was a well-known leftist, and the circumstances of his death damaged Burnham's image with many leaders and intellectuals in less-developed countries who earlier had been willing to overlook the authoritarian nature of his government.\n\nA new constitution was promulgated in 1980. The old ceremonial post of president was abolished, and the [[head of government]] became the [[executive president]], chosen, as the former position of prime minister had been, by the majority party in the [[National Assembly of Guyana|National Assembly]]. Burnham automatically became Guyana's first executive president and promised elections later in the year. In elections held on December 15, 1980, the PNC claimed 77 percent of the vote and forty-one seats of the popularly elected seats, plus the ten chosen by the regional councils. The PPP and UF won ten and two seats, respectively. The WPA refused to participate in an electoral contest it regarded as fraudulent. Opposition claims of electoral fraud were upheld by a team of international observers headed by Britain's [[Lord Avebury]].\n\nThe economic crisis facing Guyana in the early 1980s deepened considerably, accompanied by the rapid deterioration of public services, infrastructure, and overall quality of life. Blackouts occurred almost daily, and water services were increasingly unsatisfactory. The litany of Guyana's decline included shortages of rice and sugar (both produced in the country), cooking oil, and kerosene. While the formal economy sank, the black market economy in Guyana thrived.\n\nIn the midst of this turbulent period, Burnham underwent surgery for a throat ailment. On August 6, 1985, while in the care of Cuban doctors, Guyana's first and only leader since independence unexpectedly died.\n\n== Hoyte to present ==\n\nDespite concerns that the country was about to fall into a period of political instability, the transfer of power went smoothly. Vice President [[Desmond Hoyte]] became the new executive president and leader of the PNC. His initial tasks were threefold: to secure authority within the PNC and national government, to take the PNC through the December 1985 elections, and to revitalize the stagnant economy.\n\nHoyte's first two goals were easily accomplished. The new leader took advantage of factionalism within the PNC to quietly consolidate his authority. The December 1985 elections gave the PNC 79 percent of the vote and forty-two of the fifty-three directly elected seats. Eight of the remaining eleven seats went to the PPP, two went to the UF, and one to the WPA. Charging fraud, the opposition boycotted the December 1986 municipal elections. With no opponents, the PNC won all ninety-one seats in local government.\n\nRevitalizing the economy proved more difficult. As a first step, Hoyte gradually moved to embrace the private sector, recognizing that state control of the economy had failed. Hoyte's administration lifted all curbs on foreign activity and ownership in 1988.\n\nAlthough the Hoyte government did not completely abandon the authoritarianism of the Burnham regime, it did make certain political reforms. Hoyte abolished overseas voting and the provisions for widespread proxy and postal voting. Independent newspapers were given greater freedom, and political harassment abated considerably.\n\nFormer U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] visited Guyana to lobby for the resumption of free elections, and on October 5, 1992, a new National Assembly and regional councils were elected in the first Guyanese election since 1964 to be internationally recognized as free and fair. [[Cheddi Jagan]] of the PPP was elected and sworn in as President on October 9, 1992, reversing the monopoly Afro-Guyanese traditionally had over Guyanese politics. The poll was marred by violence however. A new [[International Monetary Fund]] Structural Adjustment programme was introduced which led to an increase in the GDP whilst also eroding real incomes and hitting the middle-classes hard.\n\nWhen President Jagan died of a heart attack in March 1997, Prime Minister [[Sam Hinds|Samuel Hinds]] replaced him in accordance with constitutional provisions, with his widow [[Janet Jagan]] as Prime Minister. She was then elected President on fifteenth December 1997 for the PPP. Desmond Hoyte's PNC contested the results however, resulting in strikes, riots and one death before a [[Caricom]] mediating committee was brought in. Janet Jagan's PPP government was sworn in on 24 December having agreed to a constitutional review and to hold elections within three years, though Hoyte refused to recognise her government.\n\nJagan resigned in August 1999 due to ill health and was succeeded by Finance Minister [[Bharrat Jagdeo]], who had been named Prime Minister a day earlier. National elections were held on March 19, 2001, three months later than planned as the election committees said they were unprepared. Fears that the violence that marred the previous election led to monitoring by foreign bodies, including Jimmy Carter. In March incumbent President Jagdeo won the election with a voter turnout of over 90%.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions with Suriname were seriously strained by a dispute over their shared maritime border after Guyana had allowed oil-prospectors license to explore the areas.\n\nIn December 2002, Hoyte died, with [[Robert Corbin]] replacing him as leader of the PNC. He agreed to engage in '[[constructive engagement]]' with Jagdeo and the PPP.\n\nSevere flooding following torrential rainfall wreaked havoc in Guyana beginning in January 2005. The downpour, which lasted about six weeks, inundated the coastal belt, caused the deaths of 34 people, and destroyed large parts of the rice and sugarcane crops. The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimated in March that the country would need $415 million for recovery and rehabilitation. About 275,000 people\u201437% of the population\u2014were affected in some way by the floods.\n\nIn May 2008, President [[Bharrat Jagdeo]] was a signatory to The [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the [[Union of South American Nations]]. Guyana has ratified the treaty.\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[French colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of South America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[Politics of Guyana]]\n*[[List of Governors of British Guiana]]\n*[[List of Governors-General of Guyana]]\n*[[List of Presidents of Guyana]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Guyana]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Daly\n  | first = Vere T.\n  | title = The Making of Guyana\n  | year = 1974\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | isbn = 978-0-333-14482-4\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UOFrAAAAMAAJ\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Daly\n  | first = Vere T.\n  | title = A Short History of The Guyanese People\n  | year = 1975\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | isbn = 978-0-333-18304-5\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sPkYAAAAYAAJ\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Hope\n  | first = Kempe Ronald\n  | title = Guyana: Politics and Development in an Emergent Socialist State\n  | year = 1985\n  | publisher = Mosaic Press\n  | location = Oakville, Ont\n  | isbn = 0-88962-302-3\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YPsYAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn=0889623023\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = R\u00e9vauger\n  | first = C\u00e9cile\n  | authorlink = C\u00e9cile R\u00e9vauger\n  | title = The Abolition of Slavery&nbsp;\u2013 The British Debate 1787\u20131840\n  | publisher = Presse Universitaire de France\n  | date = October 2008\n  | isbn = 978-2-13-057110-0\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GQgrPQAACAAJ&dq=isbn=9782130571100\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}{{cite book\n  | last = Spinner\n  | first = Thomas J.\n  | title = A Political and Social History of Guyana, 1945\u20131983\n  | year = 1984\n  | publisher = Westview Press\n  | location = Boulder, Colo\n  | isbn = 0-86531-852-2\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NvsYAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn=0865318522\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{Cite book|title = General History of the Caribbean: Volume I: Autochthonous Societies|publisher = UNESCO|year = 2003|isbn = 0-333-72453-4|location = Paris|editor-last = Sued-Badillo|editor-first = Jalil}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Henry\n  | first = Paget\n  | last2 = Stone\n  | first2 = Carl\n  | title = The Newer Caribbean: Decolonization, Democracy, and Development\n  | year = 1983\n  | publisher = Institute for the Study of Human Issues\n  | series = Volume 4 of Inter-American politics series\n  | location = Philadelphia\n  | isbn = 0-89727-049-5\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OBIPAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn=0897270495\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* This article includes information from the public domain Library of Congress Guyana country study.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist\n| refs =\n}}\n\n{{Spanish Empire}}\n{{History of South America}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Guyana}}\n[[Category:History of Guyana| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|History of South American country Guyana}}\n{{lead too short|date=March 2012}}\n{{History of Guyana}}\nThe recorded '''history of Guyana''' can be dated back to 1499, when Alonso de Ojeda's first expedition arrived from Spain at the [[Essequibo River]].

The African [[slave rebellion]]s in 1763 and 1823 were seminal moments in the nation's history. Africans were enslaved and transported to Guyana as [[slave]]s; in contrast, East Indians came as [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers.]] Guyana's recent history is characterized in particular by the struggle to free itself from colonial rule, and from the lingering effects of [[colonialism]].\n\nOn May 26, 1966, Guyana gained independence from Britain.\n\n== Pre-colonial Guyana and first contacts ==\nThe first people to reach Guyana made their way from Asia, perhaps as far back as 35,000 years ago. These first inhabitants were [[nomads]] who slowly migrated south into Central and South America. At the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages, Guyana's inhabitants were divided into two groups, the [[Arawaks|Arawak]] along the coast and the [[Kalina people|Carib]] in the interior. One of the legacies of the indigenous peoples was the word Guiana, often used to describe the region encompassing modern Guyana as well as [[Suriname]] (former Dutch Guiana) and [[French Guiana]]. The word, which means \"land of waters\", is appropriate considering the area's multitude of rivers and streams.\n\nHistorians speculate that the Arawaks and Caribs originated in the South American [[hinterland]] and migrated northward, first to the present-day Guianas and then to the [[Caribbean islands]]. The Arawak, mainly cultivators, hunters, and fishermen, migrated to the Caribbean islands before the Carib and settled throughout the region. The tranquility of Arawak society was disrupted by the arrival of the bellicose Carib from the South American interior. The warlike behavior of the Carib and their violent migration north made an impact. By the end of the 15th century, the Carib had displaced the Arawak throughout the islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. The Carib settlement of the Lesser Antilles also affected Guyana's future development. The Spanish explorers and settlers who came after Columbus found that the Arawak proved easier to conquer than the Carib, who fought hard to maintain their independence. This fierce resistance, along with a lack of gold in the Lesser Antilles, contributed to the Spanish emphasis on conquest and settlement of the [[Greater Antilles]] and the mainland. Only a weak Spanish effort was made at consolidating Spain's authority in the Lesser Antilles (with the arguable exception of [[Trinidad]]) and the Guianas.\n\n==Colonial-Guyana==\n[[File:Guiana and Amazon Region - 1649.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A map created circa 1649 depicting the Guiana region. Territory claimed by Spain in red to the west, Dutch Guiana highlighted in yellow and Portuguese territory in red to the southeast. The mythical Lake Parime is also visible.]]\n\n===Early colonisation===\n[[File:LocationNetherlandsGuiana.png|thumb|right|250px|A map of Dutch Guiana 1667\u20131814 CE.]]\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle modern day Guyana. The Netherlands had [[Dutch Revolt|obtained independence from Spain]] in the late 16th century and by the early 17th century had emerged as a major commercial power, trading with the fledgling English and French colonies in the Lesser Antilles. In 1616 the Dutch established the first European settlement in the area of Guyana, a trading post twenty-five kilometers upstream from the mouth of the [[Essequibo River]]. Other settlements followed, usually a few kilometers inland on the larger rivers. The initial purpose of the Dutch settlements was trade with the indigenous people. The Dutch aim soon changed to acquisition of territory as other European powers gained colonies elsewhere in the Caribbean. Although Guyana was claimed by the Spanish, who sent periodic patrols through the region, the Dutch gained control over the region early in the 17th century. Dutch sovereignty was officially recognized with the signing of the [[Peace of M\u00fcnster|Treaty of Munster]] in 1648.\n\nIn 1621 the government of the Netherlands gave the newly formed [[Dutch West India Company]] complete control over the trading post on the Essequibo. This Dutch commercial concern administered the colony, known as [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]], for more than 170 years. The company established a second colony, on the [[Berbice River]] southeast of [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]], in 1627. Although under the general jurisdiction of this private group, the settlement, named [[Berbice]], was governed separately. [[Demerara]], situated between Essequibo and Berbice, was settled in 1741 and emerged in 1773 as a separate colony under direct control of the Dutch West India Company.\n\nAlthough the Dutch colonizers initially were motivated by the prospect of trade in the Caribbean, their possessions became significant producers of crops. The growing importance of agriculture was indicated by the export of 15,000 kilograms of [[tobacco]] from Essequibo in 1623. But as the agricultural productivity of the Dutch colonies increased, a labor shortage emerged. The indigenous populations were poorly adapted for work on [[plantations]], and many people died from [[Population history of American indigenous peoples#Depopulation from disease|diseases introduced by the Europeans]]. The Dutch West India Company turned to the importation of [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]]<nowiki/>, who rapidly became a key element in the colonial economy. By the 1660s, the enslaved population numbered about 2,500; the number of indigenous people was estimated at 50,000, most of whom had retreated into the vast hinterland. Although enslaved Africans were considered an essential element of the colonial economy, their working conditions were brutal. The mortality rate was high, and the dismal conditions led to more than half a dozen rebellions led by the enslaved Africans.\n\nThe most famous uprising of the enslaved Africans, the [[Berbice Slave Uprising]], began in February 1763. On two plantations on the [[Canje River]] in Berbice, the enslaved Africans rebelled, taking control of the region. As plantation after plantation fell to the enslaved Africans, the European population fled; eventually only half of the whites who had lived in the colony remained. Led by [[Cuffy (person)|Cuffy]] (now the national hero of Guyana), the escaped enslaved Africans came to number about 3,000 and threatened European control over the Guianas. The rebels were defeated with the assistance of troops from neighbouring European colonies like from the British, French, [[Sint Eustatius]] and overseas from the [[Dutch Republic]]. The 1763 Monument on Square of the Revolution in Georgetown, Guyana commemorates the uprising.\n\n===Transition to British rule===\n[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of British Guiana.]]\nEager to attract more settlers, in 1746 the Dutch authorities opened the area near the [[Demerara River]] to British immigrants. British plantation owners in the Lesser Antilles had been plagued by poor soil and erosion, and many were lured to the Dutch colonies by richer soils and the promise of landownership. The influx of British citizens was so great that by 1760 the English constituted a majority of the European population of Demerara.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} By 1786 the internal affairs of this Dutch colony were effectively under British control,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} though two-thirds of the plantation owners were still Dutch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20720/VdKreeke,%20Essequebo%20en%20Demerary%201741-1781.pdf\n|title=Essequebo en Demerary, 1741-1781: beginfase van de Britse overname |author=Kreeke, Frank van de |year=2013 |accessdate=2015-03-23|publisher= Leiden University Master Thesis}}</ref>\n\nAs economic growth accelerated in Demerara and Essequibo, strains began to appear in the relations between the planters and the Dutch West India Company. Administrative reforms during the early 1770s had greatly increased the cost of government. The company periodically sought to raise taxes to cover these expenditures and thereby provoked the resistance of the planters. In 1781 a [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|war]] broke out between the Netherlands and Britain, which resulted in the British occupation of Berbice, Essequibo, and Demerara. Some months later, France, allied with the Netherlands, seized control of the colonies. The French governed for two years, during which they constructed a new town, Longchamps, at the mouth of the Demerara River. When the Dutch regained power in 1784, they moved their colonial capital to Longchamps, which they renamed Stabroeck. The capital was in 1812 renamed [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] by the British.\n\nThe return of Dutch rule reignited conflict between the planters of Essequibo and Demerara and the Dutch West India Company. Disturbed by plans for an increase in the slave tax and a reduction in their representation on the colony's judicial and policy councils, the colonists petitioned the Dutch government to consider their grievances. In response, a special committee was appointed, which proceeded to draw up a report called the [[Concept Plan of Redress]]. This document called for far-reaching constitutional reforms and later became the basis of the British governmental structure. The plan proposed a decision-making body to be known as the [[Court of Policy]]. The judiciary was to consist of two courts of justice, one serving Demerara and the other Essequibo. The membership of the Court of Policy and of the courts of justice would consist of company officials and planters who owned more than twenty-five slaves. The Dutch commission that was assigned the responsibility of implementing this new system of government returned to the Netherlands with extremely unfavorable reports concerning the Dutch West India Company's administration. The company's charter therefore was allowed to expire in 1792 and the Concept Plan of Redress was put into effect in Demerara and Essequibo. Renamed the [[United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo]], the area then came under the direct control of the Dutch government. Berbice maintained its status as a separate colony.\n\nThe catalyst for formal British takeover was the [[French Revolution]] and the subsequent [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1795 the French occupied the Netherlands. The British declared war on France and in 1796 launched an expeditionary force from [[Barbados]] to occupy the Dutch colonies. The British takeover was bloodless, and local Dutch administration of the colony was left relatively uninterrupted under the constitution provided by the Concept Plan of Redress.\n\nBoth Berbice and the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo were under British control from 1796 to 1802. By means of the [[Treaty of Amiens]], both were returned to Dutch control. Peace was short-lived, however. War between Britain and France resumed in less than a year, and in 1803 the United Colony and Berbice were seized once more by British troops. At the [[London Convention of 1814]], both colonies were formally ceded to Britain. In 1831, Berbice and the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo were unified as [[British Guiana]]. The colony would remain under British control until independence in 1966.\n\n===Origins of the border dispute with Venezuela===\n[[File:Gran Colombia map.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of [[Gran Colombia]] (1819) including the Essequibo border.]]\nWhen Britain gained formal control over what is now Guyana in 1814, it also became involved in one of Latin America's most persistent border disputes. At the London Convention of 1814, the Dutch surrendered the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo and Berbice to the British, a colony which had the Essequibo river as its west border with the Spanish colony of Venezuela. Although Spain still claimed the region, the Spanish did not contest the treaty because they were preoccupied with their own colonies' struggles for independence. In 1835 the British government asked German explorer [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk]] to map British Guiana and mark its boundaries. As ordered by the British authorities, Schomburgk began British Guiana's western boundary with [[Venezuela]] at the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]], although all the Venezuelan maps showed the Essequibo river as the east border of the country. A map of the British colony was published in 1840. Venezuela protested, claiming the entire area west of the Essequibo River. Negotiations between Britain and Venezuela over the boundary began, but the two nations could reach no compromise. In 1850 both agreed not to occupy the disputed zone.\n\nThe discovery of gold in the contested area in the late 1850s reignited the dispute. British settlers moved into the region and the [[British Guiana Mining Company]] was formed to mine the deposits. Over the years, Venezuela made repeated protests and proposed arbitration, but the British government was uninterested. Venezuela finally broke diplomatic relations with Britain in 1887 and appealed to the United States for help. The British at first rebuffed the United States government's suggestion of arbitration, but when President [[Grover Cleveland]] threatened to intervene according to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], Britain agreed to let an international tribunal arbitrate the boundary in 1897.\n\nFor two years, the tribunal consisting of two Britons, two Americans, and a Russian studied the case in Paris (France).<ref>https://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_XXVIII/331-340.pdf</ref> Their three-to-two decision, handed down in 1899, awarded 94 percent of the disputed territory to British Guiana. Venezuela received only the mouths of the Orinoco River and a short stretch of the Atlantic coastline just to the east. Although Venezuela was unhappy with the decision, a commission surveyed a new border in accordance with the award, and both sides accepted the boundary in 1905. The issue was considered settled for the next half-century.\n\n===The early British Colony and the labour  problem===\n[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Georgetown in 1823 CE.]]\nPolitical, economic, and social life in the 19th century was dominated by a European planter class. Although the smallest group in terms of numbers, members of the [[plantocracy]] had links to British commercial interests in London and often enjoyed close ties to the governor, who was appointed by the monarch. The plantocracy also controlled exports and the working conditions of the majority of the population. The next social stratum consisted of a small number of [[freed slaves]], many of mixed African and European heritage, in addition to some [[Portugal|Portuguese]] merchants. At the lowest level of society was the majority, the African slaves who lived and worked in the countryside, where the plantations were located. Unconnected to colonial life, small groups of Amerindians lived in the hinterland.\n\nColonial life was changed radically by the demise of slavery. Although the international slave trade was [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished]] in the [[British Empire]] in 1807, slavery itself continued. In what is known as the [[Demerara rebellion of 1823]] 10\u201313,000 slaves in [[Demerara-Essequibo]] rose up against their oppressors.{{sfn|R\u00e9vauger|2008|pp=105\u2013106}} Although the rebellion was easily crushed,{{sfn|R\u00e9vauger|2008|pp=105\u2013106}} the momentum for abolition remained, and by 1838 total emancipation had been effected. The end of slavery had several ramifications. Most significantly, many former slaves rapidly departed the plantations. Some ex-slaves moved to towns and villages, feeling that field labor was degrading and inconsistent with freedom, but others pooled their resources to purchase the abandoned estates of their former masters and created village communities. Establishing small settlements provided the new Afro-Guyanese communities an opportunity to grow and sell food, an extension of a practice under which slaves had been allowed to keep the money that came from the sale of any surplus produce. The emergence of an independent-minded Afro-Guyanese peasant class, however, threatened the planters' political power, inasmuch as the planters no longer held a near-monopoly on the colony's economic activity.\n\nEmancipation also resulted in the introduction of new ethnic and cultural groups into British Guiana. The departure of the Afro-Guyanese from the sugar plantations soon led to labor shortages. After unsuccessful attempts throughout the 19th century to attract Portuguese workers from [[Madeira]], the estate owners were again left with an inadequate supply of labor. The Portuguese had not taken to plantation work and soon moved into other parts of the economy, especially retail business, where they became competitors with the new Afro-Guyanese middle class. Some 14,000 Chinese came to the colony between 1853 and 1912. Like their Portuguese predecessors, the Chinese forsook the plantations for the retail trades and soon became assimilated into Guianese society.\n\nConcerned about the plantations' shrinking labor pool and the potential decline of the [[sugar]] sector, British authorities, like their counterparts in Dutch Guiana, began to contract for the services of poorly paid [[indentured workers from India]]. The East Indians, as this group was known locally, signed on for a certain number of years, after which, in theory, they would return to India with their savings from working in the sugar fields. The introduction of indentured East Indian workers alleviated the labor shortage and added another group to Guyana's ethnic mix. A majority of the East Indian workers had their origins in eastern Uttar Pradesh, with a smaller amount coming from Tamil and Telugu speaking areas in southern India. A small minority of these workers came from other areas such as Bengal, Punjab, and Gujarat. Areas of India that were under British occupation had been devastated over decades by famines caused by [[Famine in India| British policies]] leading to the wide availability of workers willing to emigrate.\n\n== Political and social awakenings ==\n\n=== Nineteenth-century British Guiana ===\n\nThe constitution of the British colony favored the white planters. Planter political power was based in the Court of Policy and the two courts of justice, established in the late 18th century under Dutch rule. The Court of Policy had both legislative and administrative functions and was composed of the governor, three colonial officials, and four colonists, with the governor presiding. The courts of justice resolved judicial matters, such as licensing and civil service appointments, which were brought before them by petition.\n\nThe Court of Policy and the courts of justice, controlled by the plantation owners, constituted the center of power in British Guiana. The colonists who sat on the Court of Policy and the courts of justice were appointed by the governor from a list of nominees submitted by two electoral colleges. In turn, the seven members of each [[College of Electors]] were elected for life by those planters possessing twenty-five or more slaves. Though their power was restricted to nominating colonists to fill vacancies on the three major governmental councils, these electoral colleges provided a setting for political agitation by the planters.\n\nRaising and disbursing revenue was the responsibility of the [[Combined Court]], which included members of the Court of Policy and six additional financial representatives appointed by the College of Electors. In 1855 the Combined Court also assumed responsibility for setting the salaries of all government officials. This duty made the Combined Court a center of intrigues resulting in periodic clashes between the governor and the planters.\n\nOther Guyanese began to demand a more representative political system in the 19th century. By the late 1880s, pressure from the new Afro-Guyanese middle class was building for constitutional reform. In particular, there were calls to convert the Court of Policy into an assembly with ten elected members, to ease voter qualifications, and to abolish the College of Electors. Reforms were resisted by the planters, led by [[Henry K. Davson]], owner of a large plantation. In London the planters had allies in the [[West India Committee]] and also in the [[West India Association of Glasgow]], both presided over by proprietors with major interests in British Guiana.\n\nConstitutional revisions in 1891 incorporated some of the changes demanded by the reformers. The planters lost political influence with the abolition of the College of Electors and the relaxation of voter qualification. At the same time, the Court of Policy was enlarged to sixteen members; eight of these were to be elected members whose power would be balanced by that of eight appointed members. The Combined Court also continued, consisting, as previously, of the Court of Policy and six financial representatives who were now elected. To ensure that there would be no shift of power to elected officials, the governor remained the head of the Court of Policy; the executive duties of the Court of Policy were transferred to a new [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]], which the governor and planters dominated. The 1891 revisions were a great disappointment to the colony's reformers. As a result of the [[British Guiana general election, 1892|1892 elections]], the membership of the new Combined Court was almost identical to that of the previous one.\n\nThe next three decades saw additional, although minor, political changes. In 1897 the [[secret ballot]] was introduced. A reform in 1909 expanded the limited British Guiana electorate, and for the first time, Afro-Guyanese constituted a majority of the eligible voters.\n\nPolitical changes were accompanied by social change and jockeying by various ethnic groups for increased power. The British and Dutch planters refused to accept the Portuguese as equals and sought to maintain their status as aliens with no rights in the colony, especially voting rights. The political tensions led the Portuguese to establish the [[Reform Association]]. After the [[anti-Portuguese riots of 1898]], the Portuguese recognized the need to work with other disenfranchised elements of Guyanese society, in particular the Afro-Guyanese. By around the start of the 20th century, organizations including the Reform Association and the [[Reform Club]] began to demand greater participation in the colony's affairs. These organizations were largely the instruments of a small but articulate emerging middle class. Although the new middle class sympathized with the working class, the middle-class political groups were hardly representative of a national political or social movement. Indeed, working-class grievances were usually expressed in the form of riots.\n\n=== Political and social changes in the early twentieth century ===\n\nThe 1905 [[Ruimveldt Riots (1905)|Ruimveldt Riots]] rocked British Guiana. The severity of these outbursts reflected the workers' widespread dissatisfication with their standard of living. The uprising began in late November 1905 when the Georgetown [[stevedores]] went on strike, demanding higher wages. The strike grew confrontational, and other workers struck in sympathy, creating the country's first urban-rural worker alliance. On November 30, crowds of people took to the streets of Georgetown, and by December 1, 1905, now referred to as Black Friday, the situation had spun out of control. At the [[Plantation Ruimveldt]], close to Georgetown, a large crowd of porters refused to disperse when ordered to do so by a police patrol and a detachment of artillery. The colonial authorities opened fire, and four workers were seriously injured.\n\nWord of the shootings spread rapidly throughout Georgetown and hostile crowds began roaming the city, taking over a number of buildings. By the end of the day, seven people were dead and seventeen badly injured. In a panic, the British administration called for help. Britain sent troops, who finally quelled the uprising. Although the stevedores' strike failed, the riots had planted the seeds of what would become an organized trade union movement.\n\nEven though [[World War I]] was fought far beyond the borders of British Guiana, the war altered Guyanese society. The Afro-Guyanese who joined the British military became the nucleus of an elite Afro-Guyanese community upon their return. World War I also led to the end of East Indian indentured service. British concerns over political stability in India and criticism by Indian nationalists that the program was a form of human bondage caused the British government to outlaw indentured labor in 1917.\n\nIn the closing years of World War I, the colony's first trade union was formed. The [[British Guiana Labour Union]] (BGLU) was established in 1917 under the leadership of [[H.N. Critchlow]] and led by [[Alfred A. Thorne]]. Formed in the face of widespread business opposition, the BGLU at first mostly represented Afro-Guyanese [[dockworkers]]. Its membership stood around 13,000 by 1920, and it was granted legal status in 1921 under the [[Trades Union Ordinance]]. Although recognition of other unions would not come until 1939, the BGLU was an indication that the working class was becoming politically aware and more concerned with its rights.\n\nThe second trade union, the British Guiana Workers' League, was established in 1931 by [[Alfred A. Thorne]], who served as the League's leader for 22 years. The League sought to improve the working conditions for people of all ethnic backgrounds in the colony. Most workers were of West African, East Indian, Chinese and Portuguese descent, and had been brought to the country under a system of forced or indentured labor.\n\nAfter World War I, new economic interest groups began to clash with the Combined Court. The country's economy had come to depend less on sugar and more on rice and [[bauxite]], and producers of these new commodities resented the sugar planters' continued domination of the Combined Court. Meanwhile, the planters were feeling the effects of lower sugar prices and wanted the Combined Court to provide the necessary funds for new drainage and irrigation programs.\n\nTo stop the bickering and resultant legislative paralysis, in 1928 the [[Colonial Office]] announced a new constitution that would make British Guiana a [[crown colony]] under tight control of a governor appointed by the Colonial Office. The Combined Court and the Court of Policy were replaced by a [[Legislative Council]] with a majority of appointed members. To middle-class and working-class political activists, this new constitution represented a step backward and a victory for the planters. Influence over the governor, rather than the promotion of a particular public policy, became the most important issue in any political campaign.\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s brought economic hardship to all segments of Guyanese society. All of the colony's major exports\u2014sugar, rice and bauxite\u2014were affected by low prices, and unemployment soared. As in the past, the working class found itself lacking a political voice during a time of worsening economic conditions. By the mid-1930s, British Guiana and the whole British Caribbean were marked by labor unrest and violent demonstrations. In the aftermath of riots throughout the [[British West Indies]], a royal commission under [[Lord Moyne]] was established to determine the reasons for the riots and to make recommendations.\n\nIn British Guiana, the [[Moyne Commission]] questioned a wide range of people, including trade unionists, Afro-Guyanese professionals, and representatives of the Indo-Guyanese community. The commission pointed out the deep division between the country's two largest ethnic groups, the Afro-Guyanese and the Indo-Guyanese. The largest group, the Indo-Guyanese, consisted primarily of rural rice producers or merchants; they had retained the country's traditional culture and did not participate in national politics. The Afro-Guyanese were largely urban workers or bauxite miners; they had adopted European culture and dominated national politics. To increase representation of the majority of the population in British Guiana, the Moyne Commission called for increased democratization of government as well as economic and social reforms.\n\nThe Moyne Commission report in 1938 was a turning point in British Guiana. It urged extending the franchise to women and persons not owning land and encouraged the emerging trade union movement. However, many of the Moyne Commission's recommendations were not immediately implemented because of the outbreak of [[World War II]] and because of British opposition.\n\nWith the fighting far away, the period of World War II in British Guiana was marked by continuing political reform and improvements to the national infrastructure. The governor, Sir [[Gordon Lethem]], created the country's first Ten-Year Development Plan (led by Sir Oscar Spencer, the Economic Adviser to the Governor and [[Alfred P. Thorne]], Assistant to the Economic Adviser), reduced property qualifications for office holding and voting, and made elective members a majority on the Legislative Council in 1943. Under the aegis of the [[Lend-Lease Act of 1941]], a modern air base (now [[Timehri Airport]]) was constructed by United States troops. By the end of World War II, British Guiana's political system had been widened to encompass more elements of society and the economy's foundations had been strengthened by increased demand for bauxite.\n\n== Pre-independence government==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Development of political parties===\nAt the end of World War II, political awareness and demands for independence grew in all segments of society. The immediate postwar period witnessed the founding of Guyana's major political parties. The [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) was founded on January 1, 1950. Internal conflicts developed in the PPP, and in 1957 the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] (PNC) was created as a split-off. These years also saw the beginning of a long and acrimonious struggle between the country's two dominant political personalities\u2014[[Cheddi Jagan]] and [[Linden Forbes Burnham]].\n\n====Cheddi Jagan====\n[[File:Cheddi_Jagan_Anefo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Cheddi Jagan]]]]\n[[Cheddi Jagan]] had been born in Guyana in 1918. His parents were immigrants from India. His father was a driver, a position considered to be on the lowest rung of the middle stratum of Guyanese society. Jagan's childhood gave him a lasting insight into rural poverty. Despite their poor background, the senior Jagan sent his son to [[Queen's College, Guyana|Queen's College]] in Georgetown. After his education there, Jagan went to the United States to study dentistry, graduating from [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]] in 1942.\n\nJagan returned to British Guiana in October 1943 and was soon joined by his American wife, the former [[Janet Rosenberg]], who was to play a significant role in her new country's political development. Although Jagan established his own dentistry clinic, he was soon enmeshed in politics. After a number of unsuccessful forays into Guyana's political life, Jagan became treasurer of the [[Manpower Citizens' Association]] (MPCA) in 1945. The MPCA represented the colony's sugar workers, many of whom were Indo-Guyanese. Jagan's tenure was brief, as he clashed repeatedly with the more moderate union leadership over policy issues. Despite his departure from the MPCA a year after joining, the position allowed Jagan to meet other union leaders in British Guiana and throughout the English-speaking Caribbean.\n\n====Linden Forbes Sampson Burnham====\n[[File:Forbes_Burnham_(1966).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7| [[Forbes Burnham]] ]]\nBorn in 1923, [[Forbes Burnham]] was the sole son in a family that had three children. His father was headmaster of [[Kitty Methodist Primary School]], which was located just outside Georgetown. As part of the colony's educated class, young Burnham was exposed to political viewpoints at an early age. He did exceedingly well in school and went to London to obtain a law degree. Although not exposed to childhood poverty as was Jagan, Burnham was acutely aware of racial discrimination.\n\nThe social strata of the urban Afro-Guyanese community of the 1930s and 1940s included a mulatto or \"coloured\" elite, a black professional middle class, and, at the bottom, the black working class. Unemployment in the 1930s was high. When war broke out in 1939, many Afro-Guyanese joined the military, hoping to gain new job skills and escape poverty. When they returned home from the war, however, jobs were still scarce and discrimination was still a part of life.\n\n====Founding of the PAC and PPP====\nThe springboard for Jagan's political career was the Political Affairs Committee (PAC), formed in 1946 as a discussion group. The new organization published the ''[[PAC Bulletin]]'' to promote its [[Marxist]] ideology and ideas of liberation and decolonization. The PAC's outspoken criticism of the colony's poor living standards attracted followers as well as detractors.\n\nIn the November 1947 general elections, the PAC put forward several members as independent candidates. The PAC's major competitor was the newly formed  [[British Guiana Labour Party]], which, under [[J.B. Singh]], won six of fourteen seats contested. Jagan won a seat and briefly joined the Labour Party. But he had difficulties with his new party's center-right ideology and soon left its ranks. The Labour Party's support of the policies of the British governor and its inability to create a grass-roots base gradually stripped it of liberal supporters throughout the country. The Labour Party's lack of a clear-cut reform agenda left a vacuum, which Jagan rapidly moved to fill. Turmoil on the colony's sugar plantations gave him an opportunity to achieve national standing. After the June 16, 1948 police shootings of five Indo-Guyanese workers at [[Enmore, Guyana|Enmore]], close to Georgetown, the PAC and the [[Guiana Industrial Workers' Union]] (GIWU) organized a large and peaceful demonstration, which clearly enhanced Jagan's standing with the Indo-Guyanese population.\n\nAfter the PAC, Jagan's next major step was the founding of the [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) in January 1950. Using the PAC as a foundation, Jagan created from it a new party that drew support from both the Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese communities. To increase support among the Afro-Guyanese, Forbes Burnham was brought into the party.\n\nThe PPP's initial leadership was multi-ethnic and left of center, but hardly revolutionary. Jagan became the leader of the PPP's parliamentary group, and Burnham assumed the responsibilities of party chairman. Other key party members included Janet Jagan, [[Brindley Benn]]<ref>\"[http://www.guyanachronicle.com/site/index.php/news/courts/images/banners/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7323%3Aformer-deputy-prime-minister-brindley-benn-dies-at-86&Itemid=12 Former Deputy Prime Minister Brindley Benn dies at 86]\", ''Guyana Chronicle'', December 12, 2009</ref>  and [[Ashton Chase]], both PAC veterans. The new party's first victory came in the 1950 municipal elections, in which Janet Jagan won a seat. Cheddi Jagan and Burnham failed to win seats, but Burnham's campaign made a favorable impression on many Afro-Guyanese citizens.\n\nFrom its first victory in the 1950 municipal election, the PPP gathered momentum. However, the party's often strident [[anticapitalist]] and [[socialist]] message made the British government uneasy. Colonial officials showed their displeasure with the PPP in 1952 when, on a regional tour, the Jagans were designated prohibited immigrants in [[Trinidad]] and [[Grenada]].\n\nA British commission in 1950 recommended universal adult suffrage and the adoption of a [[ministerial system]] for British Guiana. The commission also recommended that power be concentrated in the [[executive branch]], that is, the office of the governor. These reforms presented British Guiana's parties with an opportunity to participate in national elections and form a government, but maintained power in the hands of the British-appointed chief executive. This arrangement rankled the PPP, which saw it as an attempt to curtail the party's political power.\n\n=== The first PPP government ===\n\nOnce the new constitution was adopted, elections were set for 1953. The PPP's coalition of lower-class Afro-Guyanese and rural Indo-Guyanese workers, together with elements of both ethnic groups' middle sectors, made for a formidable constituency. Conservatives branded the PPP as [[communist]], but the party campaigned on a center-left platform and appealed to a growing nationalism. The other major party participating in the election, the [[National Democratic Party (Guyana)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP), was a spin-off of the [[League of Coloured Peoples]] and was largely an Afro-Guyanese middle-class organization, sprinkled with middle-class Portuguese and Indo-Guyanese. The NDP, together with the poorly organized [[United Farmers and Workers Party]] and the [[United National Party]], was soundly defeated by the PPP. Final results gave the PPP eighteen of twenty-four seats compared with the NDP's two seats and four seats for independents.\n\nThe PPP's first administration was brief. The legislature opened on May 30, 1953. Already suspicious of Jagan and the PPP's radicalism, conservative forces in the business community were further distressed by the new administration's program of expanding the role of the state in the economy and society. The PPP also sought to implement its reform program at a rapid pace, which brought the party into confrontation with the governor and with high-ranking civil servants who preferred more gradual change. The issue of civil service appointments also threatened the PPP, in this case from within. Following the 1953 victory, these appointments became an issue between the predominantly Indo-Guyanese supporters of Jagan and the largely Afro-Guyanese backers of Burnham. Burnham threatened to split the party if he were not made sole leader of the PPP. A compromise was reached by which members of what had become Burnham's faction received ministerial appointments.\n\nThe PPP's introduction of the [[Labour Relations Act]] provoked a confrontation with the British. This law ostensibly was aimed at reducing intraunion rivalries, but would have favored the GIWU, which was closely aligned with the ruling party. The opposition charged that the PPP was seeking to gain control over the colony's economic and social life and was moving to stifle the opposition. The day the act was introduced to the legislature, the GIWU went on strike in support of the proposed law. The British government interpreted this intermingling of party politics and labor unionism as a direct challenge to the constitution and the authority of the governor. The day after the act was passed, on October 9, 1953, London suspended the colony's constitution and, under pretext of quelling disturbances, sent in troops.\n\n=== The interim government ===\n\nFollowing the suspension of the constitution, British Guiana was governed by an interim administration consisting of a small group of conservative politicians, businessmen, and civil servants that lasted until 1957. Order in the colonial government masked a growing rift in the country's main political party as the personal conflict between the PPP's Jagan and Burnham widened into a bitter dispute. In 1955 Jagan and Burnham formed rival wings of the PPP. Support for each leader was largely, but not totally, along ethnic lines. [[Joseph P. Lachmansingh|J. P. Lachmansingh]], a leading Indo-Guyanese and head of the GIWU, supported Burnham, whereas Jagan retained the loyalty of a number of leading Afro-Guyanese radicals, such as [[Sydney King]]. Burnham's wing of the PPP moved to the right, leaving Jagan's wing on the left, where he was regarded with considerable apprehension by Western governments and the colony's conservative business groups.\n\n=== The second PPP government===\n\nThe [[British Guiana general election, 1957|1957 elections]] held under a [[Constitution of Guyana|new constitution]] demonstrated the extent of the growing ethnic division within the Guyanese electorate. The revised constitution provided limited [[self-government]], primarily through the Legislative Council. Of the council's twenty-four delegates, fifteen were elected, six were nominated, and the remaining three were to be [[ex officio]] members from the interim administration. The two wings of the PPP launched vigorous campaigns, each attempting to prove that it was the legitimate heir to the original party. Despite denials of such motivation, both factions made a strong appeal to their respective ethnic constituencies.\n\nThe 1957 elections were convincingly won by [[Cheddi Jagan|Jagan]]'s [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|PPP]] faction. Although his group had a secure parliamentary majority, its support was drawn more and more from the [[Indo-Guyanese]] community. The faction's main planks were increasingly identified as Indo-Guyanese: more rice land, improved union representation in the sugar industry, and improved business opportunities and more government posts for Indo-Guyanese.\n\nJagan's veto of [[British Guiana]]'s participation in the [[West Indies Federation]] resulted in the complete loss of [[Afro-Guyanese]] support. In the late 1950s, the British Caribbean colonies had been actively negotiating establishment of a West Indies Federation. The PPP had pledged to work for the eventual political union of British Guiana with the Caribbean territories. The Indo-Guyanese, who constituted a majority in Guyana, were apprehensive of becoming part of a federation in which they would be outnumbered by people of African descent. Jagan's veto of the federation caused his party to lose all significant Afro-Guyanese support.\n\nBurnham learned an important lesson from the 1957 elections. He could not win if supported only by the lower-class, urban Afro-Guyanese. He needed [[middle-class]] allies, especially those Afro-Guyanese who backed the moderate [[United Democratic Party (Guyana)|United Democratic Party]]. From 1957 onward, Burnham worked to create a balance between maintaining the backing of the more radical Afro-Guyanese lower classes and gaining the support of the more capitalist middle class. Clearly, Burnham's stated preference for [[socialism]] would not bind those two groups together against Jagan, an avowed [[Marxist]]. The answer was something more basic: [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]. Burnham's appeals to race proved highly successful in bridging the schism that divided the Afro-Guyanese along class lines. This strategy convinced the powerful Afro-Guyanese middle class to accept a leader who was more of a radical than they would have preferred to support. At the same time, it neutralized the objections of the black working class to entering an alliance with those representing the more moderate interests of the middle classes. Burnham's move toward the right was accomplished with the merger of his PPP faction and the United Democratic Party into a new organization, the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] (PNC).\n\nFollowing the 1957 elections, Jagan rapidly consolidated his hold on the Indo-Guyanese community. Though candid in expressing his admiration for [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], and, later, [[Fidel Castro Ruz]], Jagan in power asserted that the PPP's Marxist-[[Leninist]] principles must be adapted to Guyana's own particular circumstances. Jagan advocated [[nationalization]] of foreign holdings, especially in the sugar industry. British fears of a communist takeover, however, caused the British governor to hold Jagan's more radical policy initiatives in check.\n\n=== PPP re-election and debacle ===\n\nThe 1961 elections were a bitter contest between the PPP, the PNC, and the United Force (UF), a conservative party representing big business, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and Amerindian, Chinese, and Portuguese voters. These elections were held under yet another new constitution that marked a return to the degree of self-government that existed briefly in 1953. It introduced a [[bicameral]] system boasting a wholly elected thirty-five-member Legislative Assembly and a thirteen-member Senate to be appointed by the governor. The post of prime minister was created and was to be filled by the majority party in the Legislative Assembly. With the strong support of the Indo-Guyanese population, the PPP again won by a substantial margin, gaining twenty seats in the Legislative Assembly, compared to eleven seats for the PNC and four for the UF. Jagan was named prime minister.\n\nJagan's administration became increasingly friendly with communist and leftist regimes; for instance, Jagan refused to observe the United States embargo on communist [[Cuba]]. After discussions between Jagan and Cuban revolutionary [[Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara]] in 1960 and 1961, Cuba offered British Guiana loans and equipment. In addition, the Jagan administration signed trade agreements with [[Hungary]] and the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany).\n\nFrom 1961 to 1964, Jagan was confronted with a destabilization campaign conducted by the PNC and UF. In addition to domestic opponents of Jagan, an important role was played by the [[American Institute for Free Labor Development]] (AIFLD), which was alleged to be a front for the [[CIA]]. Various reports say that AIFLD, with a budget of US $800,000, maintained anti-Jagan labor leaders on its payroll, as well as an AIFLD-trained staff of 11 activists who were assigned to organize riots and destabilize the Jagan government. Riots and demonstrations against the PPP administration were frequent, and during disturbances in 1962 and 1963 mobs destroyed part of Georgetown, doing $40 million in damage.<ref>Hirsch, Fred, ''The Labour Movement: Penetration Point for U.S. Intelligence and Transnationals'', Spokesman Books, 1977</ref><ref>Brereton, Bridget, ''General History of the Caribbean: The Caribbean in the Twentieth Century'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=rGSCOTc90WUC&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=AIFLD+guyana+riots&source=bl&ots=O9d5B61giL&sig=bn7nJoWHuL-tC31I3lGD8DVBDu8&hl=en&ei=HuZRToetBKTUiALn0eWDAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=AIFLD%20guyana%20riots&f=false], UNESCO 2004</ref>\n\nTo counter the MPCA with its link to Burnham, the PPP formed the [[Guyanese Agricultural Workers Union]]. This new union's political mandate was to organize the Indo-Guyanese sugarcane field-workers. The MPCA immediately responded with a one-day strike to emphasize its continued control over the sugar workers.\n\nThe PPP government responded to the strike in March 1964 by publishing a new [[Labour Relations Bill]] almost identical to the 1953 legislation that had resulted in British intervention. Regarded as a power play for control over a key labor sector, introduction of the proposed law prompted protests and rallies throughout the capital. Riots broke out on April 5; they were followed on April 18 by a general strike. By May 9, the governor was compelled to declare a state of emergency. Nevertheless, the strike and violence continued until July 7, when the Labour Relations Bill was allowed to lapse without being enacted. To bring an end to the disorder, the government agreed to consult with union representatives before introducing similar bills. These disturbances exacerbated tension and animosity between the two major ethnic communities and made a reconciliation between Jagan and Burnham an impossibility.\n\nJagan's term had not yet ended when another round of labor unrest rocked the colony. The pro-PPP GIWU, which had become an umbrella group of all labor organizations, called on sugar workers to strike in January 1964. To dramatize their case, Jagan led a march by sugar workers from the interior to Georgetown. This demonstration ignited outbursts of violence that soon escalated beyond the control of the authorities. On May 22, the governor finally declared another state of emergency. The situation continued to worsen, and in June the governor assumed full powers, rushed in British troops to restore order, and proclaimed a moratorium on all political activity. By the end of the turmoil, 160 people were dead and more than 1,000 homes had been destroyed.\n\nIn an effort to quell the turmoil, the country's political parties asked the British government to modify the constitution to provide for more proportional representation. The colonial secretary proposed a fifty-three member unicameral legislature. Despite opposition from the ruling PPP, all reforms were implemented and new elections set for October 1964.\n\nAs Jagan feared, the PPP lost the general elections of 1964. The politics of ''[[apan jhaat]]'', [[Hindi]] for \"vote for your own kind\", were becoming entrenched in Guyana. The PPP won 46 percent of the vote and twenty-four seats, which made it the largest single party but short of an overall majority. However, the PNC, which won 40 percent of the vote and twenty-two seats, and the UF, which won 11 percent of the vote and seven seats, formed a coalition. The socialist PNC and unabashedly capitalist UF had joined forces to keep the PPP out of office for another term. Jagan called the election fraudulent and refused to resign as prime minister. The constitution was amended to allow the governor to remove Jagan from office. Burnham became prime minister on December 14, 1964.\n\n== Independence and the Burnham era ==\n\n=== Burnham in power ===\n\nIn the first year under [[Forbes Burnham]], conditions in the colony began to stabilize. The new coalition administration broke diplomatic ties with [[Cuba]] and implemented policies that favored local investors and foreign industry. The colony applied the renewed flow of Western [[Development aid|aid to further development]] of its infrastructure. A constitutional conference was held in [[London]]; the conference set May 26, 1966 as the date for the colony's independence. By the time independence was achieved, the country was enjoying economic growth and relative domestic peace.\n\nThe newly independent Guyana at first sought to improve relations with its neighbors. For instance, in December 1965 the country had become a charter member of the [[Caribbean Free Trade Association]] (Carifta). Relations with [[Venezuela]] were not so placid, however. In 1962 Venezuela had announced that it was rejecting the 1899 boundary and would renew its claim to all of Guyana west of the [[Essequibo River]]. In 1966, Venezuela seized the Guyanese half of [[Ankoko Island]], in the [[Cuyuni River]], and two years later claimed a strip of sea along Guyana's western coast.\n\nAnother challenge to the newly independent government came at the beginning of January 1969, with the [[Rupununi Uprising]]. In the [[Rupununi]] region in southwest Guyana, along the Venezuelan border, white settlers and [[Amerindians]] rebelled against the central government. Several Guyanese policemen in the area were killed, and spokesmen for the rebels declared the area independent and asked for Venezuelan aid. Troops arrived from Georgetown within days, and the rebellion was quickly put down. Although the rebellion was not a large affair, it exposed underlying tensions in the new state and the Amerindians' marginalized role in the country's political and social life.\n\n=== The cooperative republic ===\n\nThe [[Guyanese general election, 1968|1968 elections]] allowed the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|PNC]] to rule without the [[The United Force|UF]]. The PNC won thirty seats, the [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|PPP]] nineteen seats, and the UF four seats. However, many observers claimed the elections were marred by manipulation and coercion by the PNC. The PPP and UF were part of Guyana's political landscape but were ignored as Burnham began to convert the machinery of state into an instrument of the PNC.\n\nAfter the 1968 elections, Burnham's policies became more leftist as he announced he would lead Guyana to socialism. He consolidated his dominance of domestic policies through [[gerrymandering]], manipulation of the balloting process, and politicalization of the [[civil service]]. A few Indo-Guyanese were co-opted into the PNC, but the ruling party was unquestionably the embodiment of the Afro-Guyanese political will. Although the Afro-Guyanese middle class was uneasy with Burnham's leftist leanings, the PNC remained a shield against Indo-Guyanese dominance. The support of the Afro-Guyanese community allowed the PNC to bring the economy under control and to begin organizing the country into [[cooperatives]].\n\nOn February 23, 1970, Guyana declared itself a \"cooperative republic\" and cut all ties to the [[British monarchy]]. The [[governor general]] was replaced as head of state by a ceremonial [[President (government title)|president]]. Relations with Cuba were improved, and Guyana became a force in the [[Nonaligned Movement]]. In August 1972, Burnham hosted the [[Conference of Foreign Ministers of Nonaligned Countries]] in Georgetown. He used this opportunity to address the evils of [[imperialism]] and the need to support [[African liberation movement]]s in southern Africa. Burnham also let Cuban troops use Guyana as a transit point on their way to the [[Angolan Civil War|war]] in [[Angola]] in the mid-1970s.\n\nIn the early 1970s, electoral fraud became blatant in Guyana. PNC victories always included overseas voters, who consistently and overwhelmingly voted for the ruling party. The police and military intimidated the Indo-Guyanese. The army was accused of tampering with ballot boxes.\n\nConsidered a low point in the democratic process, the [[Guyanese general election, 1973|1973 elections]] were followed by an amendment to the constitution that abolished legal appeals to the [[Privy Council]] in London. After consolidating power on the legal and electoral fronts, Burnham turned to mobilizing the masses for what was to be Guyana's cultural revolution. A program of [[national service]] was introduced that placed an emphasis on self-reliance, loosely defined as Guyana's population feeding, clothing, and housing itself without outside help.\n\nGovernment [[authoritarianism]] increased in 1974 when Burnham advanced the \"paramountcy of the party\". All organs of the state would be considered agencies of the ruling PNC and subject to its control. The state and the PNC became interchangeable; PNC objectives were now public policy.\n\nBurnham's consolidation of power in Guyana was not total; opposition groups were tolerated within limits. For instance, in 1973 the [[Working People's Alliance]] (WPA) was founded. Opposed to Burnham's authoritarianism, the WPA was a multi-ethnic combination of politicians and intellectuals that advocated racial harmony, free elections, and democratic socialism. Although the WPA did not become an official political party until 1979, it evolved as an alternative to Burnham's PNC and Jagan's PPP.\n\nJagan's political career continued to decline in the 1970s. Outmaneuvered on the parliamentary front, the PPP leader tried another tactic. In April 1975, the PPP ended its [[boycott]] of parliament with Jagan stating that the PPP's policy would change from noncooperation and civil resistance to critical support of the Burnham regime. Soon after, Jagan appeared on the same platform with Prime Minister Burnham at the celebration of ten years of Guyanese independence, on May 26, 1976.\n\nDespite Jagan's conciliatory move, Burnham had no intention of sharing powers and continued to secure his position. When overtures intended to bring about new elections and PPP participation in the government were brushed aside, the largely Indo-Guyanese sugar work force went on a bitter [[strike action|strike]]. The strike was broken, and sugar production declined steeply from 1976 to 1977. The PNC postponed the 1978 elections, opting instead for a referendum to be held in July 1978, proposing to keep the incumbent assembly in power.\n\nThe July [[Guyanese constitutional referendum, 1978|1978 national referendum]] was poorly received. Although the PNC government proudly proclaimed that 71 percent of eligible voters participated and that 97 percent approved the referendum, other estimates put turnout at 10 to 14 percent. The low turnout was caused in large part by a boycott led by the PPP, WPA, and other opposition forces.\n\n==== The Jonestown massacre ====\n\n{{Main|Jonestown}}\n{{Location map many\n| Guyana\n| label = [[Jonestown]]\n| label_size = 100\n| pos = bottom\n| lat = 7.66\n| long = -60.187\n| marksize = 8\n| label2 = [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]]\n| label2_size = 70\n| lat2 = 6.807\n| long2 = -58.159\n| mark2size = 7\n| label3 = [[Port Kaituma]]\n| label3_size = 70\n| pos3 = right\n| lat3 = 7.84\n| long3 = -60.01\n| mark3size = 7\n| width = 200\n| float = right\n| background = #FFFFDD\n| caption = Peoples Temple Agricultural Project (\"Jonestown\", Guyana)\n}}\n\nBurnham's control over Guyana began to weaken when the [[Jonestown massacre]] brought unwanted international attention. In the 1970s, [[Jim Jones]], leader of the [[People's Temple of Christ]], moved more than 1,000 of his followers from [[San Francisco]] to form [[Jonestown]], a [[utopian]] agricultural community near [[Port Kaituma]] in western Guyana. The People's Temple of Christ was regarded by members of the Guyanese government as a model agricultural community that shared its vision of settling the hinterland and its view of cooperative socialism. The fact that the People's Temple was well equipped with openly flaunted weapons hinted that the community had the approval of members of the PNC's inner circle. Complaints of abuse by leaders of the cult prompted United States congressman [[Leo Ryan]] to fly to Guyana to investigate. The San Francisco-area representative was shot and killed by members of the People's Temple as he was boarding an airplane in Port Kaituma to return to Georgetown. Fearing further publicity, Jones and more than 900 of his followers died in a massive communal murder and suicide. The November 1978 Jonestown massacre suddenly put the Burnham government under intense foreign scrutiny, especially from the United States. Investigations into the massacre led to allegations that the Guyanese government had links to the fanatical cult.\n\n===The Last 6 Years of Burnham===\nAlthough the bloody memory of Jonestown faded, Guyanese politics experienced a violent year in 1979. Some of this violence was directed against the WPA, which had emerged as a vocal critic of the state and of Burnham in particular. One of the party's leaders, [[Walter Rodney]], and several professors at the [[University of Guyana]] were arrested on [[arson]] charges. The professors were soon released, and Rodney was granted bail. WPA leaders then organized the alliance into Guyana's most vocal opposition party.\n\nAs 1979 wore on, the level of violence continued to escalate. In October Minister of Education [[Vincent Teekah]] was mysteriously shot to death. The following year, Rodney was killed by a car bomb. The PNC government quickly accused Rodney of being a terrorist who had died at the hands of his own bomb and charged his brother [[Donald]] with being an accomplice. Later investigation implicated the Guyanese government, however. Rodney was a well-known leftist, and the circumstances of his death damaged Burnham's image with many leaders and intellectuals in less-developed countries who earlier had been willing to overlook the authoritarian nature of his government.\n\nA new constitution was promulgated in 1980. The old ceremonial post of president was abolished, and the [[head of government]] became the [[executive president]], chosen, as the former position of prime minister had been, by the majority party in the [[National Assembly of Guyana|National Assembly]]. Burnham automatically became Guyana's first executive president and promised elections later in the year. In elections held on December 15, 1980, the PNC claimed 77 percent of the vote and forty-one seats of the popularly elected seats, plus the ten chosen by the regional councils. The PPP and UF won ten and two seats, respectively. The WPA refused to participate in an electoral contest it regarded as fraudulent. Opposition claims of electoral fraud were upheld by a team of international observers headed by Britain's [[Lord Avebury]].\n\nThe economic crisis facing Guyana in the early 1980s deepened considerably, accompanied by the rapid deterioration of public services, infrastructure, and overall quality of life. Blackouts occurred almost daily, and water services were increasingly unsatisfactory. The litany of Guyana's decline included shortages of rice and sugar (both produced in the country), cooking oil, and kerosene. While the formal economy sank, the black market economy in Guyana thrived.\n\nIn the midst of this turbulent period, Burnham underwent surgery for a throat ailment. On August 6, 1985, while in the care of Cuban doctors, Guyana's first and only leader since independence unexpectedly died.\n\n== Hoyte to present ==\n\nDespite concerns that the country was about to fall into a period of political instability, the transfer of power went smoothly. Vice President [[Desmond Hoyte]] became the new executive president and leader of the PNC. His initial tasks were threefold: to secure authority within the PNC and national government, to take the PNC through the December 1985 elections, and to revitalize the stagnant economy.\n\nHoyte's first two goals were easily accomplished. The new leader took advantage of factionalism within the PNC to quietly consolidate his authority. The December 1985 elections gave the PNC 79 percent of the vote and forty-two of the fifty-three directly elected seats. Eight of the remaining eleven seats went to the PPP, two went to the UF, and one to the WPA. Charging fraud, the opposition boycotted the December 1986 municipal elections. With no opponents, the PNC won all ninety-one seats in local government.\n\nRevitalizing the economy proved more difficult. As a first step, Hoyte gradually moved to embrace the private sector, recognizing that state control of the economy had failed. Hoyte's administration lifted all curbs on foreign activity and ownership in 1988.\n\nAlthough the Hoyte government did not completely abandon the authoritarianism of the Burnham regime, it did make certain political reforms. Hoyte abolished overseas voting and the provisions for widespread proxy and postal voting. Independent newspapers were given greater freedom, and political harassment abated considerably.\n\nFormer U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] visited Guyana to lobby for the resumption of free elections, and on October 5, 1992, a new National Assembly and regional councils were elected in the first Guyanese election since 1964 to be internationally recognized as free and fair. [[Cheddi Jagan]] of the PPP was elected and sworn in as President on October 9, 1992, reversing the monopoly Afro-Guyanese traditionally had over Guyanese politics. The poll was marred by violence however. A new [[International Monetary Fund]] Structural Adjustment programme was introduced which led to an increase in the GDP whilst also eroding real incomes and hitting the middle-classes hard.\n\nWhen President Jagan died of a heart attack in March 1997, Prime Minister [[Sam Hinds|Samuel Hinds]] replaced him in accordance with constitutional provisions, with his widow [[Janet Jagan]] as Prime Minister. She was then elected President on fifteenth December 1997 for the PPP. Desmond Hoyte's PNC contested the results however, resulting in strikes, riots and one death before a [[Caricom]] mediating committee was brought in. Janet Jagan's PPP government was sworn in on 24 December having agreed to a constitutional review and to hold elections within three years, though Hoyte refused to recognise her government.\n\nJagan resigned in August 1999 due to ill health and was succeeded by Finance Minister [[Bharrat Jagdeo]], who had been named Prime Minister a day earlier. National elections were held on March 19, 2001, three months later than planned as the election committees said they were unprepared. Fears that the violence that marred the previous election led to monitoring by foreign bodies, including Jimmy Carter. In March incumbent President Jagdeo won the election with a voter turnout of over 90%.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions with Suriname were seriously strained by a dispute over their shared maritime border after Guyana had allowed oil-prospectors license to explore the areas.\n\nIn December 2002, Hoyte died, with [[Robert Corbin]] replacing him as leader of the PNC. He agreed to engage in '[[constructive engagement]]' with Jagdeo and the PPP.\n\nSevere flooding following torrential rainfall wreaked havoc in Guyana beginning in January 2005. The downpour, which lasted about six weeks, inundated the coastal belt, caused the deaths of 34 people, and destroyed large parts of the rice and sugarcane crops. The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimated in March that the country would need $415 million for recovery and rehabilitation. About 275,000 people\u201437% of the population\u2014were affected in some way by the floods.\n\nIn May 2008, President [[Bharrat Jagdeo]] was a signatory to The [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the [[Union of South American Nations]]. Guyana has ratified the treaty.\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[French colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of South America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[Politics of Guyana]]\n*[[List of Governors of British Guiana]]\n*[[List of Governors-General of Guyana]]\n*[[List of Presidents of Guyana]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Guyana]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Daly\n  | first = Vere T.\n  | title = The Making of Guyana\n  | year = 1974\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | isbn = 978-0-333-14482-4\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UOFrAAAAMAAJ\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Daly\n  | first = Vere T.\n  | title = A Short History of The Guyanese People\n  | year = 1975\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | isbn = 978-0-333-18304-5\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sPkYAAAAYAAJ\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Hope\n  | first = Kempe Ronald\n  | title = Guyana: Politics and Development in an Emergent Socialist State\n  | year = 1985\n  | publisher = Mosaic Press\n  | location = Oakville, Ont\n  | isbn = 0-88962-302-3\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YPsYAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn=0889623023\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = R\u00e9vauger\n  | first = C\u00e9cile\n  | authorlink = C\u00e9cile R\u00e9vauger\n  | title = The Abolition of Slavery&nbsp;\u2013 The British Debate 1787\u20131840\n  | publisher = Presse Universitaire de France\n  | date = October 2008\n  | isbn = 978-2-13-057110-0\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GQgrPQAACAAJ&dq=isbn=9782130571100\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}{{cite book\n  | last = Spinner\n  | first = Thomas J.\n  | title = A Political and Social History of Guyana, 1945\u20131983\n  | year = 1984\n  | publisher = Westview Press\n  | location = Boulder, Colo\n  | isbn = 0-86531-852-2\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NvsYAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn=0865318522\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{Cite book|title = General History of the Caribbean: Volume I: Autochthonous Societies|publisher = UNESCO|year = 2003|isbn = 0-333-72453-4|location = Paris|editor-last = Sued-Badillo|editor-first = Jalil}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Henry\n  | first = Paget\n  | last2 = Stone\n  | first2 = Carl\n  | title = The Newer Caribbean: Decolonization, Democracy, and Development\n  | year = 1983\n  | publisher = Institute for the Study of Human Issues\n  | series = Volume 4 of Inter-American politics series\n  | location = Philadelphia\n  | isbn = 0-89727-049-5\n  | accessdate = 2011-01-07\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OBIPAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn=0897270495\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* This article includes information from the public domain Library of Congress Guyana country study.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist\n| refs =\n}}\n\n{{Spanish Empire}}\n{{History of South America}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Guyana}}\n[[Category:History of Guyana| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePPP re-election and debacle:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: US $ \u2192 US$", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Guyana"}

In addition to the call for an institutional change of the patriarchal family in favor of individual freedom and women's liberation, many scholars also discussed various gender issues in their writings.\n\nLu Xun, a leading figure and influential writer of modern Chinese literature, published an article in the ''[[New Youth]]'' in 1918 titled \"My Views on Chastity.\" As a response to the cult of female chastity in [[Neo-Confucianism]] which believed \"starving to death is a small matter, but losing chastity is a great matter,\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Li |first1=Hsiang |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |date=2007 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0791467503 |pages=132\u2013133}}</ref> Lu Xun directly argues against the idea that losing female chastity is the cause of corruption of social morality, questioning the functioning of patriarchal ideology in blaming women for the decline of a nation. \"Why should women shoulder the whole responsibility for saving the world?\" writes Lu Xun, \"According to the old school, women belong to the yin, or negative element.  Their place is in the home, as chattels of men. Surely, then, the onus for governing the state and saving the country should rest with the men, who belong to the men. However, a country's downfall is always blamed on women. Willy-nilly they have shouldered the sins of mankind for more than three thousand years.

The [[I Ching]] stated that \"'Great Righteousness is shown in that man and woman occupy their correct places; the relative positions of Heaven and Earth.'\"<ref>Quoted in Croll (1978), 13.</ref> Women were to be submissive and obedient to men,<ref>Croll (1978), 13.</ref> and normally not allowed to participate in government, military or community institutions.<ref>Croll (1978), 15.</ref> While there were lauded exceptions in Chinese history and literature, such as the [[Song dynasty]] general [[Liang Hongyu]] and legendary [[women warriors in literature and culture|woman warrior]] [[Hua Mulan]], these were considered to be signs of the dire situation of China at the time.

In addition to the call for an institutional change of the patriarchal family in favor of individual freedom and women's liberation, many scholars also discussed various gender issues in their writings.\n\nLu Xun, a leading figure and influential writer of modern Chinese literature, published an article in the ''[[New Youth]]'' in 1918 titled \"My Views on Chastity.\" As a response to the cult of female chastity in [[Neo-Confucianism]] which believed \"starving to death is a small matter, but losing chastity is a great matter,\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Li |first1=Hsiang |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |date=2007 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0791467503 |pages=132\u2013133}}</ref> Lu Xun directly argues against the idea that losing female chastity is the cause of corruption of social morality, questioning the functioning of patriarchal ideology in blaming women for the decline of a nation. \"Why should women shoulder the whole responsibility for saving the world?\" writes Lu Xun, \"According to the old school, women belong to the yin, or negative element.  Their place is in the home, as chattels of men. Surely, then, the onus for governing the state and saving the country should rest with the men, who belong to the men. However, a country's downfall is always blamed on women. Willy-nilly they have shouldered the sins of mankind for more than three thousand years. Since men are not brought to book and have no sense of shame, they go on seducing women as just as they please, while writers treat such incidents as romantic.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Leo Ou-fan |title=Lu Xun and his legacy |date=1985 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0520051584 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/luxunhislegacy00leel_0/page/61 61\u201363] |url=https://archive.org/details/luxunhislegacy00leel_0/page/61 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, after reading [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[A Doll's House]]'', Lu Xun wrote a continuation of the story titled \"What Happens after Nora Leaves Home?\" In his own story, Lu Xun explores what might happen if China's own version of Nora left home and he has a very pessimistic view of Nora and her liberation. Lu Xun proposes the idea that unless a structural and systemic reforming has been accomplished, any individual liberation will eventually end up in misery.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chien |first1=Ying-Ying |title=Feminism and China's New \"Nora\": Ibsen, Hu Shi, and Lu Xun |journal=The Comparatist |date=May 1995 |volume=19 |pages=97\u2013113 |doi=10.1353/com.1995.0014}}</ref> In the same year, Lu Xun published a novel titled ''The New Year Sacrifice''. One of the major themes of the novel is women's rights and marriage practices (including arranged marriages), as he writes, \"This poor woman, abandoned by people in the dust as a tiresome and worn-out toy, once left her own imprint in the dust, and those who enjoy life must have wondered at her for wishing to prolong her existence; but now at least she has been swept clear by eternity.

The population was 1,919 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], down from 1,987 in 2000.\n\n== History ==\nPrairie La Porte, meaning \"the door to the prairie,\" was the first name given to Guttenberg by French explorers in 1673.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIp55QcwE30C&lpg=PA175&dq=leclaire%20iowa&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q=leclaire%20iowa&f=false | title=Travel Guide-Lansing Iowa to Leclaire: Along the Mississippi River in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin: Lansing Iowa to Leclaire | publisher=Dean Klinkenberg | date=Oct 1, 2009 | accessdate=2013-05-04 | author=Klinkenberg, Dean | pages=64}}</ref> The Guttenberg area was a site of [[Sac (tribe)|Sac]] and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] campgrounds until 1823. The [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803 transferred ownership to the [[United States of America|United States]] and the [[Black Hawk Purchase]] of 1833 finally opened the area for legal settlement.\n\nGuttenberg's past is preserved today in the many limestone buildings built by German immigrants in the mid-to-late 19th century. These  structures were used for both residential and commercial purposes. Many are pre-[[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]] era and are on the [[National Historic Register]] (NHR).\n   \nGuttenberg's riverfront location was pivotal in its early commercial development. The town first served as a focal point for westward settlement and as an early governmental and administrative center. It was the early location of the county seat from 1838\u20131843. Guttenberg served as a supply center for the general area until the Civil War, when railroads and an interior road system combined to detract from Guttenberg's role as a market center.\n\nThe earliest businesses included general supply stores, blacksmith, wagon shops, and [[hotel]]s. The loss of the county seat in 1843 slowed growth and the population declined. Economic revival began in 1845 with the influx of hundreds of German immigrants under the auspices of the Western Settlement Society of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and continued with the development of the lead mining industry along Miners Creek.\n\nThe German immigration began in 1845, and by 1850 the town was sizable and nearly all German. It has been said that the city takes its name from [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of [[movable type]], however it's actually named after Guttenberg, Bavaria, Germany.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The influence of the German population was best indicated by the construction during the period between 1845 and 1865 for over one hundred stone buildings. The bluff [[limestone]] was easily obtained and good, local clay and lime for construction was available. Four large riverside warehouses opened and a large flour mill, stores, and hotels appeared during this period. The steamboat trade deposited merchandise and picked up farm produce, milled flour and lead ore.\n\nGuttenberg experienced many floods, the most recent and devastating being in 1965, after which a levee was built. Today, Guttenberg's population is 1,980 and it is the largest town in Clayton County.\n\n==Geography==\nGuttenberg is located at {{coord|42|47|10|N|91|6|5|W|type:city}} (42.785992, -91.101366).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref><br>\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.12|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|2.09|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name =\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref>\n\nThe community is located on the [[Mississippi River]], across from [[Wisconsin]], and is on [[U.S. Route 52 in Iowa|U.S. Route 52]].\n\n===Climate===\nGuttenberg has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'').\n\n{{Weather box \n| location    = Guttenberg\n| single line = Y\n| Jan record high F = 60\n| Feb record high F = 64\n| Mar record high F = 87\n| Apr record high F = 97\n| May record high F = 95\n| Jun record high F = 101\n| Jul record high F = 102\n| Aug record high F = 103\n| Sep record high F = 98\n| Oct record high F = 94\n| Nov record high F = 78\n| Dec record high F = 68\n| year record high F = 103\n| Jan high F = 27\n| Feb high F = 33\n| Mar high F = 45\n| Apr high F = 59\n| May high F = 72\n| Jun high F = 81\n| Jul high F = 85\n| Aug high F = 83\n| Sep high F = 75\n| Oct high F = 62\n| Nov high F = 45\n| Dec high F = 31\n| year high F = 58\n| Jan low F = 8\n| Feb low F = 15\n| Mar low F = 26\n| Apr low F = 39\n| May low F = 50\n| Jun low F = 60\n| Jul low F = 64\n| Aug low F = 62\n| Sep low F = 53\n| Oct low F = 42\n| Nov low F = 28\n| Dec low F = 16\n| year low F = 39\n| Jan record low F = \u221236\n| Feb record low F = \u221238\n| Mar record low F = \u221230\n| Apr record low F = 7\n| May record low F = 27\n| Jun record low F = 40\n| Jul record low F = 46\n| Aug record low F = 40\n| Sep record low F = 27\n| Oct record low F = 14\n| Nov record low F = \u221211\n| Dec record low F = \u221229\n| year record low F = \u221238\n| Jan precipitation inch = 1.09\n| Feb precipitation inch = 1.14\n| Mar precipitation inch = 2.01\n| Apr precipitation inch = 3.25\n| May precipitation inch = 3.80\n| Jun precipitation inch = 4.42\n| Jul precipitation inch = 4.12\n| Aug precipitation inch = 4.36\n| Sep precipitation inch = 3.01\n| Oct precipitation inch = 2.17\n| Nov precipitation inch = 2.23\n| Dec precipitation inch = 1.32\n| year precipitation inch = 32.92\n| source 1 = ''The Weather Channel''<ref name=\"TWC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIA0361|title= Average weather for Guttenberg|publisher= [[The Weather Channel]]|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}</ref>\n| date     = March 2011\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title= Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|align= left\n|1860|1104\n|1870|1040\n|1880|1076\n|1890|1160\n|1900|1620\n|1910|1873\n|1920|1666\n|1930|1918\n|1940|1860\n|1950|1912\n|1960|2087\n|1970|2177\n|1980|2428\n|1990|2257\n|2000|1987\n|2010|1914\n|2018|1811\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=Source:{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|title=American FactFinder|access-date=2020-03-29|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212063637/http://factfinder.census.gov/|archive-date=2020-02-12|url-status=dead}} and [http://data.iowadatacenter.org/datatables/PlacesAll/plpopulation18502000.pdf Iowa Data Center]\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,919 people, 887 households, and 516 families living in the city.

The population was 1,919 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], down from 1,987 in 2000.\n\n== History ==\nPrairie La Porte, meaning \"the door to the prairie,\" was the first name given to Guttenberg by French explorers in 1673.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIp55QcwE30C&lpg=PA175&dq=leclaire%20iowa&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q=leclaire%20iowa&f=false | title=Travel Guide-Lansing Iowa to Leclaire: Along the Mississippi River in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin: Lansing Iowa to Leclaire | publisher=Dean Klinkenberg | date=Oct 1, 2009 | accessdate=2013-05-04 | author=Klinkenberg, Dean | pages=64}}</ref> The Guttenberg area was a site of [[Sac (tribe)|Sac]] and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] campgrounds until 1823. The [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803 transferred ownership to the [[United States of America|United States]] and the [[Black Hawk Purchase]] of 1833 finally opened the area for legal settlement.\n\nGuttenberg\u2019s past is preserved today in the many limestone buildings built by German immigrants in the mid-to-late 19th century. These  structures were used for both residential and commercial purposes. Many are pre-[[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]] era and are on the [[National Historic Register]] (NHR).\n   \nGuttenberg's riverfront location was pivotal in its early commercial development. The town first served as a focal point for westward settlement and as an early governmental and administrative center. It was the early location of the county seat from 1838-1843. Guttenberg served as a supply center for the general area until the Civil War, when railroads and an interior road system combined to detract from Guttenberg's role as a market center.\n\nThe earliest businesses included general supply stores, blacksmith, wagon shops, and [[hotel]]s. The loss of the county seat in 1843 slowed growth and the population declined. Economic revival began in 1845 with the influx of hundreds of German immigrants under the auspices of the Western Settlement Society of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and continued with the development of the lead mining industry along Miners Creek.\n\nThe German immigration began in 1845, and by 1850 the town was sizable and nearly all German. It has been said that the city takes its name from [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of [[movable type]], however it\u2019s actually named after Guttenberg, Bavaria, Germany.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The influence of the German population was best indicated by the construction during the period between 1845 and 1865 for over one hundred stone buildings. The bluff [[limestone]] was easily obtained and good, local clay and lime for construction was available. Four large riverside warehouses opened and a large flour mill, stores, and hotels appeared during this period. The steamboat trade deposited merchandise and picked up farm produce, milled flour and lead ore.\n\nGuttenberg experienced many floods, the most recent and devastating being in 1965, after which a levee was built. Today, Guttenberg's population is 1,980 and it is the largest town in Clayton County.\n\n==Geography==\nGuttenberg is located at {{coord|42|47|10|N|91|6|5|W|type:city}} (42.785992, -91.101366).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref><br>\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|2.12|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|2.09|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name =\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref>\n\nThe community is located on the [[Mississippi River]], across from [[Wisconsin]], and is on [[U.S. Route 52 in Iowa|U.S. Route 52]].\n\n===Climate===\nGuttenberg has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'').\n\n{{Weather box \n| location    = Guttenberg\n| single line = Y\n| Jan record high F = 60\n| Feb record high F = 64\n| Mar record high F = 87\n| Apr record high F = 97\n| May record high F = 95\n| Jun record high F = 101\n| Jul record high F = 102\n| Aug record high F = 103\n| Sep record high F = 98\n| Oct record high F = 94\n| Nov record high F = 78\n| Dec record high F = 68\n| year record high F = 103\n| Jan high F = 27\n| Feb high F = 33\n| Mar high F = 45\n| Apr high F = 59\n| May high F = 72\n| Jun high F = 81\n| Jul high F = 85\n| Aug high F = 83\n| Sep high F = 75\n| Oct high F = 62\n| Nov high F = 45\n| Dec high F = 31\n| year high F = 58\n| Jan low F = 8\n| Feb low F = 15\n| Mar low F = 26\n| Apr low F = 39\n| May low F = 50\n| Jun low F = 60\n| Jul low F = 64\n| Aug low F = 62\n| Sep low F = 53\n| Oct low F = 42\n| Nov low F = 28\n| Dec low F = 16\n| year low F = 39\n| Jan record low F = \u221236\n| Feb record low F = \u221238\n| Mar record low F = \u221230\n| Apr record low F = 7\n| May record low F = 27\n| Jun record low F = 40\n| Jul record low F = 46\n| Aug record low F = 40\n| Sep record low F = 27\n| Oct record low F = 14\n| Nov record low F = \u221211\n| Dec record low F = \u221229\n| year record low F = \u221238\n| Jan precipitation inch = 1.09\n| Feb precipitation inch = 1.14\n| Mar precipitation inch = 2.01\n| Apr precipitation inch = 3.25\n| May precipitation inch = 3.80\n| Jun precipitation inch = 4.42\n| Jul precipitation inch = 4.12\n| Aug precipitation inch = 4.36\n| Sep precipitation inch = 3.01\n| Oct precipitation inch = 2.17\n| Nov precipitation inch = 2.23\n| Dec precipitation inch = 1.32\n| year precipitation inch = 32.92\n| source 1 = ''The Weather Channel''<ref name=\"TWC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIA0361|title= Average weather for Guttenberg|publisher= [[The Weather Channel]]|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}</ref>\n| date     = March 2011\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title= Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|align= left\n|1860|1104\n|1870|1040\n|1880|1076\n|1890|1160\n|1900|1620\n|1910|1873\n|1920|1666\n|1930|1918\n|1940|1860\n|1950|1912\n|1960|2087\n|1970|2177\n|1980|2428\n|1990|2257\n|2000|1987\n|2010|1914\n|2018|1811\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=Source:{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|title=American FactFinder|access-date=2020-03-29|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212063637/http://factfinder.census.gov/|archive-date=2020-02-12|url-status=dead}} and [http://data.iowadatacenter.org/datatables/PlacesAll/plpopulation18502000.pdf Iowa Data Center]\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-05-11}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,919 people, 887 households, and 516 families living in the city.

During the initial year of putting the band together and working on new material the band wrote and independently released the single, \"Shock\" in 1991 which rose to the top of the dance charts.  Industrial dance music ruled the charts in Europe along with strong ties to Chicago, Wax Trax Records, and Houston. Subsequent releases of \"Cut the Skin\" and \"Shoot to Kill\" gained national exposure on the dance charts and club scene. \"Never Again\" was self-released as a radio single and quickly rose to the top of Houston Radio Station's 93Q and 96.5 attracting the attention of independent record label Alpha International.  Stephen Bogle produced the single of \"Never Again\". The band wrote and produced the album \"Leave Me Alone\" but due to the bankruptcy of Alpha International the record sat idle. It was released but there were no marketing efforts behind it. After the release of the album, the band sought out drummer Max Schuldberg and they played their first concert as a foursome opening for Peter Murphy at Southern Star Amphitheater. They played concerts in Texas as a foursome for two years. Along with the three founders and newest member Max Schuldberg, the band added producer Stephen Bogle as guitarist to complete the line up. The band recorded and produced \"Grip\" under their own start up label, Gut Records. \"Grip\" went on to sell 15,000 units with the help of a crafty rework of Bad Company's \"Feel like Makin Love\". Universal Records, at the time a brand new start up label, heard of the success of \"Grip\" and signed the band as their second artist ever. \"Devil Thumbs a Ride\", the 3rd album, had already been recorded and mastered and was about to be manufactured for another self-release when Universal stepped in to sign the band and release the album as-is.  The Hunger had a hit song in 1996, \"Vanishing Cream\", from the ''Devil Thumbs a Ride'' CD, which received heavy [[airplay (radio)|airplay]] on rock stations and reached No. 4 on the Mainstream Rock charts. After two years of constant touring, the band finally stopped to record their second release with Universal Records, \"Cinematic Superthug\".

The upper side of the rather narrow forewings is white in ground colour, with dark brown antemedian, postmedian and submarginal lines, and large deep dark brown costal markings. Hindwings white with more or less prominent light brown submarginal and marginal lines, except in the anal field of the hindwings. Thorax white with brown spots, abdomen mostly white, dorsally with some greyish brown on most if not all segments. Forelegs dorsally greyish brown, ventrally white, midlegs white with apical femur and tibia brown, and hindlegs entirely white.<ref name=Landry-eal-2011/>\n\nIn the male genitalia, the tegumen exhibits straight sides and a semi-circular top, over which the uncus, reduced to a narrow band (an [[Synapomorphy and apomorphy|apomorphy of the genus]]), arches. The uncus centre is loosely set with simple thin chaetae. Vinculum broad U-shaped with a sharp, short keeled ventral tip. Juxta broad, dorsally rectangular, ventrally somewhat rhomboid and broader. Valva costae very broad, straight to slightly concave, basally each with a medially directed slender, apically pointed projection (which are, however, not the transtilla arms); valva apex broad rounded, ventral valva side medially broadly bulging outward, in basal half with elongate sacculus. A stout-tipped, short posteroventrad directed fibula emerging from a broad sclerotised base stretching from close to the costa base to the ventral valva edge. Phallus short, broad, evenly sclerotised, with a short coecum; vesica with a compact field of about 20 short, slender cornuti.<ref name=Landry-eal-2011/>\n\nFemale genitalia with a cup-shaped, weakly sclerotised antrum. In its posterior part, the ductus bursae is sclerotised and longitudinally ridged, the anterior part is membranous and gradually widens towards the globular corpus bursae, which contains a minute spine-like signum near the conjunction with the ductus bursae.<ref name=Landry-eal-2011/>\n\nBased on material collected on Fernandina Island, the known flying period is between January and May, as well as in August, October, and November.
