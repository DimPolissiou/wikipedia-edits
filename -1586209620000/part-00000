After [[World War I]], Fiat consolidated several Italian small aircraft manufacturers, like [[Fabbrica Aeroplani Ing. O. Pomilio|Pomilio]] and [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]]. Most famous were the Fiat biplane [[fighter aircraft]] of the 1930s,  the [[Fiat CR.32]] and  the [[Fiat CR.42]]. Other notable designs were the fighters [[Fiat CR.20|CR.20]], [[Fiat G.50|G.50]], [[Fiat G.55|G.55]] and a bomber, the [[Fiat BR.20]]. In the 1950s, the company designed the [[Fiat G.91|G.91]] light ground attack plane.\n\nIn 1969, Fiat Aviazione merged with [[Aerfer]] to create [[Aeritalia]], which would become [[Alenia Aeronautica]] in 1990.\n[[File:Fiat AS1.jpg|right|thumb|A Fiat AS.1]]\n\n==History==\n\n===The beginning===\nIn 1908, aeronautical production started taking its first steps in [[Turin]], by Fiat, with the decision to design and produce an engine, the SA 8/75, derived from racing cars. It was the beginning of a centennial story whose heritage is today linked directly to [[Avio]]. The first mass-produced engine produced by Fiat was the A10, created in 1,070 units between 1914 and 1915: at this point the pioneer age had come to an end and the company decided to design and construct complete aircraft (1969). Thus in 1916 the Societ\u00e0 Italiana Aviazione was founded, changing its name in 1918 to Fiat.<ref name=\"aviogroup.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aviogroup.com/it/avio_heritage/velivoli_e_motori |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807161417/http://www.aviogroup.com/it/avio_heritage/velivoli_e_motori |archivedate=2011-08-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn Turin, besides aircraft engines, and always along the lines of the internal-combustion engine, Fiat diversified production with the constitution in 1909 of [[Fiat San Giorgio]] for marine diesel engines, the area from which activities in the field of industrial engines for electric power generation later ensued. In [[Colleferro]] ([[Rome]]), the Bombrini Parodi-Delfino-BPD Company, established in [[Genoa]] in 1912, started manufacturing explosives and chemical products, from which the space segment originated.\n\nIn the aeronautical field, roots grew in [[Brindisi]] with the [[Societ\u00e1 per Azioni Costruzioni Aeronavali|SACA]] Company. Gradually, many other realities began such as the [[CMASA di Marina]] Company in [[Pisa]], founded in 1921 by German design engineer [[Claude Dornier]], in collaboration with [[Rinaldo Piaggio]] and [[Attilio Odero]]. Finally, interactions and exchanges, accumulation of skills and experience, and multi-faceted stimuli have come from the many varied forms of international collaboration that have taken place with major companies like [[General Electric]], [[Rolls-Royce Group PLC|Rolls-Royce]],  [[Pratt & Whitney]] and [[Eurocopter]], just to mention a few of the most important names with whom current partnerships go back over half a century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[La Storia futura - Stefano Musso Professor of History of Political Movements and Parties at the Faculty of Political Science, Turin University - 2008- \u00a9AVIO S.p.A.]</ref>\n\n===From biplanes to jet aircraft===\nAfter the first pioneering design of aircraft engines at the beginning of the twentieth century, against the opinion of over-cautious directors towards new technologies and areas of activity, [[Giovanni Agnelli]], one of Fiat's founder members, and technical director [[Guido Fornaca]], supported aeronautical production, and started up on an industrial basis during the Great War to meet military orders. Therefore, the [[Societ\u00e0 Italiana Aviazione]] (Italian Aviation Company) was established in 1916, and later passed to the Aviation Section of Fiat in 1918. The first mass-produced aeronautical engine (over 1,000 units), the [[Fiat A.10]], was installed in several aircraft between 1914 and 1915, such as the Farman, later produced under licence, and the three-engined [[Caproni]] bomber aircraft.\n\n===After the First World War===\nAt the end of the [[First World War]], the technical and production resources accumulated during the conflict were directed at the emerging sector of the commercial aeroplane. The production of complete aircraft, already started up with the SP series, intensified under the guidance of design engineer [[Celestino Rosatelli]] who began his collaboration with Fiat in 1918. For about fifteen years, Rosatelli contributed to the famous CR and BR fighter and bomber aircraft while, thanks to its highly technical and reliable engines, Fiat aircraft had a run of world records: power, with the A14 of 700HP produced between 1917 and 1919;  speed, with the 300&nbsp;km/h achieved by the R700 in 1921; speed and airworthiness, with the AS2 engine that, installed on the Idromacchi M20, established the speed record for seaplanes and won the prestigious Schneider Cup in America in 1926; and speed again, with the new record attained by Francesco Agello in 1934 in an aeroplane powered by the Fiat AS6 engine of 3,100HP.\n\n===Merger with the Societ\u00e0 Aeronautica d\u2019Italia===\nIn 1926, with the acquisition of the [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]] factory in [[Corso Francia]], Turin, Fiat Aviazione merged with the Societ\u00e0 Aeronautica d\u2019Italia (Italian Aeronautical Company). In 1931, Vittorio Valletta, the then General Manager of Fiat, employed a young design engineer, Giuseppe Gabrielli, to head the Aviation Technical Office. In 1934, the acquisition of the CMASA Company marked the entry of Fiat into the production of seaplanes. A great many of the targets achieved in the subsequent thirty-year period were linked to the genius of Gabrielli who quickly made a name for himself, beginning with the G2, a commercial plane with six seats besides the pilot, destined to be used by the Societ\u00e0 Aviolinee Italiane (Italian Airline Company), with Fiat as majority shareholder, which boasted original innovations and developments under six patents.\n\nWhile investments in the passenger and cargo transport sector continued with the opening up of European routes by civil airlines which used G18 and APR2 twin-engine monoplanes, the G50 was produced in 1937, in the CMASA factory in Marina di Pisa, the first single-seater fighter plane employed by the [[Italian Air Force]].\n\n===After the Second World War===\nIn 1949, having overcome the uncertainties and difficulties of the Second World War, the Fiat aeronautical activities were reorganised in the Aviation area. Delays in the production typologies accumulated in the years of autarchy were soon overcome thanks to the technical competences of Gabrielli and the new climate of Atlantic and inter-European collaboration. Already in 1951, Gabrielli had designed the G80, the first Italian jet aircraft powered by a De Havilland \u201cGoblin\u201d turbojet engine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Fiat Aviazione started a production revival by means of American orders and, in particular, was the only company in Europe to obtain the licence from [[NATO]] for the construction of the F86 K. It entered into an agreement with [[General Electric]] and [[Pratt & Whitney]] for the production of jet engine components. The experience acquired through this work allowed the Company to participate in the international call for tenders by NATO in 1954 for a light tactical fighter aircraft. The following year, the Italian project, named G91, obtained the order for three prototypes, in the same way as the English and French competitors, and then emerged as the winner, with the final decision being made in 1958. The G91 was affirmed as NATO's standard light fighter aircraft in the European zone, becoming the most important Italian postwar aircraft with over 700 planes produced, for the most part exported.<ref>[G.

Gabrielli \u2013 Una vita per l\u2019aviazione \u2013 1982 Edizioni Bompiani]</ref>\n\nIn 1961, Fiat Aviazione took on the role of Italian prime contractor for the NATO F104 G aircraft and, under these circumstances, established collaboration relations with the [[Alfa Romeo]] Avio Company in Pomigliano d\u2019Arco, near Naples, directly controlled by the Finmeccanica State Company. From the middle of the 1950s, under the guidance of the engineer Stefanutti, Alfa Romeo Avio had also intensified collaboration relations with [[Rolls-Royce Group PLC|Rolls-Royce]] and [[General Electric]] for aeronautical engines. In the second half of the 1960s, following consistent orders of the DC-9 for the national flagship airline [[Alitalia]], controlled by the IRI State Company, the collaboration began between [[McDonnell Douglas]] and [[Aerfer]], an aeronautical and railway Construction Company established by Finmeccanica in 1950 on part of the Aeronautical Centre in [[Pomigliano d\u2019Arco]].\n\n===Setting up of the Aeritalia Company===\nIn 1969, Fiat and Finmeccanica set up the [[Aeritalia]] Company, who Fiat entrusted with the aircraft activities.\n\nSubsequently, through different international collaborations, Pomigliano d\u2019Arco specialised in the development and production of components for the \u201chot parts\u201d of jet engines and the overhaul of civil aero engines.\nFiat concentrated instead on aero engines and transmissions for helicopters, assembled by Fiat Aviazione in 1976, with 3,700 employees, with production centres in [[Turin]] and [[Brindisi]].\n\nThis choice was consistent with the transformation of the aeronautical industry's worldwide scenario, characterised by the formation of just a few large groups and growing specialisation and internationalisation. A twofold necessity ensued, on the one side, to put into the field collaborations crucial to bringing together the financial resources and technological competences required by an increasingly sophisticated production in the area of materials, electronics and safety systems and, on the other, to identify areas of specialisation in which to play a leading role at a worldwide level. The programme of refinement and improvement of quality control was a strategic factor that gave rise to Fiat Aviazione's success during those years.\n\n===Changing the name to Fiat Avio===\nWith the change of the company name to Fiat Avio in 1989, the Turin Company collaborated on the design and manufacture of propulsion systems for the [[Panavia Tornado]] and [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier]] Jump Jet (vertical/short takeoff and landing) in the military sector, and [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]] in the commercial one, to mention the most important examples in both military and commercial fields.\n\nIn 1997, the acquisition of the controlling stake in [[Alfa Romeo]] Avio from [[Finmeccanica]] was key to a national strategic project aimed at reducing the excessive fragmentation of the Italian companies and at increasing competitiveness through more systematic synergies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Products==\n\n===Aircraft===\n* [[Fiat AN.1 (aircraft)|Fiat AN.1]]\n* [[Fiat APR.2]]\n* [[Fiat AS.1]]\n\n; [[Giuseppe Gabrielli]] series\n* [[Fiat G.2]]\n* [[Fiat G.5]]\n* [[Fiat G.8]]\n* [[Fiat G.12]]\n* [[Fiat G.18]]\n* [[Fiat G.46]]\n* [[Fiat G.49]]\n* [[Fiat G.50]]\n* [[Fiat G.55]]\n* [[Fiat G.61]]\n* [[Fiat G.80]]\n* [[Fiat G.82]]\n* [[Fiat G.91]]\n* [[Fiat G.91Y]]\n* [[Fiat G.212]]\n* [[Aeritalia G.222|Fiat G.222]]\n\n; Aldo Guglielmetti series\n* [[Fiat BGA]]\n\n; [[Celestino Rosatelli]] series\n* [[Fiat B.R.]]\n* [[Fiat B.R.1]]\n* [[Fiat B.R.2]]\n* [[Fiat BR.20]]\n* [[Fiat BRG]]\n* [[Fiat C.29]]\n* [[Fiat CR.1]]\n* [[Fiat CR.20]]\n* [[Fiat CR.25]]\n* [[Fiat CR.30]]\n* [[Fiat CR.32]]\n* [[Fiat C.R.33]]\n* [[Fiat C.R.40]]\n* [[Fiat C.R.41]]\n* [[Fiat CR.42]]\n* [[Fiat R.2]]\n* [[Fiat R.22]]\n* [[Fiat-Ansaldo A.120]]\n* [[Fiat-Ansaldo A.S.1]]\n* [[Fiat CANSA F.C. 12]]\n* [[Fiat CANSA F.C.20]]\n* [[Fiat RS.14]]\n* [[Fiat M.F.4]]\n\n; Helicopters\n* [[Fiat 7002]]\n\n===Aircraft engines===\n\n* [[Fiat SA8/75]]\n* [[Fiat S.55]]\n* [[Fiat A.10]]\n* [[Fiat A.12]]\n* [[Fiat A.14]]\n* [[Fiat A.15]]\n* [[Fiat A.20]]\n* [[Fiat A.22]]\n* [[Fiat A.24]]\n* [[Fiat A.25]]\n* [[Fiat A.30]]\n* [[Fiat A.50]]\n* [[Fiat A.53]]\n* [[Fiat A.54]]\n* [[Fiat A.55]]<ref name=\"Grey 1972 pp.68d-71d\">Grey 1972 pp.68d-71d</ref>\n* [[Fiat A.58]]<ref name=\"Grey 1972 pp.68d-71d\"/>\n* [[Fiat A.59]]\n* [[Fiat A.60]]\n* [[Fiat A.74]]\n* [[Fiat A.76]]\n* [[Fiat A.78]]<ref name=\"Grey 1972 pp.68d-71d\"/>\n* [[Fiat A.80]]\n* [[Fiat A.82]]\n* [[Fiat AS.2]] Schneider Trophy 1926\n* [[Fiat AS.3]]\n* [[Fiat AS.5]] Schneider Trophy 1929\n* [[Fiat AS.6]] Schneider Trophy 1931\n* [[Fiat AN.1]] Diesel\n* [[Fiat 4002]]\n* [[Fiat 4004]]\n* [[Fiat 4301]]\n* [[Fiat 4700]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Italy|Companies}}\n* [[Aeritalia]]\n* [[Alenia Aeronautica]]\n* [[List of Italian companies#Aircraft companies|List of Italian companies]]\n\n==References==\n{{more footnotes|date=March 2008}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last= Gunston |first= Bill |coauthors= |title= World Encyclopedia of Aircraft Manufacturers, 2nd Edition |year= 2005 |publisher= Sutton Publishing Limited |location= Phoenix Mill, Gloucestershire, England, UK |isbn= 0-7509-3981-8 |pages= 164 }}\n\n<!-- ==External links== -->\n{{Fiat aeroengines}}\n{{Fiat aircraft}}\n\n[[Category:Fiat| ]]\n[[Category:Defunct aircraft manufacturers of Italy]]\n[[Category:Defunct helicopter manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Turin]]\n[[Category:Aeritalia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company\n| name             = Fiat Aviazione\n| logo = Fiat Aviazione logo.jpg\n| logo_size = 240px\n| type             = [[Private company|Private]]\n| fate \t    = Merged with [[Aerfer]]\n| successor = [[Aeritalia]]\n| foundation       = {{Start date|1908}}\n| founder          = [[Giovanni Agnelli]]\n| defunct          = {{End date|1969}}\n| location_city    = [[Turin]]\n| location_country = Italy\n| industry         = [[Aeronautics]] \n| products         = [[Aircraft]]\n}}\n\n'''Fiat Aviazione''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[aircraft]] manufacturer, at one time part of the [[Fiat]] group, focused mainly on military aviation. After [[World War I]], Fiat consolidated several Italian small aircraft manufacturers, like [[Fabbrica Aeroplani Ing. O. Pomilio|Pomilio]] and [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]]. Most famous were the Fiat biplane [[fighter aircraft]] of the 1930s,  the [[Fiat CR.32]] and  the [[Fiat CR.42]]. Other notable designs were the fighters [[Fiat CR.20|CR.20]], [[Fiat G.50|G.50]], [[Fiat G.55|G.55]] and a bomber, the [[Fiat BR.20]]. In the 1950s, the company designed the [[Fiat G.91|G.91]] light ground attack plane.\n\nIn 1969, Fiat Aviazione merged with [[Aerfer]] to create [[Aeritalia]], which would become [[Alenia Aeronautica]] in 1990.\n[[File:Fiat AS1.jpg|right|thumb|A Fiat AS.1]]\n==History==\n\n===The beginning===\nIn 1908, aeronautical production started taking its first steps in [[Turin]], by Fiat, with the decision to design and produce an engine, the SA 8/75, derived from racing cars. It was the beginning of a centennial story whose heritage is today linked directly to [[Avio]]. The first mass-produced engine produced by Fiat was the A10, created in 1,070 units between 1914 and 1915: at this point the pioneer age had come to an end and the company decided to design and construct complete aircraft (1969). Thus in 1916 the Societ\u00e0 Italiana Aviazione was founded, changing its name in 1918 to Fiat.<ref name=\"aviogroup.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aviogroup.com/it/avio_heritage/velivoli_e_motori |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807161417/http://www.aviogroup.com/it/avio_heritage/velivoli_e_motori |archivedate=2011-08-07 }}</ref>\n\nIn Turin, besides aircraft engines, and always along the lines of the internal-combustion engine, Fiat diversified production with the constitution in 1909 of [[Fiat San Giorgio]] for marine diesel engines, the area from which activities in the field of industrial engines for electric power generation later ensued. In [[Colleferro]] ([[Rome]]), the Bombrini Parodi-Delfino-BPD Company, established in [[Genoa]] in 1912, started manufacturing explosives and chemical products, from which the space segment originated.\n\nIn the aeronautical field, roots grew in [[Brindisi]] with the [[Societ\u00e1 per Azioni Costruzioni Aeronavali|SACA]] Company. Gradually, many other realities began such as the [[CMASA di Marina]] Company in [[Pisa]], founded in 1921 by German design engineer [[Claude Dornier]], in collaboration with [[Rinaldo Piaggio]] and [[Attilio Odero]]. Finally, interactions and exchanges, accumulation of skills and experience, and multi-faceted stimuli have come from the many varied forms of international collaboration that have taken place with major companies like [[General Electric]], [[Rolls-Royce Group PLC|Rolls-Royce]],  [[Pratt & Whitney]] and [[Eurocopter]], just to mention a few of the most important names with whom current partnerships go back over half a century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[La Storia futura - Stefano Musso Professor of History of Political Movements and Parties at the Faculty of Political Science, Turin University - 2008- \u00a9AVIO S.p.A.]</ref>\n\n===From biplanes to jet aircraft===\nAfter the first pioneering design of aircraft engines at the beginning of the twentieth century, against the opinion of over-cautious directors towards new technologies and areas of activity, [[Giovanni Agnelli]], one of Fiat\u2019s founder members, and technical director [[Guido Fornaca]], supported aeronautical production, and started up on an industrial basis during the Great War to meet military orders. Therefore, the [[Societ\u00e0 Italiana Aviazione]] (Italian Aviation Company) was established in 1916, and later passed to the Aviation Section of Fiat in 1918. The first mass-produced aeronautical engine (over 1,000 units), the [[Fiat A.10]], was installed in several aircraft between 1914 and 1915, such as the Farman, later produced under licence, and the three-engined [[Caproni]] bomber aircraft.\n\n===After the First World War===\nAt the end of the [[First World War]], the technical and production resources accumulated during the conflict were directed at the emerging sector of the commercial aeroplane. The production of complete aircraft, already started up with the SP series, intensified under the guidance of design engineer [[Celestino Rosatelli]] who began his collaboration with Fiat in 1918. For about fifteen years, Rosatelli contributed to the famous CR and BR fighter and bomber aircraft while, thanks to its highly technical and reliable engines, Fiat aircraft had a run of world records: power, with the A14 of 700HP produced between 1917 and 1919;  speed, with the 300&nbsp;km/h achieved by the R700 in 1921; speed and airworthiness, with the AS2 engine that, installed on the Idromacchi M20, established the speed record for seaplanes and won the prestigious Schneider Cup in America in 1926; and speed again, with the new record attained by Francesco Agello in 1934 in an aeroplane powered by the Fiat AS6 engine of 3,100HP.\n\n===Merger with the Societ\u00e0 Aeronautica d\u2019Italia===\nIn 1926, with the acquisition of the [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]] factory in [[Corso Francia]], Turin, Fiat Aviazione merged with the Societ\u00e0 Aeronautica d\u2019Italia (Italian Aeronautical Company). In 1931, Vittorio Valletta, the then General Manager of Fiat, employed a young design engineer, Giuseppe Gabrielli, to head the Aviation Technical Office. In 1934, the acquisition of the CMASA Company marked the entry of Fiat into the production of seaplanes. A great many of the targets achieved in the subsequent thirty-year period were linked to the genius of Gabrielli who quickly made a name for himself, beginning with the G2, a commercial plane with six seats besides the pilot, destined to be used by the Societ\u00e0 Aviolinee Italiane (Italian Airline Company), with Fiat as majority shareholder, which boasted original innovations and developments under six patents.\n\nWhile investments in the passenger and cargo transport sector continued with the opening up of European routes by civil airlines which used G18 and APR2 twin-engine monoplanes, the G50 was produced in 1937, in the CMASA factory in Marina di Pisa, the first single-seater fighter plane employed by the [[Italian Air Force]].\n\n===After the Second World War===\nIn 1949, having overcome the uncertainties and difficulties of the Second World War, the Fiat aeronautical activities were reorganised in the Aviation area. Delays in the production typologies accumulated in the years of autarchy were soon overcome thanks to the technical competences of Gabrielli and the new climate of Atlantic and inter-European collaboration. Already in 1951, Gabrielli had designed the G80, the first Italian jet aircraft powered by a De Havilland \u201cGoblin\u201d turbojet engine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Fiat Aviazione started a production revival by means of American orders and, in particular, was the only company in Europe to obtain the licence from [[NATO]] for the construction of the F86 K.

[[Edward Dalton]], a former surgeon in the [[Union Army]], was charged with creating a hospital in lower New York; he started an ambulance service to bring the patients to the hospital faster and in more comfort, a service which started in 1869. These ambulances carried medical equipment, such as splints, a stomach pump, [[morphine]], and [[brandy]], reflecting contemporary medicine. Dalton believed that speed was of the essence, and at first the horses were kept in harness while awaiting a call: within a few months this practice had been replaced with a 'drop,' or 'snap,' [[Horse harness|harness]] arrangement, whereby the tack was lowered by pulley from the ceiling straight onto the horse: under either scheme, ambulances were ready to go within 30&nbsp;seconds of being called.<ref name=ambhist>The Ambulance: A History. Ryan Corbett Bell. McFarland & Co., 2009 ({{ISBN|978-0786438112}})</ref> The service was very popular and grew rapidly, with the year 1870 seeing the ambulances attend 1401 emergency calls, but twenty-one years later, this had more than tripled to 4392.<ref name=Ambulance/> For the first week of their operation, the ambulances were crewed by the hospital's house-staff, after which the hospital hired Drs. Duncan Lee and Robert Taylor as full-time ambulance surgeons; going forward, the plan was to crew the ambulances with fresh graduates of Bellevue's surgical training program, who would serve for six-month terms and be replaced by new hires from successive graduating classes.<ref name=ambhist/>  This scheme foundered immediately, however, when graduates balked at the schedule and the salary offered: $50 a month, twelve-hour shifts, and one day off every four weeks. Instead, by the end of 1869, the system of staffing the ambulance with residents in training (who could simply be assigned, rather than having to be recruited) was firmly established. As late as 1935, these interns were earning the same $50 a month their grandfathers had received.<ref name=ambhist/>\n\nIn 1867, the city of [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]], in the [[United Kingdom]], received six horse-drawn ambulances for the purpose of conveying [[smallpox]] and fever patients from their homes to a hospital. These ambulances were designed to resemble private carriages, but were equipped with rollers in their floors and large rear doors to allow for a patient, lying on a specially designed bed, to be easily loaded. Space was provided for an attendant to ride with the patient, and the entire patient compartment was designed to be easily cleaned and decontaminated. Anyone willing to pay the cost of horse hire could summon the ambulance by telegram or in person.<ref>{{cite web|last=Higginbotham|first=Peter|url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?MAB-Ambulances/MAB-Ambulances.shtml|title=The MAB Land Ambulance Service|date=October 2005|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Workhouses Information|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914024956/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?MAB-Ambulances%2FMAB-Ambulances.shtml|archivedate=2007-09-14}}</ref>\n\n== Dedicated services begin ==\nIn 1880, the President of the [[Liverpool Medical Institution]], [[Reginald Harrison]], suggested a horse-drawn ambulance for the city.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ambulance in Civil Life: Being An Address Delivered at the Liverpool Medical Society, 6 October 1881|last=Harrison|first=Reginald|publisher=John Bale|year=1902|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-YtlthqHmHsC&pg=PA355|title=The Ambulance: A History|last=Bell|first=Ryan Corbett|date=2009-01-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786438112|location=|pages=11\u201317|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> In 1884, this ambulance service was created based at the Liverpool Northern Hospital: it was the first in Britain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1908-03-07|title=REGINALD HARRISON, F.R.C.S.Eng|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/1/2462/601|journal=British Medical Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=2462|pages=601\u2013603|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2462.601|pmc=2436126|issn=0007-1447|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1887 the [[St John Ambulance Brigade]] was established to provide first aid and ambulance services at public events in London.<ref name=sja1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-history/industrial-revolution.aspx|title=St John Ambulance in the Industrial Revolution|publisher=St John Ambulance UK|accessdate=2007-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626032454/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-history/industrial-revolution.aspx|archive-date=2007-06-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was modelled on a military-style command and discipline structure.

In 1910 the Brigade began its first public duty at the Royal Dublin Society. During the 1916 rising and (after becoming the independent [[St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland]]) the 'Emergency' (World War II) the brigade acted as an ambulance service and remained so until the set up of Regional Ambulance Services.\n\nIn 1938 the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]] was set up in Galway. In the years since this voluntary service has gone from strength to strength and is now Ireland's largest voluntary ambulance service and one of Ireland's largest charities.\n\nIn [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], military medic Seymour Warrian called a public meeting in Brisbane and established an ambulance service after witnessing an event at the Brisbane showgrounds during Show Week in 1892.<ref name=qab>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambulance.qld.gov.au/about/|title=History of Queensland Ambulance Service|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Queensland Ambulance Service}}</ref> A fallen rider, suffering a broken leg was walked off the field by well-meaning but misguided bystanders, worsening his injury. As a result of the meeting, the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade was formed on the 12 September.<ref name=qab/> The first [[ambulance station]] in Queensland operated out of the Brisbane Newspaper Company and officers on night duty slept on rolls of newspaper on the floor. They had a stretcher, but no vehicle and transported patients on foot, although in time, they gained horse-drawn stretchers and eventually vehicles. A year after the establishment of the Brisbane centre, another was established in Charters Towers in north Queensland, growing to over 90 community controlled ambulance centres. In 1991 the independent QATB centres amalgamated to form the Queensland Ambulance Service which is now the fourth largest ambulance service in the world.<ref name=qab/>\n\n== Mass transit use for emergency medical provision ==\n\nIn the late 19th century cities, including [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]] and [[St Louis]], [[Missouri]], [[United States]] started using trolley cars on their [[tram]] network which were designed to act as ambulances, transporting the sick and injured. The trolley cars in Bahia included a fumigating compartment and a two-bed nurses work area. The design of the tram network in St Louis was such that the ambulance streetcar, introduced in 1894 was able to reach all 16 infirmaries in the city.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nIn Germany, in 1902, a civilian ambulance train was introduced (building on the use of trains during military conflict) for use during railway accidents. It housed a mobile operating room and eight stretchers. Railroad employed surgeons lived near the railway station where the ambulance train was stationed, and were summoned to urgently attend in the event of an emergency. This train had priority over the tracks, with all other trains obliged to give way.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\n== Introduction of motor units ==\n[[File:DFVAC 1948 Cadillac Miller Meteor front passenger quarter.jpg|thumb|A 1948 Cadillac [[Miller-Meteor|Meteor]] ambulance]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[automobile]] was being developed, and started to be introduced alongside horse-drawn models; early 20th-century ambulances were powered by [[steam]], [[gasoline]], and [[electricity]], reflecting the competing automotive technologies then in existence. However, the first motor-powered ambulance was brought into service in the last year of the 19th century, with the [[Michael Reese Hospital]], [[Chicago]], taking delivery of the first automobile ambulance, donated in February 1899 by 500 prominent local businessmen.<ref name=Ambulance/> This was followed in 1900, by New York City, which extolled its virtues of greater speed, more safety for the patient, faster stopping and a smoother ride. These first two automobile ambulances were electrically powered with {{convert|2|hp}} motors on the rear axle.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe first gasoline-powered ambulance was the Palliser Ambulance, introduced in 1905, and named for Capt. [[John Palliser]] of the Canadian Militia. This three-wheeled vehicle (one at the front, two at the rear) was designed for use on the battlefield, under enemy fire. It was a heavy tractor unit, cased in bulletproof steel sheets. These steel shields opened outwards to provide a small area of cover from fire (nine feet wide by {{convert|7|ft|m}} high) for the ambulance staff when the vehicle was stationary.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe British Army followed quickly behind the Canadians in introducing a limited number of automobile ambulances. In 1905, the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] commissioned a number of [[Straker-Squire]] motor ambulance vans. They were based on a double-decker bus manufactured by the same company, although on a shorter wheelbase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steamtraction.com/archive/5090/|title=The Straker-Squire 1905 Ambulance|accessdate=2007-06-05|publisher=Steam Traction}}</ref> A number of them were based in Oxfordshire, serving several major encampments in the area.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe first mass-production automobile-based ambulance (rather than one-off models) was produced in the United States in 1909 by the [[James Cunningham, Son & Company]] of [[Rochester, New York]], a manufacturer of carriages and hearses. This ambulance, named the ''Model 774 Automobile Ambulance'', featured a proprietary {{convert|32|hp}}, 4-cylinder [[internal combustion]] engine. The chassis rode on pneumatic tires, while the body featured electric lights, a suspended cot with two attendant seats, and a side-mounted gong.<ref>McCall, Walter MP. 2002. \"The American Ambulance\", ''Iconografix''</ref>\n\n== World War I ==\n\nDuring World War One, the Red Cross brought in the first widespread battlefield motor ambulances to replace horse-drawn vehicles, a change which was such a success, the horse-drawn variants were quickly phased out. In civilian emergency care, dedicated ambulance services were frequently managed or dispatched by individual [[hospital]]s, though in some areas, [[telegraph]] and [[telephone]] services enabled [[police]] departments to handle dispatch duties.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" />\n\nThe equipment carried by the ambulance was changing fast at this time. Traction splints were introduced during [[World War I]], and were found to have a positive effect on the [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] of patients with leg fractures. [[Two-way radio]]s became available shortly after World War I, providing more efficient radio [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] of ambulances. Shortly before [[World War II]], then, a modern ambulance carried advanced medical equipment, was staffed by a [[physician]], and was dispatched by radio. It was frequently found that ambulances were [[hearse]]s \u2013 the only available vehicle that could carry a recumbent patient \u2013 and were thus frequently run by [[funeral home]]s. These vehicles which could serve for either purpose were known as [[combination car]]s.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-meteor.com/history.asp |title=Miller-Meteor History |accessdate=2007-06-02 |publisher=Miller Meteor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314002150/http://www.miller-meteor.com/history.asp |archivedate=2007-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Air ambulances ==\n\n[[File:Flying doctor Alice Springs 1954.jpg|thumb|Australian Flying Doctor Service vehicles in 1954]]\n\nDuring World War One, aviation moved from experimentation to a powerful military force, and following the war, with a surplus of aircraft in circulation, new uses were found for the aircraft. This included the conversion of planes throughout the world into ambulance planes. Although in 1917, Lieutenant Clifford Peel, a medical student, outlined a system of [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and ground facilities designed to provide medical services to the [[Australia]]n [[Outback]]; the first custom-built air ambulances did not come into existence until the late 1920s. These ideas became reality under the guidance of the Very Reverend [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]] in 1928 when the [[Australian Inland Mission]] service established the Aerial <!--Note: proper name is \"Aerial\", because it was founded in Australia--> Medical Service, a one-year experimental program. Physicians in this program had several responsibilities, one of which was to fly out to a patient, treat the patient, and fly the patient to a hospital if the physician could not deliver adequate care on scene. Eventually, this experiment became the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]].<ref name=Flying>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingdoctor.net/|title=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612073357/http://www.flyingdoctor.net/|archive-date=2007-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== World War II ==\n[[File:Phaenomen granit 30.JPG|thumb|A German ambulance of the World War II era]]\n\nIn much of the world, ambulance quality fell sharply during the Second World War, as physicians, needed by the armed services, were pulled off ambulances. In the [[United Kingdom]], during the [[Battle of Britain]], the need for ambulances was so great that vans were commandeered and pressed into service, often carrying several victims at once. Following the war, physicians would continue to ride ambulances in some countries, but not in others. Other vehicles, including civilian and [[police car]]s were pressed into service to transport patients due to a lack of a dedicated resource.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref>King, Dean. ''Patrick O'Brian: a Life''. ''Owl Books''. 2001 @ p. 81</ref>\nMilitary ambulances such as the [[Austin K2/Y]] were used both in the combat areas and on the [[Home Front]]. The American Dodge 3/4-ton [[WC-54]] became the standard allied ambulance in front-line units.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  The [[Dodge WC series|Dodge 1/2 ton 9 18 27]] became standard around bases overseas and in the States.  They also saw combat in Africa and through parts of Europe and the Pacific.\n\n== The Korean War ==\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], the newly created [[United States Air Force]] produced a number of air-ambulance units for use in forward operating medical units, using helicopters for rapid evacuation of patients. The [[H-13 Sioux]] helicopter, made famous by the film and television versions of ''[[M*A*S*H]]'', transported 18,000 wounded soldiers during the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olive-drab.com/od_medical_evac_helio_korea.php|publisher=olive-drab.com|title=Medical Evacuation in the Korean War}}</ref> The work of the Medical Air Evacuation Squadrons was a success and was repeated by U.S. forces in Vietnam. The use of helicopters for emergency medical evacuations extended to civilian practice by groups such as the [[Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society]].\n\n== Move to on-scene care ==\n[[File:StratfordPd64.jpg|thumb|A 1964 police cruiser, which is also fitted to transport patients]]\n\nAfter the [[Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash]] in 1952, ambulances in Britain were restructured to be a \"mobile hospital\", rather than just transporting patients, thus leading to modern ambulances. [[CPR]] was developed and accepted as the standard of care for out-of-hospital [[cardiac arrest]]; [[defibrillation]], based in part on an increased understanding of heart arrhythmias, was introduced, as were new [[pharmaceutical]]s to be used in cardiac arrest situations; in [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]], a mobile coronary care ambulance successfully resuscitated patients using these technologies;<ref name=Ambulance/> and well-developed studies demonstrated the need for overhauling ambulance services. These studies placed pressure on governments to improve emergency care in general, including the care provided by ambulance services. Part of the result was the creation of [[Standardization|standard]]s in ambulance construction concerning the internal height of the patient care area (to allow for an attendant to continue to care for the patient during transport), and in the equipment (and thus weight) that an ambulance had to carry.\n\n[[File:DFVAC 1970s Cadillac Miller Meteor color.jpg|thumb|left|A 1973 [[Cadillac]] [[Miller-Meteor#Miller-Meteor|Miller-Meteor]] ambulance.

High-topped car-based ambulances were developed, but car chassis proved unable to accept the weight and other demands of the new standards; [[van]] (and later, light [[truck]]) chassis would have to be used instead.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref name=\"White_Paper\" />  The early van-based ambulances looked very similar to their civilian counterparts, having been given a limited amount of [[emergency vehicle equipment]] such as audible and visual warnings, and the internal fittings for carrying medical equipment, most notably a [[stretcher]].  As time went on, ambulances matured in parallel to the newly developed [[Emergency medical services|EMS]], gaining the capacity to carry additional equipment (both portable and permanently installed) as [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s and [[paramedic]]s added this equipment to their arsenal.  Ambulance design also evolved to reflect the [[ergonomics]] and other [[human factors]] of emergency medical care (for instance, raising the roof higher than typical for a van).  Advances in the technology and understanding of emergency vehicle equipment also continued to influence ambulance design, just as it did for police and fire-suppression vehicles.\n\n== Modern vehicles ==\n[[File:MDA Armoured Ambulance.jpg|thumb|[[Magen David Adom|Israeli EMS]]'s contemporary civilian armored mobile intensive care unit. Used for response to difficult situations, it incorporates a customized rear compartment on a super-duty [[Ford E-Series#E-Series|Ford E-450]] chassis]]\n\nModern ambulances are now often custom-built, and as well as the specialist medical equipment now built into the ambulances, industry-wide improvements in vehicle design have had an impact, including improvements in audible and visual warning equipment to help protect crews in vulnerable situations (such as at a road traffic collision), and general improvements such as [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], which are particularly valuable for ambulances, due to the speeds reached and the weight carried. There have also been improvements to help safeguard the health and welfare of ambulance crews, such as the addition of patient [[tail lift]]s, ramps and winches,<ref name=tail>{{cite web|url=http://www.rossandbonnyman.co.uk/specialist-lifts.html#aa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701055836/http://www.rossandbonnyman.co.uk/specialist-lifts.html#aa|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-07-01|title=Ambulance Lifts|publisher=Ross and Bonnyman|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> to cut down on the amount of manual handling a crew must perform.\n\nAmbulance design is still evolving, largely due to the growing skills and role of [[paramedic]]s and other ambulance crew, which require specialist equipment. Other factors driving improvement include the need to help protect ambulance crews from common accidents, such as traffic collisions and rarer, but potentially catastrophic incidents such as terrorist activities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dodge WC54]]\n* [[Combat medic]]\n* [[Ambulance]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180921124235/http://www.paramedic-community.com/ahsv/ Ambulance Historical Society Victoria website]\n\n{{Emergency medical services}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Ambulance}}\n[[Category:Ambulances]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Ford-field-ambulance.jpg|thumb|300px|Ford 1916 [[Model T]] Field Ambulance.

[[Edward Dalton]], a former surgeon in the [[Union Army]], was charged with creating a hospital in lower New York; he started an ambulance service to bring the patients to the hospital faster and in more comfort, a service which started in 1869. These ambulances carried medical equipment, such as splints, a stomach pump, [[morphine]], and [[brandy]], reflecting contemporary medicine. Dalton believed that speed was of the essence, and at first the horses were kept in harness while awaiting a call: within a few months this practice had been replaced with a 'drop,' or 'snap,' [[Horse harness|harness]] arrangement, whereby the tack was lowered by pulley from the ceiling straight onto the horse: under either scheme, ambulances were ready to go within 30&nbsp;seconds of being called.<ref name=ambhist>The Ambulance: A History. Ryan Corbett Bell. McFarland & Co., 2009 ({{ISBN|978-0786438112}})</ref> The service was very popular and grew rapidly, with the year 1870 seeing the ambulances attend 1401 emergency calls, but twenty-one years later, this had more than tripled to 4392.<ref name=Ambulance/> For the first week of their operation, the ambulances were crewed by the hospital's house-staff, after which the hospital hired Drs. Duncan Lee and Robert Taylor as full-time ambulance surgeons; going forward, the plan was to crew the ambulances with fresh graduates of Bellevue's surgical training program, who would serve for six-month terms and be replaced by new hires from successive graduating classes.<ref name=ambhist/>  This scheme foundered immediately, however, when graduates balked at the schedule and the salary offered: $50 a month, twelve-hour shifts, and one day off every four weeks. Instead, by the end of 1869, the system of staffing the ambulance with residents in training (who could simply be assigned, rather than having to be recruited) was firmly established. As late as 1935, these interns were earning the same $50 a month their grandfathers had received.<ref name=ambhist/>\n\nIn 1867, the city of [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]], in the [[United Kingdom]], received six horse-drawn ambulances for the purpose of conveying [[smallpox]] and fever patients from their homes to a hospital. These ambulances were designed to resemble private carriages, but were equipped with rollers in their floors and large rear doors to allow for a patient, lying on a specially designed bed, to be easily loaded. Space was provided for an attendant to ride with the patient, and the entire patient compartment was designed to be easily cleaned and decontaminated. Anyone willing to pay the cost of horse hire could summon the ambulance by telegram or in person.<ref>{{cite web|last=Higginbotham|first=Peter|url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?MAB-Ambulances/MAB-Ambulances.shtml|title=The MAB Land Ambulance Service|date=October 2005|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Workhouses Information|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914024956/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?MAB-Ambulances%2FMAB-Ambulances.shtml|archivedate=2007-09-14}}</ref>\n\n== Dedicated services begin ==\nIn 1880, the President of the [[Liverpool Medical Institution]], [[Reginald Harrison]], suggested a horse-drawn ambulance for the city.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ambulance in Civil Life: Being An Address Delivered at the Liverpool Medical Society, 6 October 1881|last=Harrison|first=Reginald|publisher=John Bale|year=1902|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-YtlthqHmHsC&pg=PA355|title=The Ambulance: A History|last=Bell|first=Ryan Corbett|date=2009-01-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786438112|location=|pages=11\u201317|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> In 1884, this ambulance service was created based at the Liverpool Northern Hospital: it was the first in Britain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1908-03-07|title=REGINALD HARRISON, F.R.C.S.Eng|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/1/2462/601|journal=British Medical Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=2462|pages=601\u2013603|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2462.601|pmc=2436126|issn=0007-1447|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1887 the [[St John Ambulance Brigade]] was established to provide first aid and ambulance services at public events in London.<ref name=sja1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-history/industrial-revolution.aspx|title=St John Ambulance in the Industrial Revolution|publisher=St John Ambulance UK|accessdate=2007-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626032454/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-history/industrial-revolution.aspx|archive-date=2007-06-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was modelled on a military-style command and discipline structure.

In 1910 the Brigade began its first public duty at the Royal Dublin Society. During the 1916 rising and (after becoming the independent [[St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland]]) the 'Emergency' (World War II) the brigade acted as an ambulance service and remained so until the set up of Regional Ambulance Services.\n\nIn 1938 the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]] was set up in Galway. In the years since this voluntary service has gone from strength to strength and is now Ireland's largest voluntary ambulance service and one of Ireland's largest charities.\n\nIn [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], military medic Seymour Warrian called a public meeting in Brisbane and established an ambulance service after witnessing an event at the Brisbane showgrounds during Show Week in 1892.<ref name=qab>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambulance.qld.gov.au/about/|title=History of Queensland Ambulance Service|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Queensland Ambulance Service}}</ref> A fallen rider, suffering a broken leg was walked off the field by well-meaning but misguided bystanders, worsening his injury. As a result of the meeting, the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade was formed on the 12 September.<ref name=qab/> The first [[ambulance station]] in Queensland operated out of the Brisbane Newspaper Company and officers on night duty slept on rolls of newspaper on the floor. They had a stretcher, but no vehicle and transported patients on foot, although in time, they gained horse-drawn stretchers and eventually vehicles. A year after the establishment of the Brisbane centre, another was established in Charters Towers in north Queensland, growing to over 90 community controlled ambulance centres. In 1991 the independent QATB centres amalgamated to form the Queensland Ambulance Service which is now the fourth largest ambulance service in the world.<ref name=qab/>\n\n== Mass transit use for emergency medical provision ==\n\nIn the late 19th century cities, including [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]] and [[St Louis]], [[Missouri]], [[United States]] started using trolley cars on their [[tram]] network which were designed to act as ambulances, transporting the sick and injured. The trolley cars in Bahia included a fumigating compartment and a two bed nurses work area. The design of the tram network in St Louis was such that the ambulance streetcar, introduced in 1894 was able to reach all 16 infirmaries in the city.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nIn Germany, in 1902, a civilian ambulance train was introduced (building on the use of trains during military conflict) for use during railway accidents. It housed a mobile operating room and eight stretchers. Railroad employed surgeons lived near the railway station where the ambulance train was stationed, and were summoned to urgently attend in the event of an emergency. This train had priority over the tracks, with all other trains obliged to give way.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\n== Introduction of motor units ==\n[[File:DFVAC 1948 Cadillac Miller Meteor front passenger quarter.jpg|thumb|A 1948 Cadillac [[Miller-Meteor|Meteor]] ambulance]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[automobile]] was being developed, and started to be introduced alongside horse-drawn models; early 20th-century ambulances were powered by [[steam]], [[gasoline]], and [[electricity]], reflecting the competing automotive technologies then in existence. However, the first motor-powered ambulance was brought into service in the last year of the 19th century, with the [[Michael Reese Hospital]], [[Chicago]], taking delivery of the first automobile ambulance, donated in February 1899 by 500 prominent local businessmen.<ref name=Ambulance/> This was followed in 1900, by New York City, which extolled its virtues of greater speed, more safety for the patient, faster stopping and a smoother ride. These first two automobile ambulances were electrically powered with {{convert|2|hp}} motors on the rear axle.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe first gasoline-powered ambulance was the Palliser Ambulance, introduced in 1905, and named for Capt. [[John Palliser]] of the Canadian Militia. This three-wheeled vehicle (one at the front, two at the rear) was designed for use on the battlefield, under enemy fire. It was a heavy tractor unit, cased in bulletproof steel sheets. These steel shields opened outwards to provide a small area of cover from fire (nine feet wide by {{convert|7|ft|m}} high) for the ambulance staff when the vehicle was stationary.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe British Army followed quickly behind the Canadians in introducing a limited number of automobile ambulances. In 1905, the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] commissioned a number of [[Straker-Squire]] motor ambulance vans. They were based on a double-decker bus manufactured by the same company, although on a shorter wheelbase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steamtraction.com/archive/5090/|title=The Straker-Squire 1905 Ambulance|accessdate=2007-06-05|publisher=Steam Traction}}</ref> A number of them were based in Oxfordshire, serving several major encampments in the area.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe first mass-production automobile-based ambulance (rather than one-off models) was produced in the United States in 1909 by the [[James Cunningham, Son & Company]] of [[Rochester, New York]], a manufacturer of carriages and hearses. This ambulance, named the ''Model 774 Automobile Ambulance'', featured a proprietary {{convert|32|hp}}, 4-cylinder [[internal combustion]] engine. The chassis rode on pneumatic tires, while the body featured electric lights, a suspended cot with two attendant seats, and a side-mounted gong.<ref>McCall, Walter MP. 2002. \"The American Ambulance\", ''Iconografix''</ref>\n\n== World War I ==\n\nDuring World War One, the Red Cross brought in the first widespread battlefield motor ambulances to replace horse-drawn vehicles, a change which was such a success, the horse-drawn variants were quickly phased out. In civilian emergency care, dedicated ambulance services were frequently managed or dispatched by individual [[hospital]]s, though in some areas, [[telegraph]] and [[telephone]] services enabled [[police]] departments to handle dispatch duties.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" />\n\nThe equipment carried by the ambulance was changing fast at this time. Traction splints were introduced during [[World War I]], and were found to have a positive effect on the [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] of patients with leg fractures. [[Two-way radio]]s became available shortly after World War I, providing more efficient radio [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] of ambulances. Shortly before [[World War II]], then, a modern ambulance carried advanced medical equipment, was staffed by a [[physician]], and was dispatched by radio. It was frequently found that ambulances were [[hearse]]s \u2013 the only available vehicle that could carry a recumbent patient \u2013 and were thus frequently run by [[funeral home]]s. These vehicles which could serve for either purpose were known as [[combination car]]s.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-meteor.com/history.asp |title=Miller-Meteor History |accessdate=2007-06-02 |publisher=Miller Meteor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314002150/http://www.miller-meteor.com/history.asp |archivedate=2007-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Air ambulances ==\n\n[[File:Flying doctor Alice Springs 1954.jpg|thumb|Australian Flying Doctor Service vehicles in 1954]]\n\nDuring World War One, aviation moved from experimentation to a powerful military force, and following the war, with a surplus of aircraft in circulation, new uses were found for the aircraft. This included the conversion of planes throughout the world into ambulance planes. Although in 1917, Lieutenant Clifford Peel, a medical student, outlined a system of [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and ground facilities designed to provide medical services to the [[Australia]]n [[Outback]]; the first custom-built air ambulances did not come into existence until the late 1920s. These ideas became reality under the guidance of the Very Reverend [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]] in 1928 when the [[Australian Inland Mission]] service established the Aerial <!--Note: proper name is \"Aerial\", because it was founded in Australia--> Medical Service, a one-year experimental program. Physicians in this program had several responsibilities, one of which was to fly out to a patient, treat the patient, and fly the patient to a hospital if the physician could not deliver adequate care on scene. Eventually, this experiment became the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]].<ref name=Flying>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingdoctor.net/|title=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612073357/http://www.flyingdoctor.net/|archive-date=2007-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== World War II ==\n[[File:Phaenomen granit 30.JPG|thumb|A German ambulance of the World War II era]]\n\nIn much of the world, ambulance quality fell sharply during the Second World War, as physicians, needed by the armed services, were pulled off ambulances. In the [[United Kingdom]], during the [[Battle of Britain]], the need for ambulances was so great that vans were commandeered and pressed into service, often carrying several victims at once. Following the war, physicians would continue to ride ambulances in some countries, but not in others. Other vehicles, including civilian and [[police car]]s were pressed into service to transport patients due to a lack of a dedicated resource.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref>King, Dean. ''Patrick O'Brian: a Life''. ''Owl Books''. 2001 @ p. 81</ref>\nMilitary ambulances such as the [[Austin K2/Y]] were used both in the combat areas and on the [[Home Front]]. The American Dodge 3/4-ton [[WC-54]] became the standard allied ambulance in front-line units.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  The [[Dodge WC series|Dodge 1/2 ton 9 18 27]] became standard around bases overseas and in the States.  They also saw combat in Africa and through parts of Europe and the Pacific.\n\n== The Korean War ==\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], the newly created [[United States Air Force]] produced a number of air-ambulance units for use in forward operating medical units, using helicopters for rapid evacuation of patients. The [[H-13 Sioux]] helicopter, made famous by the film and television versions of ''[[M*A*S*H]]'', transported 18,000 wounded soldiers during the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olive-drab.com/od_medical_evac_helio_korea.php|publisher=olive-drab.com|title=Medical Evacuation in the Korean War}}</ref> The work of the Medical Air Evacuation Squadrons was a success and was repeated by U.S. forces in Vietnam. The use of helicopters for emergency medical evacuations extended to civilian practice by groups such as the [[Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society]].\n\n== Move to on-scene care ==\n[[File:StratfordPd64.jpg|thumb|A 1964 police cruiser, which is also fitted to transport patients]]\n\nAfter the [[Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash]] in 1952, ambulances in Britain were restructured to be a \"mobile hospital\", rather than just transporting patients, thus leading to modern ambulances. [[CPR]] was developed and accepted as the standard of care for out-of-hospital [[cardiac arrest]]; [[defibrillation]], based in part on an increased understanding of heart arrhythmias, was introduced, as were new [[pharmaceutical]]s to be used in cardiac arrest situations; in [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]], a mobile coronary care ambulance successfully resuscitated patients using these technologies;<ref name=Ambulance/> and well-developed studies demonstrated the need for overhauling ambulance services. These studies placed pressure on governments to improve emergency care in general, including the care provided by ambulance services. Part of the result was the creation of [[Standardization|standard]]s in ambulance construction concerning the internal height of the patient care area (to allow for an attendant to continue to care for the patient during transport), and in the equipment (and thus weight) that an ambulance had to carry.\n\n[[File:DFVAC 1970s Cadillac Miller Meteor color.jpg|thumb|left|A 1973 [[Cadillac]] [[Miller-Meteor#Miller-Meteor|Miller-Meteor]] ambulance.

High-topped car-based ambulances were developed, but car chassis proved unable to accept the weight and other demands of the new standards; [[van]] (and later, light [[truck]]) chassis would have to be used instead.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref name=\"White_Paper\" />  The early van-based ambulances looked very similar to their civilian counterparts, having been given a limited amount of [[emergency vehicle equipment]] such as audible and visual warnings, and the internal fittings for carrying medical equipment, most notably a [[stretcher]].  As time went on, ambulances matured in parallel to the newly developed [[Emergency medical services|EMS]], gaining the capacity to carry additional equipment (both portable and permanently installed) as [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s and [[paramedic]]s added this equipment to their arsenal.  Ambulance design also evolved to reflect the [[ergonomics]] and other [[human factors]] of emergency medical care (for instance, raising the roof higher than typical for a van).  Advances in the technology and understanding of emergency vehicle equipment also continued to influence ambulance design, just as it did for police and fire-suppression vehicles.\n\n== Modern vehicles ==\n[[File:MDA Armoured Ambulance.jpg|thumb|[[Magen David Adom|Israeli EMS]]'s contemporary civilian armored mobile intensive care unit. Used for response to difficult situations, it incorporates a customized rear compartment on a super-duty [[Ford E-Series#E-Series|Ford E-450]] chassis]]\n\nModern ambulances are now often custom-built, and as well as the specialist medical equipment now built into the ambulances, industry-wide improvements in vehicle design have had an impact, including improvements in audible and visual warning equipment to help protect crews in vulnerable situations (such as at a road traffic collision), and general improvements such as [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], which are particularly valuable for ambulances, due to the speeds reached and the weight carried. There have also been improvements to help safeguard the health and welfare of ambulance crews, such as the addition of patient [[tail lift]]s, ramps and winches,<ref name=tail>{{cite web|url=http://www.rossandbonnyman.co.uk/specialist-lifts.html#aa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701055836/http://www.rossandbonnyman.co.uk/specialist-lifts.html#aa|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-07-01|title=Ambulance Lifts|publisher=Ross and Bonnyman|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> to cut down on the amount of manual handling a crew must perform.\n\nAmbulance design is still evolving, largely due to the growing skills and role of [[paramedic]]s and other ambulance crew, which require specialist equipment. Other factors driving improvement include the need to help protect ambulance crews from common accidents, such as traffic collisions and rarer, but potentially catastrophic incidents such as terrorist activities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dodge WC54]]\n* [[Combat medic]]\n* [[Ambulance]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180921124235/http://www.paramedic-community.com/ahsv/ Ambulance Historical Society Victoria website]\n\n{{Emergency medical services}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Ambulance}}\n[[Category:Ambulances]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMass transit use for emergency medical provision:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: two bed \u2192 two-bed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_ambulance"}

It used most of the same administrative divisions as the [[Qing Dynasty]] but divided [[Inner Mongolia]] into four provinces and set up several [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|municipalities under the authority of the Executive Yuan]]. After the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, [[Manchuria]] was reincorporated into the Republic of China as nine provinces. [[Taiwan]] and the [[Pescadores]] were also acquired by the Republic of China and organized into [[Taiwan Province]] after [[Retrocession Day]]. By this time the top-level divisions consisted of 35 [[provinces]], 12 [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|Yuan-controlled municipalities]], one [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]] and two regions ([[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet Area, Republic of China|Tibet]]). After the central government's withdrawal from [[mainland China]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and subsequent relocation to [[Taiwan]] in 1949, the jurisdiction of the ROC was restricted to only [[Taiwan]], the [[Pescadores]], [[Hainan]], and a few offshore islands of [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fukien]] and [[Chekiang Province, Republic of China|Chekiang]]. Hainan fell to the Communists in May 1950 and Chekiang was lost to the Communists in 1955. The remaining area is called the \"[[Free Area of the Republic of China]]\" in the Constitution. In most ordinary legislation, the term \"Taiwan Area\" is used in place of the \"Free Area\", while Mainland China is referred to as the \"Mainland Area\".\n\n==Beiyang Government (1912\u201328) ==\n{{main|Beiyang Government}}\n{|\n|[[File:China in 1911.svg|thumb|250px|Provinces and areas of the Republic of China in 1912.]]\n|[[File:China old map.jpg|thumb|265px|Map of the Republic of China

The jurisdiction of the Republic was restricted to [[Taiwan]], the [[Pescadores]], and a few islands off [[Fujian]], but the Republic of China has never retracted its claim to mainland China or Mongolia. Accordingly, the official first-order divisions of Republic of China remain the historical divisions of China immediately prior to the loss of mainland China and maps of [[China]] and the world published in Taiwan sometimes show provincial and national boundaries as they were in 1949, ignoring changes made by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist government]] and including [[outer Mongolia|Mongolia]], northern [[Burma]] (northern [[Kachin state]]), and [[Tannu Uriankhai]] as part of the Republic. Maps and list of administrative divisions covering above places were published until 2005.\n\nIn 2005, the nominal political divisions of the Republic were 35 [[provinces of China|provinces]], 1 [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]], 2 regions, 14 [[special municipality (Republic of China)|special municipalities]] (adding [[Taipei]] and [[Kaohsiung]] to the original list), 14 leagues, and 4 special banners. For second-order divisions, under provinces and special administrative regions, there are counties, province-controlled cities (56), bureaus (34) and management bureaus (7). Under provincial-level municipalities there are districts, and under leagues there are banners (127).\n\n* Provinces (\u7701, ''sh\u011bng'') and [[special municipality (Taiwan)|Special municipalities]] (\u76f4\u8f44\u5e02, ''zh\u00edxi\u00e1sh\u00ec'')\n* [[County (Taiwan)|Counties]] (\u7e23, ''xi\u00e0n'') and [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|Cities]] (\u5e02, ''sh\u00ec'')\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background: #ffff99;\" | '''Changes made to Province-level divisions of the Republic of China between 1949 and 2005'''\n|-\n!Name!![[Traditional Chinese|Traditional<br>Chinese]]!![[Pinyin]]!!Abbreviation!!Capital!!Capital in Chinese!!rowspan=16| !!width=450|Notes\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffff99;\" |'''Provinces'''\n|-\n|[[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]]||\u798f\u5efa||F\u00faji\u00e0n||\u95a9 m\u01d0n||[[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng Township]]||\u91d1\u57ce\u93ae\n|The capital of Fukien Province was moved to [[Xindian District|Xindian]] in 1956, and moved to [[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng Township]], [[Kinmen]] since 1996.\n|-\n|[[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]||\u81fa\u7063||T\u00e1iw\u0101n||\u81fa t\u00e1i||[[Zhongxing New Village]]||\u4e2d\u8208\u65b0\u6751\n|The capital of Taiwan Province was moved to [[Zhongxing Village]] in [[Nantou County]] from [[Taipei]] in the 1960s.\n|-\n|[[Jiangsu|Kiangsu]]||\u6c5f\u8607||Ji\u0101ngs\u016b||\u8607 s\u016b||[[Shengsi County]]||\u5d4a\u6cd7\u7e23 \n|The government of Kiangsu Province was moved to Shengsi County in 1949.

It used most of the same administrative divisions as the [[Qing Dynasty]] but divided [[Inner Mongolia]] into four provinces and set up several [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|municipalities under the authority of the Executive Yuan]]. After the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, [[Manchuria]] was reincorporated into the Republic of China as nine provinces. [[Taiwan]] and the [[Pescadores]] were also acquired by the Republic of China and organized into [[Taiwan Province]] after [[Retrocession Day]]. By this time the top-level divisions consisted of 35 [[provinces]], 12 [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|Yuan-controlled municipalities]], one [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]] and two regions ([[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet Area, Republic of China|Tibet]]). After the central government's withdrawal from [[mainland China]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and subsequent relocation to [[Taiwan]] in 1949, the jurisdiction of the ROC was restricted to only [[Taiwan]], the [[Pescadores]], [[Hainan]], and a few offshore islands of [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fukien]] and [[Chekiang Province, Republic of China|Chekiang]]. Hainan fell to the Communists in May 1950 and Chekiang was lost to the Communists in 1955. The remaining area is called the \"[[Free Area of the Republic of China]]\" in the Constitution. In most ordinary legislation, the term \"Taiwan Area\" is used in place of the \"Free Area\", while Mainland China is referred to as the \"Mainland Area\".\n\n==Beiyang Government (1912\u201328) ==\n{{main|Beiyang Government}}\n{|\n|[[File:China in 1911.svg|thumb|250px|Provinces and areas of the Republic of China in 1912.]]\n|[[File:China old map.jpg|thumb|265px|Map of the Republic of China

The jurisdiction of the Republic was restricted to [[Taiwan]], the [[Pescadores]], and a few islands off [[Fujian]], but the Republic of China has never retracted its claim to mainland China or Mongolia. Accordingly, the official first-order divisions of Republic of China remain the historical divisions of China immediately prior to the loss of mainland China and maps of [[China]] and the world published in Taiwan sometimes show provincial and national boundaries as they were in 1949, ignoring changes made by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist government]] and including [[outer Mongolia|Mongolia]], northern [[Burma]] (northern [[Kachin state]]), and [[Tannu Uriankhai]] as part of the Republic. Maps and list of administrative divisions covering above places were published until 2005.\n\nIn 2005, the nominal political divisions of the Republic were 35 [[provinces of China|provinces]], 1 [[Special administrative regions of China#ROC special administrative regions|special administrative region]], 2 regions, 14 [[special municipality (Republic of China)|special municipalities]] (adding [[Taipei]] and [[Kaohsiung]] to the original list), 14 leagues, and 4 special banners. For second-order divisions, under provinces and special administrative regions, there are counties, province-controlled cities (56), bureaus (34) and management bureaus (7). Under provincial-level municipalities there are districts, and under leagues there are banners (127).\n\n* Provinces (\u7701, ''sh\u011bng'') and [[special municipality (Taiwan)|Special municipalities]] (\u76f4\u8f44\u5e02, ''zh\u00edxi\u00e1sh\u00ec'')\n* [[County (Taiwan)|Counties]] (\u7e23, ''xi\u00e0n'') and [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|Cities]] (\u5e02, ''sh\u00ec'')\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background: #ffff99;\" | '''Changes made to Province-level divisions of the Republic of China between 1949 and 2005'''\n|-\n!Name!![[Traditional Chinese|Traditional<br>Chinese]]!![[Pinyin]]!!Abbreviation!!Capital!!Capital in Chinese!!rowspan=16| !!width=450|Notes\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" style=\"background: #ffff99;\" |'''Provinces'''\n|-\n|[[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]]||\u798f\u5efa||F\u00faji\u00e0n||\u95a9 m\u01d0n||[[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng Township]]||\u91d1\u57ce\u93ae\n|The capital of Fukien Province was moved to [[Xindian District|Xindian]] in 1956, and moved to [[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng Township]], [[Kinmen]] since 1996.\n|-\n|[[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]||\u81fa\u7063||T\u00e1iw\u0101n||\u81fa t\u00e1i||[[Zhongxing New Village]]||\u4e2d\u8208\u65b0\u6751\n|The capital of Taiwan Province was moved to [[Zhongxing Village]] in [[Nantou County]] from [[Taipei]] in the 1960s.\n|-\n|[[Jiangsu|Kiangsu]]||\u6c5f\u8607||Ji\u0101ngs\u016b||\u8607 s\u016b||[[Shengsi County]]||\u5d4a\u6cd7\u7e23 \n|The government of Kiangsu Province was moved to Shengsi County in 1949.

The Tolkien family originated in the [[East Prussia]]n town [[Kreuzburg, East Prussia|Kreuzburg]] near [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], which was founded during medieval [[German eastward expansion]], where his earliest-known paternal ancestor Michel Tolkien was born around 1620. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663\u20131746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg. His son Christian Tolkien (1706\u20131791) moved from Kreuzburg to nearby [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]], and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747\u20131813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) emigrated to London in the 1770s and became the ancestors of the English family; the younger brother was J. R. R. Tolkien's second great-grandfather. In 1792 John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Other German relatives also joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as J. R. R.

For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.\n\nIn 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter,<ref name=Letters306 /> noting that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s journey across the [[Misty Mountains]] (\"including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods\") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from [[Interlaken]] to [[Lauterbrunnen]] and on to camp in the [[moraine]]s <!-- Tolkien spells \"morains\", but this is not a direct quote. Oxford English Dictionary offers standardized spelling of \"moraines\".--> beyond [[M\u00fcrren]]. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of [[Jungfrau]] and [[Silberhorn]], \"the Silvertine ([[Celebdil]]) of my dreams\". They went across the [[Kleine Scheidegg]] to [[Grindelwald]] and on across the [[Grosse Scheidegg]] to [[Meiringen]]. They continued across the [[Grimsel Pass]], through the upper [[Valais]] to [[Brig, Switzerland|Brig]] and on to the [[Aletsch glacier]] and [[Zermatt]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.valais-wallis-digital.ch/de/a/#!/explore/cards/173 |title=1911 \u2013 J.

According to Humphrey Carpenter,\n{{quote|Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ...

I don't regret my decision, though it was very hard on my lover. But it was not my fault. She was completely free and under no vow to me, and I should have had no just complaint (except according to the unreal romantic code) if she had got married to someone else. For very nearly ''three'' years I did not see or write to my lover. It was extremely hard, especially at first. The effects were not wholly good: I fell back into folly and slackness and misspent a good deal of my first year at college.<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" />}}\n\nOn the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at [[Cheltenham]]. He declared that he had never ceased to love her, and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. But Edith said she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.\n\nOn 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\".<ref>''Biography'', pp.&nbsp;67\u201369.</ref> Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, \"I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different.\"<ref>''The Tolkien Family Album'', (1992), page 34.</ref>\n\nFollowing their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence. Jessop, \"like many others of his age and class ... strongly [[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|anti-Catholic]]\", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.<ref>''Biography'', p.&nbsp;73.</ref>\n\nEdith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at [[St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick]], on 22 March 1916.<ref>''Biography'', p.&nbsp;86.</ref> In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" />\n\n=== First World War ===\nIn August 1914, Britain entered the [[First World War]]. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to volunteer immediately for the [[British Army]]. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled: \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" />\n\nInstead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\",<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" /> and entered a programme by which he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\".<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" /> He was commissioned as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] on 15 July 1915.<ref>''Biography'', pp.&nbsp;77\u201385.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29232|page=6968|date=16 July 1915}}</ref> He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on [[Cannock Chase]], [[Staffordshire]], for 11 months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained: \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\"<ref>''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&nbsp;94.</ref> Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp.\n\nOn 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to [[Folkestone]] for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in [[Edgbaston]], Birmingham.\n\nHe later wrote: \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then&nbsp;... it was like a death.\"<ref>Quoted in John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\n==== France ====\nOn 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to [[Calais]]. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s (BEF) base depot at [[\u00c9taples]]. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the [[74th Brigade (United Kingdom)|74th Brigade]], [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Division]].\n\nWhile waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled ''The Lonely Isle'', which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's [[postal censorship]], he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.<ref>Garth, John. ''Tolkien and the Great War'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin 2003, pp.&nbsp;144\u2013145.</ref>\n\nHe left \u00c9taples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at [[Rubempr\u00e9]], near [[Amiens]].<ref>Garth (2003), pages 147\u2013148.</ref> He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire.<ref>Garth (2003), pp.&nbsp;148\u2013149.</ref> According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol prohibited friendships with \"[[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]\". Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\"<ref name=\"Garth149\">Garth (2003), p.&nbsp;149.</ref>\n\nTolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"Garth149\" />\n\n==== Battle of the Somme ====\nTolkien arrived at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at [[Bouzincourt]], he participated in the assaults on the [[Schwaben Redoubt]] and the [[Leipzig salient]]. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, [[Anglican]] chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers:\n[[File:Schwaben Redoubt by William Orpen IWM Art.IWM ART 3000.jpg|thumb|right|''The Schwaben Redoubt'', painting by William Orpen.

We dossed down for the night in the hopes of getting some sleep, but it was not to be. We no sooner lay down than hordes of lice got up. So we went round to the Medical Officer, who was also in the dugout with his equipment, and he gave us some ointment which he assured us would keep the little brutes away. We anointed ourselves all over with the stuff and again lay down in great hopes, but it was not to be, because instead of discouraging them it seemed to act like a kind of ''[[hors d'oeuvre]]'' and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.<ref>Quoted in Garth (2003), p.&nbsp;200.</ref>}}\n\nOn 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked [[Regina Trench]], Tolkien contracted [[trench fever]], a disease carried by the [[lice]]. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.<ref>''Biography'', p.&nbsp;93.</ref> Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the [[first day of the Somme]] while leading his men in the assault on [[Beaumont Hamel]]. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.\n\n[[File:Lancashire Fusiliers trench Beaumont Hamel 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Men of the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers in a communication trench near [[Beaumont Hamel]], 1916.

Tolkien wrote that the experience taught him, \"a deep sympathy and feeling for the [[Tommy Atkins|Tommy]]; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties\". He remained profoundly grateful for the lesson. For a long time, he had been imprisoned in a tower, not of pearl, but of ivory.<ref>Garth (2003), pp.&nbsp;94\u201395.</ref>}}\n\nIn later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the [[Second World War]] were entirely mistaken:\n{{quote|One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.<ref>''The Lord of the Rings''.

Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated [[The Father Christmas Letters|letters from Father Christmas]] when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters.

It was visible in the small things, the almost absurd degree in which each worried about the other's health, and the care in which they chose and wrapped each other's birthday presents; and in the large matters, the way in which Ronald willingly abandoned such a large part of his life in retirement to give Edith the last years in Bournemouth that he felt she deserved, and the degree in which she showed pride in his fame as an author. A principal source of happiness to them was their shared love of their family. This bound them together until the end of their lives, and it was perhaps the strongest force in the marriage.

Such [[allegory]] is entirely foreign to my thought.\"<ref>''Letters'', no. 229.</ref>\n\n==== Opposition to National Socialism ====\nTolkien vocally opposed [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] before the [[Second World War]], and was known to especially despise [[Nazi]] racist and anti-semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house R\u00fctten & Loening Verlag was preparing to release ''The Hobbit'' in [[Nazi Germany]]. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] origin. In a letter to his British publisher [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], he condemned Nazi \"race-doctrine\" as \"wholly pernicious and unscientific\". He added that he had many [[Jewish]] friends and was considering \"letting a German translation go hang\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 29, to Stanley Unwin, 25 July 1938.</ref> He provided two letters to R\u00fctten & Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that \"[[Aryan]]\" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]]. He continued,{{quote|But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of ''Jewish'' origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have ''no'' ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject\u2014which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army.

In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:{{quote|We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes. Well, well,\u2014you and I can do nothing about it. And that [should] be a measure of the amount of guilt that can justly be assumed to attach to any member of a country who is not a member of its actual Government. Well the first War of the Machines seems to be drawing to its final inconclusive chapter\u2014leaving, alas, everyone the poorer, many bereaved or maimed and millions dead, and only one thing triumphant: the Machines.<ref>''Letters'', no. 96.</ref>}}\n\nHe also reacted with anger to the excesses of [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] propaganda during World War II. In an earlier, 1944 letter to Christopher, he wrote:{{quote|...it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don't know the difference between good and evil!

The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.<ref>''Letters'', no. 81.</ref>}}\n\nTolkien was horrified by the 1945 [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], referring to the scientists of the [[Manhattan Project]] as \"these lunatic physicists\" and \"[[Tower of Babel|Babel]]-builders\".<ref name=\"atom\">''Letters'', no. 102.</ref>\n\n=== Nature ===\nDuring most of his own life [[conservationism]] was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views\u2014except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.<ref>{{Cite book |title=J.

Neither are the tales. I do know Celtic things (many in their original languages Irish and Welsh), and feel for them a certain distaste: largely for their fundamental unreason.

B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]], [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]] and others had succeeded in linking in the public mind traditional Irish folk tales of fairies and elves to Irish national identity while denigrating English folk tales as being merely derivative of Irish folk tales.<ref name=\"Fimi\" /> This had prompted a backlash by English writers, leading to a savage war of words about which nation had the more authentic and better fairy tales with for example the English essayist [[G. K. Chesterton]] engaging in a series of polemical essays with Yeats over the question of the superiority of Irish vs. English fairy tales.<ref name=\"Fimi\" /> Even though there is nothing innately anti-English about Irish folklore, the way in which Irish mythology became associated with Irish nationalism, being promoted most enthusiastically by those favouring Irish independence, led many to perceive Irish mythology and folklore as Anglophobic.<ref name=\"Fimi\" /> Tolkien with his determination to write a \"mythology for England\" was for this reason disinclined to admit to Celtic influences.<ref name=\"Fimi\" /> Fimi noted in particular that the story of the Noldor, the Elves who fled Valinor for Middle-earth, resembles the story related in the ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'' of the semi-divine [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] who fled from what is variously described as a place in the north or Greece to conquer Ireland.<ref name=\"Fimi\" /> Like Tolkien's Elves, the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann are inferior to the gods, but superior to humans; being endowed with extraordinary skills as craftsmen, poets, warriors, and magicians.<ref name=\"Fimi\" /> Likewise, after the triumph of humanity, both the Elves and the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann are driven underground, which causes their \"fading\", leading them to become diminutive and pale.<ref name=\"Fimi\" />\n\n==== Catholicism ====\nCatholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien's creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit.<ref name=DayTolkiensRing /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm |title=Tolkien's Catholic Imagination |last=Bofetti |first=Jason |date=November 2001 |website=Crisis Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821111145/http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2001/feature7.htm <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archive-date=21 August 2006 |access-date=30 August 2006}}</ref> Tolkien acknowledged this himself:\n{{quote|''The Lord of the Rings'' is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.

For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism.<ref>''Letters'', no. 142.</ref>}}\n\nSpecifically, [[Paul H. Kocher]] argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the [[absence of good]]. He cites many examples in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as Sauron's \"Lidless Eye\": \"the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as [[Thomas Aquinas]], \"whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/masterofmiddleea00paul/page/76 |title=Master of Middle-earth: The Fiction of J.

Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: \"evil is nothing\". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of [[Frodo]]'s remark, \"the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own\", and related remarks by [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Road to Middle-earth |last=Shippey |first=Tom |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-395-33973-2 |location=Boston |pages=140\u2013141}}</ref> He goes on to argue that in ''The Lord of the Rings'' evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good, and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.<ref>''Road'', pp.&nbsp;141\u2013145.</ref>\n\n[[Stratford Caldecott]] also interpreted the Ring in theological terms: \"The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly 'thin' and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |title=The Lord & Lady of the Rings |last=Caldecott |first=Stratford |date=January\u2013February 2002 |work=Touchstone Magazine |access-date=27 March 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426033720/http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |archive-date=26 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Publications ===\n\n==== \"''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics\" ====\n{{Main|Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics}}\nAs well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. ''Beowulf'' is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of ''Beowulf'' which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:{{quote|As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.<ref>Tolkien, J. R. R. (1963). ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''. Oxford. pp.&nbsp;10\u201311.</ref>}}\n\n==== \"On Fairy-Stories\" ====\n{{Main|On Fairy-Stories}}\nThis essay discusses the fairy-story as a literary form. It was initially written as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland.\n\nTolkien focuses on [[Andrew Lang]]'s work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales. He disagreed with Lang's broad inclusion, in his [[Lang's Fairy Books|Fairy Book]] collections, of traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories. Tolkien held a narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in [[Fairyland|Faerie]], an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters. He viewed them as the natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language.\n\n==== Children's books and other short works ====\nIn addition to his [[mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |title=The Prevalence of Hobbits |last=Phillip |first=Norman |work=The New York Times |access-date=12 March 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062440/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |archive-date=11 April 2009 |year=2005}}</ref> He wrote annual Christmas letters from [[Father Christmas]] for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]''). Other works included ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' and ''[[Roverandom]]'' (for children), and ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' (part of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''), ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''. ''Roverandom'' and ''Smith of Wootton Major'', like ''The Hobbit'', borrowed ideas from his ''legendarium''.\n\n==== ''The Hobbit'' ====\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm [[George Allen & Unwin]], who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.<ref name=\"NYTimes obit\" /> When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.\n\n==== ''The Lord of the Rings'' ====\nThe request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (originally published in three volumes 1954\u20131955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend [[C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis]], the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set against the background of ''The Silmarillion'', but in a time long after it.\n\nTolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be a children's tale in the style of ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |title=Oxford Calling |date=5 June 1955 |work=The New York Times |access-date=12 March 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062443/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |archive-date=11 April 2009}}</ref> Though a direct sequel to ''The Hobbit'', it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense [[backstory]] of [[Beleriand]] that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in ''The Silmarillion'' and other volumes.

Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but publishers (both [[Allen & Unwin]] and [[HarperCollins|Collins]]) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be published in three volumes.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] (1993). ''J. R. R.

From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of ''The Fall of [[N\u00famenor]]'', which was inspired by the legend of [[Atlantis]].\n\nTolkien had appointed his son Christopher to be his [[literary executor]], and he (with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]], later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in 1977.

In subsequent years (1983\u20131996), he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing ''The Hobbit'' for a third edition, that he would have preferred to rewrite the book completely because of the style of its prose.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |title=Middle-earth Revised, Again |last=Martinez |first=Michael |date=27 July 2002 |website=Michael Martinez Tolkien Essays |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617122627/http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |archive-date=17 June 2008 |access-date=28 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==== ''The Children of H\u00farin'' ====\nMore recently, in 2007, ''[[The Children of H\u00farin]]'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] (in the UK and Canada) and [[Houghton Mifflin]] (in the US). The novel tells the story of [[T\u00farin Turambar]] and his sister [[Nienor]], children of [[H\u00farin Thalion]]. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from ''The Silmarillion'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and unpublished manuscripts.\n\n==== ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan'' ====\n''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan]]'', which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of [[Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Niflungs]] from Germanic mythology. It is a [[narrative poem]] composed in [[alliterative verse]] and is modelled after the [[Old Norse]] poetry of the [[Elder Edda]]. Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.\n\nAccording to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, \"He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them.\"<ref>''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan'', page 5.</ref> In a 1967 letter to [[W.

It is [[alliterative poem|alliterative]], extending to almost 1,000 lines imitating the [[Old English poetry|Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' metre in Modern English. Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction, the historical setting of the poem is during the Post-Roman [[Migration Period]], both in form (using [[Germanic poetry|Germanic verse]]) and in content, showing Arthur as a [[Sub-Roman Britain|British]] [[warlord]] fighting the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Saxon invasion]], while it avoids the high medieval aspects of the Arthurian cycle (such as the Grail, and the courtly setting); the poem begins with a British \"counter-invasion\" to the [[Old Saxony|Saxon lands]] (''Arthur eastward in arms purposed'').<ref>announcing the 2013 edition, ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 9 October 2012 published the poem's first nine verses; Alison Flood, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur 'New' JRR Tolkien epic due out next year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202023157/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur |date=2 December 2016 }} guardian.co.uk, Tuesday 9 October 2012.</ref>\n\n==== ''Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary'' ====\n''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]]'', published on 22 May 2014, is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' from [[Old English]] to modern English. Translated by Tolkien from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by his son Christopher.

He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with [[Old Norse]] as his special subject. He worked on the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including ''[[walrus]]'', over which he struggled mightily.<ref>[[Winchester, Simon]] (2003).

The most developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[esthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elvenlatin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.<ref name=\"letter144\">''Letters'', no. 144.</ref> A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Ad\u00fbnaic]] or [[N\u00famen\u00f3rean]], a language of a \"faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour\", connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the \"[[Second Age]]\" and the story of [[E\u00e4rendil]] was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century \"real primary world\" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.\n\nTolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]]: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.bl.uk/european/2018/01/tolkiens-secret-vice.html |title=Tolkien's 'Secret Vice' |last=Corsetti |first=Renato |date=31 January 2018 |website=British Library}}</ref> \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 he had concluded that \"[[Volap\u00fck]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Novial]], &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".<ref name=\"letter180\">''Letters'', no. 180.</ref>\n\nThe popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the [[Old English]] plural survived, it would have been ''dwarrows'' or ''dwerrows''.) He also coined the term ''[[eucatastrophe]]'', though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.\n\n== Artwork ==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}\nTolkien was an accomplished artist, who learned to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/Mag/Big-Picture/The-fine-art-of-weaving-a-Tolkien-tale |title=The fine art of weaving a Tolkien tale |last=France |first=Connexion |website=connexionfrance.com |access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref> From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in ''Mr Bliss'' and ''Roverandom'', and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of ''The Hobbit''. Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: ''[[J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]''. The book discusses Tolkien's paintings, drawings, and sketches, and reproduces approximately 200 examples of his work.<ref>{{Cite book |title=J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator |title-link=J.

R. R. Tolkien}}\n\nIn a 1951 letter to publisher Milton Waldman (1895\u20131976), Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a \"body of more or less connected legend\", of which \"[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 131.</ref> The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were [[Pauline Baynes]] (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') and [[Donald Swann]] (who set the music to ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]''). Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-46949881 |title=Queen Margrethe II: Denmark's monarch for a modern age |last=Thygesen |first=Peter |date=Autumn 1999 |work=Scandinavian Review |access-date=12 March 2006}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of ''The Hobbit'' as \"too [[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]] ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and [[Gandalf]] as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the [[Odin]]ic wanderer that I think of\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 107.</ref>\n\nTolkien was sceptical of the emerging [[Tolkien fandom]] in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'':\n{{quote|Thank you for sending me the projected \"blurbs\", which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.<ref name=\"letter144\" />}}\n\nHe had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\", first presented in 1939:\n{{quote|In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. ...

He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director [[John Boorman]] was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s.

The Tolkien family originated in the [[East Prussia]]n town [[Kreuzburg, East Prussia|Kreuzburg]] near [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], which was founded during medieval [[German eastward expansion]], where his earliest-known paternal ancestor Michel Tolkien was born around 1620. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663\u20131746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg. His son Christian Tolkien (1706\u20131791) moved from Kreuzburg to nearby [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]], and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747\u20131813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) emigrated to London in the 1770s and became the ancestors of the English family; the younger brother was J. R. R. Tolkien's second great-grandfather. In 1792 John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Other German relatives also joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as J. R. R.

I don't regret my decision, though it was very hard on my lover. But it was not my fault. She was completely free and under no vow to me, and I should have had no just complaint (except according to the unreal romantic code) if she had got married to someone else. For very nearly ''three'' years I did not see or write to my lover. It was extremely hard, especially at first. The effects were not wholly good: I fell back into folly and slackness and misspent a good deal of my first year at college.<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" />}}\n\nOn the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at [[Cheltenham]]. He declared that he had never ceased to love her, and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. But Edith said she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.\n\nOn 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\".<ref>''Biography'', pp.&nbsp;67\u201369.</ref> Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, \"I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different.\"<ref>''The Tolkien Family Album'', (1992), page 34.</ref>\n\nFollowing their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence. Jessop, \"like many others of his age and class ... strongly [[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|anti-Catholic]]\", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.<ref>''Biography'', p.&nbsp;73.</ref>\n\nEdith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at [[St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick]], on 22 March 1916.<ref>''Biography'', p.&nbsp;86.</ref> In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" />\n\n=== First World War ===\nIn August 1914, Britain entered the [[First World War]]. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to volunteer immediately for the [[British Army]]. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled: \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" />\n\nInstead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\",<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" /> and entered a programme by which he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\".<ref name=\"Letters, No. 43\" /> He was commissioned as a temporary [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] on 15 July 1915.<ref>''Biography'', pp.&nbsp;77\u201385.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29232|page=6968|date=16 July 1915}}</ref> He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on [[Cannock Chase]], [[Staffordshire]], for 11 months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained: \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\"<ref>''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&nbsp;94.</ref> Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp.\n\nOn 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to [[Folkestone]] for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in [[Edgbaston]], Birmingham.\n\nHe later wrote: \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then&nbsp;... it was like a death.\"<ref>Quoted in John Garth, ''Tolkien and the Great War'', p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\n==== France ====\nOn 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to [[Calais]]. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s (BEF) base depot at [[\u00c9taples]]. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the [[74th Brigade (United Kingdom)|74th Brigade]], [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Division]].\n\nWhile waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled ''The Lonely Isle'', which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's [[postal censorship]], he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.<ref>Garth, John.

Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\"<ref name=\"Garth149\">Garth (2003), p.&nbsp;149.</ref>\n\nTolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"Garth149\" />\n\n==== Battle of the Somme ====\nTolkien arrived at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at [[Bouzincourt]], he participated in the assaults on the [[Schwaben Redoubt]] and the [[Leipzig salient]]. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, [[Anglican]] chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers:\n[[File:Schwaben Redoubt by William Orpen IWM Art.IWM ART 3000.jpg|thumb|right|''The Schwaben Redoubt'', painting by William Orpen.

''The Lord of the Rings'' is often thought to represent England during and immediately after the Second World War. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory.<ref name=MEreffotrForeword /> This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien objected strongly to C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical.<ref>Longenecker, Dwight (2008). \"[http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia Why Tolkien said No to Narnia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430143646/http://www.speroforum.com/a/16698/Why-Tolkien-said-No-to-Narnia |date=30 April 2011 }}\", Spero News, 12 November 2008.

Such [[allegory]] is entirely foreign to my thought.\"<ref>''Letters'', no. 229.</ref>\n\n==== Opposition to National Socialism ====\nTolkien vocally opposed [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] before the [[Second World War]], and was known to especially despise [[Nazi]] racist and anti-semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house R\u00fctten & Loening Verlag was preparing to release ''The Hobbit'' in [[Nazi Germany]]. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] origin. In a letter to his British publisher [[Stanley Unwin (publisher)|Stanley Unwin]], he condemned Nazi \"race-doctrine\" as \"wholly pernicious and unscientific\". He added that he had many [[Jewish]] friends and was considering \"letting a German translation go hang\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 29, to Stanley Unwin, 25 July 1938.</ref> He provided two letters to R\u00fctten & Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that \"[[Aryan]]\" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of [[Indo-Iranian languages]]. He continued,{{quote|But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of ''Jewish'' origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have ''no'' ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the 18th century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject\u2014which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army.

In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:{{quote|We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted.

In an earlier, 1944 letter to Christopher, he wrote:{{quote|...it is distressing to see the press grovelling in the gutter as low as [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] in his prime, shrieking that any German commander who holds out in a desperate situation (when, too, the military needs of his side clearly benefit) is a drunkard, and a besotted fanatic. ... There was a solemn article in the local paper seriously advocating systematic exterminating of the entire German nation as the only proper course after military victory: because, if you please, they are rattlesnakes, and don't know the difference between good and evil!

The Germans have just as much right to declare the Poles and Jews exterminable vermin, subhuman, as we have to select the Germans: in other words, no right, whatever they have done.<ref>''Letters'', no. 81.</ref>}}\n\nTolkien was horrified by the 1945 [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], referring to the scientists of the [[Manhattan Project]] as \"these lunatic physicists\" and \"[[Tower of Babel|Babel]]-builders\".<ref name=\"atom\">''Letters'', no. 102.</ref>\n\n=== Nature ===\nDuring most of his own life [[conservationism]] was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views\u2014except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.<ref>{{Cite book |title=J.

Kocher]] argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the [[absence of good]]. He cites many examples in ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as Sauron's \"Lidless Eye\": \"the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as [[Thomas Aquinas]], \"whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/masterofmiddleea00paul/page/76 |title=Master of Middle-earth: The Fiction of J.

Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: \"evil is nothing\". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of [[Frodo]]'s remark, \"the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own\", and related remarks by [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Road to Middle-earth |last=Shippey |first=Tom |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-395-33973-2 |location=Boston |pages=140\u2013141}}</ref> He goes on to argue that in ''The Lord of the Rings'' evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good, and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.<ref>''Road'', pp.&nbsp;141\u2013145.</ref>\n\n[[Stratford Caldecott]] also interpreted the Ring in theological terms: \"The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly 'thin' and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |title=The Lord & Lady of the Rings |last=Caldecott |first=Stratford |date=January\u2013February 2002 |work=Touchstone Magazine |access-date=27 March 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426033720/http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=15-01-051-f |archive-date=26 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Publications ===\n\n==== \"''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics\" ====\n{{Main|Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics}}\nAs well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. ''Beowulf'' is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of ''Beowulf'' which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:{{quote|As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or tale, are actually rare.<ref>Tolkien, J. R. R. (1963). ''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics''. Oxford. pp.&nbsp;10\u201311.</ref>}}\n\n==== \"On Fairy-Stories\" ====\n{{Main|On Fairy-Stories}}\nThis essay discusses the fairy-story as a literary form. It was initially written as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland.\n\nTolkien focuses on [[Andrew Lang]]'s work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales. He disagreed with Lang's broad inclusion, in his [[Lang's Fairy Books|Fairy Book]] collections, of traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories. Tolkien held a narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in [[Fairyland|Faerie]], an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters. He viewed them as the natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language.\n\n==== Children's books and other short works ====\nIn addition to his [[mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |title=The Prevalence of Hobbits |last=Phillip |first=Norman |work=The New York Times |access-date=12 March 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062440/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |archive-date=11 April 2009 |year=2005}}</ref> He wrote annual Christmas letters from [[Father Christmas]] for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]''). Other works included ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' and ''[[Roverandom]]'' (for children), and ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' (part of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''), ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''. ''Roverandom'' and ''Smith of Wootton Major'', like ''The Hobbit'', borrowed ideas from his ''legendarium''.\n\n==== ''The Hobbit'' ====\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm [[George Allen & Unwin]], who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.<ref name=\"NYTimes obit\" /> When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.\n\n==== ''The Lord of the Rings'' ====\nThe request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (originally published in three volumes 1954\u20131955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend [[C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis]], the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set against the background of ''The Silmarillion'', but in a time long after it.\n\nTolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be a children's tale in the style of ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |title=Oxford Calling |date=5 June 1955 |work=The New York Times |access-date=12 March 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062443/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |archive-date=11 April 2009}}</ref> Though a direct sequel to ''The Hobbit'', it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense [[backstory]] of [[Beleriand]] that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in ''The Silmarillion'' and other volumes.

Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but publishers (both [[Allen & Unwin]] and [[HarperCollins|Collins]]) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be published in three volumes.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] (1993). ''J. R. R.

From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of ''The Fall of [[N\u00famenor]]'', which was inspired by the legend of [[Atlantis]].\n\nTolkien had appointed his son Christopher to be his [[literary executor]], and he (with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]], later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in 1977.

In subsequent years (1983\u20131996), he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing ''The Hobbit'' for a third edition, that he would have preferred to rewrite the book completely because of the style of its prose.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |title=Middle-earth Revised, Again |last=Martinez |first=Michael |date=27 July 2002 |website=Michael Martinez Tolkien Essays |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617122627/http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |archive-date=17 June 2008 |access-date=28 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==== ''The Children of H\u00farin'' ====\nMore recently, in 2007, ''[[The Children of H\u00farin]]'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] (in the UK and Canada) and [[Houghton Mifflin]] (in the US). The novel tells the story of [[T\u00farin Turambar]] and his sister [[Nienor]], children of [[H\u00farin Thalion]]. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from ''The Silmarillion'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and unpublished manuscripts.\n\n==== ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan'' ====\n''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan]]'', which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of [[Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Niflungs]] from Germanic mythology. It is a [[narrative poem]] composed in [[alliterative verse]] and is modelled after the [[Old Norse]] poetry of the [[Elder Edda]]. Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.\n\nAccording to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, \"He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them.\"<ref>''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan'', page 5.</ref> In a 1967 letter to [[W.

It is [[alliterative poem|alliterative]], extending to almost 1,000 lines imitating the [[Old English poetry|Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' metre in Modern English. Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction, the historical setting of the poem is during the Post-Roman [[Migration Period]], both in form (using [[Germanic poetry|Germanic verse]]) and in content, showing Arthur as a [[Sub-Roman Britain|British]] [[warlord]] fighting the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Saxon invasion]], while it avoids the high medieval aspects of the Arthurian cycle (such as the Grail, and the courtly setting); the poem begins with a British \"counter-invasion\" to the [[Old Saxony|Saxon lands]] (''Arthur eastward in arms purposed'').<ref>announcing the 2013 edition, ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 9 October 2012 published the poem's first nine verses; Alison Flood, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur 'New' JRR Tolkien epic due out next year] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202023157/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/09/jrr-tolkien-new-poem-king-arthur |date=2 December 2016 }} guardian.co.uk, Tuesday 9 October 2012.</ref>\n\n==== ''Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary'' ====\n''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]]'', published on 22 May 2014, is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' from [[Old English]] to modern English.

The most developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[esthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elvenlatin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.<ref name=\"letter144\">''Letters'', no. 144.</ref> A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Ad\u00fbnaic]] or [[N\u00famen\u00f3rean]], a language of a \"faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour\", connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the \"[[Second Age]]\" and the story of [[E\u00e4rendil]] was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century \"real primary world\" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.\n\nTolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]]: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.bl.uk/european/2018/01/tolkiens-secret-vice.html |title=Tolkien's 'Secret Vice' |last=Corsetti |first=Renato |date=31 January 2018 |website=British Library}}</ref> \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 he had concluded that \"[[Volap\u00fck]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Novial]], &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".<ref name=\"letter180\">''Letters'', no. 180.</ref>\n\nThe popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the [[Old English]] plural survived, it would have been ''dwarrows'' or ''dwerrows''.) He also coined the term ''[[eucatastrophe]]'', though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.\n\n== Artwork ==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}\nTolkien was an accomplished artist, who learned to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/Mag/Big-Picture/The-fine-art-of-weaving-a-Tolkien-tale |title=The fine art of weaving a Tolkien tale |last=France |first=Connexion |website=connexionfrance.com |access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref> From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in ''Mr Bliss'' and ''Roverandom'', and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of ''The Hobbit''. Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: ''[[J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]''. The book discusses Tolkien's paintings, drawings, and sketches, and reproduces approximately 200 examples of his work.<ref>{{Cite book |title=J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator |title-link=J.

Personally known to him were [[Pauline Baynes]] (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') and [[Donald Swann]] (who set the music to ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]''). Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-46949881 |title=Queen Margrethe II: Denmark's monarch for a modern age |last=Thygesen |first=Peter |date=Autumn 1999 |work=Scandinavian Review |access-date=12 March 2006}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of ''The Hobbit'' as \"too [[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]] ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and [[Gandalf]] as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the [[Odin]]ic wanderer that I think of\".<ref>''Letters'', no. 107.</ref>\n\nTolkien was sceptical of the emerging [[Tolkien fandom]] in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'':\n{{quote|Thank you for sending me the projected \"blurbs\", which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.<ref name=\"letter144\" />}}\n\nHe had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\", first presented in 1939:\n{{quote|In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. ...

He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director [[John Boorman]] was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company, and the first film adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was released in 1978 as an animated [[rotoscoping]] film directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] with screenplay by the fantasy writer [[Peter S.

One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by Sarehole Mill, near which he lived between the ages of four and eight, while two mark childhood homes up to the time he left to attend Oxford University and the other marks a hotel he stayed at before leaving for France during World War I. The plaque in West Park, Leeds, commemorates the five years Tolkien enjoyed at Leeds as Reader and then Professor of English Language at the University. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote ''The Hobbit'' and most of ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Address !!

Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his letters or of the first editions of his individual writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may occur on the market. In particular, the signed first hardback edition of ''The Hobbit'' from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000. Collectibles also include non-fiction books with hand-written annotations from Tolkien's private library.<ref>{{Cite book |url={{Google books|eHAyr784pREC|page=PA163|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |title=The Essential J.

A Zapatista slogan is in harmony with the concept of [[mutual aid (politics)|mutual aid]]: \"For everyone, everything. For us, nothing\" (''Para todos todo, para nosotros nada'').\n\nThe EZLN opposes [[economic globalization]], arguing that it severely and negatively affects the peasant life of its indigenous support base and oppresses people worldwide. The signing of [[NAFTA]] also resulted in the removal of Article 27, Section VII, from the [[Mexican Constitution]], which had guaranteed land reparations to indigenous groups throughout Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAnother key element of the Zapatistas' ideology is their aspiration to do politics in a new, [[participatory politics|participatory]] way, from the \"bottom up\" instead of \"top down\". The Zapatistas consider the contemporary [[Politics of Mexico|political system of Mexico]] inherently flawed due to what they consider its purely representative nature and its disconnection from the people and their needs. In contrast, the EZLN aims to reinforce the idea of [[participatory democracy]] or radical democracy by limiting public servants' terms to only two weeks, not using visible organization leaders, and constantly referring to the people they are governing for major decisions, strategies, and conceptual visions. Marcos has reiterated, \"my real commander is the people\". In accordance with this principle, the Zapatistas are not a political party: they do not seek office throughout the state, because that would perpetuate the political system by attempting to gain power within its ranks. Instead, they wish to reconceptualize the entire system.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Postcolonialism===\n[[File:052_pot_v_Palenque_(39).JPG|thumb|left|250px|Zapatista point towards Palenque (2010).]]\nThe Zapatistas' response to the introduction of NAFTA in 1994, it is argued, reflects the shift in perception taking place in societies that have experienced colonialism.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beardsell|first=Peter|title=Europe and Latin America: Returning the Gaze|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK}}</ref> Over the last 20 years, Chiapas is said to have emerged as a formidable force against the Mexican government, fighting against structural violence and social and economic marginalization brought on by globalization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collier|first=George|title=A Generation of Crisis in the Central Highlands of Chiapas|year=2003|publisher=Rowmand and Littlefield Publishers Inc.|page=33}}</ref> The Zapatista rebellion not only raised many questions about the consequences of globalization and free trade; it also questioned the long-standing ideas created by the Spanish colonial system.

Within a few weeks [[Subcomandante Marcos]], the EZLN's spokesperson, was granting interviews to journalists from both the national and international press, including reporters from ''[[The New York Times]]''.

The Zapatistas consider the contemporary [[Politics of Mexico|political system of Mexico]] inherently flawed due to what they consider its purely representative nature and its disconnection from the people and their needs.
