Heduohan's brother [[Yujiul\u00fc Shelun|Shelun]] raided several tribal dependencies of the [[Tuoba]] in retaliation, but reportedly suffered a serious defeat in 399, and was forced to flee westward.  Here Shelun defeated the Hulu (\u659b\u5f8b) tribe and subjugated them. With the aid of a Hulu named Chiluohou (\u53f1\u6d1b\u4faf), Shelun conquered most of the Gaoche tribes and proclaimed himself Kaghan of the Rouran on March 11, 402. Many Gaoche, such as Chiluohou, were promoted to establish better control.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 208\u2013211.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 7,105 (Vol.27).</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Shelun and his successor [[Yujiul\u00fc Datan|Datan]], the Rouran pushed as far as the [[Issyk Kul]], where they defeated the [[Wusun]] and drove them to the south.

The Western Chile (mainly the Hulu and Tiele related to Fufuluo's Qifuli (\u6ce3\u4f0f\u5229) clan) rebelled between 524\uff0d526, moved further south and were eventually assimilated.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 272\u2013273, 315\u2013320.</ref>\n\nWith the loss of numerous subjects and vital resources, the Rouran went into a temporary decline. However, in 460 they launched new campaigns in the west, destroying the remnant of [[Northern Liang]]. During a campaign against [[Khotan]] in 470, the king wrote in his supplicatory letter to the Toba Emperor that all of the statelets in the west had submitted to the Rouran. In 472, [[Yujiul\u00fc Yucheng|Yucheng]] attacked Northern Wei across the western border. By the time of his death in 485, Yucheng had restored the Kaghanate to a status even more powerful than the times of Datan.\n\nDuring these wars, a southwestern Gaoche tribal group known as the '''Fufuluo''' united twelve clans and rebelled, but were defeated by the Rouran. They escaped and established a state northwest of [[Gaochang]] in 487. From then on, little is known about the rest of the Gaoche until the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]].\n\n===Fufuluo===\nThe Fufuluo (\u526f\u4f0f\u7f57) were a Gaoche tribe of twelve clans, dwelling close to the Gaochang kingdom (likely by the Tuin River of the [[Govi-Altai Province|Govi-Altai range]]. Early on a Fufuluo clan known as the Yizhan (which had lived there since the mid 2nd century) allied with the Touba.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 186.</ref> In 481, the Fufuluo began to interfere with the [[Gaochang]] and deposed one of their kings. After the death of Yucheng, his belligerent son [[Yujiul\u00fc Doulun|Dulun]] fought more wars against the Touba.\n\nAfter a disagreement, A-Fuzhiluo betrayed him, and in 487, together with his younger cousin Qiongqi (\u7a77\u5947), they managed their clans of over 100,000 yurts to escape from the pursuing armies, led by Dulun and his uncle [[Yujiul\u00fc Nagai|Nagai]] by defeating them.\n\nAfter they settled, he founded a statelet (also known as the A-Fuzhiluo kingdom) under the title of Ulu Beglik (\u5019\u5a04\u5310\u52d2, based on an interpretation of [[Shiratori Kurakichi]] and [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank|Pulleyblank]]). Like the later Qibi and [[Xueyantuo]] in 605, the Fufuluo divided their rule between north and south at [[Dzungaria]].<ref name=\"highcart\" /> <ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 38, 217\u2013219, 366\u2013367.</ref>\n\nThe Fufuluo allied with the Northern Wei in 490 and fought against the Rouran until 541 when they were dispersed by them.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 216, 226, 229\u2013230, 252.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of Dulun in 492, several important cities on the eastern route were taken by Fufuluo, separating the Rouran from the west. With the elimination of Rouran influence, the [[Hephthalite]]s, kindred steppe nomads, for the first time extended their domain as far as [[Karashahr]], where Qiongqi was killed and his son Mietu (\u5f25\u4fc4\u7a81) was taken hostage{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nAfter 507, the [[Hephthalites]] uninterruptedly sent eighteen embassies with gifts (\u671d\u732e/\u671d\u8d21) to the Chinese courts (twelve to [[Northern Wei]], three to [[Liang Dynasty]], two to [[Western Wei]] and one to [[Northern Zhou]]), as opposed to only one in 456.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 235\u2013239.</ref> Like [[Peroz I]] and his son [[Kavadh I]] earlier in the west, the Hephthalites helped Mietu. He returned to his realm and [[Biliyan]] (\u8dcb\u5229\u5ef6), the successor of A-Fuzhiluo, was overthrown by his tribesmen, while shortly paying tribute to the Touba. In 508, [[Yujiul\u00fc Futu|Futu]] attacked the Fufuluo and gained a victory, but was killed by Mietu on his course back. Later in 516, [[Yujiul\u00fc Chounu|Chounu]], son of Futu, defeated Mietu, and in reprisal had him towed to death by a horse. The Fufuluo went for several years into exile under the refuge of the Hephthalites. In 520, Chounu was repulsed by his younger brother Yifu (\u4f0a\u5310) who restored the realm. After his defeat, Chounu returned to the east, where he was killed in a coup in which the ruling clan of Yujiulu (\u90c1\u4e45\u95fe) was split into two factions. In 521, the Fufuluo penetrated into the Rouran territory, but were finally repulsed by 524. Thereafter, the Fufuluo suffered a series of defeats from [[Yujiul\u00fc Anagui|Anagui]] before being annihilated in 541. During the final decade, they helped the [[Eastern Wei]] to fight the [[Western Wei]] in a civil war. After defeat, the nobility surrendered to them.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 242\u2013254.</ref>\n\n=== Rulers of Gaoche ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Many of their tribal chiefs were expelled and some were killed during this period.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 346\u2013347.</ref> They allied themselves in a rebellion against the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks during the turmoil between 599 and 603. This might have already started as early as in 582, when rumor was spread about a revolt in the north when a raiding campaign led [[Ishbara Qaghan]] away from the capital. Among the rivals of Ishbara in the west was Tardu, son of [[Ist\u00e4mi]]. He allied with Apa Khan, a qaghan at the northern Dzungaria and Khovd River, and declared himself independent.\n\nIn 587 Baga Khan, heir of Ishbara, captured Apa with the help of the Chinese but died the next year on a campaign in the west. Later on, [[Tulan Qaghan|Dulan]] took over his reign and in 599 he, together with Tardu, launched a civil war against his son [[Qimin]], who sided with the Chinese. However, he was unsuccessful and was assassinated during his battles with the Chinese. His partner Tardu took over and launched a revolt against the Qaghanate. In 603 he was revolted against by the Tiele tribes, provoked by the Chinese, and fled to the [[Tuyuhun Kingdom|Tuyuhun]].<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 344, 349\u2013352.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 10,680 (Vol.41) 10,795, 10,805, 10,857 (Vol.42).</ref> Earlier, when Apa was captured, Nili took over from him, but he died after the defeat of Tardu in the east. His son [[Heshana Khan]] succeeded him in the Western Qaghanate, levying heavy taxes on the Tiele. To prevent a revolt he gathered several hundreds of chiefs and murdered them. In 605 an alliance among the Tiele under the Qibi (\u5951\u82fe) and Xueyantuo (\u859b\u5ef6\u9640) tribes was formed to overthrow him. They captured most of the Dzungaria and defeated his occupying army, taking several important cities, including [[Kumul, Xinjiang|Kumul]], Karashahr and [[Gaochang]], pushing Heshana Khan further west to the lower [[Ili River]] by 607.\n\nAfter victory, the Qibi chief Geleng (\u54e5\u695e) was proclaimed as the qaghan by the tribes and the Xueyantuo chief [[Yiedie Khan]] as subordinate qaghan. At the same year Geleng allied with the Chinese to defeat the Tuyuhun to resolve a conflict at [[Dunhuang]].\n\nIn 611, Shekui, a qaghan from [[Tashkent]] and grandson of Tardu, attacked [[Ashina Xichun|Chuluo]] and forced him to escape to China. The return of Shekui marked the end of the rebellion, although exactly when the rebels were put down is uncertain. One Chinese account indicated that the Gaochang kingdom still remained under their vassal until the year 612. They were most likely subdued after this year as Shekui restored order in the Western Qaghanate.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 352\u2013356.</ref>\n\nFailure to put down these uprisings led to a fatal division within the G\u00f6kturks ruling Ashina clan. Under the leadership of [[Zhenzhu Khan]] in 628, grandson of Yishibo, the [[Xueyantuo]] made their crossing over the Altai, and quickly founded a confederation with the rest of the Tiele at the east.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 360.</ref>\n\nThe Xueyantuo founded a short-lived Qaghanate over the steppe under [[Zhenzhu Khan]], his son [[Duomi Khan]] and nephew [[Yitewushi Khan]], the last of which eventually surrendered to the Chinese.\n\n=== Chinese subjugation ===\nShortly after 646, the Uyghur and the rest of the twelve Tiele chiefs (and subsequently the far-away Guligan and Dubo) arrived at the Chinese court. They were bestowed either with the title of commander-in-chief (\u90fd\u7763 ''dudu'') or prefect (\u523a\u53f2 ''{{transl|cmn|cishi}}'') under the [[Jimi system|loose control]] (\u7f81\u7e3b ''jimi'') of the northern protectorate or \"pacificed north\" (\u5b89\u5317\u5e9c), whose seat and name changed at certain times.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 445\u2013449.</ref>\n\nThe Uyghur were prominent among the Tiele tribes next to the Xueyantuo. Their name first appeared in 390 as ''Yuanhe'' (\u8881\u7ea5). Under the leadership of Pusa (\u83e9\u8428), son of chief Tejian (\u7279\u5065), the Uyghur co-operated with the Xueyantuo to make a stand against the Eastern Qaghanate. Soon after his death, his successor Tumidu (\u5410\u8ff7\u5ea6) formed a new alliance with the Chinese and turned against his former ally. Thereafter, Tumidu was granted a Chinese title like the rest of the Tiele chiefs, and carried the title of qaghan among the other tribes, who now annually donated  furs to the Chinese to fulfill their tax obligations.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 186, 451, 453\u2013457.</ref>\n\nIn 648, Tumidu was murdered by his nephew Wuhe (\u4e4c\u7ea5) and another tribesman named Juluobo (\u4ff1\u7f57\u52c3). Both were sons-in-law of the [[Chebi Khan]], the ruler of the Eastern Qaghanate at the northern Altai, who now held hegemony over the surrounding tribes, including the Qarluq. This alerted the Chinese, and Wuhe was assassinated by a ruse upon receiving his uncle's position from the Chinese deputy in the north. Later Juluobo was detained by the Chinese. On November 17, Porun (\u5a46\u95f0) was granted his fathers title.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 457\u2013458.</ref>\n\nSince their submission, the Tiele (mainly the Uyghur) had participated in several campaigns under Chinese leadership. Under the command of Ashina Sheer (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u793e\u5c14), Yuan Lichen (\u5143\u793c\u81e3), Gao Kan (\u9ad8\u4f83), Liang Jianfang (\u6881\u5efa\u65b9), Cheng Zhijie (\u7a0b\u77e5\u8282), [[Su Ding Fang]] and Xiao Siya (\u8427\u55e3\u4e1a) this resulted in the capture of Chebi Khan in 650 and the end of the Western Qaghanate in 657, except for a last campaign at [[Goguryeo]] which probably killed Porun.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 459\u2013470, 493.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 11,972 (Vol.47).</ref>\n\nDuring those campaigns, visits would be paid to restrain the tribes. In 658 such a visit was repelled, and a revolt broke out in 660 starting with the Sijie (\u601d\u7ed3), Bayegu (\u62d4\u91ce\u53e4), Pugu (\u4ec6\u9aa8) and Tongluo (\u540c\u7f57). The reason for this revolt is unclear, perhaps due to the Chinese repression of the surrounding tribes during the campaigns.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 472\u2013475.</ref> Two years later the revolts were suppressed by the Chinese at the upper [[Selenge River]] around [[Khangai Mountains|Khangai]]. The battle was short, and a massacre was said to be committed by the two leading commanders. According to one exaggerated account from [[Tang Huiyao]] around 900,000 surrendered tribesmen were slaughtered, though it is certain that a large number of them were captured.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 477\u2013478.</ref> After the event, a message was sent to the north to appease the restless Tiele.\n\nIn 669 similar unsuccessful revolts had been made by the Xueyantuo, but the details of these are vague.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 479\u2013481.</ref> The last revolt was mentioned in 686, led by the Pugu and Tongluo to join with the Ashina clan, who had formed the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]] under [[Ilterish Qaghan]] in 682. They were immediately suppressed by an army dispatched from [[Juyan]]. A number of them were moved to that region along with the seat of the protectorate under the jurisdiction of [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]]. Earlier during the rebellion contacts between the northern protectorate and the Chinese capital were cut off, and the only way to pass was through the area of [[Jiuquan|Suzhou]].<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 482\u2013488.</ref>\n\n=== Rise of the Uyghur Khaganate ===\n{{Main article|Uyghur Khaganate}}\nAfter the disintegration of the Eastern Qaghanate in 630, many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk nobles were resettled either at the Chinese border or in the capital. Some went on to participate in frontier campaigns for the Chinese.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 413.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 11,660 (Vol.46).</ref>\n\nIn 679 a major rebellion was led by three G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk nobles{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Among them, Ashina Nishufu (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u6ce5\u719f\u5310), a direct descendant of Illig, was chosen as their qaghan. They were quickly subdued by the Chinese and their leader was betrayed and killed by his own troops. The rest of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks managed to escape and allied themselves with Ashina Funian (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u4f0f\u5ff5) for a new rebellion. Funian declared himself qaghan in 681, but his revolt did not succeed and more than fifty participants were executed on November 16 at the Chinese capital.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 481, 483.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 12,265, 12,273, 12,284, 12,292 (Vol.48).</ref> The remaining rebellious G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks formed the Second Turkic Eastern Qaghanate under Ilteris Sad and his 5,000 supporters. They were mostly active in the southern region bordering China at mount \u010co\u03b3ay (\u603b\u6750\u5c71). Over the decade they held countless raids across the Chinese border.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 483, 495.</ref>\n\nExactly when or how the Tiele came under their subjection is unclear. However, during this period, a number of pro-Chinese Tiele groups who had earlier cooperated with the Chinese against them, such as Uyghur, Qibi, Sijie and Hun (\u6d51), escaped into the [[Hexi Corridor]] and eventually resettled to [[Wuwei, Gansu|Liangzhou]].\n\nAccording to the Tonyukuk and K\u00fcltigin [[Orkhon script]], the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks made five out of forty-seven attacks on the Tiele who were led by Ilteris. Among them, four seem to have been mere raids while the last attack could be seen as their re-subjection on the northern steppe. The estimated date for the Tiele submission to the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks would be around 687, probably without much resistance.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 484, 501\u2013505, 523.</ref>\n\nThe establishment of a second G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk capital at the foot of the sacred mountain \u00d6t\u00fcken (\u90fd\u65a4\u5c71) brought unrest to the Tiele tribes. After the Uyghur chief was killed, they were recruited for their annual raiding campaigns over the Chinese border after 694.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 434, 505\u2013509.</ref> These raids were halted in 708, as the Chinese constructed fortifications along the Ordos. Raids continued elsewhere as [[Qapagan Khan|Qapagan]] turned his attention to the west and the [[Turgesh]] and [[Karl\u00edk|Qarluq]] tribes between 708 and 715. By this time, some of the Tiele had escaped into China and were settled in [[Yinchuan|Lingzhou]] and elsewhere, while others like the Bayegu had revolted in 707. These revolts continued until 716 and Qapagan, on his way back from suppressing revolts by the Uyghur, Tongluo, Baixi, Bayegu and Pugu, was ambushed and killed by a Bayegu tribesman named Xiezhilue (\u9889\u8d28\u7565) on July 22. In conclusion, not all tribes were involved in the revolts. Two of the northernmost tribal allies, the Guligan and Dubo (\u90fd\u64ad) did not participate in any of the revolts.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 509\u2013511, 515.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 12,852 (Vol.50).</ref>\n\nSoon, [[Bilge Khan]] took over the reign and together with [[Tonyukuk]], began to appease the subjected Tiele. Tonyukuk was born in China and was considered a wise statesman in both Turkic and Chinese accounts. Meanwhile, a friendly relationship was built with the Chinese. Till the end of the Second Eastern Qaghanate only one raid in 720 was made on the Chinese border. Bilge Khan started to call for a return of the former members of the Tiele tribes who had settled in China. He had risen in status among the tribal chiefs, especially the Uyghur within the Qaghanate.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 517\u2013520.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, many Tiele had betrayed the local Chinese authorities and fled to the north, in particular the five communities around Liang, Ling, [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Xia]], [[Baynnur|Feng]], and [[Shuozhou|Bingzhou]], while minor insurgencies had occurred throughout the process.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 532\u2013539.</ref> Among the returning Tiele tribes was the Uyghur, specifically the Yaoluoge, who had escaped into China until 727. The Yaoluoge consisted one of nine<ref>1. Huduoge (\u80e1\u5484\u845b) 2. Guluowu (\u5552\u7f57\u52ff) 3. Mogexiqi (\u8c8a\u6b4c\u606f\u8bab) 4. A-Wudi (\u963f\u52ff\u5600) 5. Gesa (\u845b\u8428) 6.

Within a few years, an alliance was established between the [[Basmyl]] (\u62d4\u6089\u871c), Uyghur and Qarluq. They overthrew the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and killed the qaghan. Most of the heirs were killed subsequently. At the same time the Basmyl chief, who was approved as qaghan, was overthrown by the allies.\n\nIn 745 the exiled qaghan of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks was killed by an Uyghur chief named Qutlugh Boyla, son of Hushu (\u62a4\u8f93). He founded the new [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghur Qaghanate]] under the title of Qutlugh Bilge K\u00f6l Qaghan. The name \"Tiele\", and the \"nine allies (of Tiele)\" (\u4e5d\u59d3) or '''Toquz Oguz''' (based on the interpretation of scholar Cen Zhongmian in the late 1950s) is not mentioned afterwards, and was probably replaced by the name '''Huihu''' (Uyghur) in historic records.

Heduohan's brother [[Yujiul\u00fc Shelun|Shelun]] raided several tribal dependencies of the [[Tuoba]] in retaliation, but reportedly suffered a serious defeat in 399, and was forced to flee westward.  Here Shelun defeated the Hulu (\u659b\u5f8b) tribe and subjugated them. With the aid of a Hulu named Chiluohou (\u53f1\u6d1b\u4faf), Shelun conquered most of the Gaoche tribes and proclaimed himself Kaghan of the Rouran on March 11, 402. Many Gaoche, such as Chiluohou, were promoted to establish better control.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 208\u2013211.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 7,105 (Vol.27).</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Shelun and his successor [[Yujiul\u00fc Datan|Datan]], the Rouran pushed as far as the [[Issyk Kul]], where they defeated the [[Wusun]] and drove them to the south.

The Western Chile (mainly the Hulu and Tiele related to Fufuluo's Qifuli (\u6ce3\u4f0f\u5229) clan) rebelled between 524\uff0d526, moved further south and were eventually assimilated.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 272\u2013273, 315\u2013320.</ref>\n\nWith the loss of numerous subjects and vital resources, the Rouran went into a temporary decline. However, in 460 they launched new campaigns in the west, destroying the remnant of [[Northern Liang]]. During a campaign against [[Khotan]] in 470, the king wrote in his supplicatory letter to the Toba Emperor that all of the statelets in the west had submitted to the Rouran. In 472, [[Yujiul\u00fc Yucheng|Yucheng]] attacked Northern Wei across the western border. By the time of his death in 485, Yucheng had restored the Kaghanate to a status even more powerful than the times of Datan.\n\nDuring these wars, a southwestern Gaoche tribal group known as the '''Fufuluo''' united twelve clans and rebelled, but were defeated by the Rouran. They escaped and established a state northwest of [[Gaochang]] in 487. From then on, little is known about the rest of the Gaoche until the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]].\n\n===Fufuluo===\nThe Fufuluo (\u526f\u4f0f\u7f57) were a Gaoche tribe of twelve clans, dwelling close to the Gaochang kingdom (likely by the Tuin River of the [[Govi-Altai Province|Govi-Altai range]]. Early on a Fufuluo clan known as the Yizhan (which had lived there since the mid 2nd century) allied with the Touba.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 186.</ref> In 481, the Fufuluo began to interfere with the [[Gaochang]] and deposed one of their kings. After the death of Yucheng, his belligerent son [[Yujiul\u00fc Doulun|Dulun]] fought more wars against the Touba.\n\nAfter a disagreement, A-Fuzhiluo betrayed him, and in 487, together with his younger cousin Qiongqi (\u7a77\u5947), they managed their clans of over 100,000 yurts to escape from the pursuing armies, led by Dulun and his uncle [[Yujiul\u00fc Nagai|Nagai]] by defeating them.\n\nAfter they settled, he founded a statelet (also known as the A-Fuzhiluo kingdom) under the title of Ulu Beglik (\u5019\u5a04\u5310\u52d2, based on an interpretation of [[Shiratori Kurakichi]] and [[Edwin G. Pulleyblank|Pulleyblank]]). Like the later Qibi and [[Xueyantuo]] in 605, the Fufuluo divided their rule between north and south at [[Dzungaria]].<ref name=\"highcart\" /> <ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 38, 217\u2013219, 366\u2013367.</ref>\n\nThe Fufuluo allied with the Northern Wei in 490 and fought against the Rouran until 541 when they were dispersed by them.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 216, 226, 229\u2013230, 252.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of Dulun in 492, several important cities on the eastern route were taken by Fufuluo, separating the Rouran from the west. With the elimination of Rouran influence, the [[Hephthalite]]s, kindred steppe nomads, for the first time extended their domain as far as [[Karashahr]], where Qiongqi was killed and his son Mietu (\u5f25\u4fc4\u7a81) was taken hostage{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nAfter 507, the [[Hephthalites]] uninterruptedly sent eighteen embassies with gifts (\u671d\u732e/\u671d\u8d21) to the Chinese courts (twelve to [[Northern Wei]], three to [[Liang Dynasty]], two to [[Western Wei]] and one to [[Northern Zhou]]), as opposed to only one in 456.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 235\u2013239.</ref> Like [[Peroz I]] and his son [[Kavadh I]] earlier in the west, the Hephthalites helped Mietu. He returned to his realm and [[Biliyan]] (\u8dcb\u5229\u5ef6), the successor of A-Fuzhiluo, was overthrown by his tribesmen, while shortly paying tribute to the Touba. In 508, [[Yujiul\u00fc Futu|Futu]] attacked the Fufuluo and gained a victory, but was killed by Mietu on his course back. Later in 516, [[Yujiul\u00fc Chounu|Chounu]], son of Futu, defeated Mietu, and in reprisal had him towed to death by a horse. The Fufuluo went for several years into exile under the refuge of the Hephthalites. In 520, Chounu was repulsed by his younger brother Yifu (\u4f0a\u5310) who restored the realm. After his defeat, Chounu returned to the east, where he was killed in a coup in which the ruling clan of Yujiulu (\u90c1\u4e45\u95fe) was split into two factions. In 521, the Fufuluo penetrated into the Rouran territory, but were finally repulsed by 524. Thereafter, the Fufuluo suffered a series of defeats from [[Yujiul\u00fc Anagui|Anagui]] before being annihilated in 541. During the final decade, they helped the [[Eastern Wei]] to fight the [[Western Wei]] in a civil war. After defeat, the nobility surrendered to them.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 242\u2013254.</ref>\n\n=== Rulers of Gaoche ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In 603 he was revolted against by the Tiele tribes, provoked by the Chinese, and fled to the [[Tuyuhun Kingdom|Tuyuhun]].<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 344, 349\u2013352.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 10,680 (Vol.41) 10,795, 10,805, 10,857 (Vol.42).</ref> Earlier, when Apa was captured, Nili took over from him, but he died after the defeat of Tardu in the east. His son [[Heshana Khan]] succeeded him in the Western Qaghanate, levying heavy taxes on the Tiele. To prevent a revolt he gathered several hundreds of chiefs and murdered them. In 605 an alliance among the Tiele under the Qibi (\u5951\u82fe) and Xueyantuo (\u859b\u5ef6\u9640) tribes was formed to overthrow him. They captured most of the Dzungaria and defeated his occupying army, taking several important cities, including [[Kumul, Xinjiang|Kumul]], Karashahr and [[Gaochang]], pushing Heshana Khan further west to the lower [[Ili River]] by 607.\n\nAfter victory, the Qibi chief Geleng (\u54e5\u695e) was proclaimed as the qaghan by the tribes and the Xueyantuo chief [[Yiedie Khan]] as subordinate qaghan. At the same year Geleng allied with the Chinese to defeat the Tuyuhun to resolve a conflict at [[Dunhuang]].\n\nIn 611, Shekui, a qaghan from [[Tashkent]] and grandson of Tardu, attacked [[Ashina Xichun|Chuluo]] and forced him to escape to China. The return of Shekui marked the end of the rebellion, although exactly when the rebels were put down is uncertain. One Chinese account indicated that the Gaochang kingdom still remained under their vassal until the year 612. They were most likely subdued after this year as Shekui restored order in the Western Qaghanate.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 352\u2013356.</ref>\n\nFailure to put down these uprisings led to a fatal division within the G\u00f6kturks ruling Ashina clan. Under the leadership of [[Zhenzhu Khan]] in 628, grandson of Yishibo, the [[Xueyantuo]] made their crossing over the Altai, and quickly founded a confederation with the rest of the Tiele at the east.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 360.</ref>\n\nThe Xueyantuo founded a short-lived Qaghanate over the steppe under [[Zhenzhu Khan]], his son [[Duomi Khan]] and nephew [[Yitewushi Khan]], the last of which eventually surrendered to the Chinese.\n\n=== Chinese subjugation ===\nShortly after 646, the Uyghur and the rest of the twelve Tiele chiefs (and subsequently the far-away Guligan and Dubo) arrived at the Chinese court. They were bestowed either with the title of commander-in-chief (\u90fd\u7763 ''dudu'') or prefect (\u523a\u53f2 ''{{transl|cmn|cishi}}'') under the [[Jimi system|loose control]] (\u7f81\u7e3b ''jimi'') of the northern protectorate or \"pacificed north\" (\u5b89\u5317\u5e9c), whose seat and name changed at certain times.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 445\u2013449.</ref>\n\nThe Uyghur were prominent among the Tiele tribes next to the Xueyantuo. Their name first appeared in 390 as ''Yuanhe'' (\u8881\u7ea5). Under the leadership of Pusa (\u83e9\u8428), son of chief Tejian (\u7279\u5065), the Uyghur co-operated with the Xueyantuo to make a stand against the Eastern Qaghanate. Soon after his death, his successor Tumidu (\u5410\u8ff7\u5ea6) formed a new alliance with the Chinese and turned against his former ally. Thereafter, Tumidu was granted a Chinese title like the rest of the Tiele chiefs, and carried the title of qaghan among the other tribes, who now annually donated  furs to the Chinese to fulfill their tax obligations.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 186, 451, 453\u2013457.</ref>\n\nIn 648, Tumidu was murdered by his nephew Wuhe (\u4e4c\u7ea5) and another tribesman named Juluobo (\u4ff1\u7f57\u52c3). Both were sons-in-law of the [[Chebi Khan]], the ruler of the Eastern Qaghanate at the northern Altai, who now held hegemony over the surrounding tribes, including the Qarluq. This alerted the Chinese, and Wuhe was assassinated by a ruse upon receiving his uncle's position from the Chinese deputy in the north. Later Juluobo was detained by the Chinese. On November 17, Porun (\u5a46\u95f0) was granted his fathers title.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 457\u2013458.</ref>\n\nSince their submission, the Tiele (mainly the Uyghur) had participated in several campaigns under Chinese leadership. Under the command of Ashina Sheer (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u793e\u5c14), Yuan Lichen (\u5143\u793c\u81e3), Gao Kan (\u9ad8\u4f83), Liang Jianfang (\u6881\u5efa\u65b9), Cheng Zhijie (\u7a0b\u77e5\u8282), [[Su Ding Fang]] and Xiao Siya (\u8427\u55e3\u4e1a) this resulted in the capture of Chebi Khan in 650 and the end of the Western Qaghanate in 657, except for a last campaign at [[Goguryeo]] which probably killed Porun.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 459\u2013470, 493.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 11,972 (Vol.47).</ref>\n\nDuring those campaigns, visits would be paid to restrain the tribes. In 658 such a visit was repelled, and a revolt broke out in 660 starting with the Sijie (\u601d\u7ed3), Bayegu (\u62d4\u91ce\u53e4), Pugu (\u4ec6\u9aa8) and Tongluo (\u540c\u7f57). The reason for this revolt is unclear, perhaps due to the Chinese repression of the surrounding tribes during the campaigns.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 472\u2013475.</ref> Two years later the revolts were suppressed by the Chinese at the upper [[Selenge River]] around [[Khangai Mountains|Khangai]]. The battle was short, and a massacre was said to be committed by the two leading commanders. According to one exaggerated account from [[Tang Huiyao]] around 900,000 surrendered tribesmen were slaughtered, though it is certain that a large number of them were captured.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 477\u2013478.</ref> After the event, a message was sent to the north to appease the restless Tiele.\n\nIn 669 similar unsuccessful revolts had been made by the Xueyantuo, but the details of these are vague.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 479\u2013481.</ref> The last revolt was mentioned in 686, led by the Pugu and Tongluo to join with the Ashina clan, who had formed the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]] under [[Ilterish Qaghan]] in 682. They were immediately suppressed by an army dispatched from [[Juyan]]. A number of them were moved to that region along with the seat of the protectorate under the jurisdiction of [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]]. Earlier during the rebellion contacts between the northern protectorate and the Chinese capital were cut off, and the only way to pass was through the area of [[Jiuquan|Suzhou]].<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 482\u2013488.</ref>\n\n=== Rise of the Uyghur Khaganate ===\n{{Main article|Uyghur Khaganate}}\nAfter the disintegration of the Eastern Qaghanate in 630, many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk nobles were resettled either at the Chinese border or in the capital. Some went on to participate in frontier campaigns for the Chinese.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 413.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 11,660 (Vol.46).</ref>\n\nIn 679 a major rebellion was led by three G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk nobles{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Among them, Ashina Nishufu (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u6ce5\u719f\u5310), a direct descendant of Illig, was chosen as their qaghan. They were quickly subdued by the Chinese and their leader was betrayed and killed by his own troops. The rest of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks managed to escape and allied themselves with Ashina Funian (\u963f\u53f2\u90a3\u4f0f\u5ff5) for a new rebellion. Funian declared himself qaghan in 681, but his revolt did not succeed and more than fifty participants were executed on November 16 at the Chinese capital.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 481, 483.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 12,265, 12,273, 12,284, 12,292 (Vol.48).</ref> The remaining rebellious G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks formed the Second Turkic Eastern Qaghanate under Ilteris Sad and his 5,000 supporters. They were mostly active in the southern region bordering China at mount \u010co\u03b3ay (\u603b\u6750\u5c71). Over the decade they held countless raids across the Chinese border.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 483, 495.</ref>\n\nExactly when or how the Tiele came under their subjection is unclear. However, during this period, a number of pro-Chinese Tiele groups who had earlier cooperated with the Chinese against them, such as Uyghur, Qibi, Sijie and Hun (\u6d51), escaped into the [[Hexi Corridor]] and eventually resettled to [[Wuwei, Gansu|Liangzhou]].\n\nAccording to the Tonyukuk and K\u00fcltigin [[Orkhon script]], the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks made five out of forty-seven attacks on the Tiele who were led by Ilteris. Among them, four seem to have been mere raids while the last attack could be seen as their re-subjection on the northern steppe. The estimated date for the Tiele submission to the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks would be around 687, probably without much resistance.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 484, 501\u2013505, 523.</ref>\n\nThe establishment of a second G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk capital at the foot of the sacred mountain \u00d6t\u00fcken (\u90fd\u65a4\u5c71) brought unrest to the Tiele tribes. After the Uyghur chief was killed, they were recruited for their annual raiding campaigns over the Chinese border after 694.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 434, 505\u2013509.</ref> These raids were halted in 708, as the Chinese constructed fortifications along the Ordos. Raids continued elsewhere as [[Qapagan Khan|Qapagan]] turned his attention to the west and the [[Turgesh]] and [[Karl\u00edk|Qarluq]] tribes between 708 and 715. By this time, some of the Tiele had escaped into China and were settled in [[Yinchuan|Lingzhou]] and elsewhere, while others like the Bayegu had revolted in 707. These revolts continued until 716 and Qapagan, on his way back from suppressing revolts by the Uyghur, Tongluo, Baixi, Bayegu and Pugu, was ambushed and killed by a Bayegu tribesman named Xiezhilue (\u9889\u8d28\u7565) on July 22. In conclusion, not all tribes were involved in the revolts. Two of the northernmost tribal allies, the Guligan and Dubo (\u90fd\u64ad) did not participate in any of the revolts.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 509\u2013511, 515.</ref><ref>Bo Yang, \"Zizhi Tongjian\", p. 12,852 (Vol.50).</ref>\n\nSoon, [[Bilge Khan]] took over the reign and together with [[Tonyukuk]], began to appease the subjected Tiele. Tonyukuk was born in China and was considered a wise statesman in both Turkic and Chinese accounts. Meanwhile, a friendly relationship was built with the Chinese. Till the end of the Second Eastern Qaghanate only one raid in 720 was made on the Chinese border. Bilge Khan started to call for a return of the former members of the Tiele tribes who had settled in China. He had risen in status among the tribal chiefs, especially the Uyghur within the Qaghanate.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 517\u2013520.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, many Tiele had betrayed the local Chinese authorities and fled to the north, in particular the five communities around Liang, Ling, [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Xia]], [[Baynnur|Feng]], and [[Shuozhou|Bingzhou]], while minor insurgencies had occurred throughout the process.<ref>Duan, \"Dingling, Gaoju and Tiele\", p. 532\u2013539.</ref> Among the returning Tiele tribes was the Uyghur, specifically the Yaoluoge, who had escaped into China until 727. The Yaoluoge consisted one of nine<ref>1. Huduoge (\u80e1\u5484\u845b) 2. Guluowu (\u5552\u7f57\u52ff) 3. Mogexiqi (\u8c8a\u6b4c\u606f\u8bab) 4. A-Wudi (\u963f\u52ff\u5600) 5. Gesa (\u845b\u8428) 6.

Within a few years, an alliance was established between the [[Basmyl]] (\u62d4\u6089\u871c), Uyghur and Qarluq. They overthrew the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and killed the qaghan. Most of the heirs were killed subsequently. At the same time the Basmyl chief, who was approved as qaghan, was overthrown by the allies.\n\nIn 745 the exiled qaghan of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks was killed by an Uyghur chief named Qutlugh Boyla, son of Hushu (\u62a4\u8f93). He founded the new [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghur Qaghanate]] under the title of Qutlugh Bilge K\u00f6l Qaghan. The name \"Tiele\", and the \"nine allies (of Tiele)\" (\u4e5d\u59d3) or '''Toquz Oguz''' (based on the interpretation of scholar Cen Zhongmian in the late 1950s) is not mentioned afterwards, and was probably replaced by the name '''Huihu''' (Uyghur) in historic records.

At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage [[electric power transmission]] system.\n\nA transmission line is required to bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable. Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation.\n\nOne of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states in the middle of the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">Wald, Matthew (26 August 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Wind Energy Bumps Into Power Grid\u2019s Limits]. ''New York Times''</ref> As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances.<ref>Power System Analysis and Design.Glover, Sarma, Overbye/ 5th Edition</ref> However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.<ref>[http://www.pressherald.com/news/there-is-a-problem-withwind-power-in-maine_2013-08-04.html?pagenum=full Inadequate transmission lines keeping some Maine wind power off the grid \u2013 The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram].

In the image, wind power [[Wind power in Spain|generators in Spain]], near an [[Osborne bull]].]]\n\nElectric power generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-[[Intermittent power sources#Terminology|dispatchable]] nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental [[operating reserve]], and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing [[energy demand management]], [[load shedding]], storage solutions or system interconnection with [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] cables.\n\nFluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large fossil-fuel generating units requires operating reserve capacity, which can be increased to compensate for variability of wind generation.\n\nWind power is variable, and during low wind periods it must be replaced by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of [[intermittent power source]]s such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.\n\nPresently, grid systems with large wind penetration require a small increase in the frequency of usage of [[natural gas]] spinning reserve power plants to prevent a loss of electric power in the event that there is no wind. At low wind power penetration, this is less of an issue.<ref name=\"is windpower reliable\" /><ref name=\"clavertonReliable\" /><ref>Milligan, Michael (October 2010) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49019.pdf Operating Reserves and Wind Power Integration: An International Comparison].

Despite the small capacity, it is enough to guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 percent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants.<ref>Bullis, Kevin. \"[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/514331/wind-turbines-battery-included-can-keep-power-supplies-stable/ Wind Turbines, Battery Included, Can Keep Power Supplies Stable]\" [[Technology Review]], 7 May 2013.

During hours of low electrical demand excess [[electrical grid]] power is used to pump water up into the reservoir, which then provides an extra 174 MW of electric power during periods of peak demand.]]\n\nTypically, conventional [[hydroelectricity]] complements wind power very well. When the wind is blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.\n\nAlternatively, where a suitable head of water is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] or other forms of [[grid energy storage]] such as [[compressed air energy storage]] and [[thermal energy storage]] can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level \u2013 low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage \u2013 as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this [[arbitrage]] can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW [[Dinorwig pumped storage plant|Dinorwig pumped-storage plant]] evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.<ref name=\"dinorwig\" /><ref name=\"futureStorage\" />\n\nIn particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power. In the U.S. states of [[Wind power in California|California]] and [[Wind power in Texas|Texas]], for example, hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to the use of [[air conditioning]]. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of [[geothermal heat pump]]s by their customers, to reduce electric power demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient;<ref name=\"geothermal_incentive\" /> widespread adoption of this technology would better match electric power demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds. A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC \"[[super grid]]\". In the U.S. it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least USD 60 bn,<ref name=\"slogin\" /> while the society value of added windpower would be more than that cost.<ref name=usvis>\"[https://www.energy.gov/windvision A New Era for Wind Power in the United States]\" p. xiv.

Arrays of large turbines, known as [[wind farm]]s, have become an increasingly important source of [[renewable energy]] and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on [[fossil fuel]]s.\n\nWind turbine design is the process of defining the form and specifications of a [[wind turbine]] to extract energy from the [[wind]].<ref name=\"BERR\">{{cite web | publisher =UK Department for Business, Enterprise & Regulatory Reform | title =Efficiency and performance |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file17821.pdf | accessdate =29 December 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090205054846/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file17821.pdf | archivedate =5 February 2009 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nA wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert [[mechanical energy|mechanical rotation]] into [[electrical power]], and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.\n\nIn 1919 the German physicist [[Albert Betz]] showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine, the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16/27 (59%) of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured. This [[Betz' law|Betz limit]] can be approached in modern turbine designs, which may reach 70 to 80% of the theoretical Betz limit.<ref>[[Albert Betz|Betz, A.]]; Randall, D. G. (trans.).

The air flow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the [[aerodynamics]] of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/what-factors-affect-the-output-of-wind-turbines/ | title=What factors affect the output of wind turbines? | publisher=Alternative-energy-news.info | date=24 July 2009 | accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the aerodynamic [[Wind turbine design#Blade design|design of the blades]], the design of a complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation's [[Wind turbine design#The hub|rotor hub]], [[Nacelle (wind turbine)|nacelle]], [[Wind turbine design#Tower|tower structure]], [[Electric generator|generator]], controls, and foundation.<ref name=\"univ2011\">{{cite web |author1=Zehnder, Alan T. |author2=Warhaft, Zellman\n |lastauthoramp=yes |title=University Collaboration on Wind Energy |date=27 July 2011 |url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf |publisher=Cornell University [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] |accessdate=22 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901005908/http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/attachments/2011-UnivWindCollaboration.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2011 |df=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|float=right|{{Portal|Renewable energy|Energy|Wind power}}}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[100% renewable energy]]\n* [[Airborne wind turbine]]\n* [[Cost of electricity by source]]\n* [[Global Wind Day]]\n* [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources]]\n* [[List of wind turbine manufacturers]]\n* [[Lists of offshore wind farms by country]]\n* [[Lists of wind farms by country]]\n* [[Outline of wind energy]]\n* [[Renewable energy by country]]\n* [[Wind resource assessment]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=home-made>[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Migration/article100906.ece Home-made energy to prop up grid] [[The Times]] 22 June 2008 Retrieved on 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n<ref name=ceereCapInter>[http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf Wind Power: Capacity Factor, Intermittency, and what happens when the wind doesn't blow?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001205145/http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf |date=1 October 2008}}.

At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage [[electric power transmission]] system.\n\nA transmission line is required to bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable. Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation.\n\nOne of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states in the middle of the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">Wald, Matthew (26 August 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Wind Energy Bumps Into Power Grid\u2019s Limits]. ''New York Times''</ref> As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances.<ref>Power System Analysis and Design.Glover, Sarma, Overbye/ 5th Edition</ref> However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.<ref>[http://www.pressherald.com/news/there-is-a-problem-withwind-power-in-maine_2013-08-04.html?pagenum=full Inadequate transmission lines keeping some Maine wind power off the grid \u2013 The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram].

Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-[[Intermittent power sources#Terminology|dispatchable]] nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental [[operating reserve]], and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing [[energy demand management]], [[load shedding]], storage solutions or system interconnection with [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] cables.\n\nFluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large fossil-fuel generating units requires operating reserve capacity, which can be increased to compensate for variability of wind generation.\n\nWind power is variable, and during low wind periods it must be replaced by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of [[intermittent power source]]s such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.\n\nPresently, grid systems with large wind penetration require a small increase in the frequency of usage of [[natural gas]] spinning reserve power plants to prevent a loss of electric power in the event that there is no wind. At low wind power penetration, this is less of an issue.<ref name=\"is windpower reliable\" /><ref name=\"clavertonReliable\" /><ref>Milligan, Michael (October 2010) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49019.pdf Operating Reserves and Wind Power Integration: An International Comparison].

During hours of low electrical demand excess [[electrical grid]] power is used to pump water up into the reservoir, which then provides an extra 174 MW of electric power during periods of peak demand.]]\n\nTypically, conventional [[hydroelectricity]] complements wind power very well. When the wind is blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.\n\nAlternatively, where a suitable head of water is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] or other forms of [[grid energy storage]] such as [[compressed air energy storage]] and [[thermal energy storage]] can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level \u2013 low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage \u2013 as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this [[arbitrage]] can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW [[Dinorwig pumped storage plant|Dinorwig pumped-storage plant]] evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.<ref name=\"dinorwig\" /><ref name=\"futureStorage\" />\n\nIn particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power. In the U.S. states of [[Wind power in California|California]] and [[Wind power in Texas|Texas]], for example, hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to the use of [[air conditioning]]. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of [[geothermal heat pump]]s by their customers, to reduce electric power demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient;<ref name=\"geothermal_incentive\" /> widespread adoption of this technology would better match electric power demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds. A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC \"[[super grid]]\".

The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74&nbsp;billion for energy subsidies to support [[R&D]] for [[nuclear power]] ($50 billion) and [[fossil fuels]] ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, [[renewable energy]] technologies and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] received a total of US$26&nbsp;billion.

Between 2010 and 2016, subsidies for wind were between 1.3\u00a2 and 5.7\u00a2 per kWh. Subsidies for coal, natural gas and nuclear are all between 0.05\u00a2 and 0.2\u00a2 per kWh over all years.

The smallest turbines are used for applications such as [[Battery charger|battery charging]] for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the [[electrical grid]].

In addition the [[aerodynamics]] of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields.

The rivalry between these two schools, located about {{convert|80|mi|km}} apart, dates to their first men's [[college basketball]] game in 1921, and has continued across all sports, with the [[college football|football]] series gaining attention as well, having started in 1929. Both universities share common characteristics, both being over 200 year old institutions in urban settings. The schools have also shared conferences historically, with the rivalry stretching over the span of four conferences from the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], to the [[Metro Conference]] to [[Conference USA]], and more recently in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]], which in 2013 was renamed to the [[American Athletic Conference]]. After the 2013\u201314 season, Louisville joined the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] and since then the rivalry has been put on hiatus in football and basketball. However, many other sports at the universities, such as baseball, continue to battle periodically. \n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:88%;\"\n|+ College Comparison\n! \n! style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Cincinnati Bearcats}}\" | [[University of Cincinnati|{{white|Cincinnati}}]]\n! style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Louisville Cardinals}}\" | [[University of Louisville|{{white|Louisville}}]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Founded\n| align=center | 1819 || align=center | 1798\n|-\n! scope=row | Type \n| align=center | [[Public university|Public]] || align=center |[[Public university|Public]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Location\n| align=center |  [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, OH]] || align=center | [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Conference \n| align=center |  [[American Athletic Conference|American]] || align=center | [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Students \n| align=center | 44,338 || align=center | 22,640\n|-\n! scope=row | School colors \n| align=center | {{color box|#E00122}} {{color box|Black}} || align=center | {{color box|#C9001F}} {{color box|Black}}\n|-\n! scope=row | Nickname \n| align=center |  [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Bearcats]] || align=center | [[Louisville Cardinals|Cardinals]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Stadium\n| align=center | [[Nippert Stadium]] || align=center | [[Cardinal Stadium]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Arena\n| align=center | [[Fifth Third Arena]] || align=center | [[KFC Yum!

Due to their close proximity, the universities became early athletic opponents as college athletics developed first facing off in 1921 in a men's [[college basketball]] game. Additionally, this proximity led to both schools being members of the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], [[Metro Conference]], [[Conference USA]], and the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] historically. While the rivalry was represented annually in Football from 1966\u20131992 and 1996\u20132013, the true intensity of the rivalry was felt on the basketball court. Legendary coaches [[Denny Crum]], [[Bob Huggins]], and [[Rick Pitino]] each played their part in famous wins for each program and fanning the flames of the matchup. \n\nIn the last year of the rivalry in football and basketball for the foreseeable future, the contests lived up to the pressure. In the battle for [[The Keg of Nails]], [[Teddy Bridgewater]] led the No. 19 Cardinals to an overtime comeback at [[Nippert Stadium]] much to the ire of the Bearcat faithful. On the hardwood both teams would claim upset, ranked wins at their opponent's home court. [[Sean Kilpatrick]] lead the Bearcats to a 69\u201366 victory at the [[KFC Yum! Center]] while [[Russ Smith (basketball)|Russ Smith]] and the Cardinals would beat the Bearcats 58\u201357 at [[Fifth Third Arena]] in their last matchup.\n\n==Football==\n{{Main|The Keg of Nails}}\n{{See also|Cincinnati Bearcats football|Louisville Cardinals football}}\n\n==Men's Basketball==\n{{Infobox sports rivalry\n| wide                  = yes\n| name                  = Cincinnati\u2013Louisville basketball rivalry\n| image                 = \n| image_size            = \n| caption               = \n| team1                 = [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati Bearcats]]\n| team1logo             = Cincinnati University Bearcats textlogo.svg\n| team2                 = [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]]\n| team2logo             = Louisville Cardinals wordmark.svg\n| sport                 = [[College Basketball]]\n| firstmeeting          = January 17, 1921<br />Cincinnati 36 \u2013 Louisville 16\n| mostrecent            = February 22, 2014<br />Cincinnati 57 \u2013 Louisville 58\n| nextmeeting           = \n| total                 = 99\n| series                = Louisville leads, 53\u201343\n| largestvictory        = \n| longeststreak         = Louisville, 16 (January 19, 1977 \u2013 March 8, 1984)\n| longestunbeatenstreak = \n| currentstreak         = \n| currentunbeatenstreak = \n| trophy                = \n| trophy series         = \n| stadiums              =  \n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:88%;\"\n|+ Men's Basketball Comparison\n! \n! style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Cincinnati Bearcats}}\" | [[University of Cincinnati|{{white|Cincinnati}}]]\n! style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Louisville Cardinals}}\" | [[University of Louisville|{{white|Louisville}}]]\n|-\n! scope=row | First Season\n| align=center | 1901 || align=center | 1911\n|-\n! scope=row | NCAA Championships\n| align=center | 2 || align=center | 3*\n|-\n! scope=row | NCAA Tournament Appearances\n| align=center | 33 || align=center | 43*\n|-\n! scope=row | Conference Championships \n| align=center | 29 || align=center | 23*\n|-\n! scope=row | Conference Tournament Championships\n| align=center | 12 || align=center | 19*\n|-\n! scope=row | All-Americans\n| align=center |  44 || align=center | 25\n|-\n! scope=row | Consensus 1st Team All-Americans\n| align=center | 8 || align=center | 7\n|-\n! scope=row | Player of the Year\n| align=center | 3 || align=center | 1\n|-\n! scope=row | Conference Player of the Year\n| align=center | 10 || align=center | 10\n|}\n{{See also|Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals men's basketball}}\n[[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] were rivals, first playing in 1921, until the [[2010\u201314 NCAA conference realignment]] put the contest on hiatus, as Louisville moved to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] on July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|title=ACC votes to add Louisville in 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312052203/http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref> The teams have faced off 99 times in basketball series history, with Louisville leading the all-time series 53\u201343.<ref name=\"Media Guide\">{{cite news|url=https://gobearcats.com/documents/2018/10/19/2018_19_Cincinnati_MBB_Media_Guide.pdf|title=UC Basketball Media Guide|publisher=GoBearcats|accessdate=January 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Bearcats and Cardinals have played in eight conference tournaments, with the Bearcats and Cardinals tied at 4\u20134.

The rivalry between these two schools, located about {{convert|80|mi|km}} apart, dates to their first men's [[college basketball]] game in 1921, and has continued across all sports, with the [[college football|football]] series gaining attention as well, having started in 1929. Both universities share common characteristics, both being over 200 year old institutions in urban settings. The schools have also shared conferences historically, with the rivalry stretching over the span of four conferences from the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], to the [[Metro Conference]] to [[Conference USA]], and more recently in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]], which in 2013 was renamed to the [[American Athletic Conference]]. After the 2013\u201314 season, Louisville joined the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] and since then the rivalry has been put on hiatus in football and basketball. However, many other sports at the universities, such as baseball, continue to battle periodically. \n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:88%;\"\n|+ College Comparison\n! \n! style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Cincinnati Bearcats}}\" | [[University of Cincinnati|{{white|Cincinnati}}]]\n! style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Louisville Cardinals}}\" | [[University of Louisville|{{white|Louisville}}]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Founded\n| align=center | 1819 || align=center | 1798\n|-\n! scope=row | Type \n| align=center | [[Public university|Public]] || align=center |[[Public university|Public]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Location\n| align=center |  [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, OH]] || align=center | [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Conference \n| align=center |  [[American Athletic Conference|American]] || align=center | [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Students \n| align=center | 44,338 || align=center | 22,640\n|-\n! scope=row | School colors \n| align=center | {{color box|#E00122}} {{color box|Black}} || align=center | {{color box|#C9001F}} {{color box|Black}}\n|-\n! scope=row | Nickname \n| align=center |  [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Bearcats]] || align=center | [[Louisville Cardinals|Cardinals]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Stadium\n| align=center | [[Nippert Stadium]] || align=center | [[Cardinal Stadium]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Arena\n| align=center | [[Fifth Third Arena]] || align=center | [[KFC Yum!

Due to their close proximity, the universities became early athletic opponents as college athletics developed first facing off in 1921 in a men's [[college basketball]] game. Additionally, this proximity led to both schools being members of the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], [[Metro Conference]], [[Conference USA]], and the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] historically. While the rivalry was represented annually in Football from 1966\u20131992 and 1996\u20132013, the true intensity of the rivalry was felt on the basketball court. Legendary coaches [[Denny Crum]], [[Bob Huggins]], and [[Rick Pitino]] each played their part in famous wins for each program and fanning the flames of the matchup. \n\nIn the last year of the rivalry in football and basketball for the foreseeable future, the contests lived up to the pressure. In the battle for [[The Keg of Nails]], [[Teddy Bridgewater]] led the No. 19 Cardinals to an overtime comeback at [[Nippert Stadium]] much to the ire of the Bearcat faithful. On the hardwood both teams would claim upset, ranked wins at their opponent's home court. [[Sean Kilpatrick]] lead the Bearcats to a 69\u201366 victory at the [[KFC Yum!

The first issue was triple-sized (70 pages) in order to properly introduce the various characters and factions.<ref name=TheAtlantic/>\n\nLiu and Takeda first worked together on Liu's run of ''[[X-23]]'' for [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]. Liu would later describe her work with Takeda as \"a wonderful process; it felt like she was reading my mind.\" A native of Japan, Takeda's art takes inspiration from [[manga]].<ref name=TheAtlantic/>\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:5.30.19MarjorieLiuByLuigiNovi51.jpg|thumb|left|Liu at a 2019 signing for ''Monstress'' #24 at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan]]\nAccording to Liu, among the series's themes are the inner strength required to withstand constant dehumanization, as well as the power of friendship among women.<ref name=HollywoodReporter>{{cite news|last1=McMillan|first1=Graeme|title='Monstress': Inside The Fantasy Comic About Race, Feminism And The Monster Within|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/monstress-inside-fantasy-comic-race-836391|accessdate=24 November 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=3 November 2015}}</ref> Race also plays a large role in the series. In the series the Arcanics, a race of magical creatures, have been at war with humans for decades, and they are now at a stalemate; however the humans are taking Arcanics and selling them as slaves to other humans.<ref name=HollywoodReporter/>\n\n== Reception ==\nThe first, triple-sized issue of ''Monstress'' received critical praise. Writing for ''[[Kotaku]]'', Evan Narcisse called it \"a gorgeous comic book about racism, war and slavery\", noting the intricate detail of Takeda's [[manga]]-inspired art.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Narcisse|first1=Evan|title=Monstress Is A Gorgeous Comic Book About Racism, War and Slavery|url=http://kotaku.com/monstress-is-a-gorgeous-comic-book-about-racism-war-an-1744178284|accessdate=24 November 2015|work=Kotaku|date=23 November 2015}}</ref> Reviewing the book for [[The A.V. Club]], Caitlin Rosberg described the leading characters, all women, as \"deeply flawed and showing layers of nuanced characterization that you don\u2019t often see in comic books\", and appreciated the series's \"sense of in-between-ness\u2014(...) neither traditionally Western nor manga, paced like a novel but drawn like a comic\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rosberg|first1=Caitlin|title=Monstress captivates with its fusion of Western comics and manga|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/monstress-captivates-its-fusion-western-comics-and-227787|accessdate=24 November 2015|work=A.V.
