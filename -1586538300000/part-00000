{"title_page": "Sri Lankan cuisine", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=March 2020}}\n'''Sri Lankan cuisine''' has been shaped by many historical, cultural and other factors. As a tropical island with an abundance of vegetation, the cuisine is known for a its use of a vast array of herbs, spices, fish, vegetables, rices, and fruits. The cuisine is highly centered around many varieties of [[rice]], as well as [[coconut]] which is an ubiquitous plant throughout the country. Seafood also plays a significant role in the cuisine, be it fresh fish or preserved fish. As an country that was a hub in the historic oceanic silk road, contact with foreign traders brought new food items and cultural influences in addition to the local traditions of the country's ethnic groups, all of which have helped shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Similarities can be seen to the cuisines of other South Asian neighbouring regions (particularly to the state of Kerala in Southern India), as well as to some South East Asian cuisines. \n\nSri Lanka was historically famous for its cinnamon. The ''true cinnamon'' tree, or [[Cinnamomum verum]] used to be botanically named ''Cinnamomum zeylanicum'' to reflect its Sri Lankan origins. This is a widely utilized spice in Sri Lanka, and has a more delicate, sweet taste in comparison to  [[Cinnamomum cassia]] which is more common in some other South Asian cuisines. Contrasting the local cuisine with those of neighbouring regions, Sri Lankan cuisine is characterized by unique spice blends with heavy use of Sri Lankan cinnamon and black pepper, as well as by the use of ingredients such as [[maldive fish]], [[goraka]] (garcinia cambogia), [[pandan leaf]], [[lemongrass]], and [[jaggery]] made from the kithul palm syrup. Sri Lanka is also a consumer of many varieties of red rice, some of which are considered heirloom rices in the country. Tea is also an important beverage throughout the country, and Sri Lanka is known for producing some of the world's finest tea.\n\n== Common Ingredients ==\n\n'''Spices:''' [[True cinnamon]], [[black pepper]], [[fennel]], [[cardamom]], [[cloves]], [[fenugreek]], [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[cumin]],  [[coriander]],  [[turmeric]]\n\n'''Herbs:''' [[pandan leaf]], [[shallot]], [[goraka]], [[lemongrass]], [[tamarind]], [[garlic]], [[ginger]], [[curry leaf]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[cayenne pepper]] [[tabasco pepper]]\n\n'''Fish:''' [[maldive fish]], [[dried fish]], [[mackerel]], [[tuna]], [[shark]], [[sprats]], fermented preserved fish\n\n'''Grains:''' [[white rice]] (some common varieties are: Samba, Kekulu, Suwandel), [[red rice]] (some common varieties are: Kekulu, Pachchaperumal, Kaluheenati, Madathawalu), [[finger millet]], [[hog millet]], ''olu haal'' (water lily seed)<ref>http://serendib.btoptions.lk/article.php?id=2248</ref>\n\n'''Oils:'''  [[coconut oil]], [[sesame oil]], cow [[ghee]], buffalo ghee, [[mustard oil]]\n\n'''Sweetners:''' kithul [[jaggery]], coconut jaggery, [[palmyrah]] jaggery\n\n'''Vegetables and greens:''' [[gotukola]], [[green papaya]], [[snake beans]], [[bitter melon]], [[snake gourd]], [[luffa]], [[pumpkin]], [[winged bean]]\n\n'''Meats:''' [[chicken]], [[pork]], [[goat meat]], [[beef]]\n\n'''Yams, roots and tubers:''' [[lotus root]], [[purple yam]], [[tapioca]], ''kohila'' (Lasia spinosa), [[Arrowleaf elephant's ear]]\n\n'''Other:''' Coconut milk and grated coconut are ubiquitous in the cuisine, and are freshly prepated almost everyday in most households.

There are many variations of kevum.  ''Moong Kevum'' is a variant where [[mung bean]] flour is made into a paste and shaped like diamonds before frying. Other types of kevum include athiraha, konda kevum, athirasa, and handi kevum.\n\nMany sweets are served with [[kiribath]] milk rice during the [[Sinhalese New Year|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil New Year]]s.\nOther sweets include:\n\n''Cakes and pastries:''\n* [[Aluwa]] - Diamond-shaped rice-flour pastries\n* Bibikkan - A rich, cake-like sweet made from grated coconut, coconut treacle, and wheat flour. It is a speciality of coastal areas.\n* [[Kokis]] - A savoury crispy biscuit-like dish made from rice flour and [[coconut milk]].\n* Pushnambu - A rich, cake-like sweet made from coconut treacle and wheat flour. Cinnamon/[[cardamom]] and sweet [[cumin]] is often added among the Christian population of Sri Lanka.\n* [[Nian gao#Sri Lankan cuisine|Seenakku]] - a glutinous rice cake often served with grated coconut.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n''Treacle-flavored sweets:''\n* Undu Walalu/Undu wal or Pani walalu - A sweet from the Mathale area, prepared using [[urad (bean)|urad bean]] flour and [[Caryota urens|kithul]] treacle.\n* Aggala - Rice balls flavored with [[treacle]]\n* Weli Thalapa - Made from [[rice flour]] and coconut treacle\n* Aasmi - Made with [[rice flour]] and the juice of a leaf called [[''dawul kurundu''|Neolitsea cassia]] ([[okra]] juice can be used as a substitute), deep fried and topped with pink-coloured treacle.\n\n''Puddings and toffees:''\n* [[Kalu Dodol]] - A solid [[toffee]]-, jelly-like confection made by lengthy reduction of coconut milk, thickened with rice flour and sweetened with [[jaggery]].\n* [[Watalappam]] - A steamed pudding made with [[coconut milk]], [[eggs (food)|eggs]], and jaggery. First introduced by the [[Sri Lankan Malays|Malay]] immigrants, watalappam has become a staple of Sri Lankan desserts.\n\n''Other sweets:''\n* Thala Guli - Made from ground [[sesame]] and jaggery with finely grated coconut. \n* Kiri Toffee - Made with sweetened [[condensed milk]] or sugar-thickened pure cow's milk. Cardamom/sweet cumin and cashews are added for more taste.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Sri Lankan sweets\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"170px\"> \nFile:Konda Kavum 01.JPG|Konda Kevum\nFile:Kokis.JPG|Kokis\nFile:Kalu Dodol.JPG|Kalu Dodol\nFile:Sri Lankan Swiss roll.jpg|Sri Lankan Swiss roll\n</gallery>\n\n== Short eats ==\n\"[[snacks|Short eats]]\" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from \"short eat\" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening.\nShort eats include [[Pastry|pastries]], Chinese rolls and [[Patty|patties]]. Other short eats include:\n\n*Vade - parippu vade, [[medu vada|ulundu vade]], isso (shrimp) vade, crab vade\n*Chinese rolls or [[egg roll]]s, which often contain minced meats, potatoes, and vegetables\n*Patties and pastries  - filled with vegetables, meat, or fish\n*Vegetable/fish roti - a flatbread with a filling rolled into a triangular shape and baked\n\nShort eats are served at parties or to guests when they visit a home. Western food such as hot dogs and hamburgers have arrived in Sri Lanka, with the [[globalization]] of fast-food chains such as [[McDonald's]], [[KFC]] and [[Pizza Hut]]. However, foods from these establishments are not usually considered short eats. Additionally, hot dogs and hamburgers are also modified to fit local tastes.\n\n==Beverages==\nBeverages commonly served in Sri Lanka include:\n*[[Faluda]] - a mixture of syrup, ice cream, jelly pieces and [[basil]] seeds, served cold\n*Fruit juices - especially [[passionfruit]] juice\n*Toddy - a mildly alcoholic drink made from [[palm tree]] [[sap]]\n*[[Arrack (drink)|Arrack]] - a [[distilled spirit]] made from coconut\n*[[Tea]]\n* [[Papaya]] juice\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Sri Lanka|Food}}\n* [[Faluda]]\n* [[Kottu]]\n* [[Pittu]]\n* [[Traditional rice of Sri Lanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Cuisine of Sri Lanka}}\n{{Div col}} \n{{Div col end}}\n\n{{Sri Lankan cuisine}}\n{{Asian topic|| cuisine}}\n{{cuisine}}\n\n[[Category:Sri Lankan Tamil culture|Cuisine]]\n[[Category:Sri Lankan cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Sinhalese culture]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:mace\u2192mace (spice)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cuisine"}

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

The design was later selected as [[Messerschmitt]]'s competitor in the ''[[Reich Air Ministry|Reichsluftfahrtministerium]]''{{'}}s (the German Air Ministry) ''[[Amerikabomber]]'' programme, for a [[strategic bomber]] capable of attacking [[New York City]] from bases in [[France]] or the [[Azores]].\n\nThree [[prototype]]s were built but production was abandoned to allow Messerschmitt to concentrate on fighter production and the [[Junkers Ju 390]] was selected in its place. Developement continued as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft instead.\n\n==Development==\nThe origin of the Me 264 design came from Messerschmitt's long-range [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] aircraft project, the '''P.1061''', of the late 1930s. A variant on the P.1061 was the [[Messerschmitt Me 261|P.1062]] of which three prototypes were built, with only two \"engines\" to the P.1061's four, but they were, in fact, the more powerful [[Daimler-Benz_DB_601#Variants|Daimler-Benz DB 606]] \"power systems\", each comprising a pair of [[Daimler-Benz DB 601|DB 601]] inverted V-12 engines. These were also successfully used in the long-range [[Messerschmitt Me 261]], itself originating as the Messerschmitt P.1064 design of 1937. The DB 606's later use in the [[Heinkel He 177]]A's airframe design resulted in derision by ''Reichsmarschall'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as [[Heinkel He 177#Engine difficulties|\"welded-together engines\"]] in August 1942, due to badly designed engine installations. In early 1941, six P.1061 prototypes were ordered from Messerschmitt, under the designation '''Me 264'''. This was later reduced to three prototypes.\n\nThe progress of these projects was initially slow, but after Germany had declared war on the United States, the ''Reichsluftfahrtministerium'' (RLM) started the more serious ''[[Amerikabomber]]'' programme in the spring of 1942 for a very long range [[bomber]], with the result that a larger, six-engine aircraft with a greater bomb load was called for. Proposals were put forward for the [[Junkers Ju 390]], the [[Focke-Wulf Ta 400]], a redesign of the unfinalized and unbuilt [[Heinkel He 277]] design (itself only receiving its [[List of RLM aircraft designations#201-300|RLM airframe number]] by the February 1943 timeframe in order to give Heinkel an entry in the ''Amerikabomber'' program later in 1943), and a design study for a six-engine Messerschmitt Me 264B. The need for six engines was prompted by the ongoing inability of Germany's aviation powerplant designers to create [[Luftwaffe#Engine_development|reliable]] powerplants of 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) and above power output levels, thwarting efforts to do the same with just four engines instead. As the Junkers Ju 390 could use components already in use for the [[Junkers Ju 290|Ju 290]] this design was chosen. The Me 264 was not abandoned, however, as the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (German navy) separately demanded a long-range [[maritime patrol]] and attack aircraft to replace the converted [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200|Fw 200]] ''Condor'' in this role.<ref>Smith and Kay 1972, p. 550.</ref> This was reinforced by an opinion given by then-''Generalmajor'' [[Eccard Freiherr von Gablenz]] of the ''Wehrmacht Heer'' (German Army) in May 1942, who had been recruited by ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Erhard Milch]] to give his opinion on the suitability of the Me 264 for the ''Amerikabomber'' mission;  von Gablenz echoed the ''Kriegsmarine's'' later opinion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griehl |first1=Manfred |last2=Dressel |first2=Joachim |title=Heinkel He 177 - 277 - 274 |url= |accessdate= |year=1998 |publisher=Airlife Publishing |location=Shrewsbury, UK |isbn=1-85310-364-0 |page=186 }}</ref> As a result, the two pending prototypes were ordered to be completed as development prototypes for the Me 264A ultra long-range reconnaissance aircraft.<ref name=\"Green 1970, p. 641\">Green 1970, p. 641.</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe Me 264 was an all-metal, high-wing, four-engine [[heavy bomber]] of classic construction. The [[fuselage]] was round in cross-section and had a [[Aircraft cabin|cabin]] in a glazed nose, comprising a \"[[stepless (aircraft)|stepless cockpit]]\" with no separate windscreen section for the pilots, which was common for most later German bomber designs. A strikingly similar design was used for the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]], of slightly earlier origin. The wing had a slightly [[swept wing|swept]] [[leading edge]] and a straight [[trailing edge]]. The [[empennage]] had double [[vertical stabilizer|tail fin]]s. The [[landing gear|undercarriage]] was a retractable [[tricycle gear]] with large-diameter wheels on the wing-mounted main gear.\n\nThe planned armament consisted of guns in remotely operated [[gun turret|turret]]s and in positions on the sides of the fuselage. Overall, it carried very little armour and few guns as a means of increasing fuel capacity and range. The Me 264's first prototype was originally fitted with four [[Junkers Jumo 211]] inverted V12 engines using the then-new ''Kraftei'' (or \"[[power-egg]]\") unitized powerplant installation as standardized for the earlier [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88A]] ''[[Schnellbomber]]'', but inadequate power from the Jumo 211 engines led to their replacement on the Me 264 V1 first prototype with four similarly unitized 1,700&nbsp;[[Pferdest\u00e4rke|PS]] (1,250&nbsp;kW) BMW 801G engines. In order to provide comfort on the proposed long-range missions, the Me 264 featured [[bunk bed]]s and a small [[galley (kitchen)|galley]] complete with [[hot plate]]s.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1995-042-37, Schwerer Bomber Messerschmitt Me 264 V1.jpg|thumb|Me 264 V1 undergoing flight-testing.]]\nThe first prototype, the '''Me 264 V1''', bearing the ''Stammkennzeichen'' factory code of '''RE+EN''', was flown on 23 December 1942. It was powered at first by four [[Junkers Jumo 211|Jumo 211]]J [[inline engine (aviation)|inline engine]]s of 990&nbsp;kW (1,340&nbsp;hp) each. In late 1943, these were changed to the [[BMW 801]]G [[radial engine|radial]]s which delivered 1,290&nbsp;kW (1,750&nbsp;hp). Trials showed numerous minor faults and handling was found to be difficult. One of the drawbacks was the very high [[wing loading]] of the Me 264 in fully loaded conditions at some {{convert|356|kg/m2|abbr=on}}. Comparable aircraft, such as the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] with a wing loading of {{convert|337|kg/m2|abbr=on}}, the redesigned He 277 at {{convert|334.6|kg/m2|abbr=on}} and the Ju 390 at {{convert|209|kg/m2|abbr=on}} had lower wing loadings. The relatively high wing loading caused poor climb performance, loss of manoeuvrability, stability and high take-off and landing speeds. The first prototype was not fitted with weapons or [[Vehicle armour|armour]] but the following two prototypes, the '''Me 264 V2''' and '''V3''' had armour for the engines, crew and gun positions. The Me 264 V2 was built without defensive armament and vital equipment and the Me 264 V3 was to be armed and have the same armour.\n\nIn 1943, the ''Kriegsmarine'' withdrew their interest in the Me 264 in favour of the Ju 290 and the planned Ju 390. The Luftwaffe indicated preferrence for the unbuilt Ta 400 and the [[Heinkel He 277]] as ''Amerikabomber'' candidates in May 1943, based on their performance estimates. Further payments for development work to [[Messerschmitt]] AG for its design were stopped.<ref name=\"GriehlDresselp187\">Griehl & Dressel 1998, p.187</ref> Late in 1943, the second prototype, Me 264 V2, was destroyed in a bombing attack.<ref name=\"Green 1970, p. 641\"/><ref>Smith and Kay 1972, p. 552.</ref> On 18 July 1944, the first prototype, which had entered service with ''Transportstaffel'' 5, was damaged during an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing raid and was not repaired.

In October 1943, [[Erhard Milch]] stopped further Me 264 development, to concentrate on the development and production of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]] jet [[fighter-bomber]].\n\nFollowing the cancellation of the competing He 277 in April 1944, on 23 September 1944, work on the Me 264 project was officially cancelled. Messerschmitt proposed a six-engine version of the Me 264, the '''Me 264/6m''' (or alternately '''Me 364'''), but it was never built.<ref>http://www.luft46.com/prototyp/me264.html</ref>\n\n==Specifications (Me 264 V3)==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=The warplanes of the Third Reich<ref name=Greentwottr>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=William |title=The warplanes of the Third Reich |date=1970 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0385057822 |pages= |edition=1st 1973 reprint}}</ref>\n|prime units?=met\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|crew=8\n|length ft=68\n|length in=6.75\n|span ft=141\n|span in=1\n|height ft=14\n|height in=1.25\n|wing area sqft=1374.55\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight lb=46627\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight lb=123460\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=4\n|eng1 name=[[BMW 801D]] (or BMW 801G)\n|eng1 type=14-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engines\n|eng1 kw=<!-- prop engines -->\n|eng1 hp=1700\n|eng1 shp=<!-- prop engines -->\n|eng1 kn=<!-- jet/rocket engines -->\n|eng1 lbf=<!-- jet/rocket engines -->\n|eng1 note=for take-off\n::::{{cvt|1440|hp|kW|order=flip}} at {{cvt|18700|ft|0|order=flip}}\n\n|prop blade number=3\n|prop name=constant-speed propellers\n|prop dia m=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia note=\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|max speed kmh=546\n|max speed note=at {{cvt|79366|lb|0|order=flip}} at {{cvt|20015|ft|0|order=flip}}\n:::{{cvt|470|km/h|mph kn}} at {{cvt|75840|lb|0|order=flip}} at {{cvt|27230|ft|0|order=flip}} \n::::{{cvt|565|km/h|mph kn}} at {{cvt|27230|ft|0|order=flip}} with [[GM-1]] operating\n|cruise speed kmh=349\n|cruise speed note=at {{cvt|26250|ft|0|order=flip}}\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|minimum control speed kmh=\n|minimum control speed note=\n|range km=15000\n|range note={{cvt|333|km/h|mph kn}}\n|combat range km=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range km=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=<!-- if range unknown -->\n|ceiling ft=26250\n|ceiling note=at {{cvt|79366|lb|0|order=flip}}\n|g limits=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|roll rate=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|climb rate ftmin=393\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|power/mass=\n|more performance=\n<!--\n        Armament\n-->\n|guns=\n**4 \u00d7 13 mm (0.51 in) [[MG 131 machine gun]]s\n**2 \u00d7 20 mm [[MG 151/20 cannon]]\n|bombs= 3,000 kg (6,614 lb) bombload in internal [[bomb bay]] at 14,400 km (8,947 miles). 6,000 kg (13,200 lbs) bombload in internal [[bomb bay]] at 8,600 km (5,343 miles)<ref>Creek & Forsyth 2007 p. 35.</ref>\n\n|avionics=\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{aircontent\n|related=\n|similar aircraft=*[[Avro Lincoln]]\n*[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]\n*[[Consolidated B-32 Dominator]]\n*[[Focke-Wulf Ta 400]]\n*[[Heinkel He 277]]\n*[[Junkers Ju 390]]\n*[[Nakajima G10N]]\n*[[Piaggio P.108]]\n*[[Victory Bomber]]\n|lists=\n*[[List of aircraft of World War II]]\n*[[List of WW2 Luftwaffe aircraft prototype projects]]\n*[[List of bomber aircraft]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Duffy, James P.

The design was later selected as [[Messerschmitt]]'s competitor in the ''[[Reich Air Ministry|Reichsluftfahrtministerium]]''{{'}}s (the German Air Ministry) ''[[Amerikabomber]]'' programme, for a [[strategic bomber]] capable of attacking [[New York City]] from bases in [[France]] or the [[Azores]].\n\nThree [[prototype]]s were built but production was abandoned to allow Messerschmitt to concentrate on fighter production and the [[Junkers Ju 390]] was selected in its place. Developement continued as as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft instead.\n\n==Development==\nThe origin of the Me 264 design came from Messerschmitt's long-range [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] aircraft project, the '''P.1061''', of the late 1930s. A variant on the P.1061 was the [[Messerschmitt Me 261|P.1062]] of which three prototypes were built, with only two \"engines\" to the P.1061's four, but they were, in fact, the more powerful [[Daimler-Benz_DB_601#Variants|Daimler-Benz DB 606]] \"power systems\", each comprising a pair of [[Daimler-Benz DB 601|DB 601]] inverted V-12 engines. These were also successfully used in the long-range [[Messerschmitt Me 261]], itself originating as the Messerschmitt P.1064 design of 1937. The DB 606's later use in the [[Heinkel He 177]]A's airframe design resulted in derision by ''Reichsmarschall'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] as [[Heinkel He 177#Engine difficulties|\"welded-together engines\"]] in August 1942, due to badly designed engine installations.

Messerschmitt proposed a six-engine version of the Me 264, the '''Me 264/6m''' (or alternately '''Me 364'''), but it was never built.<ref>http://www.luft46.com/prototyp/me264.html</ref>\n\n==Specifications (Me 264 V3)==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=The warplanes of the Third Reich<ref name=Greentwottr>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=William |title=The warplanes of the Third Reich |date=1970 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0385057822 |pages= |edition=1st 1973 reprint}}</ref>\n|prime units?=met\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|crew=8\n|length ft=68\n|length in=6.75\n|span ft=141\n|span in=1\n|height ft=14\n|height in=1.25\n|wing area sqft=1374.55\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=<!-- sailplanes -->\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight lb=46627\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight lb=123460\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=4\n|eng1 name=[[BMW 801D]] (or BMW 801G)\n|eng1 type=14-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engines\n|eng1 kw=<!-- prop engines -->\n|eng1 hp=1700\n|eng1 shp=<!-- prop engines -->\n|eng1 kn=<!-- jet/rocket engines -->\n|eng1 lbf=<!-- jet/rocket engines -->\n|eng1 note=for take-off\n::::{{cvt|1440|hp|kW|order=flip}} at {{cvt|18700|ft|0|order=flip}}\n\n|prop blade number=3\n|prop name=constant-speed propellers\n|prop dia m=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia note=\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|max speed kmh=546\n|max speed note=at {{cvt|79366|lb|0|order=flip}} at {{cvt|20015|ft|0|order=flip}}\n:::{{cvt|470|km/h|mph kn}} at {{cvt|75840|lb|0|order=flip}} at {{cvt|27230|ft|0|order=flip}} \n::::{{cvt|565|km/h|mph kn}} at {{cvt|27230|ft|0|order=flip}} with [[GM-1]] operating\n|cruise speed kmh=349\n|cruise speed note=at {{cvt|26250|ft|0|order=flip}}\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|minimum control speed kmh=\n|minimum control speed note=\n|range km=15000\n|range note={{cvt|333|km/h|mph kn}}\n|combat range km=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range km=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=<!-- if range unknown -->\n|ceiling ft=26250\n|ceiling note=at {{cvt|79366|lb|0|order=flip}}\n|g limits=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|roll rate=<!-- aerobatic -->\n|climb rate ftmin=393\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|power/mass=\n|more performance=\n<!--\n        Armament\n-->\n|guns=\n**4 \u00d7 13 mm (0.51 in) [[MG 131 machine gun]]s\n**2 \u00d7 20 mm [[MG 151/20 cannon]]\n|bombs= 3,000 kg (6,614 lb) bombload in internal [[bomb bay]] at 14,400 km (8,947 miles). 6,000 kg (13,200 lbs) bombload in internal [[bomb bay]] at 8,600 km (5,343 miles)<ref>Creek & Forsyth 2007 p. 35.</ref>\n\n|avionics=\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{aircontent\n|related=\n|similar aircraft=*[[Avro Lincoln]]\n*[[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]\n*[[Consolidated B-32 Dominator]]\n*[[Focke-Wulf Ta 400]]\n*[[Heinkel He 277]]\n*[[Junkers Ju 390]]\n*[[Nakajima G10N]]\n*[[Piaggio P.108]]\n*[[Victory Bomber]]\n|lists=\n*[[List of aircraft of World War II]]\n*[[List of WW2 Luftwaffe aircraft prototype projects]]\n*[[List of bomber aircraft]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Duffy, James P.

The results show an increase in the fraction of children with elevated lead blood levels immediately pre/post the water switch (from 2.2% to 3.7%); invoking a [[Bonferroni correction]], G\u00f3mez argues the change is not statistically significant.

That is, the upward blip during the water switch sits on a rapid declining curve (presumably due to the many lead mitigation projects that have been initiated nationally) so that blood lead levels during the crisis are actually lower than those two years earlier.\n\n==== Virginia Tech water study ====\n[[File:Marc Edwards 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)|Marc Edwards]] led the<br /> first Virginia Tech Flint water study.]] \nIn September 2015 a team from [[Virginia Tech]] arrived in Flint.

In April 2015, the county health department contacted the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), and in April 2015 a CDC employee wrote in an email that the Legionnaires' outbreak was \"very large, one of the largest we know of in the past decade and community-wide, and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive investigation.\" However, MDHHS told the county health department at the time that federal assistance was not necessary.<ref name=\"FongerLegionnaireEarlyWarning\">{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Fonger|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/documents_show_agencies_knew_o.html|title=Public never told, but investigators suspected Flint River tie to Legionnaires' in 2014|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmails obtained by Progress Michigan in February 2016 indicate Snyder's office knew about the outbreak since March 2015, despite Snyder's claim he was only informed in January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2016/02/officials_were_warned_of_flint.html|title=Officials were warned of Flint water, Legionnaires' link months before public|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Michigan Live|date=February 4, 2016|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn March 11, 2016, Governor Snyder ordered an investigation of the MDHHS regarding the outbreak.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/03/governor_wants_investigation_i.html|title=Governor wants investigation into MDHHS in handling of Legionnaires' outbreak|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 16, 2017, it was reported the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] discovered the first genetic links between city water and patients diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County. \"The presence of Legionella in Flint was widespread,\" said Janet Stout, a research associate professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and a national expert on the disease. \"The (laboratory) results show that strains (of the bacteria) were throughout the water system.\" Virginia Tech researcher Amy Pruden published a study that found Legionella levels up to 1,000 times higher than normal tap water in Flint, and said finding a patient whose clinical isolates\u2014or bacteria\u2014matched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there \"suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere.\"<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/cdc_finds_first_genetic_link_b.html CDC finds first genetic link between Legionnaires' outbreak, Flint water] ''The flint Journal'' via MLive.com, February 16, 2017</ref><ref>[http://michiganradio.org/post/new-tests-raise-questions-about-source-legionnaires-disease-outbreak New tests raise questions about the source of Legionnaires Disease outbreak], ''Michigan Radio'', February 16, 2017</ref>\n\nOn March 10, 2017, affidavits filed by experts in court supported the conclusion that Flint water was connected to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak.

''The New York Times'' notes, \"Although Congress banned lead water pipes 30 years ago, between 3.3 million and 10 million older ones remain, primed to leach lead into tap water by forces as simple as jostling during repairs or a change in water chemistry.\" Inadequate regulation was cited as one reason for unsafe lead levels in tap water and \"efforts to address shortcomings often encounter push-back from industries like agriculture and mining that fear cost increases, and from politicians ideologically opposed to regulation.\" The crisis called attention to a \"resource gap\" for water regulators. The annual budget of the EPA's drinking water office declined 15% from 2006 to 2015, with the office losing over 10% of employees, and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators reported in 2013 that \"federal officials had slashed drinking-water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees,\" with \"serious implications for states' ability to protect public health.\"<ref name=\"WinesSchwartz\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath of the water crisis, it was noted that elevated blood-lead levels in children are found in many cities across Michigan, including Detroit, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], and [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]]. Although statewide childhood lead-poisoning rates have dramatically declined since the [[Tetraethyllead|removal of lead from gasoline]], certain areas of the state (particularly low-income areas with older housing stock) continue to experience lead poisoning, mostly from lead paint in homes built before 1978 and lead residue in dust and soil.

White mothers saw a 71-gram reduction in birth weight, resulting in a 2.73% increase in low birth weight infants. There were not any statistically meaningful differences among African American infants. There were likely not enough control counties to properly assess African American birth weights separately. The main limitation of the study was that infants of Flint were compared to infants of other counties.

Some adults felt guilty about giving children contaminated water, and in some cases family members stopped visiting. Some residents related the water crisis to depression and even thoughts of suicide; some sought treatment for mental breakdowns. The state government gave a $500,000 grant to the Genesee Health System for free counseling in addition to sending state mobile crisis teams and expanding Medicaid programs for affected residents.

inexpensive and easy to work. Lead pipes can [[Leaching (chemistry)|leach]] lead into the water, especially if certain contaminants are present. However, the water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, where Flint had obtained its water since 1967, had been [[water treatment|treated]] well enough that the leaching from the lead pipes was at levels considered acceptable by state and federal environmental protection agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/snyder-emails.pdf|title=The City of Flint Police Department Crime Reduction Strategy|last1=Snyder|first1=Richard D.|last2=Calley|first2=Brian|author-link1=Rick Snyder|author-link2=Brian Calley|date=January 20, 2016|publisher=Flint Water Study|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> There are an estimated 43,000 service lines in the city; these include 3,500 lead lines, 9,000 known galvanized lines, and 9,000 unknown service lines.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/05/city_ready_to_accept_proposals.html|title=City officials set to accept proposals to replace lead lines in Flint|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLead exposure across the U.S. has fallen dramatically since the 1980s, but no blood-lead level is considered completely safe.

The results show an increase in the fraction of children with elevated lead blood levels immediately pre/post the water switch (from 2.2% to 3.7%); invoking a [[Bonferroni correction]], G\u00f3mez argues the change is not statistically significant.

That is, the upward blip during the water switch sits on a rapid declining curve (presumably due to the many lead mitigation projects that have been initiated nationally) so that blood lead levels during the crisis are actually lower than those two years earlier.\n\n==== Virginia Tech water study ====\n[[File:Marc Edwards 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)|Marc Edwards]] led the<br /> first Virginia Tech Flint water study.]] \nIn September 2015 a team from [[Virginia Tech]] arrived in Flint.

In April 2015, the county health department contacted the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), and in April 2015 a CDC employee wrote in an email that the Legionnaires' outbreak was \"very large, one of the largest we know of in the past decade and community-wide, and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive investigation.\" However, MDHHS told the county health department at the time that federal assistance was not necessary.<ref name=\"FongerLegionnaireEarlyWarning\">{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Fonger|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/documents_show_agencies_knew_o.html|title=Public never told, but investigators suspected Flint River tie to Legionnaires' in 2014|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmails obtained by Progress Michigan in February 2016 indicate Snyder's office knew about the outbreak since March 2015, despite Snyder's claim he was only informed in January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2016/02/officials_were_warned_of_flint.html|title=Officials were warned of Flint water, Legionnaires' link months before public|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Michigan Live|date=February 4, 2016|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn March 11, 2016, Governor Snyder ordered an investigation of the MDHHS regarding the outbreak.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/03/governor_wants_investigation_i.html|title=Governor wants investigation into MDHHS in handling of Legionnaires' outbreak|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 16, 2017, it was reported the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] discovered the first genetic links between city water and patients diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County. \"The presence of Legionella in Flint was widespread,\" said Janet Stout, a research associate professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and a national expert on the disease. \"The (laboratory) results show that strains (of the bacteria) were throughout the water system.\" Virginia Tech researcher Amy Pruden published a study that found Legionella levels up to 1,000 times higher than normal tap water in Flint, and said finding a patient whose clinical isolates\u2014or bacteria\u2014matched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there \"suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere.\"<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/cdc_finds_first_genetic_link_b.html CDC finds first genetic link between Legionnaires' outbreak, Flint water] ''The flint Journal'' via MLive.com, February 16, 2017</ref><ref>[http://michiganradio.org/post/new-tests-raise-questions-about-source-legionnaires-disease-outbreak New tests raise questions about the source of Legionnaires Disease outbreak], ''Michigan Radio'', February 16, 2017</ref>\n\nOn March 10, 2017, affidavits filed by experts in court supported the conclusion that Flint water was connected to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak.

''The New York Times'' notes, \"Although Congress banned lead water pipes 30 years ago, between 3.3 million and 10 million older ones remain, primed to leach lead into tap water by forces as simple as jostling during repairs or a change in water chemistry.\" Inadequate regulation was cited as one reason for unsafe lead levels in tap water and \"efforts to address shortcomings often encounter push-back from industries like agriculture and mining that fear cost increases, and from politicians ideologically opposed to regulation.\" The crisis called attention to a \"resource gap\" for water regulators. The annual budget of the EPA's drinking water office declined 15% from 2006 to 2015, with the office losing over 10% of employees, and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators reported in 2013 that \"federal officials had slashed drinking-water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees,\" with \"serious implications for states' ability to protect public health.\"<ref name=\"WinesSchwartz\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath of the water crisis, it was noted that elevated blood-lead levels in children are found in many cities across Michigan, including Detroit, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], and [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]]. Although statewide childhood lead-poisoning rates have dramatically declined since the [[Tetraethyllead|removal of lead from gasoline]], certain areas of the state (particularly low-income areas with older housing stock) continue to experience lead poisoning, mostly from lead paint in homes built before 1978 and lead residue in dust and soil.

White mothers saw a 71-gram reduction in birth weight, resulting in a 2.73% increase in low birth weight infants. There were not any statistically meaningful differences among African American infants. There were likely not enough control counties to properly assess African American birth weights separately. The main limitation of the study was that infants of Flint were compared to infants of other counties.

Some adults felt guilty about giving children contaminated water, and in some cases family members stopped visiting. Some residents related the water crisis to depression and even thoughts of suicide; some sought treatment for mental breakdowns. The state government gave a $500,000 grant to the Genesee Health System for free counseling in addition to sending state mobile crisis teams and expanding Medicaid programs for affected residents.

See also Teodorescu ''et al.'', p.855</ref> was a Romanian poet, art critic and political journalist, one of the minor representatives of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. He was a disciple of both [[Alexandru Macedonski]] and [[\u0218tefan Petic\u0103]], representing the conservative and mystical school of [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolism]], and a regular contributor to the newspaper ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]''. He is also remembered as the husband and, for a while, literary partner of novelist [[Lucrezzia Karnabatt]].\n\nKarnabatt had a controversial career, particularly so during [[World War I]]. Strongly [[Russophobia|Russophobic]], and skeptical of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]], he gave full endorsement to [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[Central Powers]]. His [[collaborationism]], exemplified by the propaganda articles he wrote for ''[[Gazeta Bucure\u0219tilor]]'', earned him a jail sentence in March 1919. He was ultimately released in January 1920, but the scandal still had repercussion throughout the 1920s, hindering his career in the [[interwar]] press.\n\nMystical symbolism was a constant of Karnabatt's literary work. In the 1930s and '40s, the poet publicized his admiration for [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholicism]] in general, and for [[Franciscan]] dogma in particular. These beliefs were echoed in his final essays and poems, which received mixed reviews.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and debut years===\nAs noted by historian [[Lucian Boia]], the journalist-poet was a [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgaro-Romanian]] with an \"evidently non-Romanian\" surname, but patriotic and [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|anti-Slavic]] by conviction.<ref name=\"lb240\">Boia, p.240</ref> A Karnabatt (or Carnabat) family took refuge to [[Bucharest]] after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828]].

As Romania preserved her [[Allies of World War I|Entente]]-friendly neutrality, Karnabatt and ''Seara'' became supporters of the [[Central Powers]], or \"[[Germanophilia|Germanophiles]]\".

He adhered to this position until October 1915, when the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], a Slavic country, joined the Central Powers. In Karnabatt's view, this signaled that a territorial race had begun: with a \"[[Greater Bulgaria]]\" in the making, Romania needed to extend its eastern borders even beyond Bessarabia, to the [[Dnieper River]].<ref>Boia, p.240-241</ref>\n\nHis political essay, ''Rusia \u00een fa\u021ba cuget\u0103rei rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti'' (\"Russia vs. the Romanian Idea\"), came out at [[Editura Minerva]], in 1915.<ref>Teodorescu ''et al.'', p.856.

Following initial successes in the [[Battle of Transylvania]], the Romanian Land Forces were pushed back, and southern Romania [[Romania in World War I|fell to the Central Powers]]. Karnabatt stayed behind in occupied Bucharest. Together with Arghezi, [[Ioan Slavici]], [[Saniel Grossman]] and [[Dem. Theodorescu]], he began writing for the [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] daily, ''[[Gazeta Bucure\u0219tilor]]'', in December 1916.<ref>Boia, p.96</ref> His first articles there proclaimed that the Romanian armies still putting up a fight in [[Moldavia]] did so not out of conviction, but because they had become \"slaves to the Ruskies\".<ref name=\"lb241\"/>\n\nAccording to diarist Pia Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, who lived through the period in occupied Bucharest, Karnabatt and Slavici were also barometers of Germanophile disinformation: \"The more violent they are against the interventionists [...], that's how much more difficult things ought to be for the krauts fighting on the front.\"<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.78</ref> Karnabatt took on the old regime, still represented in Moldavia by the refugee government of [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]]. In his view, Br\u0103tianu deserved the [[Capital punishment in Romania|death penalty]] for having signed Romania to the Entente. However, he contended, the moral crisis would bring about \"a new Romania\", free from \"politicking\" and \"oriental statesmanship\".<ref name=\"lb241\"/> Karnabatt's notes in ''Gazeta Bucure\u0219tilor'' became famous for their attacks on [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]], the pro-Entente [[King of Romania]], borrowing their tone from prewar republicans.<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.72</ref> Lastly, Karnabatt and Slavici's pieces stood out for their [[Anglophobia]]: having already theorized that the war was carried by [[British Empire|British imperialism]] (''see [[Gott strafe England]]''), Karnabatt later suggested that the English were natural-born sadists.<ref>Boia, p.241, 242, 310</ref>\n\nUnder the occupation, Karnabatt also became a contributor to Macedonski's ''[[Literatorul]]'' review, in its final series (he joined the ''Literatorul'' group at roughly the same time as [[Tudor Vianu]] and [[Vasile Militaru]]).<ref>Pohon\u021bu, p.67-68, 146</ref> He then restated his preference for Symbolism with a topical essay in the magazine ''Rena\u0219terea'' (October 1918).<ref name=\"lidb149\"/> Karnabatt was still writing poetry in 1917 and 1918, putting out two new volumes of verse: ''Crini albi \u0219i ro\u0219ii'' (\"Lilies of White and Red\"), with Independen\u021ba Printers, and, at Poporul Publishers, ''Mozaic bizantin'' (\"Byzantine Mosaic\").<ref>Teodorescu ''et al.'', p.855, 856.

There, Karnabatt is described as a \"tall, well-fed, idle man\", whose only interests were reading and chewing on his smoking pipe.<ref>Boia, p.341-342</ref> The state's case against Karnabatt relied on evidence of treason: ''Gazeta Bucure\u0219tilor'' had effectively been founded by the Germans.

As Romania preserved her [[Allies of World War I|Entente]]-friendly neutrality, Karnabatt and ''Seara'' became supporters of the [[Central Powers]], or \"[[Germanophilia|Germanophiles]]\".

He adhered to this position until October 1915, when the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], a Slavic country, joined the Central Powers. In Karnabatt's view, this signaled that a territorial race had begun: with a \"[[Greater Bulgaria]]\" in the making, Romania needed to extend its eastern borders even beyond Bessarabia, to the [[Dnieper River]].<ref>Boia, p.240-241</ref>\n\nHis political essay, ''Rusia \u00een fa\u021ba cuget\u0103rei rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti'' (\"Russia vs. the Romanian Idea\"), came out at [[Editura Minerva]], in 1915.<ref>Teodorescu ''et al.'', p.856.

Following initial successes in the [[Battle of Transylvania]], the Romanian Land Forces were pushed back, and southern Romania [[Romania in World War I|fell to the Central Powers]]. Karnabatt stayed behind in occupied Bucharest. Together with Arghezi, [[Ioan Slavici]], [[Saniel Grossman]] and [[Dem. Theodorescu]], he began writing for the [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] daily, ''[[Gazeta Bucure\u0219tilor]]'', in December 1916.<ref>Boia, p.96</ref> His first articles there proclaimed that the Romanian armies still putting up a fight in [[Moldavia]] did so not out of conviction, but because they had become \"slaves to the Ruskies\".<ref name=\"lb241\"/>\n\nAccording to diarist Pia Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, who lived through the period in occupied Bucharest, Karnabatt and Slavici were also barometers of Germanophile disinformation: \"The more violent they are against the interventionists [...], that's how much more difficult things ought to be for the krauts fighting on the front.\"<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.78</ref> Karnabatt took on the old regime, still represented in Moldavia by the refugee government of [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]]. In his view, Br\u0103tianu deserved the [[Capital punishment in Romania|death penalty]] for having signed Romania to the Entente. However, he contended, the moral crisis would bring about \"a new Romania\", free from \"politicking\" and \"oriental statesmanship\".<ref name=\"lb241\"/> Karnabatt's notes in ''Gazeta Bucure\u0219tilor'' became famous for their attacks on [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]], the pro-Entente [[King of Romania]], borrowing their tone from prewar republicans.<ref>Alim\u0103ni\u0219teanu, p.72</ref> Lastly, Karnabatt and Slavici's pieces stood out for their [[Anglophobia]]: having already theorized that the war was carried by [[British Empire|British imperialism]] (''see [[Gott strafe England]]''), Karnabatt later suggested that the English were natural-born sadists.<ref>Boia, p.241, 242, 310</ref>\n\nUnder the occupation, Karnabatt also became a contributor to Macedonski's ''[[Literatorul]]'' review, in its final series (he joined the ''Literatorul'' group at roughly the same time as [[Tudor Vianu]] and [[Vasile Militaru]]).<ref>Pohon\u021bu, p.67-68, 146</ref> He then restated his preference for Symbolism with a topical essay in the magazine ''Rena\u0219terea'' (October 1918).<ref name=\"lidb149\"/> Karnabatt was still writing poetry in 1917 and 1918, putting out two new volumes of verse: ''Crini albi \u0219i ro\u0219ii'' (\"Lilies of White and Red\"), with Independen\u021ba Printers, and, at Poporul Publishers, ''Mozaic bizantin'' (\"Byzantine Mosaic\").<ref>Teodorescu ''et al.'', p.855, 856.

On the eve of the recording session, a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]] concert was held in the casino's theatre. This was to be the theatre's final concert before the casino complex closed down for its annual winter renovations, which would allow Deep Purple to record there. At the beginning of [[Don Preston]]'s synthesizer solo on \"King Kong\", the place suddenly caught fire when somebody in the audience fired a [[flare gun]] toward the [[rattan]] covered ceiling, as mentioned in the \"some stupid with a flare gun\" line.<ref>''The Real Frank Zappa Book'' by Frank Zappa with Peter Occhiogrosso, pg. 112, {{ISBN|0-671-63870-X}}</ref><ref>''Bang Your Head'' by David Konow, page 26, {{ISBN|0-609-80732-3}}</ref> Although there were no major injuries, the resulting fire destroyed the entire casino complex, along with all the Mothers' equipment. The \"smoke on the water\" that became the title of the song (credited to bass guitarist [[Roger Glover]], who related how the title occurred to him when he woke from a dream a few days later) referred to the smoke from the fire spreading over [[Lake Geneva]] from the burning [[Montreux Casino|casino]] as the members of Deep Purple watched from their hotel. \"It was probably the biggest fire I'd ever seen up to that point and probably ever seen in my life\" said Glover. \"It was a huge building. I remember there was very little panic getting out, because it didn't seem like much of a fire at first.

One promising venue (found by Nobs) was a local theatre called The Pavilion, but soon after the band loaded in and started working/recording, neighbours took offence at the noise. The band was only able to lay down backing tracks for one song (based on Blackmore's riff and temporarily named \"Title No.1\"), before local police shut them down.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d>{{cite news |title=How Deep Purple created their best hit 'Smoke on the Water' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/deep-purple-montreux-jazz-festival-lake-geneva-1971-a8418926.html |accessdate=10 April 2020 |newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nAfter about a week of searching, the band rented the nearly-empty [[H\u00f4tel des Alpes-Grand H\u00f4tel|Grand H\u00f4tel de Territet]] and converted its hallways and stairwells into a makeshift studio, where they laid down most of the tracks for what would become their most commercially successful album, ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'' (which is dedicated to Claude Nobs).<ref>{{cite news |title=Deep Purple revient sur le lieu o\u00f9 est n\u00e9 \u00abSmoke on the Water\u00bb |url=https://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/deep-purple-revient-smoke-the-water/story/29995483 |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=Tribune deGeneve}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC.

Its lyrics were composed later, primarily by Gillan and based around Glover's title, and the vocals were recorded in the Grand Hotel.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d/>\n\nBecause of the incident and the exposure Montreux received when \"Smoke on the Water\" became an international hit, Deep Purple formed a lasting bond with the town. The song is honoured in Montreux by a sculpture along the lake shore (right next to the statue of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] frontman [[Freddie Mercury]]) with the band's name, the song title, and the riff in musical notes. The new casino in Montreux displays notes from the riff as decoration on its balustrade facing the gambling hall.\n\nOn the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' episode about ''Machine Head'', [[Ritchie Blackmore]] claimed friends of the band were not fans of the \"Smoke on the Water\" riff, which they thought too simplistic. Blackmore retorted by making comparisons to the first movement of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 5th Symphony]], which revolves around a similar four note arrangement.\n\n\"The amazing thing with that song, and Ritchie's riff in particular,\" observed [[Ian Paice]], \"is that somebody hadn't done it before, because it's so gloriously simple and wonderfully satisfying.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=To Infinity\u2026 and Beyond?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #234|date=April 2017|p=39}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\"Smoke on the Water\" was included on ''Machine Head'', which was released in early 1972, but was not released as a single until a year later, in May 1973. (\"[[Never Before (song)|Never Before]]\" and \"[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]\" were the first singles issued from the album.) The band members have said that they did not expect the song to be a hit, but the single reached number 4 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the United States during the summer of 1973, number 2 on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, and it propelled the album to the top 10. Live performances of the tune, featuring extended interplay between Blackmore's guitar and [[Jon Lord]]'s [[Hammond organ]] would become a centrepiece of Deep Purple's live shows, and a version of the song from the live album ''[[Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)|Made in Japan]]'' became a minor hit on its own later on in 1973.\n\nThe principal songwriters included the song within their subsequent solo ventures after Deep Purple had split up. Ian Gillan in particular performed a jazz-influenced version in early solo concerts. The band [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] adopted a feedback-soaked approach, courtesy of Gillan guitarist [[Bernie Torme]]. This song was also featured live by Ritchie Blackmore's post-Deep Purple band [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] during their tours 1981\u201383, and again after Rainbow was resurrected briefly in the mid-1990s and for three European concerts in June 2016.\n\nDuring Ian Gillan's stint with [[Black Sabbath]] in 1983, they performed \"Smoke on the Water\" as a regular repertoire number on encores during their only tour together. It remains one of the few cover songs that Black Sabbath has ever played live.\n\nThe song is popular amongst beginner guitarists, but Blackmore himself has demonstrated that most who attempt to play it do so improperly. Actually played using \"[[all fourths]]\" (or [[double stops]]) as specified by Blackmore, a [[power chord]]-driven variation on the main recognizable riff is not difficult, and is consequently often played by learners.\n\n\"Smoke on the Water\" has received the following rankings:\n* 434 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] (2004)<ref name=\"RollingStone\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: Deep Purple, 'Smoke on the Water'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703000445/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 |date=3 July 2012}} Rolling Stone.

It is a four-note [[blues scale]] melody in [[G minor]], harmonised in parallel fourths. The [[riff]], played on a [[Fender Stratocaster]] [[electric guitar]] by Blackmore, is later joined by hi-hat and distorted organ, then the rest of the [[Drum kit|drums]], then [[bass guitar|electric bass]] parts before the start of [[Ian Gillan]]'s vocal. Blackmore later claimed that the riff is an interpretation of inversion of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and that \"I owe him a lot of money\".<ref name=\"Thompson2004\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzzCw6xs9roC|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-618-8|page=128}}</ref>\n\nThe opening lyrics are:\n{{poemquote|We all came out to Montreux, on the Lake Geneva shoreline\nTo make records with a [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio|mobile]], we didn't have much time}}\n\n[[Jon Lord]] doubles the guitar part on a [[Hammond organ|Hammond C3 organ]] played through a distorted Marshall amp, creating a tone very similar to that of the guitar.

On the eve of the recording session, a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]] concert was held in the casino's theatre. This was to be the theatre's final concert before the casino complex closed down for its annual winter renovations, which would allow Deep Purple to record there. At the beginning of [[Don Preston]]'s synthesizer solo on \"King Kong\", the place suddenly caught fire when somebody in the audience fired a [[flare gun]] toward the [[rattan]] covered ceiling, as mentioned in the \"some stupid with a flare gun\" line.<ref>''The Real Frank Zappa Book'' by Frank Zappa with Peter Occhiogrosso, pg. 112, {{ISBN|0-671-63870-X}}</ref><ref>''Bang Your Head'' by David Konow, page 26, {{ISBN|0-609-80732-3}}</ref> Although there were no major injuries, the resulting fire destroyed the entire casino complex, along with all the Mothers' equipment. The \"smoke on the water\" that became the title of the song (credited to bass guitarist [[Roger Glover]], who related how the title occurred to him when he woke from a dream a few days later) referred to the smoke from the fire spreading over [[Lake Geneva]] from the burning [[Montreux Casino|casino]] as the members of Deep Purple watched from their hotel. \"It was probably the biggest fire I'd ever seen up to that point and probably ever seen in my life\" said Glover. \"It was a huge building. I remember there was very little panic getting out, because it didn't seem like much of a fire at first. But, when it caught, it went up like a fireworks display.\" The \"Funky Claude\" running in and out is referring to [[Claude Nobs]], the director of the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] who helped some of the audience escape the fire.<ref name=obit>{{cite web|title=Claude Nobs, Montreux Jazz Festival founder, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20981739|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Claude Nobs1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Claude Nobs]] (2006), the \"Funky Claude\" mentioned in the song]]\nLeft with an expensive mobile recording unit and no place to record, the band was forced to scout the town for another place to set up. One promising venue (found by Nobs) was a local theatre called The Pavilion, but soon after the band loaded in and started working/recording, neighbours took offence at the noise. The band was only able to lay down backing tracks for one song (based on Blackmore's riff and temporarily named \"Title No.1\"), before local police shut them down.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d>{{cite news |title=How Deep Purple created their best hit 'Smoke on the Water' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/deep-purple-montreux-jazz-festival-lake-geneva-1971-a8418926.html |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nAfter about a week of searching, the band rented the nearly-empty [[H\u00f4tel des Alpes-Grand H\u00f4tel|Grand H\u00f4tel de Territet]] and converted its hallways and stairwells into a makeshift studio, where they laid down most of the tracks for what would become their most commercially successful album, ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'' (which is dedicated to Claude Nobs).<ref>{{cite news |title=Deep Purple revient sur le lieu o\u00f9 est n\u00e9 \u00abSmoke on the Water\u00bb |url=https://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/deep-purple-revient-smoke-the-water/story/29995483 |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=Tribune deGeneve}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC. Retrieved 19 October 2011</ref>\n\nThe only song from ''Machine Head'' not recorded entirely in the Grand Hotel was \"Smoke on the Water\" itself, which had been partly recorded during the abortive Pavilion session. Its lyrics were composed later, primarily by Gillan and based around Glover's title, and the vocals were recorded in the Grand Hotel.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d/>\n\nBecause of the incident and the exposure Montreux received when \"Smoke on the Water\" became an international hit, Deep Purple formed a lasting bond with the town. The song is honoured in Montreux by a sculpture along the lake shore (right next to the statue of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] frontman [[Freddie Mercury]]) with the band's name, the song title, and the riff in musical notes. The new casino in Montreux displays notes from the riff as decoration on its balustrade facing the gambling hall.\n\nOn the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' episode about ''Machine Head'', [[Ritchie Blackmore]] claimed friends of the band were not fans of the \"Smoke on the Water\" riff, which they thought too simplistic. Blackmore retorted by making comparisons to the first movement of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 5th Symphony]], which revolves around a similar four note arrangement.\n\n\"The amazing thing with that song, and Ritchie's riff in particular,\" observed [[Ian Paice]], \"is that somebody hadn't done it before, because it's so gloriously simple and wonderfully satisfying.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=To Infinity\u2026 and Beyond?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #234|date=April 2017|p=39}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\"Smoke on the Water\" was included on ''Machine Head'', which was released in early 1972, but was not released as a single until a year later, in May 1973. (\"[[Never Before (song)|Never Before]]\" and \"[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]\" were the first singles issued from the album.) The band members have said that they did not expect the song to be a hit, but the single reached number 4 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the United States during the summer of 1973, number 2 on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, and it propelled the album to the top 10. Live performances of the tune, featuring extended interplay between Blackmore's guitar and [[Jon Lord]]'s [[Hammond organ]] would become a centrepiece of Deep Purple's live shows, and a version of the song from the live album ''[[Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)|Made in Japan]]'' became a minor hit on its own later on in 1973.\n\nThe principal songwriters included the song within their subsequent solo ventures after Deep Purple had split up. Ian Gillan in particular performed a jazz-influenced version in early solo concerts. The band [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] adopted a feedback-soaked approach, courtesy of Gillan guitarist [[Bernie Torme]]. This song was also featured live by Ritchie Blackmore's post-Deep Purple band [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] during their tours 1981\u201383, and again after Rainbow was resurrected briefly in the mid-1990s and for three European concerts in June 2016.\n\nDuring Ian Gillan's stint with [[Black Sabbath]] in 1983, they performed \"Smoke on the Water\" as a regular repertoire number on encores during their only tour together. It remains one of the few cover songs that Black Sabbath has ever played live.\n\nThe song is popular amongst beginner guitarists, but Blackmore himself has demonstrated that most who attempt to play it do so improperly. Actually played using \"[[all fourths]]\" (or [[double stops]]) as specified by Blackmore, a [[power chord]]-driven variation on the main recognizable riff is not difficult, and is consequently often played by learners.\n\n\"Smoke on the Water\" has received the following rankings:\n* 434 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] (2004)<ref name=\"RollingStone\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: Deep Purple, 'Smoke on the Water'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703000445/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 |date=3 July 2012}} Rolling Stone.

However, its main ingredient, [[chili pepper]] of the genus ''[[Capsicum]]'', is not native to Southeast Asia. Common variants used in sambal recipes include Cayenne pepper (''[[Capsicum frutescens]]'') and green chili pepper (''[[Capsicum annuum]]''). These variants are native to the Western Hemisphere and were introduced to the Indonesian archipelago in the 16th century by Portuguese and Spanish sailors during the [[Columbian exchange]].<ref name=\"JP-Cabya\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/06/15/meet-cabya-chili-peppers-weird-great-uncle.html|title=Meet 'cabya', chili pepper's weird great uncle|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|website=The Jakarta Post|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref> \n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Stenen bord met stamper voor het maken van sambal TMnr 3934-42a.jpg|thumb|right|Stone ''cobek'' and ''ulekan'' ([[mortar and pestle]]), essential tool to make sambal]]\nCuriously, people of the [[Nusantara|Indonesian archipelago]] were already familiar with a type of hot and spicy relish prior to the 16th century.

In today's modern [[Javanese language|Javanese]], the term ''lombok'' refers to 'chili pepper', yet the term probably originally referred to a native hot spice prior to the introduction of capsicum. The [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesian languages]] terms for 'chili pepper' are ''cabai'' or ''cabe'', yet the word 'cabya' is mentioned in several ancient inscriptions and texts found in Java from the 10th century CE. Cabya is actually a reference to the Javanese long pepper or Balinese long pepper (''[[Piper retrofractum]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.id/2019/06/18/inilah-nenek-moyang-cabai-yang-asli-indonesia|title=Inilah 'Nenek Moyang' Cabai yang Asli Indonesia|last=Hananto|first=Akhyari|website=Good News From Indonesia|language=id|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref> Historian suggest that prior to the introduction of Capsicum from the Americas in the 16th century, it was cabya that widely used and cultivated as a hot spice in Java.<ref name=\"JP-Cabya\"/> Cabya is still used in Java, but the overwhelming popularity of the capsicum plants eventually pushed out cabya consumption until it was only used in traditional herbal medication and in making [[jamu]] (Javanese traditional herbal drink).

Sambal can be served raw or cooked. There are two main categories of sambals in Indonesia, they are ''sambal masak'' (cooked) and ''sambal mentah'' (raw). Cooked sambal has undergone cooking process which resulted in a distinct flavour and aroma, while raw sambal are mixed with additional ingredients and usually consumed immediately.

Nevertheless, in most ''[[warung]]'' and restaurants, most sambal is prepared daily in bulk and offered as a hot and spicy condiment.\n\nToday some brands of prepared, prepacked, instant, or ready-to-use sambal are available in [[warung]], traditional markets, supermarkets and convenience stores. Most are bottled sambal, with a few brands available in plastic or aluminium [[sachet]] packaging. Compared to traditional sambals, bottled instant sambals often have a finer texture, more homogenous content, and thicker consistency, like [[tomato ketchup]], due to the machine-driven manufacturing process.

However, its main ingredient, [[chili pepper]] of the genus ''[[Capsicum]]'', is not native to Southeast Asia. Common variants used in sambal recipes include Cayenne pepper (''[[Capsicum frutescens]]'') and green chili pepper (''[[Capsicum annuum]]'').

In today's modern [[Javanese language|Javanese]], the term ''lombok'' refers to 'chili pepper', yet the term probably originally referred to a native hot spice prior to the introduction of capsicum. The [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesian languages]] terms for 'chili pepper' are ''cabai'' or ''cabe'', yet the word 'cabya' is mentioned in several ancient inscriptions and texts found in Java from the 10th century CE. Cabya is actually a reference to the Javanese long pepper or Balinese long pepper (''[[Piper retrofractum]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.id/2019/06/18/inilah-nenek-moyang-cabai-yang-asli-indonesia|title=Inilah 'Nenek Moyang' Cabai yang Asli Indonesia|last=Hananto|first=Akhyari|website=Good News From Indonesia|language=id|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref> Historian suggest that prior to the introduction of Capsicum from the Americas in the 16th century, it was cabya that widely used and cultivated as a hot spice in Java.<ref name=\"JP-Cabya\"/> Cabya is still used in Java, but the overwhelming popularity of the capsicum plants eventually pushed out cabya consumption until it was only used in traditional herbal medication and in making [[jamu]] (Javanese traditional herbal drink).

Sambal can be served raw or cooked. There are two main categories of sambals in Indonesia, they are ''sambal masak'' (cooked) and ''sambal mentah'' (raw). Cooked sambal has undergone cooking process which resulted in a distinct flavour and aroma, while raw sambal are mixed with additional ingredients and usually consumed immediately.

Nevertheless, in most ''[[warung]]'' and restaurants, most sambal is prepared daily in bulk and offered as a hot and spicy condiment.\n\nToday some brands of prepared, prepacked, instant, or ready-to-use sambal are available in [[warung]], traditional markets, supermarkets and convenience stores. Most are bottled sambal, with a few brands available in plastic or aluminium [[sachet]] packaging. Compared to traditional sambals, bottled instant sambals often have a finer texture, more homogenous content, and thicker consistency, like [[tomato ketchup]], due to the machine-driven manufacturing process.
