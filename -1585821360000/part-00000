Electrotonic potentials can sum spatially or temporally.  Spatial summation is the combination of multiple sources of ion influx (multiple channels within a [[dendrite]], or channels within multiple dendrites), whereas temporal summation is a gradual increase in overall charge due to repeated influxes in the same location.  Because the ionic charge enters in one location and dissipates to others, losing intensity as it spreads, electrotonic spread is a graded response.

Electronic potentials that increase the membrane potential are called [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s (EPSPs). This is because they depolarize the membrane, increasing the likelihood of an action potential. As they sum together they can depolarize the membrane sufficiently to push it above the threshold potential, which will then cause an action potential to occur.

The area comprised large parts of present-day [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], as well as [[Luxembourg]] and parts of northern [[France]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of Burgundian and Habsburg acquisitions in the Low Countries}}\nA fair share (but not most) of these territories were inherited by the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] dukes, a younger branch of the French royal [[House of Valois]] in 1384, upon the death of Count [[Louis II, Count of Flanders|Louis II of Flanders]]. His heiress, [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders|Margaret III of Flanders]] in 1369 had married [[Philip the Bold]], youngest son of King [[John II of France]] and the first of the Valois dukes of Burgundy at [[Dijon]], who thus inherited the [[County of Flanders]]. The Flemish comital [[House of Dampierre]] had been French vassals, who held territory around the affluent cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], but also adjacent lands in former [[Lower Lorraine]] east of the [[Scheldt]] river (\"Imperial Flanders\") including the exclave of [[Lordship of Mechelen|Mechelen]], which were a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, and furthermore the neighbouring French [[County of Artois]]. Together they initiated an era of Burgundian governance in the Low Countries.\n\nThe Dampierre legacy further comprised the French counties of [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|Rethel]] in northern [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[County of Nevers|Nevers]] west of Burgundy proper, both held by Philip's younger son [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Philip II]] from 1407, as well as the [[County of Burgundy]] (''Franche-Comt\u00e9'') east of it, an Imperial fief which had been part of the former [[Kingdom of Arles]].\n\nIn the following decades, the Burgundian dukes expanded their territories in the Low Countries by the acquisition of several [[Imperial State]]s: Duke [[Philip the Good]] purchased the [[County of Namur]] in 1421, inherited the Duchies of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] in 1430, and seized the Counties of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]] in 1432, and the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] in 1441. His son, the last Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]], in 1473 annexed the Duchy of [[Guelders]], which had been pawned by late [[Arnold, Duke of Guelders|Arnold of Egmond]].\n\nThe Valois era would last until 1477, when Duke Charles the Bold died at the [[Battle of Nancy]] leaving no male heir. The territorial Duchy of Burgundy reverted to the French crown according to [[Salic law]], and King [[Louis XI of France]] also seized the French portion of the Burgundian possessions in the Low Countries. The Imperial fiefs passed to the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] House of Habsburg through Charles' daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] and her husband Archduke [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]], son of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]]. Maximilian however regarded the Burgundian Netherlands including Flanders and Artois as the undivided domains of his wife and himself and marched against the French. The conflict culminated at the [[Battle of Guinegate (1479)|Battle of Guinegate]] in 1479. Though Maximilian was victorious, he was only able to gain the County of Flanders according to the 1482 [[Treaty of Arras (1482)|Treaty of Arras]] after his wife Mary had suddenly died, while France retained Artois.\n\nIn her testament, Mary of Burgundy had bequested the Burgundian heritage to her and Maximilian's son, [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]]. His father, dissatisfied with the terms of the Arras agreement, continued to contest the seized French territories. In 1493, King [[Charles VIII of France]] according to the [[Treaty of Senlis]] finally renounced Artois, which together with Flanders was incorporated into the Imperial [[Seventeen Provinces]] under the rule of Philip.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe population of the main provinces of the Low Countries in 1477.<ref>\tVan Houtte (J. \u0391.).

Attempts at enlarging personal control by the dukes resulted in revolts among the independent towns (sometimes supported by independent local nobles) and bloody military suppression in response. An increasingly modernized central government, with a bureaucracy of clerks, allowed the dukes to become celebrated art patrons and establish a glamorous court life that gave rise to conventions of behavior that lasted for centuries. Philip the Good (1419\u20131467) extended his personal control to the southeast; bringing Brussels, Namur, and Li\u00e8ge under his control. He channeled the traditional independence of the cities through such mechanisms as the first [[States-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], and consolidating of the region's economy.\n\nThe [[Estates General of 1464|first Estates General]] of the Burgundian territories met in the City Hall of [[Bruges]] on 9 January 1464. It included delegates from the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the [[County of Flanders]], [[Walloon Flanders|Lille, Douai and Orchies]], the [[County of Artois]], the [[County of Hainaut]], the [[County of Holland]], the [[County of Zeeland]], the [[County of Namur]], the [[Lordship of Mechelen]], and the [[Boulonnais (land area)|Boulonnais]].<ref>[[Wim Blockmans]], \"De samenstelling van de staten van de Bourgondische landsheerlijkheden omstreeks 1464\", ''Standen en Landen'' 47 (1968), pp. 57-112.</ref> Up to 1464, the Duke only maintained ties with each of the provincial States separately. In principle, the provincial Estates were composed of representatives of the three traditional [[Estates of the realm|estates]]: [[clergy]], [[nobility]] and the Third Estate, but the exact composition and influence of each estate (within the provincial Estates) could differ. Convening an Estates General in which all provincial Estates were represented was part of [[Philip the Good]]'s policy of [[centralisation]].\n\n==Ducal patronage==\nFrom 1441, Philip based his ducal court in Brussels, but [[Bruges]] was the world center of commerce, though by the 1480s the inevitable silting of its harbor was bringing its economic hegemony to a close. Philip was a great patron of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and court painting reached new highs:  [[Robert Campin]], the famous [[Van Eyck]] brothers, and [[Rogier Van der Weyden]]\n\n==Social and economic==\nIn 1491 and 1492, the peasants revolted in some areas.

The area comprised large parts of present-day [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], as well as [[Luxembourg]] and parts of northern [[France]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of Burgundian and Habsburg acquisitions in the Low Countries}}\nA fair share (but not most) of these territories were inherited by the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] dukes, a younger branch of the French royal [[House of Valois]] in 1384, upon the death of Count [[Louis II, Count of Flanders|Louis II of Flanders]]. His heiress, [[Margaret III, Countess of Flanders|Margaret III of Flanders]] in 1369 had married [[Philip the Bold]], youngest son of King [[John II of France]] and the first of the Valois dukes of Burgundy at [[Dijon]], who thus inherited the [[County of Flanders]]. The Flemish comital [[House of Dampierre]] had been French vassals, who held territory around the affluent cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], but also adjacent lands in former [[Lower Lorraine]] east of the [[Scheldt]] river (\"Imperial Flanders\") including the exclave of [[Lordship of Mechelen|Mechelen]], which were a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, and furthermore the neighbouring French [[County of Artois]]. Together they initiated an era of Burgundian governance in the Low Countries.\n\nThe Dampierre legacy further comprised the French counties of [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|Rethel]] in northern [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[County of Nevers|Nevers]] west of Burgundy proper, both held by Philip's younger son [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Philip II]] from 1407, as well as the [[County of Burgundy]] (''Franche-Comt\u00e9'') east of it, an Imperial fief which had been part of the former [[Kingdom of Arles]].\n\nIn the following decades, the Burgundian dukes expanded their territories in the Low Countries by the acquisition of several [[Imperial State]]s: Duke [[Philip the Good]] purchased the [[County of Namur]] in 1421, inherited the Duchies of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] in 1430, and seized the Counties of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]] in 1432, and the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] in 1441. His son, the last Burgundian duke [[Charles the Bold]], in 1473 annexed the Duchy of [[Guelders]], which had been pawned by late [[Arnold, Duke of Guelders|Arnold of Egmond]].\n\nThe Valois era would last until 1477, when Duke Charles the Bold died at the [[Battle of Nancy]] leaving no male heir. The territorial Duchy of Burgundy reverted to the French crown according to [[Salic law]], and King [[Louis XI of France]] also seized the French portion of the Burgundian possessions in the Low Countries. The Imperial fiefs passed to the [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] House of Habsburg through Charles' daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] and her husband Archduke [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]], son of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]]. Maximilian however regarded the Burgundian Netherlands including Flanders and Artois as the undivided domains of his wife and himself and marched against the French. The conflict culminated at the [[Battle of Guinegate (1479)|Battle of Guinegate]] in 1479. Though Maximilian was victorious, he was only able to gain the County of Flanders according to the 1482 [[Treaty of Arras (1482)|Treaty of Arras]] after his wife Mary had suddenly died, while France retained Artois.\n\nIn her testament, Mary of Burgundy had bequested the Burgundian heritage to her and Maximilian's son, [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]]. His father, dissatisfied with the terms of the Arras agreement, continued to contest the seized French territories. In 1493, King [[Charles VIII of France]] according to the [[Treaty of Senlis]] finally renounced Artois, which together with Flanders was incorporated into the Imperial [[Seventeen Provinces]] under the rule of Philip.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe population of the main provinces of the Low Countries in 1477.<ref>\tVan Houtte (J. \u0391.).
