The third vessel of that type built in France, her design was derived from her predecessor, {{ship|French cruiser|Tage||2}}.\n\n==Design==\n\n''Amiral C\u00e9cille'' was a [[protected cruiser]] of the [[French Navy]] derived from the preceding French cruiser of the type, {{ship|French cruiser|Tage||2}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=308}} She was ordered as part of a construction program authorized in 1878 by the {{lang|fr|Conseil des Travaux}} (Council of Works); the first vessel of the program was the cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|Sfax||2}}, which provided the basis for ''Tage'' and, in turn, ''Amiral C\u00e9cille''. Both of these ships were ordered in 1885. The three ships were intended as long-range [[commerce raider]]s.{{sfn|Ropp|p=109}}\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Amiral C\u00e9cille (ship, 1890) - Brassey's 1887.png|thumb|left|Profile drawing of ''Amiral C\u00e9cille'' as depicted in ''[[The Naval Annual]]'' in 1887; note it mistakenly omits the [[amidships]] [[sponson]] for the main battery, which was located abreast the rear funnel{{sfn|Gardiner|p=309}}]]\n\nThe ship was {{cvt|115.5|m|ftin}} [[long overall]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{cvt|15|m|ftin}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{cvt|6.81|m|ftin}}. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|5893|LT|t|lk=on}}. Her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] featured a pronounced [[naval ram|ram bow]] and a short [[forecastle]]. As was typical for French warships of the period, she had a pronounced [[tumblehome]] shape and an overhanging [[stern]]. Her [[superstructure]] was minimal, consisting primarily of a small [[conning tower]] forward. Her crew consisted of 517&nbsp;officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|pp=308\u2013309}}\n\nThe propulsion system for ''Amiral C\u00e9cille'' consisted of four vertical [[compound steam engine]]s that were paired to drive two [[screw propeller]]s. Steam was provided by twelve coal-fired [[fire-tube boiler]]s that were ducted into three [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] located [[amidships]]. The power plant was rated to produce {{convert|10200|ihp|lk=on}} for a top speed of {{convert|19.4|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{cvt|925|LT|t}}. To supplement the steam engines on long voyages, she was originally fitted with a [[barque]] sailing rig without [[Royal (sail)|royals]], with three [[mast (sailing)|masts]].{{sfn|Gardiner|pp=308\u2013309}}\n\n''Amiral C\u00e9cille'' was armed with a [[main battery]] of eight {{cvt|164|mm}} 30-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] (cal.) guns carried in individual pivot mounts. Six of the guns were mounted in [[sponson]]ed on the upper [[deck (ship)|deck]], three on each [[broadside]]. One gun was placed in the bow and the other was at the stern as [[chase gun]]s. These weapons were supported by a [[battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] of ten {{cvt|138|mm}} 30&nbsp;cal. guns that were carried in a main deck battery amidships. For close-range defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, she carried six [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|{{cvt|47|mm}} 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns]] and fourteen {{cvt|37|mm}} 1-pounder [[Hotchkiss revolver cannon]], all in individual mounts. She also carried four {{cvt|381|mm|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s in her hull above the [[waterline]].{{sfn|Gardiner|p=308}}\n\nThe ship was protected by an armor deck that was {{cvt|2.2|in|order=flip}} on the flat portion that covered her propulsion machinery spaces and [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. Toward the sides of the ship, the deck sloped down and increased in thickness to {{cvt|102|mm|0}}; the sloped sides terminated at the hull {{cvt|4|ft|3|in|order=flip}} below the waterline. The main deck battery had transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] that were {{cvt|3.1|in|order=flip}} on either end.

He is best known for his role in [[Paul Revere]]'s \"midnight ride\" to warn the townspeople of [[Concord, Massachusetts]] of the impending British army move to capture guns and gunpowder kept there at the beginning of the American Revolution. He was the only participant in the ride to reach Concord.\n\n== Early life ==\nLittle is known for certain about Prescott's life outside of his involvement in the dramatic events before and during the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. He was born on August 19, 1751. He grew up in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] where his family had lived for generations. He became a physician, as his father and grandfather had been before him.{{sfnp|Tourtellot|2000|p=100}}\n\nAccording to tradition, Samuel Prescott was courting Lydia Mulliken of [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] just prior to the outbreak of the American Revolution.{{sfnp|Langguth|1988|p=235}} There is, however, no primary source evidence to support this notion.\n\nDue to the fact that Paul Revere referred to Prescott as a \"high son of Liberty,\" (meaning one sympathetic to the Patriot cause), some have speculated that Prescott had ties to the [[Sons of Liberty]] or acted as a courier for the [[Committees of Correspondence]].{{sfnp|Ryan|2007|p=35}}\n\n== The Ride ==\nOn the evening of April 18, 1775, [[Paul Revere]] and [[William Dawes]] were dispatched by [[Joseph Warren]] to warn [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Hancock]], who were then in Lexington, that a British expedition was on its way to arrest them. Warren also instructed Revere to deliver a warning to Concord to inform provincial officials that British troops intended to confiscate or destroy the armaments being amassed there by the province's [[Militia (United States)|militia]].{{sfnp|Langguth|1988|p=97}} Revere and Dawes took different routes but met in Lexington about midnight and successfully warned Adams and Hancock, who quickly left Lexington. Revere and Dawes then proceeded towards Concord to complete their second mission.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|pp.=110-111}}\n\nSamuel Prescott was headed home to Concord from Lexington when he encountered Revere and Dawes on horseback around 1 a.m. on April 19. Revere later described their meeting in his 1775 deposition to the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]] and in a 1798 letter to [[Jeremy Belknap]].{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=329}} Revere claimed that Prescott was a \"high son of Liberty\"--insinuating that he was trustworthy. Upon hearing about their mission, Prescott offered to assist Revere and Dawes, pointing out that he was known in the area and residents would be more likely to believe a warning coming from him rather than strangers.{{sfnp|Tourtellot|2000|p=100}}\n\nWhen the three continued on to Hartwell's tavern in the lower bounds of Lincoln, they were cut off by four British horseman who were part of a larger scouting party sent out the preceding evening. Revere was captured but both Prescott and Dawes succeeded in escaping. Prescott emerged at [[Hartwell Tavern]], awakened Ephraim Hartwell, and informed him of the pending arrival of the British soldiers.

He is best known for his role in [[Paul Revere]]'s \"midnight ride\" to warn the townspeople of [[Concord, Massachusetts]] of the impending British army move to capture guns and gunpowder kept there at the beginning of the American Revolution. He was the only participant in the ride to reach Concord.\n\n== Early life ==\nLittle is known for certain about Prescott's life outside of his involvement in the dramatic events before and during the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. He was born on August 19, 1751. He grew up in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] where his family had lived for generations. He became a physician, as his father and grandfather had been before him.{{sfnp|Tourtellot|2000|p=100}}\n\nAccording to tradition, Samuel Prescott was courting Lydia Mulliken of [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] just prior to the outbreak of the American Revolution.{{sfnp|Langguth|1988|p=235}} There is, however, no primary source evidence to support this notion.\n\nDue to the fact that Paul Revere referred to Prescott as a \"high son of Liberty,\" (meaning one sympathetic to the Patriot cause), some have speculated that Prescott had ties to the [[Sons of Liberty]] or acted as a courier for the [[Committees of Correspondence]].{{sfnp|Ryan|2007|p=35}}\n\n== The Ride ==\nOn the evening of April 18, 1775, [[Paul Revere]] and [[William Dawes]] were dispatched by [[Joseph Warren]] to warn [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Hancock]], who were then in Lexington, that a British expedition was on its way to arrest them. Warren also instructed Revere to deliver a warning to Concord to inform provincial officials that British troops intended to confiscate the armaments being amassed there by the province's [[Militia (United States)|militia]].{{sfnp|Langguth|1988|p=97}} Revere and Dawes took different routes but met in Lexington about midnight and successfully warned Adams and Hancock, who quickly left Lexington. Revere and Dawes then proceeded towards Concord to complete their second mission.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|pp.=110-111}}\n\nSamuel Prescott was headed home to Concord from Lexington when he encountered Revere and Dawes on horseback around 1 a.m. on April 19. Revere later described their meeting in his 1775 deposition to the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]] and in a 1798 letter to [[Jeremy Belknap]].{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=329}} Revere claimed that Prescott was a \"high son of Liberty\"--insinuating that he was trustworthy. Upon hearing about their mission, Prescott offered to assist Revere and Dawes, pointing out that he was known in the area and residents would be more likely to believe a warning coming from him rather than strangers.{{sfnp|Tourtellot|2000|p=100}}\n\nWhen the three continued on to Hartwell's tavern in the lower bounds of Lincoln, they were cut off by four British horseman who were part of a larger scouting party sent out the preceding evening. Revere was captured but both Prescott and Dawes succeeded in escaping. Prescott emerged at [[Hartwell Tavern]], awakened Ephraim Hartwell, and informed him of the pending arrival of the British soldiers. Hartwell sent his black slave, Violet, down the road to alert his parents, Samuel and Mary. His mother then relayed the message to Captain William Smith, commanding officer of the Lincoln minutemen. The minutemen received the noticed in time, and arrived at Old North Bridge before their enemy.

{"title_page": "Quartal and quintal harmony", "text_new": "{{short description|Types of harmonic structures in music}}\n{{redirects|Fourth chord||Eleventh chord#Fourth}}\n\nIn [[music]], '''quartal harmony''' is the building of [[Harmony|harmonic]] structures built from the [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of the [[perfect fourth]], the [[tritone|augmented fourth]] and the [[diminished fourth]]. For instance, a three-note quartal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fourths, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}. \n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1\n} }\n</score>\n\n'''Quintal harmony''' is harmonic structure preferring the [[perfect fifth]], the [[augmented fifth]] and the [[tritone|diminished fifth]]. For instance, a three-note quintal chord on C can be built by stacking perfect fifths, C\u2013G\u2013D. \n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c g' d'>1\n} }\n</score>\n\n== Properties ==\n{{Image frame|content=<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <a d g c f bes es>1 <bes d f a c es g>\n} }\n</score>|width=300|caption=The notes in a quartal chord on A can be arranged to form a [[thirteenth|thirteenth chord]] on B{{music|b}} {{harv|Benward and Saker|2009|loc=279}}.}}\nUse of the terms ''quartal'' and ''quintal'' arises from a contrast, compositional or perceptual, with traditional [[tertian]] harmonic constructions. Listeners familiar with music of the (European) [[common practice period]] perceive [[tonality|tonal]] music as that which uses [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[musical scale|scales]], wherein both the [[major third]] and [[minor third]] constitute the basic ''structural elements'' of the harmony. \n\nRegarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] writes that:\n{{quote|Chords by perfect fourth are ambiguous in that, like all chords built by equidistant intervals ([[Diminished seventh chord|diminished seventh chords]] or [[Augmented triad|augmented triads]]), any member can function as the [[Root (chord)|root]]. The indifference of this rootless harmony to tonality places the burden of [[Key (music)|key]] verification upon the [[Part (music)|voice]] with the most active melodic line. {{harv|Persichetti|1961|loc=94}}|sign=|source=}}\n\n''Quintal harmony'' (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] or [[Complement (music)|complement]] of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from ''quartal harmony''. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.\n\nLike tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}, can be written as<blockquote><score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1 <f bes c> <bes c f> <f bes c f>\n} }\n</score></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance.  During the [[common practice period]] (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] (when appearing as a [[Suspension (music)|suspension]] requiring resolution in the [[voice leading]]) or as a [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord).  In the later 19th century, during the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|breakdown of tonality]] in [[classical music]], all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed.  Quartal harmony was developed in the early [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[Tristan chord]] is made up of the notes F{{music|natural}}, B{{music|natural}}, D{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|sharp}} and is the first chord heard in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.  \n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\voiceOne \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.->(~ gis4 a8 ais8-> b4~ b8) r r\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n                \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n                \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\< f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\> d!4.)~\\p d8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red <f b>2.( <e gis>4.)~ <e gis>8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThe bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant.  The chord had been found in earlier works ({{harvnb|Vogel|1962|loc=12}}), notably [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 18 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 18]], but Wagner's use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional [[tonal harmony]] and even towards [[atonality]], and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its [[Functional harmony|function]], a notion which was soon after to be explored by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and others ({{harvnb|Erickson|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=June 2012}}).  \n\nDespite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as \"quartal harmony\" or even as \"proto-quartal harmony\", since Wagner's musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary [[dominant seventh]] chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F\u2013B\u2013D\u2013G). Wagner's unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his [[Mystic chord]] (shown below) in his [[Piano Sonata No. 6 (Scriabin)|Piano Sonata No. 6]]. \n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c fis bes e a d>1\n} }\n</score>\n\nScriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional [[tertian]] passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D) into a seven-note chord (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G). Scriabin's sketches for his unfinished work ''[[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]]'' show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] {{harv|Morrison|1998|loc=316}}.<!-- image may be allowed for this article only: see the licensing question on its page -->\n\nIn France, [[Erik Satie]] experimented with [[Parallel harmony|planing]] in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for ''[[Le Fils des \u00e9toiles]]'' {{harv|Solomon|2003}}. [[Paul Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to \"rise and rise\". \n===20th- and 21st-century classical music===\nComposers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include [[Claude Debussy]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Herder|1987|loc=78}}.\n\n==== Schoenberg ====\n[[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Chamber Symphony No. 1|Chamber Symphony Op. 9]] (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measures construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013A{{music|flat}} distributed over several instruments.\n\n[[Image:SchoenbergOp9.png|thumb|280x280px|Vertical quartal-harmony in the opening measures of Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9 {{audio|SchoenbergOp9.mid|Play}}|alt=|center]]\n\n[[Image:Sch\u00f6nberg Kammersymhonie 9 for wikipedia.png|thumb|250x250px|Six-note horizontal fourth chord in Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9|alt=]]\n\nThe composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSchoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his ''Theory of Harmony'' (''Harmonielehre'') of 1911, he wrote:\n{{quote|The construction of chords by superimposing fourths can lead to a chord that contains all the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]]; hence, such construction does manifest a possibility for dealing systematically with those harmonic phenomena that already exist in the works of some of us: seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve-part chords\u2026 But the quartal construction makes possible, as I said, accommodation of all phenomena of harmony. {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=406\u2013407}}}}\n\nFor [[Anton Webern]], the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds. After hearing Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, Webern wrote \"You must write something like that, too!\" ({{harvnb|Webern|1963|loc=48}}; \"So was mu\u00dft du auch machen!\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}<!--Source for the German text needed.-->)\n\n==== Others ====\nIn his ''Theory of Harmony'' {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=407}}: \"Besides myself my students Dr. Anton Webern and [[Alban Berg]] have written these harmonies (fourth chords), but also the Hungarian [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] or the Viennese [[Franz Schreker]], who both go a similar way to Debussy, Dukas and perhaps also [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], are not far off.\"<!--- (\u201eAu\u00dfer mir haben meine Sch\u00fcler Dr. Anton Webern und Alban Berg solche Kl\u00e4nge [gemeint sind Quartenkl\u00e4nge] geschrieben.

These steps are a restructuring of fourth chords (C\u2013D\u2013G becomes the fourth chord D\u2013G\u2013C), or other mixtures of fourths and fifths (D{{music|sharp}}\u2013A{{music|sharp}}\u2013D{{music|sharp}}\u2013G{{music|sharp}}\u2013C{{music|sharp}} in measure 3 of the example).\n\nHindemith was, however, not a proponent of an explicit quartal harmony. In his 1937 writing ''Unterweisung im Tonsatz'' (''The Craft of Musical Composition'', {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937}}), he wrote that \"notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,\"<!--- (\u201edass die T\u00f6ne eine Familienzugeh\u00f6rigkeit besitzen, die sich in der Bindung an tonale Hauptt\u00f6ne \u00e4u\u00dfert, die eine unzweideutige Rangliste der Tonverwandschaften aufstellt.\u201c)---> so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition \"\u2026the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.\"<!--- (\u201e... der Musiker ist an ihn gebunden, wie der Maler an die prim\u00e4ren Farben, der Architekt an die drei Dimensionen.\u201c)---> He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. \"The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its [[Combination tone]]s.\"<!--- (\u201eDas st\u00e4rkste und eindeutige harmonische Intervall ist n\u00e4chst der alleinstehenden  Oktave die Quinte, das sch\u00f6nste jedoch die Terz wegen ihrer in den Kombinationst\u00f6nen begr\u00fcndeten Akkordwirkung.\u201c)--->\n\n[[Image:Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.png|thumb|center|378x378px|Quartal harmony in Hindemith's Flute Sonata, II with tonal center on B established by descent in left hand in [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and repeated B's and F{{music|sharp}}'s {{harv|Kostka, Payne, and Alm\u00e9n|2013|loc=Chapter twenty six: Materials and techniques, Chord structures, Quartal and secundal harmony, 469\u201370<!--  Meaningful subheadings simplify reference in translations and other editions (p. 498 in third ed.) -->}} {{Audio|Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.mid|Play}}|alt=]]The works of the Filipino composer [[Eliseo M. Pajaro]] (1915\u20131984) are characterised by quartal and quintal harmonies, as well as by dissonant counterpoint and polychords {{harv|Kasilag|2001}}.\n\nAs a transition to the history of jazz, [[George Gershwin]] may be mentioned. In the first movement of his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] altered fourth chords descend chromatically in the right hand with a chromatic scale leading upward in the left hand.\n\n===Jazz===\nThe style of jazz, having an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] harmonic orbit, was in its [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|early days]] overtaken (until perhaps the [[Swing (genre)|Swing]] of the 1930s) by the vocabulary of 19th-century European music.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}<!--This makes almost no sense at all. Jazz is a genre, not a style, so is one particular style of jazz meant here and, if so, which one? What is a harmonic orbit (never mind how an orbit might be \"eclectic\")? What does \"overtaken\" mean in this context?--> Important influences come thereby from [[opera]], [[operetta]], [[military band]]s as well as from the piano music of Classical and Romantic composers, and even that of the Impressionists. Jazz musicians had a clear interest in harmonic richness of colour, for which quartal harmony provided possibilities, as used by [[pianist]]s and [[arranger]]s like [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Bill Evans]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Milt Buckner]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Chick Corea]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) [[Herbie Hancock]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) and especially [[McCoy Tyner]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=205}}).\n\n[[Image:II V I for wikipedia.png|thumb|right|275px|The [[II-V-I progression|ii\u2013V\u2013I cadence]] {{audio|II V9 I.MID|Play}}; the fourth-suspension or [[sus chord]] {{audio|II V9sus I.MID|Play}}]]\n\n[[Image:SenorBlues.png|thumb|380px|A typical [[hard bop]] brass part, from [[Horace Silver]]'s \"Se\u00f1or Blues\"]]\n\nThe [[hard bop]] of the 1950s made new applications of quartal harmony accessible to jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Quintet]] writing in which two brass instruments (commonly trumpet and saxophone) may proceed in fourths, while the piano (as a uniquely harmonic instrument) lays down chords, but sparsely, only hinting at the intended harmony. This style of writing, in contrast with that of the previous decade, preferred a moderate tempo. Thin-sounding unison bebop horn sections occur frequently, but these are balanced by bouts of very refined [[polyphony]] such as is found in [[cool jazz]].\n\n[[File:So What chord.png|thumb|100px|The [[So What chord|\"So What\" chord]] uses three intervals of a fourth.]]\n\nOn his watershed record ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', [[Miles Davis]] with pianist [[Bill Evans]] used a chord consisting of three perfect fourth intervals and a major third on the composition \"[[So What (composition)|So What]]\". This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a [[So What chord]], and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom {{harv|Levine|1989|loc=97}}.\n\nFrom the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist [[McCoy Tyner]]'s work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]'s \"classic quartet\", was influential throughout this epoch. [[Oliver Nelson]] was also known for his use of fourth chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]] {{harv|Corozine|2002|loc=12}}. Floyd claims that the \"foundation of 'modern quartal harmony'\" began in the era when the [[Charlie Parker]]\u2013influenced John Coltrane added classically trained pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner to his ensemble {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nJazz guitarists cited as using chord voicings using quartal harmony include [[Johnny Smith]], [[Tal Farlow]], [[Chuck Wayne]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Joe Pass]], [[Jimmy Raney]], [[Wes Montgomery]], however all in a traditional manner, as major 9th, 13th and minor 11th chords {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}} (an octave and fourth equals an 11th). Jazz guitarists cited as using modern quartal harmony include [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] (especially [[Sonny Rollins]]'s ''[[The Bridge (Sonny Rollins album)|The Bridge]]''), [[George Benson]] (\"Skydive\"), [[Pat Martino]], [[Jack Wilkins]] (\"Windows\"), [[Joe Diorio]], [[Howard Roberts]] (\"Impressions\"), [[Kenny Burrell]] (\"So What\"), [[Wes Montgomery]] (\"Little Sunflower\"), [[Henry Johnson (guitarist)|Henry Johnson]], [[Russell Malone]], [[Jimmy Bruno]], [[Howard Alden]], [[Paul Bollenback]], [[Mark Whitfield]], and [[Rodney Jones (guitarist)|Rodney Jones]] {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nQuartal harmony was also explored as a possibility under new experimental [[Scale (music)|scale]] models as they were \"discovered\" by jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Musicians began to work extensively with the so-called [[Mode (music)|church modes]] of old European music, and they became firmly situated in their compositional process. Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Chick Corea]] are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as [[free jazz]] also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use due to the wandering nature of its harmony.\n\n[[Image:Maiden Voyage2.png|thumb|center|400px|Fourths in Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}]]\n\nIn jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.\n\n[[Image:Quartal voicings.png|thumb|center|400px|[[ii-V-I turnaround]] with fourth voicings: all chords are in fourth voicings {{audio|Quartal voicings.mid|Play}}; They are often ambiguous as, for example, the Dm11 and G9sus chords are here voiced identically and will thus be distinguished for the listener by the [[root (chord)|root]] movement of the [[bassist]] {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=94}}]]\n\nThus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to \"blend into one overall sound\" sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=95}}.\n\n===Rock music===\n[[image:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|Disliking the sound of thirds (in equal-temperament tuning), Robert Fripp builds chords with perfect intervals in his new&nbsp;standard tuning.]]\n{{See also|Progressive rock|Symphonic rock}}\n\nQuartal and quintal harmony have been used by [[Robert Fripp]], who has described himself as the <!-- self-described.

Listeners familiar with music of the (European) [[common practice period]] perceive [[tonality|tonal]] music as that which uses [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[musical scale|scales]], wherein both the [[major third]] and [[minor third]] constitute the basic ''structural elements'' of the harmony. \n\nRegarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] writes that:\n{{quote|Chords by perfect fourth are ambiguous in that, like all chords built by equidistant intervals ([[Diminished seventh chord|diminished seventh chords]] or [[Augmented triad|augmented triads]]), any member can function as the [[Root (chord)|root]]. The indifference of this rootless harmony to tonality places the burden of [[Key (music)|key]] verification upon the [[Part (music)|voice]] with the most active melodic line. {{harv|Persichetti|1961|loc=94}}|sign=|source=}}\n\n''Quintal harmony'' (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] or [[Complement (music)|complement]] of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from ''quartal harmony''. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.\n\nLike tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}, can be written as<blockquote><score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1 <f bes c> <bes c f> <f bes c f>\n} }\n</score></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance.  During the [[common practice period]] (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] (when appearing as a [[Suspension (music)|suspension]] requiring resolution in the [[voice leading]]) or as a [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord).  In the later 19th century, during the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|breakdown of tonality]] in [[classical music]], all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed.  Quartal harmony was developed in the early [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[Tristan chord]] is made up of the notes F{{music|natural}}, B{{music|natural}}, D{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|sharp}} and is the first chord heard in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.  \n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\voiceOne \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.->(~ gis4 a8 ais8-> b4~ b8) r r\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n                \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n                \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\< f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\> d!4.)~\\p d8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red <f b>2.( <e gis>4.)~ <e gis>8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThe bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant.  The chord had been found in earlier works ({{harvnb|Vogel|1962|loc=12}}), notably [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 18 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 18]], but Wagner's use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional [[tonal harmony]] and even towards [[atonality]], and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its [[Functional harmony|function]], a notion which was soon after to be explored by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and others ({{harvnb|Erickson|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=June 2012}}).  \n\nDespite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as \"quartal harmony\" or even as \"proto-quartal harmony\", since Wagner's musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary [[dominant seventh]] chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F\u2013B\u2013D\u2013G). Wagner's unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his [[Mystic chord]] (shown below) in his [[Piano Sonata No. 6 (Scriabin)|Piano Sonata No. 6]]. \n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c fis bes e a d>1\n} }\n</score>\n\nScriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional [[tertian]] passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D) into a seven-note chord (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G). Scriabin's sketches for his unfinished work ''[[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]]'' show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] {{harv|Morrison|1998|loc=316}}.<!-- image may be allowed for this article only: see the licensing question on its page -->\n\nIn France, [[Erik Satie]] experimented with [[Parallel harmony|planing]] in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for ''[[Le Fils des \u00e9toiles]]'' {{harv|Solomon|2003}}. [[Paul Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to \"rise and rise\". \n===20th- and 21st-century classical music===\nComposers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include [[Claude Debussy]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Herder|1987|loc=78}}.\n\n==== Schoenberg ====\n[[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Chamber Symphony No. 1|Chamber Symphony Op. 9]] (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measures construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013A{{music|flat}} distributed over several instruments.\n\n[[Image:SchoenbergOp9.png|thumb|280x280px|Vertical quartal-harmony in the opening measures of Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9 {{audio|SchoenbergOp9.mid|Play}}|alt=|center]]\n\n[[Image:Sch\u00f6nberg Kammersymhonie 9 for wikipedia.png|thumb|250x250px|Six-note horizontal fourth chord in Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9|alt=]]\n\nThe composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSchoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his ''Theory of Harmony'' (''Harmonielehre'') of 1911, he wrote:\n{{quote|The construction of chords by superimposing fourths can lead to a chord that contains all the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]]; hence, such construction does manifest a possibility for dealing systematically with those harmonic phenomena that already exist in the works of some of us: seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve-part chords\u2026 But the quartal construction makes possible, as I said, accommodation of all phenomena of harmony. {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=406\u2013407}}}}\n\nFor [[Anton Webern]], the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds. After hearing Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, Webern wrote \"You must write something like that, too!\" ({{harvnb|Webern|1963|loc=48}}; \"So was mu\u00dft du auch machen!\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}<!--Source for the German text needed.-->)\n\n==== Others ====\nIn his ''Theory of Harmony'' {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=407}}: \"Besides myself my students Dr. Anton Webern and [[Alban Berg]] have written these harmonies (fourth chords), but also the Hungarian [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] or the Viennese [[Franz Schreker]], who both go a similar way to Debussy, Dukas and perhaps also [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], are not far off.\"<!--- (\u201eAu\u00dfer mir haben meine Sch\u00fcler Dr. Anton Webern und Alban Berg solche Kl\u00e4nge [gemeint sind Quartenkl\u00e4nge] geschrieben.

These steps are a restructuring of fourth chords (C\u2013D\u2013G becomes the fourth chord D\u2013G\u2013C), or other mixtures of fourths and fifths (D{{music|sharp}}\u2013A{{music|sharp}}\u2013D{{music|sharp}}\u2013G{{music|sharp}}\u2013C{{music|sharp}} in measure 3 of the example).\n\nHindemith was, however, not a proponent of an explicit quartal harmony. In his 1937 writing ''Unterweisung im Tonsatz'' (''The Craft of Musical Composition'', {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937}}), he wrote that \"notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,\"<!--- (\u201edass die T\u00f6ne eine Familienzugeh\u00f6rigkeit besitzen, die sich in der Bindung an tonale Hauptt\u00f6ne \u00e4u\u00dfert, die eine unzweideutige Rangliste der Tonverwandschaften aufstellt.\u201c)---> so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition \"\u2026the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.\"<!--- (\u201e... der Musiker ist an ihn gebunden, wie der Maler an die prim\u00e4ren Farben, der Architekt an die drei Dimensionen.\u201c)---> He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. \"The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its [[Combination tone]]s.\"<!--- (\u201eDas st\u00e4rkste und eindeutige harmonische Intervall ist n\u00e4chst der alleinstehenden  Oktave die Quinte, das sch\u00f6nste jedoch die Terz wegen ihrer in den Kombinationst\u00f6nen begr\u00fcndeten Akkordwirkung.\u201c)--->\n\n[[Image:Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.png|thumb|center|378x378px|Quartal harmony in Hindemith's Flute Sonata, II with tonal center on B established by descent in left hand in [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and repeated B's and F{{music|sharp}}'s {{harv|Kostka, Payne, and Alm\u00e9n|2013|loc=Chapter twenty six: Materials and techniques, Chord structures, Quartal and secundal harmony, 469\u201370<!--  Meaningful subheadings simplify reference in translations and other editions (p. 498 in third ed.) -->}} {{Audio|Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.mid|Play}}|alt=]]The works of the Filipino composer [[Eliseo M.

In the first movement of his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] altered fourth chords descend chromatically in the right hand with a chromatic scale leading upward in the left hand.\n\n===Jazz===\nThe style of jazz, having an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] harmonic orbit, was in its [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|early days]] overtaken (until perhaps the [[Swing (genre)|Swing]] of the 1930s) by the vocabulary of 19th-century European music.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}<!--This makes almost no sense at all.

Jazz musicians had a clear interest in harmonic richness of colour, for which quartal harmony provided possibilities, as used by [[pianist]]s and [[arranger]]s like [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Bill Evans]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Milt Buckner]] {{harv|Hester|2000|loc=199}} [[Chick Corea]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) [[Herbie Hancock]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=203}}) and especially [[McCoy Tyner]] ({{harvnb|Herder|1987|loc=78}}; {{harvnb|Scivales|2005|loc=205}}).\n\n[[Image:II V I for wikipedia.png|thumb|right|275px|The [[II-V-I progression|ii\u2013V\u2013I cadence]] {{audio|II V9 I.MID|Play}}; the fourth-suspension or [[sus chord]] {{audio|II V9sus I.MID|Play}}]]\n\n[[Image:SenorBlues.png|thumb|380px|A typical [[hard bop]] brass part, from [[Horace Silver]]'s \"Se\u00f1or Blues\"]]\n\nThe [[hard bop]] of the 1950s made new applications of quartal harmony accessible to jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Quintet]] writing in which two brass instruments (commonly trumpet and saxophone) may proceed in fourths, while the piano (as a uniquely harmonic instrument) lays down chords, but sparsely, only hinting at the intended harmony. This style of writing, in contrast with that of the previous decade, preferred a moderate tempo. Thin-sounding unison bebop horn sections occur frequently, but these are balanced by bouts of very refined [[polyphony]] such as is found in [[cool jazz]].\n\n[[File:So What chord.png|thumb|100px|The [[So What chord|\"So What\" chord]] uses three intervals of a fourth.]]\n\nOn his watershed record ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', [[Miles Davis]] with pianist [[Bill Evans]] used a chord consisting of three perfect fourth intervals and a major third on the composition \"[[So What (composition)|So What]]\". This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a [[So What chord]], and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom {{harv|Levine|1989|loc=97}}.\n\nFrom the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist [[McCoy Tyner]]'s work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]'s \"classic quartet\", was influential throughout this epoch. [[Oliver Nelson]] was also known for his use of fourth chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]] {{harv|Corozine|2002|loc=12}}. Floyd claims that the \"foundation of 'modern quartal harmony'\" began in the era when the [[Charlie Parker]]\u2013influenced John Coltrane added classically trained pianists Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner to his ensemble {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nJazz guitarists cited as using chord voicings using quartal harmony include [[Johnny Smith]], [[Tal Farlow]], [[Chuck Wayne]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Joe Pass]], [[Jimmy Raney]], [[Wes Montgomery]], however all in a traditional manner, as major 9th, 13th and minor 11th chords {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}} (an octave and fourth equals an 11th). Jazz guitarists cited as using modern quartal harmony include [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] (especially [[Sonny Rollins]]'s ''[[The Bridge (Sonny Rollins album)|The Bridge]]''), [[George Benson]] (\"Skydive\"), [[Pat Martino]], [[Jack Wilkins]] (\"Windows\"), [[Joe Diorio]], [[Howard Roberts]] (\"Impressions\"), [[Kenny Burrell]] (\"So What\"), [[Wes Montgomery]] (\"Little Sunflower\"), [[Henry Johnson (guitarist)|Henry Johnson]], [[Russell Malone]], [[Jimmy Bruno]], [[Howard Alden]], [[Paul Bollenback]], [[Mark Whitfield]], and [[Rodney Jones (guitarist)|Rodney Jones]] {{harv|Floyd|2004|loc=4}}.\n\nQuartal harmony was also explored as a possibility under new experimental [[Scale (music)|scale]] models as they were \"discovered\" by jazz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Musicians began to work extensively with the so-called [[Mode (music)|church modes]] of old European music, and they became firmly situated in their compositional process. Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Chick Corea]] are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as [[free jazz]] also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use due to the wandering nature of its harmony.\n\n[[Image:Maiden Voyage2.png|thumb|center|400px|Fourths in Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}]]\n\nIn jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.\n\n[[Image:Quartal voicings.png|thumb|center|400px|[[ii-V-I turnaround]] with fourth voicings: all chords are in fourth voicings {{audio|Quartal voicings.mid|Play}}; They are often ambiguous as, for example, the Dm11 and G9sus chords are here voiced identically and will thus be distinguished for the listener by the [[root (chord)|root]] movement of the [[bassist]] {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=94}}]]\n\nThus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to \"blend into one overall sound\" sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=95}}.\n\n===Rock music===\n[[image:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|Disliking the sound of thirds (in equal-temperament tuning), Robert Fripp builds chords with perfect intervals in his new&nbsp;standard tuning.]]\n{{See also|Progressive rock|Symphonic rock}}\n\nQuartal and quintal harmony have been used by [[Robert Fripp]], who has described himself as the <!-- self-described.

Fripp dislikes minor thirds and especially major thirds in [[equal temperament]] tuning, which is used by non-experimental guitars. Of course, [[just intonation]]'s perfect octaves, perfect fifths, and perfect fourths are well approximated in equal temperament tuning, and perfect fifths and octaves are highly consonant intervals. Fripp builds chords using perfect fifths, fourths, and octaves in his [[new&nbsp;standard tuning]]&nbsp;(NST), a [[regular tuning]] having perfect fifths between its successive [[open string (music)|open-string]]s ({{harvnb|Mulhern|1986}}, {{Page needed|date=January 2013}}<!--The specific page citation is needed here;
