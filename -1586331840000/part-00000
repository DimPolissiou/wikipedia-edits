This leads to the condition where the stomach can randomly slide up and down through the hole and in this way affect both the esophagus\u2019 function and the upper stomach sphincter\u2019s (or Lower Esophageal Sphincter - \u2018LES\u2019) ability to close off tightly. At the same time the upper esophagus sphincter or PES (Posterior Esophageal Sphincter) is also affected, so that it does not open completely to allow food down into the esophagus.The experience of reflux varies from person to person. Whether you have a small or large leak of gastric juices into the oesophagus, you may suffer from reflux. The symptoms that appear in your everyday life may include a change in your voice, respiratory problems, dry cough, frothy and tough saliva or the feeling of a lump in the throat. \n\nIn some cases, gastric juices may cause damage to the mucous membranes of the oesophagus (such as inflammation, ulcers, or cell changes) even if you have not felt your reflux to be a major problem.\nWith a hiatal hernia a part of the stomach lies in the chest cavity instead, see the left hand illustration. The esophagus crumples like a concertina and the longitudinal muscles are relaxed. As a result, the esophagus\u2019 muscles lose the ability to create a stiff pipe and to open the upper esophagus mouth (upper esophgus sphincter) when swallowing.\n\nThis is the reason for the symptoms of the feeling of a lump-, or blockage feeling, pain in the esophagus, a cramping feeling when swallowing and food becoming stuck in the bend in the esophagus and sometimes being vomited up. Because the upper esophagus mouth does not open correctly there is also a risk that food will become stuck there and then slip into the air pathways. Food becomes stuck in your throat, you will cough, and may have other air pathway problems too.\n\nIn newborns, the presence of [[Bochdalek hernia]] can be recognised<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang SW, Lee HC, Yeung CY, Chan WT, Hsu CH, Kao HA, Hung HY, Chang JH, Sheu JC, Wang NL |title=A twenty-year review of early and late-presenting congenital Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia: are they different clinical spectra? |journal=Pediatr Neonatol |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=26\u201330 |year=2010 |pmid=20225535 |doi=10.1016/S1875-9572(10)60006-X }}</ref> from symptoms such as difficulty breathing<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 23810174 | doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.04.076 | volume=96 | issue=4 | title=Diaphragmatic hernia after esophagectomy in 440 patients with long-term follow-up |vauthors=Ganeshan DM, Correa AM, Bhosale P, Vaporciyan AA, Rice D, Mehran RJ, Walsh GL, Iyer R, Roth JA, Swisher SG, Hofstetter WL| journal=Ann Thorac Surg | pages=1138\u201345| year=2013 }}</ref> fast respiration, increased heart rate.<ref>{{cite journal |first=A |last=Alam |first2=B.N. |last2=Chander |title=Adult bochdalek hernia |journal=MJAFI |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=284\u20136 |date=July 2005 |doi=10.1016/S0377-1237(05)80177-7 |pmid=27407781 |url=|pmc=4925637 }}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\nThe following are potential causes of a hiatal hernia.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiatal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373379 |title = Hiatal hernia - Symptoms and causes}}</ref>\n\n* Increased pressure within the [[abdomen]] caused by:\n** Heavy lifting or bending over\n** Frequent or hard [[coughing]]\n** Hard sneezing\n** [[Vomiting|Violent vomiting]]\n** Straining during [[defecation]] (i.e., the [[Valsalva maneuver]])\n\n[[Obesity]] and age-related changes to the diaphragm are also general risk factors.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThe diagnosis of a hiatal hernia is typically made through an [[upper GI series]], [[gastroscopy|endoscopy]] or [[high resolution manometry]].\n<gallery>\nFile:HiatusHernia10.JPG|A large hiatal hernia on [[chest radiography|chest X-ray]] marked by open arrows in contrast to the heart borders marked by closed arrows\nFile:Hiatus hernia with air-fluid level.jpg|This hiatal hernia is mainly identified by an air-fluid level (labeled with arrows).\nFile:Hiatus-hernia.jpg|[[gastroscopy|Upper GI endoscopy]] depicting hiatal hernia\nFile:Hiatus hernia on CT scan.jpg|A hiatal hernia as seen on CT\nFile:HiatusHerniaMark.png|A large hiatal hernia as seen on CT imaging\nFile:HiatusHerniaCorMark.png|A large hiatal hernia as seen on CT imaging\nFile:UOTW 39 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|As seen on ultrasound<ref name=UOTW39>{{cite web|title=UOTW #39 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-39/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=25 February 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509123328/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-39/|archivedate=9 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nFile:UOTW 39 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|As seen on ultrasound<ref name=UOTW39/>\n</gallery>\n\n=== Classification ===\n[[Image:Hiatus hernia.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of different types of hiatus hernia.

The gastric fundus then serves as the leading point of herniation. Although type II hernias are associated with reflux disease, their primary clinical significance lies in the potential for mechanical complications. '''(D)'''\n\n'''Type III:''' Type III hernias have elements of both types I and II hernias. With progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal ligament stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm, thereby adding a sliding element to the type II hernia.\n\n'''Type IV:''' Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal ligament, allowing other organs, such as colon, spleen, pancreas and small intestine to enter the hernia sac.\n\nThe end stage of type I and type II hernias occurs when the whole stomach migrates up into the chest by rotating 180\u00b0 around its longitudinal axis, with the cardia and pylorus as fixed points. In this situation the abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stomach.\n\n== Treatment ==\nIn the great majority of cases, sufferers experience no life-altering discomfort, and no treatment is required. If there is pain or discomfort, 3 or 4 sips of room temperature water will usually relieve the pain. Symptomatic patients should elevate the head of their beds and avoid lying down directly after meals.<ref name=BMJ2014/> If the condition has been brought on by stress, [[stress management|stress reduction techniques]] may be prescribed, or if overweight, [[weight loss]] may be indicated.  Antisecretory drugs like [[proton pump inhibitors]] and [[histamine H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub> receptor]] blockers can be used to reduce acid secretion.  Medications that reduce the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES) pressure should be avoided.\n\nHowever, in some unusual instances, as when the hiatal hernia is unusually large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it may cause [[esophageal stricture]] or severe discomfort. About 5% of hiatal hernias are paraesophageal. If symptoms from such a hernia are severe for example if chronic acid reflux threatens to severely injure the [[esophagus]] or is causing [[Barrett's esophagus]], [[surgery]] is sometimes recommended. However surgery has its own risks including death and disability, so that even for large or paraesophageal hernias, watchful waiting may on balance be safer and cause fewer problems than surgery.<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\">{{cite journal | pmc = 1422604 | pmid=12368678 | doi=10.1097/00000658-200210000-00012 | volume=236 | issue=4 | title=Paraesophageal hernias: operation or observation? |vauthors=Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW| journal=Ann Surg | pages=492\u2013500 | year=2002 }}</ref> Complications from surgical procedures to correct a hiatal hernia may include [[gas bloat syndrome]], [[dysphagia]] (trouble swallowing), [[Gastric dumping syndrome|dumping syndrome]], excessive scarring, and rarely, [[achalasia]].<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\"/>  Surgical procedures sometimes fail over time, requiring a second surgery to make repairs.\n\nOne surgical procedure used is called [[Nissen fundoplication]].

The gastric fundus then serves as the leading point of herniation. Although type II hernias are associated with reflux disease, their primary clinical significance lies in the potential for mechanical complications. '''(D)'''\n\n'''Type III:''' Type III hernias have elements of both types I and II hernias. With progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal ligament stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm, thereby adding a sliding element to the type II hernia.\n\n'''Type IV:''' Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal ligament, allowing other organs, such as colon, spleen, pancreas and small intestine to enter the hernia sac.\n\nThe end stage of type I and type II hernias occurs when the whole stomach migrates up into the chest by rotating 180\u00b0 around its longitudinal axis, with the cardia and pylorus as fixed points. In this situation the abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stomach.\n\n== Treatment ==\nIn the great majority of cases, sufferers experience no life-altering discomfort, and no treatment is required. If there is pain or discomfort, 3 or 4 sips of room temperature water will usually relieve the pain. Symptomatic patients should elevate the head of their beds and avoid lying down directly after meals.<ref name=BMJ2014/> If the condition has been brought on by stress, [[stress management|stress reduction techniques]] may be prescribed, or if overweight, [[weight loss]] may be indicated.  Antisecretory drugs like [[proton pump inhibitors]] and [[histamine H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub> receptor]] blockers can be used to reduce acid secretion.  Medications that reduce the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES) pressure should be avoided.\n\nHowever, in some unusual instances, as when the hiatal hernia is unusually large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it may cause [[esophageal stricture]] or severe discomfort. About 5% of hiatal hernias are paraesophageal. If symptoms from such a hernia are severe for example if chronic acid reflux threatens to severely injure the [[esophagus]] or is causing [[Barrett's esophagus]], [[surgery]] is sometimes recommended. However surgery has its own risks including death and disability, so that even for large or paraesophageal hernias, watchful waiting may on balance be safer and cause fewer problems than surgery.<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\">{{cite journal | pmc = 1422604 | pmid=12368678 | doi=10.1097/00000658-200210000-00012 | volume=236 | issue=4 | title=Paraesophageal hernias: operation or observation? |vauthors=Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW| journal=Ann Surg | pages=492\u2013500 | year=2002 }}</ref> Complications from surgical procedures to correct a hiatal hernia may include [[gas bloat syndrome]], [[dysphagia]] (trouble swallowing), [[Gastric dumping syndrome|dumping syndrome]], excessive scarring, and rarely, [[achalasia]].<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\"/>  Surgical procedures sometimes fail over time, requiring a second surgery to make repairs.\n\nOne surgical procedure used is called [[Nissen fundoplication]]. In fundoplication, the [[gastric fundus]] (upper part) of the stomach is wrapped, or plicated, around the inferior part of the esophagus, preventing herniation of the stomach through the hiatus in the diaphragm and the reflux of [[gastric acid]].

At the time of the accident, he had accumulated a total flying hours of 9,260 hours, in which 1,927 hours were on the type. The co-pilot was 38 year old J.M Davies, who held a Vickers Vanguard rating. He had a total flying hours of 3,386 hours, in which 764 hours were on the type. The aircraft was also carrying a third pilot, identified as 27 year old B.J.S Barnes with a total flying hours of 2,237 hours, in which 1,903 hours were on the type and a supernumerary, identified as Captain G. Partridge.<ref name=\"FINAL\"/>\n\n==Investigation==\nWitnesses on the ground recalled that the Vanguard suddenly exploded in mid-air, lost one of its wings, and plunged onto the ground, with smoke pouring out from one of its wings. They stated that they heard strange noises during the crash. According to them, the aircraft touched down in one field, jumped a road, and plowed through grassland for 500 yards. It gouged into the ground and burst into flames in a pit 15 feet deep. One of the witness stated, \u201cThe fire spread from the wreckage like waves,\" Police said eyewitness reports indicated that Captain Probert had tried to execute an emergency landing.<ref name=\"ALL\"/>\n\nThere was considerable suspicion that the aircraft had been sabotaged by extremists. A BEA spokesman claimed that the aircraft was sabotaged by [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Northern Ireland extremists]]. The Vanguard had been used on the [[London]]\u2010[[Belfast]] route, though he said  the plane had not been on Belfast service for at least 48 hours and was stored in [[Edinburgh]] on Friday. However, after a preliminary investigation by William Trench, one of the investigators from AIB, stated that at the time there was no hint that sabotage played a part in the crash.<ref name=\"Bangor Daily News\"/>\n\n===Flight recorder analysis===\nInvestigators recovered the flight recorder from the crash site. The flight recorder was later taken to United Kingdom for further analysis. After investigators downloaded the content, they found that the recordings stopped abruptly while the flight was still in mid-air. Investigators concluded that a sudden explosive decompression caused this abrupt stop of the recordings.<ref name=\"FINAL\"/>\n\n===Structural failure===\n[[File:Boeing 747 Rear pressure bulkhead en.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[Aft pressure bulkhead|rear pressure bulkhead]]]]\nDetailed examination showed that the failure of the rear pressure bulkhead started the sequence of structural failure of Flight 706. The rapid inflation of the tailcone and empennage imposed a high differential pressure across the tailplane skin. This caused the upper panel to become detached from the main structure. The aircraft's flight load then caused the rapid break up and separation of the aircraft's tailplane from its main body. This separation of the tailplane caused the aircraft to pitch rapidly nose down. Investigators stated that recovery from this dive was impossible.<ref name=\"FINAL\"/>\n\nInvestigators found severe corrosion at the joint of the fuselage skin and the rear pressure bulkhead. This crack was hidden and probably was not detected by maintenance crew for a period of time. The crack was probably developed after a long period, evidenced by the presence of nicotine tar stains found on the crack.

At the time of the accident, he had accumulated a total flying hours of 9,260 hours, in which 1,927 hours were on the type. The co-pilot was 38 year old J.M Davies, who held a Vickers Vanguard rating. He had a total flying hours of 3,386 hours, in which 764 hours were on the type. The aircraft was also carrying a third pilot, identified as 27 year old B.J.S Barnes with a total flying hours of 2,237 hours, in which 1,903 hours were on the type and a supernumerary, identified as Captain G. Partridge.<ref name=\"FINAL\"/>\n\n==Investigation==\nWitnesses on the ground recalled that the Vanguard suddenly exploded in mid-air, lost one of its wings, and plunged onto the ground, with smoke pouring out from one of its wings. They stated that they heard strange noises during the crash. According to them, the aircraft touched down in one field, jumped a road, and plowed through grassland for 500 yards. It gouged into the ground and burst into flames in a pit 15 feet deep. One of the witness stated, \u201cThe fire spread from the wreckage like waves,\" Police said eyewitness reports indicated that Captain Probert had tried to execute an emergency landing.<ref name=\"ALL\"/>\n\nThere was considerable suspicion that the aircraft had been sabotaged by extremists. A BEA spokesman claimed that the aircraft was sabotaged by [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Northern Ireland extremists]]. The Vanguard had been used on the [[London]]\u2010[[Belfast]] route, though he said  the plane had not been on Belfast service for at least 48 hours and was stored in [[Edinburgh]] on Friday. However, after a preliminary investigation by William Trench, one of the investigators from AIB, stated that at the time there was no hint that sabotage played a part in the crash.<ref name=\"Bangor Daily News\"/>\n\n===Flight recorder analysis===\nInvestigators recovered the flight recorder from the crash site. The flight recorder was later taken to United Kingdom for further analysis. After investigators downloaded the content, they found that the recordings stopped abruptly while the flight was still in mid-air. Investigators concluded that a sudden explosive decompression caused this abrupt stop of the recordings.<ref name=\"FINAL\"/>\n\n===Structural failure===\n[[File:Rear pressure bulkhead B747.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[Aft pressure bulkhead|rear pressure bulkhead]]]]\nDetailed examination showed that the failure of the rear pressure bulkhead started the sequence of structural failure of Flight 706. The rapid inflation of the tailcone and empennage imposed a high differential pressure across the tailplane skin. This caused the upper panel to become detached from the main structure. The aircraft's flight load then caused the rapid break up and separation of the aircraft's tailplane from its main body. This separation of the tailplane caused the aircraft to pitch rapidly nose down. Investigators stated that recovery from this dive was impossible.<ref name=\"FINAL\"/>\n\nInvestigators found severe corrosion at the joint of the fuselage skin and the rear pressure bulkhead. This crack was hidden and probably was not detected by maintenance crew for a period of time. The crack was probably developed after a long period, evidenced by the presence of nicotine tar stains found on the crack. Further analysis from the nature of the progressive tear marks on the fracture surfaces suggests that the period was short.<ref name=\"FINAL\"/>\n\nInvestigators concluded that the crack affected the structural integrity of the aircraft.<ref name=\"FINAL\"/>\n\n===Inspection===\nIn their final report, investigators stated,<ref name=\"FINAL\"/>\n<blockquote>\"The approved maintenance schedule called for visual inspection of the bulkhead at relatively long intervals. This approach assumed that the bonding paint and sealing schemes remained intact and effective.

Spring Arbor was first spelled Spring Arbour on all early maps.\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, a Village of Spring Arbour had been planned along what is now the intersection of Cross and Hammond roads in the southwest portion of the township. The development of such a village began but ended with the departure of the Free Will Baptists' seminary to what is now [[Hillsdale College]]. Remnants of this plot are clearly visible on an aerial view of the area: a portion of Matthews Road continues along a street directed at the intersections of Cross and Hammond. Falling Waters Park can be found at this former establishment with historical information about the area including the Potawatomi village, the founding of the village of Spring Arbor, the 1835 founding of what would eventually become [[Albion College]], and the 1844 founding of the predecessor of both Hillsdale College and [[Spring Arbor University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.experiencejackson.com/business/9581|title = Falling Waters Park|date = |accessdate = |website = Experience Jackson|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSpring Arbor is in western Jackson County, in the center of Spring Arbor Township. State highway [[M-60 (Michigan highway)|M-60]] passes through the center of town, leading northeast {{convert|9|mi|0}} to [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]], the [[county seat]], and southwest {{convert|24|mi}} to [[Tekonsha, Michigan|Tekonsha]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the Spring Arbor CDP has a total area of {{convert|7.3|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.09|sqkm|order=flip|2}}, or 1.21%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> The community sits on the low height of land between the [[Kalamazoo River]] watershed to the west and the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] watershed to the east.\n\nSpring Arbor is well known for its artesian water springs which form several small lakes, creeks and rivers. Lime Lake County Park is located on {{convert|2|acre}} in Spring Arbor including a boat launch, a swimming area, playground equipment, and the Falling Waters Trail. The lake was created by the quarrying of [[marl]], a calcium carbonate or lime-rich mud used to make concrete. Divers frequent this lake to view bizarre underwater mountains, pillars, and spires left behind from concrete production.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.experiencejackson.com/business/416|title = Lime Lake County Park|date = |accessdate = |website = Experience Jackson|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 2,188 people, 643 households, and 367 families residing in the CDP.  The [[population density]] was 792.2 per square mile (306.1/km\u00b2).  There were 682 housing units at an average density of 246.9 per square mile (95.4/km\u00b2).

It is affiliated with the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]].\n\n[[Spring Arbor University]] is located in the community.  Established in 1873 as a seminary of the Free Methodist Church, it later became a high school, followed by a junior college, then a college and finally a university on April 30, 2001.\n\n[[Jackson Community College|Jackson College]] also serves the township.\n\n==Commerce and industry==\nThere are several nursing homes, retirement centers and assisted living centers in the community, all run by the Todd Ganton and Matt Gregory families.\n\n[[Spring Arbor University]] (a private university affiliated with the Free Methodist Church) employs approximately 275 staff and faculty on its main campus as of September 2004, which is by far the largest employer located in the community.\n\n[[Consumers Energy|CMS Energy]] employs a large number of Spring Arbor residents, but is located in

Falling Waters Park can be found at this former establishment with historical information about the area including the Potawatomi village, the founding of the village of Spring Arbor, the 1835 founding of what would eventually become [[Albion College]], and the 1844 founding of the predecessor of both Hillsdale College and [[Spring Arbor University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.experiencejackson.com/business/9581|title = Falling Waters Park|date = |accessdate = |website = Experience Jackson|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSpring Arbor is in western Jackson County, in the center of Spring Arbor Township.

{"title_page": "Lattice problem", "text_new": "In [[computer science]], '''lattice problems''' are a class of optimization problems related to mathematical objects called [[Lattice (group)|lattices]].  The conjectured intractability of such problems is central to the construction of secure [[Lattice-based cryptography|lattice-based cryptosystems]]:  Lattice problems are an example of NP-hard problems which have been shown to be average-case hard, providing a test case for the security of cryptographic algorithms.  In addition, some lattice problems which are worst-case hard can be used as a basis for extremely secure cryptographic schemes. The use of worst-case hardness in such schemes makes them among the very few schemes that are very likely secure even against [[quantum computers]]. For applications in such [[cryptosystems]], lattices over vector spaces (often <math>\\mathbb{Q}^n</math>) or [[free module|free modules]] (often <math>\\mathbb{Z}^n</math>) are generally considered.\n\nFor all the problems below, assume that we are given (in addition to other more specific inputs) a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the vector space ''V'' and a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] ''N''.

Moreover, worst-case hardness of some lattice problems have been used to create secure cryptographic schemes. The use of worst-case hardness in such schemes makes them among the very few schemes that are very likely secure even against [[quantum computers]].\n\nThe above lattice problems are easy to solve if the algorithm is provided with a \"good\" basis. [[Lattice reduction]] algorithms aim, given a basis for a lattice, to output a new basis consisting of relatively short, nearly [[orthogonal]] vectors. The [[Lenstra\u2013Lenstra\u2013Lov\u00e1sz lattice basis reduction algorithm]] (LLL) was an early efficient algorithm for this problem which could output an almost reduced lattice basis in polynomial time.<ref>{{cite journal |first=A.

However, experimental evidence suggests that most NP-hard problems lack this property: they are probably only worst case hard. Many lattice problems have been conjectured or proven to be average-case hard, making them an attractive class of problems to base cryptographic schemes on. Moreover, worst-case hardness of some lattice problems have been used to create secure cryptographic schemes. The use of worst-case hardness in such schemes makes them among the very few schemes that are very likely secure even against [[quantum computers]].\n\nThe above lattice problems are easy to solve if the algorithm is provided with a \"good\" basis. [[Lattice reduction]] algorithms aim, given a basis for a lattice, to output a new basis consisting of relatively short, nearly [[orthogonal]] vectors. The [[Lenstra\u2013Lenstra\u2013Lov\u00e1sz lattice basis reduction algorithm]] (LLL) was an early efficient algorithm for this problem which could output an almost reduced lattice basis in polynomial time.<ref>{{cite journal |first=A.
