Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to [[North American Rockwell]], the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell also constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was later fit with RS-25 engines and tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]]. Rockwell conducted structural tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effect of aerodynamic stresses.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\nFour operational OVs were originally built. Following the construction of ''Columbia'' (OV-102) and the conversion of ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (OV-099) to a flyable spacecraft, ''Discovery'' (OV-103) and ''Atlantis'' (OV-104) were ordered in January 1979. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]] in January 1986, NASA ordered a fifth OV, ''Endeavour'' (OV-105) in July 1987. ''Endeavour'' was primarily built from structural spares that were created during the construction of ''Discovery'' and ''Atlantis''.<ref name=challenger_report_ch3 /><ref name=\"endeavour_replacing\">{{cite web |last= Ryba |first= Jeanne |title= Endeavour |publisher= NASA |date= February 24, 2008 |url= https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/orbitersend.html |accessdate= May 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"endeavour_parts\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Endeavour: NASA's Youngest Shuttle |publisher= NASA |date= December 11, 2017 |url= https://www.space.com/18123-space-shuttle-endeavour.html |accessdate= May 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name=jenkins />{{rp|242\u2013243}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after [[STS-4]] and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting [[extravehicular activity]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned. ''Discovery'' was the first of NASA's three remaining operational Space Shuttles to be retired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA\u2014NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Launch Schedule |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate= July 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe final Space Shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010, but the program was later extended to July 2011 when Michael Suffredini of the ISS program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the International Space Station.<ref>{{cite web |first=John|last= Pike |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2010/space-100506-rianovosti01.htm |title=Space Shuttle may continue through next year\u2014Roscosmos |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}</ref> [[STS-135]] launched on July 8, 2011, and landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/index.html |title= Launch and Landing |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Distribution of orbiters and other hardware===\nNASA announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle program.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to [[North American Rockwell]], the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell also constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was later fit with RS-25 engines and tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]]. Rockwell conducted structural tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effect of aerodynamic stresses.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\nFour operational OVs were originally built.

The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after [[STS-4]] and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting [[extravehicular activity]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]].

{"title_page": "Martel affair", "text_new": "The '''Martel affair''', sometimes known as the '''Sapphire affair''', was a spy scandal that took place in [[France]] in early 1962. It involved information provided by former high-ranking member of the [[KGB]], [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], who defected to the [[United States]] in December 1961. Golitsyn stated that the Soviets had agents placed throughout French military intelligence and even within [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s cabinet. He claimed that these agents had access to any [[NATO]] document on demand.\n\nThe news so alarmed [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] that he sent a courier to hand deliver a message to [[Charles de Gaulle]] outlining the situation. Over the spring and summer of 1962, a team of French counter-intelligence officers interrogated Golitsyn for weeks. As his identity was closely guarded by the US, the French assigned him the code-name \"Martel\". Their interrogations overcame their initial suspicion that he was a CIA double-agent and they returned to France with grave warnings about the state of French security.\n\nFrench-US relations were strained at this time due to de Gaulle's policy of \"Politics of Grandeur\", and in return, de Gaulle was highly skeptical of the US's motives. Believing the story to be a fabrication, French intelligence was very deliberate in their investigations, and no action had been taken by late 1962. This was to the amazement of the US establishment, who began to take measures to exclude France from the NATO reporting chain. This led to NATO becoming largely non-functional for a year. Ultimately there was a three-year breakdown in US-French intelligence sharing.\n\nThe story only became public some years later when the former French intelligence liaison at the French embassy in Washington, Philippe Thyraud de Vosjoli, reported the story in an expos\u00e9 in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1968. A friend of de Vosjoli, [[Leon Uris]], used a highly fictionalized version of the Martel affair as the basis for the novel (and movie) ''[[Topaz (novel)|Topaz]]''.{{sfn|staff|1968|p=31}}\n\n== Anatoliy Golitsyn ==\nIn 1961, [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], a [[major]] in the KGB, was assigned to the embassy in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], under the name \"Ivan Klimov.\" On 15 December, he defected to the US, along with his wife and daughter, by riding the train to the Swedish border. Golitsyn's defection so alarmed the KGB that orders were sent out to cancel all meetings with field agents out of fear that is a they would be identified.<ref name=\"Mitrokhin\">{{cite book |first1=Vasili |last1=Mitrokhin |first2=Christopher |last2=Andrew |title=The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West |date=2015 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-196646-5 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tiNqCAAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nGolitsyn was flown to the US and interviewed by [[David Murphy (CIA)|David Murphy]], the head of the [[CIA]]'s Soviet Russia Division. After some time, Golitsyn began making increasing demands of the US and complaining about his treatment. Considering him to be unreliable, Murphy passed him on to [[James Jesus Angleton]], the CIA's director of counterintelligence.{{sfn|Richelson|1997|p=287}} Golitsyn's description of a traitor in the CIA, whom he knew only as \"[[Sasha (espionage)|Sasha]]\", led Angleton to embark on a multiyear manhunt that accused many members of the CIA of being the spy. The entire affair is still highly controversial.{{sfn|Mason|2014|loc=The Sapphire Affair}}\n\nGolitsyn's information ultimately led to the identification or the confirmation of Soviet spies throughout the [[Western world]], including [[Kim Philby]], [[Donald Duart Maclean]]{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}, [[Guy Burgess]]{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}, the potential double agent [[Aleksander Kopatzky]]{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}, and many others. He also claimed that their contacts had so infiltrated [[NATO]] that they were able to produce any secret document within a few days. So much information had been received that the KGB was using NATO's own document numbers to catalog them.{{sfn|staff|1968|p=31}} He could not identify the NATO mole directly but knew that he spoke [[French language|French]].{{sfn|Arboit|2007}} He also suggested the existence of a widespread network of KGB spies within the various branches of the French military and government offices.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=33\u201334}}{{sfn|Barry|1968|p=38}}\n\n== Kennedy's letter ==\nKennedy was alarmed by the implications of a French spy within NATO. Unable to trust any official communications network, he took the unusual route of handwriting a personal letter to de Gaulle and having it delivered directly to him by a courier. After outlining the worrying information, the letter went on to offer to de Gaulle direct access to the agent by members of the French security services.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=32}}\n\nThe letter arrived at a time when US-French relations were at a low point. In the [[postwar period]], both the US and the UK had set up spy networks in Paris with the explicit aim of spying on the Soviets but also with the secondary role of keeping an eye on political developments in France. The French were well aware of those networks but tolerated them until the 1950s. However, de Gaulle's policy of grandeur demanded for France to be able to keep its own secrets, and he began a policy to attempt to break down those networks. He ordered the SDECE to begin those efforts in January 1962.{{sfn|Barry|1968|p=39}}\n\nDe Gaulle expected there to be some sort of reprisal on the part of the [[CIA]], and he went as far as falsely believeing that the US might be behind the [[Organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS), which tried to assassinate him. All of that was taking place while Kennedy's letter arrived. That led the French to believe that the entire affair might be a CIA-led effort to discredit and shake up the French services, but a personal letter from the US president could not be ignored.{{sfn||1968|op=39}}\n\n== French interrogations ==\nDe Gaulle responded by placing Jean-Louis de Rougemont in charge of determining whether it was true that Martel was a Soviet defector. De Rougemont was the director of the Second Division of the National Defense staff, which had the task of co-ordinating the various intelligence services. He also had deep personal contacts with his counterparts in the US establishment. He flew to [[Washington, DC]], in the spring of 1962 to meet with his contacts and was granted three or four days of personal interviews with Golitsyn, whose identity was still a highly-guarded secret and so he was referred to only as \"Martel.\" Initially believing Martel to be a ride, created by the US, de Rougemont was convinced otherwise by his meetings.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=32}}\n\nDe Rougemont made his report directly to [[\u00c9tienne Burin des Roziers]], the [[Secretary-General of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e]], who organized a meeting with the heads of the [[Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage]] (SDECE) and the [[Direction de la Securite du Territoire]] (DST), responsible for external and internal security. They had been aware of rumors that a high-ranking defector was in CIA hands, and des Roziers told them that the defector was real, he was as important as the rumors suggested, and his information about French security demanded an immediate detailed debriefing by counterintelligence experts.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=32}}\n\nA mission was quickly arranged and arrived in Washington, DC, in May.{{sfn|Richelson|1997|p=287}} Liaising with the French intelligence attach\u00e9, de Vosjoli, a [[safe house]] was provided for the team. He was upset to learn that previous meetings had taken place without his involvement and that the letter from Kennedy to de Gaulle, being nonspecific, had impugned the entire French establishment. He initially believed that Martel might be a double agent on a mission of upsetting French-US relations. However, the team's reports, which he forwarded to Paris, quickly convinced him otherwise.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=32}}\n\nIn one particularly telling series of questions, the French officers attempted to trap Martel. Since he claimed that he had personally seen a number of NATO reports in Moscow, the team provided Martel with a range of documents, some real and some fake. Martel was able to identify a few of them as having been personally seen by him, but he identified all of those that were real he stated every one of the fake documents as not having seen them. That development was extremely worrying. He then went on to provide a complete description of the organization and the operation of the SDECE, including details of a secret reorganization in 1958.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=34}}\n\nWhen pressed for details on the identities of agents, Martel was able to provide only details of their operations and general descriptions. He had only seen their reports and was not involved in their actual operations, but he was aware, in general terms, of what positions they held. Returning to France after two weeks of interrogations, the team looked over the interviews and attempted to identify various details.

The SDECE immediately identified de Vosjoli as the source of the request and informed him on 16 September that he was being replaced.

It involved information provided by former high-ranking member of the [[KGB]], [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], who defected to the [[United States]] in December 1961. Golitsyn stated that the Soviets had agents placed throughout French military intelligence and even within [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s cabinet. He claimed that these agents had access to any [[NATO]] document on demand.\n\nThe news so alarmed [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] that he sent a courier to hand deliver a message to [[Charles de Gaulle]] outlining the situation. Over the spring and summer of 1962, a team of French counter-intelligence officers interrogated Golitsyn for weeks. As his identity was closely guarded by the US, the French assigned him the code-name \"Martel\". Their interrogations overcame their initial suspicion that he was a CIA double-agent and they returned to France with grave warnings about the state of French security.\n\nFrench-US relations were strained at this time due to de Gaulle's policy of \"Politics of Grandeur\", and in return, de Gaulle was highly skeptical of the US's motives. Believing the story to be a fabrication, French intelligence was very deliberate in their investigations, and no action had been taken by late 1962. This was to the amazement of the US establishment, who began to take measures to exclude France from the NATO reporting chain. This led to NATO becoming largely non-functional for a year. Ultimately there was a three-year breakdown in US-French intelligence sharing.\n\nThe story only became public some years later when the former French intelligence liaison at the French embassy in Washington, Philippe Thyraud de Vosjoli, reported the story in an expos\u00e9 in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1968. A friend of de Vosjoli, [[Leon Uris]], used a highly fictionalized version of the Martel affair as the basis for the novel (and movie) ''[[Topaz (novel)|Topaz]]''.{{sfn|staff|1968|p=31}}\n\n== Anatoliy Golitsyn ==\nIn 1961, [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], a [[major]] in the KGB, was assigned to the embassy in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], under the name \"Ivan Klimov.\" On 15 December, he defected to the US, along with his wife and daughter, by riding the train to the Swedish border. Golitsyn's defection so alarmed the KGB that orders were sent out to cancel all meetings with field agents out of fear that is a they would be identified.<ref name=\"Mitrokhin\">{{cite book |first1=Vasili |last1=Mitrokhin |first2=Christopher |last2=Andrew |title=The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West |date=2015 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-196646-5 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=tiNqCAAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nGolitsyn was flown to the US and interviewed by [[David Murphy (CIA)|David Murphy]], the head of the [[CIA]]'s Soviet Russia Division. After some time, Golitsyn began making increasing demands of the US and complaining about his treatment. Considering him to be unreliable, Murphy passed him on to [[James Jesus Angleton]], the CIA's director of counterintelligence.{{sfn|Richelson|1997|p=287}} Golitsyn's description of a traitor in the CIA, whom he knew only as \"[[Sasha (espionage)|Sasha]]\", led Angleton to embark on a multiyear manhunt that accused many members of the CIA of being the spy. The entire affair is still highly controversial.{{sfn|Mason|2014|loc=The Sapphire Affair}}\n\nGolitsyn's information ultimately led to the identification or the confirmation of Soviet spies throughout the [[Western world]], including [[Kim Philby]], [[Donald Duart Maclean]]{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}, [[Guy Burgess]]{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}, the potentialdouble agent [[Aleksander Kopatzky]]{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}, and many others. He also claimed that their contacts had so infiltrated [[NATO]] that they were able to produce any secret document within a few days. So much information had been received that the KGB was using NATO's own document numbers to catalog them.{{sfn|staff|1968|p=31}} He could not identify the NATO mole directly but knew that he spoke [[French language|French]].{{sfn|Arboit|2007}} He also suggested the existence of a widespread network of KGB spies within the various branches of the French military and government offices.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=33\u201334}}{{sfn|Barry|1968|p=38}}\n\n== Kennedy's letter ==\nKennedy was alarmed by the implications of a French spy within NATO. Unable to trust any official communications network, he took the unusual route of handwriting a personal letter to de Gaulle and having it delivered directly to him by a courier. After outlining the worrying information, the letter went on to offer to de Gaulle direct access to the agent by members of the French security services.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=32}}\n\nThe letter arrived at a time when US-French relations were at a low point. In the [[postwar period]], both the US and the UK had set up spy networks in Paris with the explicit aim of spying on the Soviets but also with the secondary role of keeping an eye on political developments in France. The French were well aware of those networks but tolerated them until the 1950s. However, de Gaulle's policy of grandeur demanded for France to be able to keep its own secrets, and he began a policy to attempt to break down those networks. He ordered the SDECE to begin those efforts in January 1962.{{sfn|Barry|1968|p=39}}\n\nDe Gaulle expected there to be some sort of reprisal on the part of the [[CIA]], and he went as far as falsely believeing that the US might be behind the [[Organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS), which tried to assassinate him. All of that was taking place while Kennedy's letter arrived. That led the French to believe that the entire affair might be a CIA-led effort to discredit and shake up the French services, but a personal letter from the US president could not be ignored.{{sfn||1968|op=39}}\n\n== French interrogations ==\nDe Gaulle responded by placing Jean-Louis de Rougemont in charge of determining whether it was true that Martel was a Soviet defector. De Rougemont was the director of the Second Division of the National Defense staff, which had the task of co-ordinating the various intelligence services. He also had deep personal contacts with his counterparts in the US establishment. He flew to [[Washington, DC]], in the spring of 1962 to meet with his contacts and was granted three or four days of personal interviews with Golitsyn, whose identity was still a highly-guarded secret and so he was referred to only as \"Martel.\" Initially believing Martel to be a ride, created by the US, de Rougemont was convinced otherwise by his meetings.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=32}}\n\nDe Rougemont made his report directly to [[\u00c9tienne Burin des Roziers]], the [[Secretary-General of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e]], who organized a meeting with the heads of the [[Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage]] (SDECE) and the [[Direction de la Securite du Territoire]] (DST), responsible for external and internal security. They had been aware of rumors that a high-ranking defector was in CIA hands, and des Roziers told them that the defector was real, he was as important as the rumors suggested, and his information about French security demanded an immediate detailed debriefing by counterintelligence experts.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=32}}\n\nA mission was quickly arranged and arrived in Washington, DC, in May.{{sfn|Richelson|1997|p=287}} Liaising with the French intelligence attach\u00e9, de Vosjoli, a [[safe house]] was provided for the team. He was upset to learn that previous meetings had taken place without his involvement and that the letter from Kennedy to de Gaulle, being nonspecific, had impugned the entire French establishment. He initially believed that Martel might be a double agent on a mission of upsetting French-US relations. However, the team's reports, which he forwarded to Paris, quickly convinced him otherwise.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=32}}\n\nIn one particularly telling series of questions, the French officers attempted to trap Martel. Since he claimed that he had personally seen a number of NATO reports in Moscow, the team provided Martel with a range of documents, some real and some fake. Martel was able to identify a few of them as having been personally seen by him, but he identified all of those that were real he stated every one of the fake documents as not having seen them. That development was extremely worrying. He then went on to provide a complete description of the organization and the operation of the SDECE, including details of a secret reorganization in 1958.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=34}}\n\nWhen pressed for details on the identities of agents, Martel was able to provide only details of their operations and general descriptions. He had only seen their reports and was not involved in their actual operations, but he was aware, in general terms, of what positions they held. Returning to France after two weeks of interrogations, the team looked over the interviews and attempted to identify various details. They returned to Washington again to confirm their suspicions with Martel, who was able to eliminate many of their guesses and to suggest others that matchee the details that he knew. That led to the identification of widespread networks within the Ministry of the Interior; Defense and Foreign Affairs; are member of de Gaulle's cabinet; an entire network of twelve agents, known as \"Sapphire,\" operating within the SDECE {{sfn|Richelson|1997|p=288}} and a second network within the SDECE that was specifically tasks with passing on US nuclear secrets.{{signe I|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=34}}\n\n== Increasing suspicion ==\nIt was the last item that led to intense distrust of the information within French intelligence.

The agent was soon arrested by the Cubans, and de Vosjoli was advised that his name was also known to the Cubans and so he should no longer visit Cuba.{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=37}}\n\nIt was that series of events that led de Vosjoli to contact [[Herv\u00e9 Alphand]], the French ambassador to the US. Alphand contacted trusted members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and found that they were entirely unaware of the issue since the SDECE had not informed them of the Martel information. The SDECE immediately identified de Vosjoli as the source of the request and informed him on 16 September that he was being replaced. He did not return to France{{sfn|de Vosjoli|1968|pp=37}} and is considered to be the only example of a French intelligence officer defecting to the US.{{sfn|staff|1968|p=31}}\n\nFrench inaction on the Martel case, combined with de Vosjoli's very public dismissal, eventually led to a complete breakdown in French-US intelligence-sharing in 1964. The issues were not entirely cleared up for three years, when normal communications resumed.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{cite web\n |first       = G\u00e9rald\n |last        = Arboit\n |title       = How The CIA Counterintelligence Staff Broke the Western Intelligence Community for Ten Years (1962\u20131973)\n |website     = Centre fran\u00e7ais de recherche sur le renseignement\n |date        = May 2007\n |url         = http://www.cf2r.org/fr/notes-historiques/in-his-defector-he-trusted-how-the-cia-counterintelligence-staff-broke-the-western-intelligence-community-for-ten-years-1962-1973.php\n |ref         = harv\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140701195515/http://www.cf2r.org/fr/notes-historiques/in-his-defector-he-trusted-how-the-cia-counterintelligence-staff-broke-the-western-intelligence-community-for-ten-years-1962-1973.php\n |archivedate = 2014-07-01\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n|first=John |last=Barry\n|title=Broad Impact of \"Martel\" Everywhere but France\n|journal=Life\n|date=26 April 1968\n|pages=38\u201339\n|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ylQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30\n|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal\n|first=Philippe Thyraud |last=De Vosjoli\n|title=So Much Has Been Swept under the Rug\n|journal=Life\n|date=26 April 1968\n|pages=32\u201337\n|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ylQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32\n|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal\n|last=staff\n|title=A Head That Holds Some Sinister Secrets\n|journal=Life\n|date=26 April 1968\n|pages=30\u201331\n|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ylQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30\n|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n|first=Fergus |last=Mason\n|title= Stranger Than Fiction: The Real Life Stories Behind Alfred Hitchcock's Greatest Works\n|publisher= Absolute Crime\n|date=2014\n|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=sO61AgAAQBAJ\n|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book\n|first=Jeffrey |last=Richelson\n|title= A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century\n|publisher= Oxford University Press\n|date=1997\n|isbn= 978-0-19-976173-9\n|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=s2aN5ETA_GQC\n|ref=harv}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n|first=Fergus |last=Mason\n|title= The Sapphire Affair: The True Story Behind Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz\n|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Sapphire_Affair.html?id=BdprAgAAQBAJ\n|publisher= Absolute Crime\n|date= 2013\n}}\n\n[[Category:Espionage scandals and incidents]]\n[[Category:1962 in France]]\n[[Category:Cold War espionage]]\n", "name_user": "David J Johnson", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAnatoliy Golitsyn:#", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martel_affair"}

In [[County Londonderry]], where it is numerous, it is spelt Hassan, Hassen, Hasson, Hassin and Hessin.  In the Monaghan Hearth Money Rolls of 1663, it appears as O'Hassan.  There was a Hasson of Wexford among the \"principal gentlemen\" of that county in 1598, but that family was no doubt of non-Gaelic stock, and a John Hassan was an influential merchant in Wexford fifty years earlier.<ref>{{cite book|title=Surnames of Ireland|author=Edward Neafsey|publisher= Irish Roots Cafe|year=2002|isbn= 978-0-940134-97-3}}</ref><ref>hoganstand.com: [http://www.hoganstand.com/general/Identity/names/h.htm Irish Identity Surnames In Irish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007011237/http://www.hoganstand.com/general/identity/names/h.htm |date=2008-10-07 }}</ref><ref>ulsterancestry.com: [http://www.ulsterancestry.com/irish-surnames.html Ulster Ancestry Irish Family Names]</ref><ref>surnamedb.com: [http://www.surnamedb.com/surname.aspx?name=Hassan Surname]</ref><ref>medievalscotland.org: [http://medievalscotland.org/kmo/Woulfe/SortedByGaelicSpelling_O4.shtml 16th & 17th Century Anglicized Irish Surnames ]</ref><ref>irishtimes.com: [http://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/surname/index.cfm?fuseaction=Go.&Surname=Hassan&UserID= Irish Ancestors Surname Hassan]</ref> Another derivation is from \"[[Hal]]'s son\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=George F.|title=The Surnames of Scotland|date=1946|publisher=Birlinn|page=346}}</ref>\n* In [[Israel]] and among [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]], the surname Hassan (''{{lang|he|\u05d7\u05e1\u05df}}'') is derived as a [[Ladino]] spelling variant of [[Hazan]] (\"cantor\") and therefore represents an alteration of this term.<ref name=autogenerated1>independent.co.uk: [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-joshua-hassan-1248542.html Obituary: Sir Joshua Hassan]</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>jpost.com: [https://www.jpost.com/jewish-world/jewish-news/french-jews-reclaim-jewish-names French Jews reclaim 'Jewish' names]</ref><ref>[http://www.templetulsa.com/pages/cmspage.php?staticpageid=6 Temple Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008103856/http://www.templetulsa.com/pages/cmspage.php?staticpageid=6 |date=2008-10-08 }}, Tulsa</ref><ref>avotaynu.com: [http://www.avotaynu.com/books/TaggerKeremNames.htm Guidebook for Sephardic and Oriental Genealogical Sources in Israel]</ref><ref>sephardicgen.com: [http://www.sephardicgen.com/names.htm Sephardic Surnames]</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>italian-family-history.com: [http://www.italian-family-history.com/jewish/Livorno.html Jewish Genealogy in Italy]</ref> Hassan is normally an Arab first or last name;

surname:\n* In [[Arabic]], Hassan is a transliteration of two names that both derive from the [[Arabic language]] [[triconsonantal]] root [[\u1e24-S-N]]: ''{{transl|ar|\u1e24asan}}'' ({{lang|ar|\u062d\u0633\u0646}}), which means \"handsome\", \"manly\", \"strong\", or \"good\", and ''{{transl|ar|\u1e24ass\u0101n}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646}}), which means \"benefactor\".\n* In [[Ireland]]/[[Scotland]], the surname Hassan is one of the anglicized forms of the [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]] ([[Irish language|Irish]]/[[Scottish Gaelic|Scottish]]) form of \u00d3 hOs\u00e1in.  It is to be distinguished from \u00d3 hOis\u00edn and \u00d3 hOise\u00e1in ([[Hession (surname)|Hession]] and [[Hishon]]).  In [[County Londonderry]], where it is numerous, it is spelt Hassan, Hassen, Hasson, Hassin and Hessin.  In the Monaghan Hearth Money Rolls of 1663, it appears as O'Hassan.  There was a Hasson of Wexford among the \"principal gentlemen\" of that county in 1598, but that family was no doubt of non-Gaelic stock, and a John Hassan was an influential merchant in Wexford fifty years earlier.<ref>{{cite book|title=Surnames of Ireland|author=Edward Neafsey|publisher= Irish Roots Cafe|year=2002|isbn= 978-0-940134-97-3}}</ref><ref>hoganstand.com: [http://www.hoganstand.com/general/Identity/names/h.htm Irish Identity Surnames In Irish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007011237/http://www.hoganstand.com/general/identity/names/h.htm |date=2008-10-07 }}</ref><ref>ulsterancestry.com: [http://www.ulsterancestry.com/irish-surnames.html Ulster Ancestry Irish Family Names]</ref><ref>surnamedb.com: [http://www.surnamedb.com/surname.aspx?name=Hassan Surname]</ref><ref>medievalscotland.org: [http://medievalscotland.org/kmo/Woulfe/SortedByGaelicSpelling_O4.shtml 16th & 17th Century Anglicized Irish Surnames ]</ref><ref>irishtimes.com: [http://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/surname/index.cfm?fuseaction=Go.&Surname=Hassan&UserID= Irish Ancestors Surname Hassan]</ref> Another derivation is from \"[[Hal]]'s son\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=George F.|title=The Surnames of Scotland|date=1946|publisher=Birlinn|page=346}}</ref>\n* In [[Israel]] and among [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]], the surname Hassan (''{{lang|he|\u05d7\u05e1\u05df}}'') is derived as a [[Ladino]] spelling variant of [[Hazan]] (\"cantor\") and therefore represents an alteration of this term.<ref name=autogenerated1>independent.co.uk: [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-joshua-hassan-1248542.html Obituary: Sir Joshua Hassan]</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>jpost.com: [https://www.jpost.com/jewish-world/jewish-news/french-jews-reclaim-jewish-names French Jews reclaim 'Jewish' names]</ref><ref>[http://www.templetulsa.com/pages/cmspage.php?staticpageid=6 Temple Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008103856/http://www.templetulsa.com/pages/cmspage.php?staticpageid=6 |date=2008-10-08 }}, Tulsa</ref><ref>avotaynu.com: [http://www.avotaynu.com/books/TaggerKeremNames.htm Guidebook for Sephardic and Oriental Genealogical Sources in Israel]</ref><ref>sephardicgen.com: [http://www.sephardicgen.com/names.htm Sephardic Surnames]</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>italian-family-history.com: [http://www.italian-family-history.com/jewish/Livorno.html Jewish Genealogy in Italy]</ref> Hassan is normally an Arab first or last name;

{"title_page": "List of military slang terms", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Globalize|date=November 2016}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2020}}\n}}\n[[Military slang]] is a colloquial language used by and associated with members of various [[military]] forces. This page lists slang words or phrases that originate with military forces, are used exclusively by military personnel or are strongly associated with military organizations.\n\n==Acronym slang==\nA number of military slang terms are [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]]. These include ''SNAFU'', ''SUSFU'', ''FUBAR'' and similar terms used by various branches of the United States military during World War II.\n\n===BOHICA===\n''BOHICA'' (''Bend Over, Here It Comes Again'') is the title of a bestselling 1987 book by Scott T. Barnes. The book is the true account of a US ISA covert paramilitary operation, dubbed Operation Grand Eagle, that took place in Laos in 1981 with a small group of Green Berets, ISA operatives, and CIA staff. Later the operation would be the subject of several US Senate hearings, congressional hearings, and a Federal Grand Jury investigation.\n\n\"BOHICA\" was to be used as the code word on covert communications with the NSA/CIA and ISA HQ. During the mission, it was uncovered that criminals of war were still being held captive in Laos. Two were ordered assassinated and to date have never been rescued, as it was determined they may have been off-the-book CIA operatives smuggling drugs.\n\nThe ''Log,'' the humor magazine written by and for Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, featured a series of comics titled \"The Bohica Brothers,\" dating back to the early 1970s.\n\n===FUBAR===\n{{distinguish-otheruses2|Foobar|FUBAR}}\n{{Wiktionary|FUBAR}}\n\n''FUBAR'' (''Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition/Any Repair/All Reason''), like SNAFU and SUSFU, dates from [[World War II]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' lists ''Yank, the Army Weekly magazine'' (1944, 7 Jan. p.&nbsp;8) as its earliest citation: \"The FUBAR squadron. \u2025 FUBAR? It means 'Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |title =fubar, ''adj''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Pres |location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nAnother version of FUBAR, said to have originated in the military, gives its meaning as Fucked Up By Assholes in the Rear. This version has at least surface validity in that it is a common belief among enlisted men and women that most problems are created by the military brass (officers, especially those bearing the rank of General, from one to four stars).

This page lists slang words or phrases that originate with military forces, are used exclusively by military personnel or are strongly associated with military organizations.\n\n==Acronym slang==\nA number of military slang terms are [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]]. These include ''SNAFU'', ''SUSFU'', ''FUBAR'' and similar terms used by various branches of the United States military during World War II.\n\n===BOHICA===\n''BOHICA'' (''Bend Over, Here It Comes Again'') is the title of a bestselling 1987 book by Scott T. Barnes. The book is the true account of a US ISA covert paramilitary operation, dubbed Operation Grand Eagle, that took place in Laos in 1981 with a small group of Green Berets, ISA operatives, and CIA staff. Later the operation would be the subject of several US Senate hearings, congressional hearings, and a Federal Grand Jury investigation.\n\n\"BOHICA\" was to be used as the code word on covert communications with the NSA/CIA and ISA HQ. During the mission, it was uncovered that criminals of war were still being held captive in Laos. Two were ordered assassinated and to date have never been rescued, as it was determined they may have been off-the-book CIA operatives smuggling drugs.\n\nThe ''Log,'' the humor magazine written by and for Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy, featured a series of comics titled \"The Bohica Brothers,\" dating back to the early 1970s.\n\n===FUBAR===\n{{distinguish-otheruses2|Foobar|FUBAR}}\n{{Wiktionary|FUBAR}}\n\n''FUBAR'' (''Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition/Any Repair/All Reason''), like SNAFU and SUSFU, dates from [[World War II]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' lists ''Yank, the Army Weekly magazine'' (1944, 7 Jan. p.&nbsp;8) as its earliest citation: \"The FUBAR squadron. \u2025 FUBAR? It means 'Fucked/Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |title =fubar, ''adj''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Pres |location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nAnother version of FUBAR, said to have originated in the military, gives its meaning as Fucked Up By Assholes in the Rear. This version has at least surface validity in that it is a common belief among enlisted men and women that most problems are created by the military brass (officers, especially those bearing the rank of General, from one to four stars). This version is also most likely to have had its origin in the Army, where the senior officers command from the rear, as opposed to the Navy, where it is not uncommon for Admirals to command a fleet from one of the ships at sea, and therefore susceptible to attacks and death by the enemy (though it is freely acknowledged that the higher level Admirals usually command from a land base). Ditto as to Air Force Generals, who do not fly and/or directly command airplanes or even Squadrons or Air Wings. FUBAR had a resurgence in the American lexicon after the term was used in two popular movies: [[Tango and Cash]] (1989) and [[Saving Private Ryan]] (1998).<ref>{{cite web |title=Which movie did FUBAR come from?(forums) |url=https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/which-movie-did-fubar-come-from.1643805/ |website=ananadtech.com |publisher=Anandtech |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis particular FUBAR acronym survived WWII and for a time in the 70s, found its way into the lexicon of management consultants. Their use of the term,(though the word, \u201crear,\u201d is not normally used to describe the vantage point of senior corporate executives) may have come about as the result of their frequent conclusions that the cause of corporate problems (inefficiencies and ineffectiveness causing poor profitability or a negative bottom line) rested not with rank and file workers, but with executives, particularly senior executives - the equivalent of senior military officers. Therefore, FUBAR (Fucked Up By Assholes in the Rear) still applied well, even if in reality it should have been rendered as FUBAT (Fucked Up By Assholes at the Top).\n\n===FUBU===\n{{distinguish|FUBU}}\n''FUBU'' (''Fucked/fouled Up Beyond all Understanding'') was also used during World War II.\n\n===SNAFU===\n{{main|SNAFU}}\n''SNAFU'' is widely used to stand for the sarcastic expression ''Situation Normal: All Fucked Up'', as a well-known example of military acronym slang.

As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', ''[[Private Lives]]'', ''[[Design for Living]]'', ''[[Present Laughter]]'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'' and comic [[revue]]s), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel ''Pomp and Circumstance'', and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1943 for his naval film drama ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as \"[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]\", \"[[London Pride (song)|London Pride]]\" and \"[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]\".\n\nCoward's plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including [[Graham Payn]], his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the [[No\u00ebl Coward Theatre]] in his honour in 2006.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nCoward was born in 1899 in [[Teddington]], [[Middlesex]], a south-western suburb of London.

This seemed to dispose of all argument. I was a talented boy, God knows, and, when washed and smarmed down a bit, passably attractive.

Although he had little luck, he found the Broadway theatre stimulating.<ref name=Kenrick1 /> He absorbed its smartness and pace into his own work, which brought him his first real success as a playwright with ''The Young Idea''. The play opened in London in 1923, after a provincial tour, with Coward in one of the leading roles.<ref>Hoare, pp. 89\u201391</ref> The reviews were good: \"Mr No\u00ebl Coward calls his brilliant little farce a 'comedy of youth', and so it is.

During the run of ''The Vortex'', Coward met [[John C. Wilson|Jack Wilson]], an American stockbroker (later a director and producer), who became his business manager and lover.

It is a comedy about four egocentric members of an artistic family who casually invite acquaintances to their country house for the weekend and bemuse and enrage each other's guests. Some writers have seen elements of Coward's old mentor, Mrs Astley Cooper, and her set in the characters of the family.<ref>Hoare, pp. 42\u201343</ref> By the 1970s the play was recognised as a classic, described in ''The Times'' as a \"dazzling achievement; like ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', it is pure comedy with no mission but to delight, and it depends purely on the interplay of characters, not on elaborate comic machinery.\"<ref name=timesobit /> By June 1925 Coward had four shows running in the West End: ''The Vortex'', ''Fallen Angels'', ''Hay Fever'' and ''[[On with the Dance (musical)|On with the Dance]]''.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 107</ref> Coward was turning out numerous plays and acting in his own works and others'.

In ''Private Lives'', Coward starred alongside his most famous stage partner, Gertrude Lawrence, together with the young [[Laurence Olivier]]. It was a highlight of both Coward's and Lawrence's career, selling out in both London and New York. Coward disliked long runs, and after this he made a rule of starring in a play for no more than three months at any venue.<ref name=Kenrick2 /> ''Design for Living'', written for [[Alfred Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne]], was so risqu\u00e9, with its theme of bisexuality and a ''m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois'', that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing that it would not survive the censor in London.<ref>Hoare, p. 249</ref>\n\n[[File:Novello-lunt-fontanne-campbell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ivor Novello]], ''top l''., [[Alfred Lunt]], ''top r''., [[Lynn Fontanne]], ''lower l''. and [[Judy Campbell]]{{snd}}stars of Coward premi\u00e8res of the 1920s{{ndash}}1940s]]\nIn 1933 Coward wrote, directed and co-starred with the French singer [[Yvonne Printemps]] in both London and New York productions of an operetta, ''[[Conversation Piece (musical)|Conversation Piece]]'' (1933).<ref name=Kenrick2 /> He next wrote, directed and co-starred with Lawrence in ''[[Tonight at 8.30]]'' (1936), a cycle of ten short plays, presented in various permutations across three evenings.{{#tag:ref|The cycle effectively comprised only nine plays: although Coward wrote ten works for the cycle, ''[[Star Chamber (play)|Star Chamber]]'' was dropped after a single performance.<ref>Hoare, pp. 268\u201370</ref>|group= n}} One of these plays, ''[[Still Life (play)|Still Life]]'', was expanded into the 1945 [[David Lean]] film ''[[Brief Encounter]]''.<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 226\u201328 and 230</ref> ''Tonight at 8.30'' was followed by a musical, ''[[Operette (musical)|Operette]]'' (1938), from which the most famous number is \"The Stately Homes of England\", and a revue entitled ''[[Set to Music]]'' (1938, a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] version of his 1932 London revue, ''Words and Music'').<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 237 and 239</ref> Coward's last pre-war plays were ''[[This Happy Breed]]'', a drama about a working-class family, and ''[[Present Laughter]]'', a comic self-caricature with an egomaniac actor as the central character.

Despite his disappointments, Coward maintained a high public profile; his performance as King Magnus in Shaw's ''[[The Apple Cart]]'' for the Coronation season of 1953, co-starring [[Margaret Leighton]], received much coverage in the press,<ref>\"Haymarket Theatre\", ''The Times'', 8 May 1953, p. 12; and Brown, Ivor. \"Royal and Ancient\", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 May 1953, p. 5</ref> and his cabaret act, honed during his wartime tours entertaining the troops, was a supreme success, first in London at the [[Caf\u00e9 de Paris (London)|Caf\u00e9 de Paris]], and later in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 339\u201340</ref> The theatre critic Kenneth Tynan wrote:\n{{quote|To see him whole, public and private personalities conjoined, you must see him in cabaret&nbsp;... he padded down the celebrated stairs{{space}}... halted before the microphone on black-suede-clad feet, and, upraising both hands in a gesture of benediction, set about demonstrating how these things should be done. Baring his teeth as if unveiling some grotesque monument, and cooing like a [[baritone]] dove, he gave us \"I'll See You Again\" and the other bat's-wing melodies of his youth. Nothing he does on these occasions sounds strained or arid; his tanned, leathery face is still an enthusiast's.... If it is possible to romp fastidiously, that is what Coward does. He owes little to earlier wits, such as [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]] or [[Henry Labouch\u00e8re|Labouchere]]. Their best things need to be delivered slowly, even lazily.

He dubbed this comeback \"Dad's Renaissance\".<ref>Hoare p. 479 ''et seq.''</ref> It began with a hit 1963 revival of ''Private Lives'' in London and then New York.<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 370\u201372</ref> Invited to direct ''Hay Fever'' with [[Edith Evans]] at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], he wrote in 1964, \"I am thrilled and flattered and frankly a little flabbergasted that the National Theatre should have had the curious perceptiveness to choose a very early play of mine and to give it a cast that could play the Albanian telephone directory.\"<ref>Morley (1974), p. 369</ref>\n\nOther examples of \"Dad's Renaissance\" included a 1968 [[Off-Broadway]] production of ''Private Lives'' at the [[Lucille Lortel Theatre|Theatre de Lys]] starring [[Elaine Stritch]], [[Lee Bowman]] and [[Betsy von Furstenberg]], and directed by [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]. Despite this impressive cast, Coward's popularity had risen so high that the theatre poster for the production used an [[Al Hirschfeld]] caricature of Coward (''pictured'') {{#tag:ref|The caricature was also used in connection with other Coward works, for example on his album of his ballet suite, \"London Morning\" (1959; reissued in 1978 on LP on DRG SL 5180 with the Hirschfeld drawing on the cover)|group= n}} instead of an image of the production or its stars.

March 1973) was an English playwright, composer, director, actor and singer, known for his wit, flamboyance, and what ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called \"a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise\".<ref name=Time1969>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941819-2,00.html \"Noel Coward at 70\",] ''Time'', 26 December 1969, accessed 2 May 2011</ref>\n\nCoward attended a dance academy in London as a child, making his professional stage d\u00e9but at the age of eleven. As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', ''[[Private Lives]]'', ''[[Design for Living]]'', ''[[Present Laughter]]'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta ''[[Bitter Sweet]]'' and comic [[revue]]s), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel ''Pomp and Circumstance'', and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1943 for his naval film drama ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as \"[[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Mad Dogs and Englishmen]]\", \"[[London Pride (song)|London Pride]]\" and \"[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]\".\n\nCoward's plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including [[Graham Payn]], his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the [[No\u00ebl Coward Theatre]] in his honour in 2006.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nCoward was born in 1899 in [[Teddington]], [[Middlesex]], a south-western suburb of London. His parents were Arthur Sabin Coward (1856{{ndash}}1937), a piano salesman, and Violet Agnes Coward (1863{{ndash}}1954), daughter of [[s:A Naval Biographical Dictionary/Veitch, Henry Gordon|Henry Gordon Veitch]], a captain and surveyor in the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Morley (1974), p. 2</ref> Violet's cousin, Rachel Veitch, was mother of Field-Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]].<ref>Hoare, p. 2</ref> No\u00ebl Coward was the second of their three sons, the eldest of whom had died in 1898 at the age of six.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 3</ref> Coward's father lacked ambition and industry, and family finances were often poor.<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 4, 8 and 67</ref> Coward was bitten by the performing bug early and appeared in amateur concerts by the age of seven. He attended the [[Chapel Royal]] Choir School as a young child. He had little formal schooling but was a voracious reader.<ref name=Kenrick1>[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]].

It stated that a talented boy of attractive appearance was required by a Miss Lila Field to appear in her production of an all-children fairy play: ''The Goldfish.'' This seemed to dispose of all argument. I was a talented boy, God knows, and, when washed and smarmed down a bit, passably attractive. There appeared to be no earthly reason why Miss Lila Field shouldn't jump at me, and we both believed that she would be a fool indeed to miss such a magnificent opportunity.<ref>Coward (''Present Indicative''), pp. 21\u201322</ref>}}\n\n[[File:coward Hawtrey 1911.jpg|left|thumb|Coward ''(left)'' with [[Lydia Bilbrook]] ''(centre)'' and [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1858)|Charles Hawtrey]], 1911]]\nThe leading actor-manager [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1858)|Charles Hawtrey]], whom the young Coward idolised and from whom he learned a great deal about the theatre, cast him in the children's play ''[[Where the Rainbow Ends]]''.

It is found at altitudes between {{convert|3,000|and|5,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Its dense form is similar to a pillow some {{convert|3|to|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick. It concentrates and retains the heat from the day to cope with low evening temperatures. The growth rate of the llareta has been recently estimated at about {{convert|1.5|cm/year|abbr=on}}, making many llaretas over 3,000 years old. It produces a much-prized resin, which the mining industry once harvested indiscriminately as fuel, making this plant endangered.\n\nThe desert is also home to cacti, succulents, and other plants that thrive in a dry climate. Cactus species here include the candelabro (''[[Browningia candelaris]]'') and cardon (''[[Echinopsis atacamensis]]''), which can reach a height of {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a diameter of {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe [[Flowering desert (Chile)|Atacama Desert flowering]] (Spanish: ''desierto florido'') can be seen from September to November<!--spring--> in years with sufficient precipitation, as happened in 2015.<ref name=lsc/><ref name=blake/>\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Atacama Desert.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andean flamingo]]s in Salar de Atacama]]\n\nThe climate of the Atacama Desert limits the number of animals living permanently in this extreme ecosystem. Some parts of the desert are so arid, no plant or animal life can survive. Outside of these extreme areas, sand-colored grasshoppers blend with pebbles on the desert floor, and beetles and their larvae provide a valuable food source in the ''[[lomas]]'' (hills). Desert wasps and butterflies can be found during the warm and humid season, especially on the lomas. Red scorpions also live in the desert.\n[[File:Atacama lizard1.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Liolaemus nitidus]]'', a lizard native to the southern reaches of the Atacama Desert]]\nA unique environment is provided by some ''lomas'', where the fog from the ocean provides enough moisture for seasonal plants and a few animal species. Surprisingly few [[reptile]] species inhabit the desert and even fewer [[amphibian]] species. ''[[Chaunus atacamensis]]'', the Vallenar toad or Atacama toad, lives on the ''lomas'', where it lays eggs in permanent ponds or streams. [[Iguania]]ns and [[lava lizard]]s inhabit parts of the desert, while [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]] lizards, ''[[Liolaemus]]'', live in the dry areas bordering the ocean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://animals.pawnation.com/animals-live-atacama-desert-2505.html |author=Monique Bos |title=Animals that live in the Atacama Desert |publisher=Paw Nation |access-date=1 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192958/http://animals.pawnation.com/animals-live-atacama-desert-2505.html |archive-date=2 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One species, ''[[Liolaemus fabiani]]'', is endemic to the [[Salar de Atacama]], the Atacama salt flat.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Claudio M.

[[Humboldt penguin]]s live year-round along the coast, nesting in desert cliffs overlooking the ocean. Inland, high-altitude salt flats are inhabited by [[Andean flamingo]]s, while [[Chilean flamingo]]s can be seen along the coast. Other birds (including species of [[hummingbird]]s and [[rufous-collared sparrow]]) visit the ''lomas'' seasonally to feed on insects, nectar, seeds, and flowers. The ''lomas'' help sustain several threatened species, such as the endangered [[Chilean woodstar]].\n\nBecause of the desert's extreme aridity, only a few specially adapted mammal species live in the Atacama, such as [[Darwin's leaf-eared mouse]]. The less arid parts of the desert are inhabited by the [[South American gray fox]] and the [[viscacha]] (a relative of the [[chinchilla]]). Larger animals, such as [[guanaco]]s and [[vicu\u00f1a]]s, graze in areas where grass grows, mainly because it is seasonally irrigated by melted snow. Vicu\u00f1as need to remain near a steady water supply, while guanacos can roam into more arid areas and survive longer without fresh water. [[South American fur seal]]s and [[South American sea lion]]s often gather along the coast.\n\n== Human presence ==\n[[File:Chuquicamata-003 02.jpg|thumb|View of [[Chuquicamata]], a large, state-owned copper mine]]\n\nThe Atacama is sparsely populated, with most towns located along the Pacific coast.<ref>[http://southamerica.zoom-maps.com/ South America physical map]</ref>  In interior areas, oases and some valleys have been populated for millennia and were the location of the most advanced pre-Columbian societies found in Chile.\n\n===Chinchorro culture===\n{{main|Chinchorro culture}}\n\nThe Chinchorro culture developed in the Atacama Desert area from 7,000 to 1,500 BCE. These peoples were sedentary fishermen inhabiting mostly coastal areas. Their presence is found from today's towns of [[Ilo Province|Ilo]], in southern Peru, to [[Antofagasta]] in northern Chile. Presence of fresh water in the arid region on the coast facilitated human settlement in these areas. The Chinchorro were famous for their detailed [[mummification]] and funerary practices.<ref>Sanz, Nuria; Arriaza, Bernardo T.; Standen, Vivien G., [http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Mexico/chinchorro4_02.pdf The Chinchorro Culture: A Comparative Perspective.] The archaeology of the earliest human mummification.

Before the [[Inca]] empire and prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the extremely arid interior was inhabited primarily by the [[Atacame\u00f1o]] tribe. They are noted for building fortified towns called ''[[pucar\u00e1]]s'', one of which is located a few kilometers from San Pedro de Atacama. The town's church was built by the [[Spain|Spanish]] in 1577.\n\nThe coastal cities originated in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries during the time of the [[Spanish Empire]], when they emerged as shipping ports for [[silver]] produced in [[Potos\u00ed]] and other mining centers. \n\n===Republican period===\nDuring the 19th century, the desert came under control of Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. With the discovery of [[sodium nitrate]] deposits and as a result of unclear borders, the area soon became a zone of conflict and resulted in the [[War of the Pacific]]. Chile annexed most of the desert, and cities along the coast developed into international ports, hosting many Chilean workers who migrated there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holsti|first=K.J.|title=The State, War, and the State of War|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57790-8|page=151}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Clayton|first=Lawrence A.|title=The Bolivarian Nations|year=1984|publisher=The Forum Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVXm7QOD6_AC&pg=PA26&dq=Atacama+desert+colonial+period#v=onepage&q=Atacama%20desert%20colonial%20period&f=false |isbn=978-0-88273-603-7 |page=26}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|last=St. John|first=Robert Bruce |title=The Bolivia-Chile-Peru dispute in the Atacama Desert |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPORDM85EsIC&pg=PA1&dq=Atacama+desert+colonial+period&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MSG8UJOiG4Wu8ASPzoCoCQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Atacama%20desert%20colonial%20period&f=false |publisher=International Boundaries Research Unit}}</ref>\n\nWith the guano and saltpeter booms of the 19th century, the population grew immensely, mostly as a result of immigration from central Chile. In the 20th century, the nitrate industry declined and at the same time, the largely male population of the desert became increasingly problematic for the Chilean state. Miners and mining companies came into conflict, and protests spread throughout the region.\n\n=== Abandoned nitrate mining towns ===\n{{main|List of saltpeter works in Tarapac\u00e1 and Antofagasta}}\nThe desert has rich deposits of [[copper]] and other [[mineral]]s and the world's largest natural supply of [[sodium nitrate]] (Chile saltpeter), which was mined on a large scale until the early 1940s. The [[Atacama border dispute]] over these resources between Chile and Bolivia began in the 19th century and resulted in the [[War of the Pacific]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-the-Pacific|title=War of the Pacific {{!}} South American history|last=|first=|date=|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=27 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe desert is littered with about 170 abandoned nitrate (or \"saltpeter\") mining towns, almost all of which were shut down decades after the invention of synthetic nitrate in [[Germany]] in the first decade of the 20th century (see [[Haber process]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  The towns include [[Chacabuco]], [[Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works|Humberstone, Santa Laura]], Pedro de Valdivia, Puelma, [[Mar\u00eda Elena]], and Oficina Anita.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe Atacama Desert is rich in metallic mineral resources such as copper, gold, silver and iron, as well as nonmetallic minerals including important deposits of boron, lithium, sodium nitrate, and potassium salts.

The growth rate of the llareta has been recently estimated at about {{convert|1.5|cm/year|abbr=on}}, making many llaretas over 3,000 years old. It produces a much-prized resin, which the mining industry once harvested indiscriminately as fuel, making this plant endangered.\n\nThe desert is also home to cacti, succulents, and other plants that thrive in a dry climate. Cactus species here include the candelabro (''[[Browningia candelaris]]'') and cardon (''[[Echinopsis atacamensis]]''), which can reach a height of {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a diameter of {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe [[Flowering desert (Chile)|Atacama Desert flowering]] (Spanish: ''desierto florido'') can be seen from September to November<!--spring--> in years with sufficient precipitation, as happened in 2015.<ref name=lsc/><ref name=blake/>\n\n==Fauna==\n[[File:Atacama Desert.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andean flamingo]]s in Salar de Atacama]]\n\nThe climate of the Atacama Desert limits the number of animals living permanently in this extreme ecosystem. Some parts of the desert are so arid, no plant or animal life can survive. Outside of these extreme areas, sand-colored grasshoppers blend with pebbles on the desert floor, and beetles and their larvae provide a valuable food source in the ''[[lomas]]'' (hills). Desert wasps and butterflies can be found during the warm and humid season, especially on the lomas. Red scorpions also live in the desert.\n[[File:Atacama lizard1.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Liolaemus nitidus]]'', a lizard native to the southern reaches of the Atacama Desert]]\nA unique environment is provided by some ''lomas'', where the fog from the ocean provides enough moisture for seasonal plants and a few animal species. Surprisingly few [[reptile]] species inhabit the desert and even fewer [[amphibian]] species. ''[[Chaunus atacamensis]]'', the Vallenar toad or Atacama toad, lives on the ''lomas'', where it lays eggs in permanent ponds or streams. [[Iguania]]ns and [[lava lizard]]s inhabit parts of the desert, while [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]] lizards, ''[[Liolaemus]]'', live in the dry areas bordering the ocean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://animals.pawnation.com/animals-live-atacama-desert-2505.html |author=Monique Bos |title=Animals that live in the Atacama Desert |publisher=Paw Nation |access-date=1 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192958/http://animals.pawnation.com/animals-live-atacama-desert-2505.html |archive-date=2 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One species, ''[[Liolaemus fabiani]]'', is endemic to the [[Salar de Atacama]], the Atacama salt flat.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Claudio M.

[[Humboldt penguin]]s live year-round along the coast, nesting in desert cliffs overlooking the ocean. Inland, high-altitude salt flats are inhabited by [[Andean flamingo]]s, while [[Chilean flamingo]]s can be seen along the coast. Other birds (including species of [[hummingbird]]s and [[rufous-collared sparrow]]) visit the ''lomas'' seasonally to feed on insects, nectar, seeds, and flowers. The ''lomas'' help sustain several threatened species, such as the endangered [[Chilean woodstar]].\n\nBecause of the desert's extreme aridity, only a few specially adapted mammal species live in the Atacama, such as [[Darwin's leaf-eared mouse]]. The less arid parts of the desert are inhabited by the [[South American gray fox]] and the [[viscacha]] (a relative of the [[chinchilla]]). Larger animals, such as [[guanaco]]s and [[vicu\u00f1a]]s, graze in areas where grass grows, mainly because it is seasonally irrigated by melted snow. Vicu\u00f1as need to remain near a steady water supply, while guanacos can roam into more arid areas and survive longer without fresh water. [[South American fur seal]]s and [[South American sea lion]]s often gather along the coast.\n\n== Human presence ==\n[[File:Chuquicamata-003 02.jpg|thumb|View of [[Chuquicamata]], a large, state-owned copper mine]]\n\nThe Atacama is sparsely populated, with most towns located along the Pacific coast.<ref>[http://southamerica.zoom-maps.com/ South America physical map]</ref>  In interior areas, oases and some valleys have been populated for millennia and were the location of the most advanced pre-Columbian societies found in Chile.\n\n===Chinchorro culture===\n{{main|Chinchorro culture}}\n\nThe Chinchorro culture developed in the Atacama Desert area from 7,000 to 1,500 BCE. These peoples were sedentary fishermen inhabiting mostly coastal areas. Their presence is found from today's towns of [[Ilo Province|Ilo]], in southern Peru, to [[Antofagasta]] in northern Chile. Presence of fresh water in the arid region on the coast facilitated human settlement in these areas. The Chinchorro were famous for their detailed [[mummification]] and funerary practices.<ref>Sanz, Nuria; Arriaza, Bernardo T.; Standen, Vivien G., [http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Mexico/chinchorro4_02.pdf The Chinchorro Culture: A Comparative Perspective.] The archaeology of the earliest human mummification.

Before the [[Inca]] empire and prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the extremely arid interior was inhabited primarily by the [[Atacame\u00f1o]] tribe. They are noted for building fortified towns called ''[[pucar\u00e1]]s'', one of which is located a few kilometers from San Pedro de Atacama. The town's church was built by the [[Spain|Spanish]] in 1577.\n\nThe coastal cities originated in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries during the time of the [[Spanish Empire]], when they emerged as shipping ports for [[silver]] produced in [[Potos\u00ed]] and other mining centers. \n\n===Republican period===\nDuring the 19th century, the desert came under control of Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. With the discovery of [[sodium nitrate]] deposits and as a result of unclear borders, the area soon became a zone of conflict and resulted in the [[War of the Pacific]]. Chile annexed most of the desert, and cities along the coast developed into international ports, hosting many Chilean workers who migrated there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holsti|first=K.J.|title=The State, War, and the State of War|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57790-8|page=151}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Clayton|first=Lawrence A.|title=The Bolivarian Nations|year=1984|publisher=The Forum Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVXm7QOD6_AC&pg=PA26&dq=Atacama+desert+colonial+period#v=onepage&q=Atacama%20desert%20colonial%20period&f=false |isbn=978-0-88273-603-7 |page=26}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|last=St. John|first=Robert Bruce |title=The Bolivia-Chile-Peru dispute in the Atacama Desert |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPORDM85EsIC&pg=PA1&dq=Atacama+desert+colonial+period&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MSG8UJOiG4Wu8ASPzoCoCQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Atacama%20desert%20colonial%20period&f=false |publisher=International Boundaries Research Unit}}</ref>\n\nWith the guano and saltpeter booms of the 19th century, the population grew immensely, mostly as a result of immigration from central Chile. In the 20th century, the nitrate industry declined and at the same time, the largely male population of the desert became increasingly problematic for the Chilean state. Miners and mining companies came into conflict, and protests spread throughout the region.\n\n=== Abandoned nitrate mining towns ===\n{{main|List of saltpeter works in Tarapac\u00e1 and Antofagasta}}\nThe desert has rich deposits of [[copper]] and other [[mineral]]s and the world's largest natural supply of [[sodium nitrate]] (Chile saltpeter), which was mined on a large scale until the early 1940s.

The [[California Independent System Operator]] (CAISO) defines V1G as \"unidirectional managed charging services\" and defines the four levels of Vehicle-Grid Interface (VGI), which encompasses all of the ways that EVs can provide grid services, as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caiso.com/documents/vehicle-gridintegrationroadmap.pdf|title=Vehicle-Grid Integration (VGI) Roadmap: Enabling vehicle-based grid services|date=February 2014|website=California ISO}}</ref>\n\n# Unidirectional power flow (V1G) with one resource and unified actors\n# V1G with aggregated resources\n# V1G with fragmented actor objectives\n# Bidirectional power flow (V2G)\n\nV1G involves varying the time or rate at which an electric vehicle is charged in order to provide ancillary services to the grid, while V2G also includes reverse power flow. V1G includes applications such as timing vehicles to charge in the middle of the day to absorb excess solar generation, or varying the charge rate of electric vehicles to provide frequency response services or load balancing services.\n\nV1G may be the best option to begin integrating EVs as controllable loads onto the electric grid due to technical issues that currently exist with regards to the feasibility of V2G. V2G requires specialized hardware (especially bi-directional inverters), has fairly high losses and limited round-trip efficiency, and may contribute to EV battery degradation due to increased energy throughput. Additionally, revenues from V2G in an SCE pilot project were lower than the costs of administering the project,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442455793|title=Southern California Edison Company's Department of Defense Vehicle-to-Grid Final Report|date=2017|website=California Public Utilities Commission}}</ref> indicating that V2G still has a ways to go before being economically feasible.\n\n=== Bidirectional local V2G (V2H , V2B, V2X) ===\nVehicle-to-home (V2H) or vehicle-to-building (V2B) or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) do not typically directly affect grid performance but creates a balance within the local environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emobilitysimplified.com/2019/12/what-is-vehicle-to-grid-v1g-v2g-v2x-v2h.html |title=What are V1G, V2G and V2H / V2B / V2X smart charging? {{!}} Integrating electric vehicles into power grid |first=Pon |last=Paulraj |website=E-Mobility Simplified |date=2019-12-10 |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The electric vehicle is used as a residential back-up power supply during periods of power outage or for increasing self-consumption of energy produced on-site (demand charge avoidance).\n\nUnlike more mature V1G solutions, V2X has not yet reached market deployment, apart from Japan where commercial V2H solutions have been available since 2012 as back-up a solution in case of electricity black-out.\n\n=== Bidirectional V2G ===\nWith V2G, the electric vehicles could be equipped to actually provide electricity to the grid. The utility or transmission system operator may be willing to purchase energy from customers during periods of peak demand, or to use the EV battery capacity for providing ancillary services, such as balancing and frequency control, including primary frequency regulation and secondary reserve.

It is important to note that this is difficult to quantify because the technology is still in its nascent stage, and is therefore difficult to reliably predict adoption of the technology around the world. The following list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give an idea of the scope of development and progress in these areas around the world.\n\n===United States===\n[[PJM Interconnection]] has envisioned using [[US Postal Service]] trucks, school buses and garbage trucks that remain unused overnight for grid connection.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\nThis could generate millions of dollars because these companies aid in storing and stabilizing some of the national grid's energy. The United States was projected to have one million electric vehicles on the road between 2015 and 2019. Studies indicate that 160 new power plants will need to be built by 2020 to compensate for electric vehicles if integration with the grid does not move forward.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn North America, at least two major school-bus manufacturers\u2014Blue Bird and Lion\u2014are working on proving the benefits of electrification and vehicle-to-grid technology.

Average Japanese homes use 10 to 12 KWh/day, and with the LEAF's 24 KWh battery capacity, this kit could potentially provide up to two days of power.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} \nProduction in additional markets will follow upon Nissan's ability to properly complete adaptations.\n\nIn November 2018 in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture, Toyota Tsusho Corporation and Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc initiated charging and discharging demonstrations with storage batteries of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles using V2G technology. The demonstration examines how to excel the ability of V2G systems to balance demand and supply of electricity is and what impacts V2G has on the power grid. In addition to ordinary usage of EVs/PHVs such as by transportation, the group is producing new values of EVs/PHVs by providing V2G services even when EVs/PHVs are parked. Two bi-directional charging stations, connected to a V2G aggregation server managed by Nuvve Corporation, have been installed at a parking lot in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture to conduct the demonstration test. The group aims to assess the capacity of EVs/PHVs to balance out demand and supply of electrical power by charging EVs/PHVs and supplying electrical power to the grid from EVs/PHVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketscreener.com/TOYOTA-TSUSHO-CORP-6494673/news/Toyota-Tsusho-and-Chubu-Electric-Power-Announce-to-Initiate-Japan-s-First-Ever-Demonstration-Proje-27561256/|title=Toyota Tsusho : and Chubu Electric Power Announce to Initiate Japan's First Ever Demonstration Project of Charging and Discharging from Storage Batteries of Electric Vehicles to the Electric Grid |last=MarketScreener|website=www.marketscreener.com|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\nDenmark currently{{when|date=September 2018}} is a world leader in wind power generation. \nInitially, Denmark's goal is to replace 10% of all vehicles with PEVs, with an ultimate goal of a complete replacement to follow. The Edison Project implements a new set of goals that will allow enough turbines to be built to accommodate 50% of total power while using V2G to prevent negative impacts to the grid. Because of the unpredictability of wind, the Edison Project plans to use PEVs while they are plugged into the grid to store additional wind energy that the grid cannot handle. Then, during peak energy use hours, or when the wind is calm, the power stored in these PEVs will be fed back into the grid. To aid in the acceptance of EVs, policies have been enforced that create a tax differential between zero emission cars and traditional automobiles. The Danish PEV market value is expected to grow from $50 to $380 million between 2015 and 2020. PEV developmental progress and advancements pertaining to the use of renewable energy resources will make Denmark a market leader with respect to V2G innovation (ZigBee 2010).\n\nFollowing the Edison project, the Nikola project was started<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nikola.droppages.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Nikola |access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref> which focused on demonstrating the V2G technology in a lab setting, located at the Ris\u00f8 Campus (DTU). DTU is a partner along with Nuvve and Nissan. The Nikola project completed in 2016, laying the groundwork for Parker, which uses a fleet of EVs to demonstrate the technology in a real-life setting.

Besides demonstrating the technology the project also aims to clear the path for V2G-integration with other OEMs as well as calculating the business case for several types of V2G, such as Adaptive charging, overload protection, peak shaving, emergency backup and frequency balancing. In the project the partners explored the most viable commercial opportunities by systematically testing and demonstrating V2G services across car brands. Here, economic and regulatory barriers were identified as well as the economic and technical impacts of the applications on the power system and markets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://parker-project.com/danish-project-defines-the-electric-vehicle-of-the-future/|title=Parker {{!}} Danish project defines the electric vehicle of the future|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> The project started in August 2016 and ended in September 2018.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe V2G market in the UK will be stimulated by aggressive smart grid and PEV rollouts. Starting in January 2011, programs and strategies to assist in PEV have been implemented. The UK has begun devising strategies to increase the speed of adoption of EVs. This includes providing universal high-speed internet for use with smart grid meters, because most V2G-capable PEVs will not coordinate with the larger grid without it. The \"Electric Delivery Plan for London\" states that by 2015, there will be 500 on-road charging stations; 2,000 stations off-road in car parks; and 22,000 privately owned stations installed. Local grid substations will need to be upgraded for drivers who cannot park on their own property. By 2020 in the UK, every residential home will have been offered a smart meter, and about 1.7 million PEVs should be on the road. The UK's electric vehicle market value is projected to grow from $0.1 to $1.3 billion between 2015 and 2020 (ZigBee 2010).\n\nIn 2018, EDF Energy announced a partnership with a leading green technology company, Nuvve, to install up to 1,500 Vehicle to Grid (V2G) chargers in the UK. The chargers will be offered to EDF Energy\u2019s business customers and will be used at its own sites to provide up to 15 MW of additional energy storage capacity. That\u2019s the equivalent amount of energy required to power 4,000 homes. The stored electricity will be made available for sale on the energy markets or for supporting grid flexibility at times of peak energy use. EDF Energy is the largest electricity supplier to UK businesses and its partnership with Nuvve could see the largest deployment of V2G chargers so far in this country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oilandgas360.com/edf-energy-and-nuvve-corporation-announce-plans-to-install-1500-smart-electric-chargers-in-the-united-kingdom/|title=EDF Energy and Nuvve Corporation Announce Plans to Install 1,500 Smart Electric Chargers in the United Kingdom|date=2018-10-31|website=Oil & Gas 360|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\nIn fall 2019, a consortium called Vehicle to Grid Britain (V2GB) released a research report on the potential of V2G technologies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://es.catapult.org.uk/case-studies/vehicle-to-grid-britain/|title=Vehicle-to-Grid Britain|last=|first=|date=2019-10-01|website=Energy Systems Catapult|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-09|ref=Vehicle-to-Grid Britain/V2GB Oct. 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-is-vehicle-to-grid-taking-so-long-to-happen|title=Why Is Vehicle-to-Grid Taking So Long to Happen?|last=Deign|first=Jason|date=2018-03-19|website=www.greentechmedia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-09|ref=GTM Mar. 2018: Why is V2G taking so long?}}</ref> \n\n==Research==\n\n=== Edison ===\n[[Denmark]]'s Edison project, an abbreviation for 'Electric vehicles in a Distributed and Integrated market using Sustainable energy and Open Networks' was a partially state funded research project on the island of [[Bornholm]] in Eastern Denmark.

Its models are used to investigate the challenges and opportunities of V2G services, such as modulation of charging time and charging rate for peak [[demand response]] and [[utility frequency]] regulation. V2G-Sim has also been used to research the potential of plug-in electric vehicles for renewable energy integration. Preliminary findings using V2G-Sim have shown controlled V2G service can provide peak-shaving and valley-filling services to balance daily electric load and mitigate the [[duck curve]]. On the contrary, uncontrolled vehicle charging was shown to exacerbate the duck curve. The study also found that even at 20 percent fade in capacity, EV batteries still met the needs of 85 percent of drivers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Used EV Batteries Get New Life Powering the Grid |url=https://www.fleetcarma.com/used-ev-batteries-power-grid/ |publisher=Fleetcarma.com |access-date=2017-10-06 }}</ref>\n\nIn another research initiative at Lawrence Berkeley Lab using V2G-Sim, V2G services were shown to have minor battery degradation impacts on electric vehicles as compared to cycling losses and calendar aging.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Dai |last1=Wang |first2=Samveg |last2=Saxena |first3=Jonathan |last3=Coignard |first4=Elpiniki |last4=Iosifidou |first5=Xiaohong |last5=Guan |date=2016-07-21 |title=Quantifying Electric Vehicle Battery Degradation from Driving vs. V2G Services |journal=2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM) |pages=1\u20135 |doi=10.1109/PESGM.2016.7741180 |isbn=978-1-5090-4168-8 }}</ref> In this study, three electric vehicles with different daily driving itineraries were modelled over a ten-year time horizon, with and without V2G services.

The [[California Independent System Operator]] (CAISO) defines V1G as \"unidirectional managed charging services\" and defines the four levels of Vehicle-Grid Interface (VGI), which encompasses all of the ways that EVs can provide grid services, as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caiso.com/documents/vehicle-gridintegrationroadmap.pdf|title=Vehicle-Grid Integration (VGI) Roadmap: Enabling vehicle-based grid services|date=February 2014|website=California ISO}}</ref>\n\n# Unidirectional power flow (V1G) with one resource and unified actors\n# V1G with aggregated resources\n# V1G with fragmented actor objectives\n# Bidirectional power flow (V2G)\n\nV1G involves varying the time or rate at which an electric vehicle is charged in order to provide ancillary services to the grid, while V2G also includes reverse power flow. V1G includes applications such as timing vehicles to charge in the middle of the day to absorb excess solar generation, or varying the charge rate of electric vehicles to provide frequency response services or load balancing services.\n\nV1G may be the best option to begin integrating EVs as controllable loads onto the electric grid due to technical issues that currently exist with regards to the feasibility of V2G. V2G requires specialized hardware (especially bi-directional inverters), has fairly high losses and limited round-trip efficiency, and may contribute to EV battery degradation due to increased energy throughput. Additionally, revenues from V2G in an SCE pilot project were lower than the costs of administering the project,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442455793|title=Southern California Edison Company's Department of Defense Vehicle-to-Grid Final Report|date=2017|website=California Public Utilities Commission}}</ref> indicating that V2G still has a ways to go before being economically feasible.\n\n=== Bidirectional local V2G (V2H , V2B, V2X) ===\nVehicle-to-home (V2H) or vehicle-to-building (V2B) or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) do not typically directly affect grid performance but creates a balance within the local environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emobilitysimplified.com/2019/12/what-is-vehicle-to-grid-v1g-v2g-v2x-v2h.html |title=What are V1G, V2G and V2H / V2B / V2X smart charging? {{!}} Integrating electric vehicles into power grid |first=Pon |last=Paulraj |website=E-Mobility Simplified |date=2019-12-10 |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> The electric vehicle is used as a residential back-up power supply during periods of power outage or for increasing self-consumption of energy produced on-site (demand charge avoidance).\n\nUnlike more mature V1G solutions, V2X has not yet reached market deployment, apart from Japan where commercial V2H solutions have been available since 2012 as back-up a solution in case of electricity black-out.\n\n=== Bidirectional V2G ===\nWith V2G, the electric vehicles could be equipped to actually provide electricity to the grid. The utility or transmission system operator may be willing to purchase energy from customers during periods of peak demand, or to use the EV battery capacity for providing ancillary services, such as balancing and frequency control, including primary frequency regulation and secondary reserve.

The following list is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to give an idea of the scope of development and progress in these areas around the world.\n\n===United States===\n[[PJM Interconnection]] has envisioned using [[US Postal Service]] trucks, school buses and garbage trucks that remain unused overnight for grid connection.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\nThis could generate millions of dollars because these companies aid in storing and stabilizing some of the national grid's energy. The United States was projected to have one million electric vehicles on the road between 2015 and 2019. Studies indicate that 160 new power plants will need to be built by 2020 to compensate for electric vehicles if integration with the grid does not move forward.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn North America, at least two major school-bus manufacturers\u2014Blue Bird and Lion\u2014are working on proving the benefits of electrification and vehicle-to-grid technology.

The demonstration examines how to excel the ability of V2G systems to balance demand and supply of electricity is and what impacts V2G has on the power grid. In addition to ordinary usage of EVs/PHVs such as by transportation, the group is producing new values of EVs/PHVs by providing V2G services even when EVs/PHVs are parked. Two bi-directional charging stations, connected to a V2G aggregation server managed by Nuvve Corporation, have been installed at a parking lot in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture to conduct the demonstration test. The group aims to assess the capacity of EVs/PHVs to balance out demand and supply of electrical power by charging EVs/PHVs and supplying electrical power to the grid from EVs/PHVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketscreener.com/TOYOTA-TSUSHO-CORP-6494673/news/Toyota-Tsusho-and-Chubu-Electric-Power-Announce-to-Initiate-Japan-s-First-Ever-Demonstration-Proje-27561256/|title=Toyota Tsusho : and Chubu Electric Power Announce to Initiate Japan's First Ever Demonstration Project of Charging and Discharging from Storage Batteries of Electric Vehicles to the Electric Grid |last=MarketScreener|website=www.marketscreener.com|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\nDenmark currently{{when|date=September 2018}} is a world leader in wind power generation. \nInitially, Denmark's goal is to replace 10% of all vehicles with PEVs, with an ultimate goal of a complete replacement to follow. The Edison Project implements a new set of goals that will allow enough turbines to be built to accommodate 50% of total power while using V2G to prevent negative impacts to the grid. Because of the unpredictability of wind, the Edison Project plans to use PEVs while they are plugged into the grid to store additional wind energy that the grid cannot handle. Then, during peak energy use hours, or when the wind is calm, the power stored in these PEVs will be fed back into the grid. To aid in the acceptance of EVs, policies have been enforced that create a tax differential between zero emission cars and traditional automobiles. The Danish PEV market value is expected to grow from $50 to $380 million between 2015 and 2020. PEV developmental progress and advancements pertaining to the use of renewable energy resources will make Denmark a market leader with respect to V2G innovation (ZigBee 2010).\n\nFollowing the Edison project, the Nikola project was started<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nikola.droppages.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Nikola |access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref> which focused on demonstrating the V2G technology in a lab setting, located at the Ris\u00f8 Campus (DTU). DTU is a partner along with Nuvve and Nissan. The Nikola project completed in 2016, laying the groundwork for Parker, which uses a fleet of EVs to demonstrate the technology in a real-life setting.

Besides demonstrating the technology the project also aims to clear the path for V2G-integration with other OEMs as well as calculating the business case for several types of V2G, such as Adaptive charging, overload protection, peak shaving, emergency backup and frequency balancing. In the project the partners explored the most viable commercial opportunities by systematically testing and demonstrating V2G services across car brands. Here, economic and regulatory barriers were identified as well as the economic and technical impacts of the applications on the power system and markets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://parker-project.com/danish-project-defines-the-electric-vehicle-of-the-future/|title=Parker {{!}} Danish project defines the electric vehicle of the future|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref> The project started in August 2016 and ended in September 2018.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe V2G market in the UK will be stimulated by aggressive smart grid and PEV rollouts. Starting in January 2011, programs and strategies to assist in PEV have been implemented. The UK has begun devising strategies to increase the speed of adoption of EVs. This includes providing universal high-speed internet for use with smart grid meters, because most V2G-capable PEVs will not coordinate with the larger grid without it. The \"Electric Delivery Plan for London\" states that by 2015, there will be 500 on-road charging stations; 2,000 stations off-road in car parks; and 22,000 privately owned stations installed. Local grid substations will need to be upgraded for drivers who cannot park on their own property. By 2020 in the UK, every residential home will have been offered a smart meter, and about 1.7 million PEVs should be on the road. The UK's electric vehicle market value is projected to grow from $0.1 to $1.3 billion between 2015 and 2020 (ZigBee 2010).\n\nIn 2018, EDF Energy announced a partnership with a leading green technology company, Nuvve, to install up to 1,500 Vehicle to Grid (V2G) chargers in the UK. The chargers will be offered to EDF Energy\u2019s business customers and will be used at its own sites to provide up to 15 MW of additional energy storage capacity. That\u2019s the equivalent amount of energy required to power 4,000 homes. The stored electricity will be made available for sale on the energy markets or for supporting grid flexibility at times of peak energy use. EDF Energy is the largest electricity supplier to UK businesses and its partnership with Nuvve could see the largest deployment of V2G chargers so far in this country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oilandgas360.com/edf-energy-and-nuvve-corporation-announce-plans-to-install-1500-smart-electric-chargers-in-the-united-kingdom/|title=EDF Energy and Nuvve Corporation Announce Plans to Install 1,500 Smart Electric Chargers in the United Kingdom|date=2018-10-31|website=Oil & Gas 360|access-date=2019-01-09}}</ref>\n\nIn fall 2019, a consortium called Vehicle to Grid Britain (V2GB) released a research report on the potential of V2G technologies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://es.catapult.org.uk/case-studies/vehicle-to-grid-britain/|title=Vehicle-to-Grid Britain|last=|first=|date=2019-10-01|website=Energy Systems Catapult|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-09|ref=Vehicle-to-Grid Britain/V2GB Oct. 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-is-vehicle-to-grid-taking-so-long-to-happen|title=Why Is Vehicle-to-Grid Taking So Long to Happen?|last=Deign|first=Jason|date=2018-03-19|website=www.greentechmedia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-09|ref=GTM Mar. 2018: Why is V2G taking so long?}}</ref> \n\n==Research==\n\n=== Edison ===\n[[Denmark]]'s Edison project, an abbreviation for 'Electric vehicles in a Distributed and Integrated market using Sustainable energy and Open Networks' was a partially state funded research project on the island of [[Bornholm]] in Eastern Denmark.

Paul's nascent congregation there was made up of pagan, not Jewish, converts ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|12:2}}). All first-generation Christians were necessarily converts, either pagan or Jewish.  They had written him regarding numerous matters of concern ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:1}}).  Criticizing what he had heard of their meetings, at which they had communal meals, one paragraph in Paul's response reminded them about what he asserted he had \"received from the Lord\" and had \"passed on\" about Jesus' actions and directives at his Last Supper. The ambiguities some find in that wording has generated reams of books, articles and opinions about the Origins of  Eucharist. \n\nIn his 1994 book, ''A Feast of Meanings: Eucharistic Theologies from Jesus through Johannine Circles'', [[Bruce Chilton]] wrote that Paul \"indeed 'received from the Lord' (1 Corinthians 11:23), through Cephas (Galatians 1:18), what he 'handed over' (1 Corinthians 11:23) to his hearers. \u2026 He reminds his hearers of what he already had taught as authoritative, a teaching 'from the Lord' and presumably warranted by the earliest 'pillars': in that sense, what he hands on is not his own, but derives from his highest authority, 'the Lord' (11:23).\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yTQZ__LDiJ4C A Feast of Meanings: Eucharistic Theologies from Jesus through Johannine Circles, by Bruce Chilton 1994] {{ISBN|9004099492}} p. 110</ref>  Eugene LaVerdiere wrote: \"That is how Paul introduced the tradition, presenting himself as a link in the chain of Eucharistic tradition.

At first, they spread through word of mouth, but within a generation Christians had begun writing about Jesus and about Christian practice, the Eucharist included. The theology of the Eucharist and its role as a sacrament developed during this period.\n\nBasing himself on the ''First Apology'' and the ''Dialogue with Trypho'' of [[Justin Martyr]] writing around 150 AD, K.W. Noakes deduces the following liturgical structure was in use at that time:\n# Scripture Readings and Homily.\n# Intercessions and Kiss-of-Peace.\n# Bread and Cup are brought to the Celebrant.\n# Eucharistic Prayer (flexible) but following a fixed pattern with congregational \u201cAmen\u201d\n# Distribution of the elements by the deacons to those present and absent.\n# Collection.\nThis corresponds in general outline to the structure of the rite as used today and is the earliest known example. The theology is as follows: the bread and wine are transformed into the Flesh and Blood of Jesus; they are the pure sacrifice spoken of by Malachi (1:11) and the eucharistic prayer itself is both a thanksgiving for creation and redemption and an ''[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]]'' (Greek: memorial) of the passion (and possibly the incarnation).<ref name=\"Noakes 1979 171f\"/>\n\nInformation from the intervening period is scanty.<ref>{{citation | last=Noakes | first=K.W. |contribution= The Eucharist: 2 From the Apostolic Fathers to Irenaeus| title=The Study of Liturgy | editor-last=Jones |editor-first= Cheslyn| location= London| publisher=SPCK | year=1979|page=170}}</ref>  Both the author of 1 Clement (about 96) and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (about 108) are concerned that due order be maintained;<ref>\"Let that eucharist alone be considered valid which is celebrated in the presence of the bishop, or of him to whom he shall have entrusted it. ...

If the object of our feast be good, in the light of that consider its further regulations. As it is an act of religious service, it permits no vileness or immodesty. The participants, before reclining, taste first of prayer to God. As much is eaten as satisfies the cravings of hunger; as much is drunk as befits the chaste.  They say it is enough, as those who remember that even during the night they have to worship God; they talk as those who know that the Lord is one of their auditors.

Via jr Foreword to ''What is Redaction Criticism?'' by Norman Perrin. London: SPCK (1970) p. vii</ref>  They therefore try to decide where the distinct components of the later rite originated by examining possible cultural elements, both Jewish and Hellenic, which already existed in the period under study.  The underlying debate is over the relative contributions of Paul and Jesus and the possible intervention of other factors.  One key consideration in this is the problem of the Jewish prohibition of drinking blood (see below).\n\nProfessor Robert J. Daly, S.J., argues that Jesus did indeed institute the Eucharist, though it took generations and centuries of guidance from the Holy Spirit for the Eucharist to reach its current form. \"What Jesus did at the Last Supper is obviously at least the generative moment of the institution of the Eucharist.\"  But it was not the Eucharist as we know it. \"The Eucharist that Christians now celebrate is what the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit of the risen Jesus, and over the course of generations and centuries, learned to do as it celebrated table fellowship with its risen Lord.\"<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March, 2005</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Bruce Chilton suggests that we can find in the New Testament six different ways of celebrating what Christians came to call the Eucharist, and can locate each of these in its own specific socio-religio-political setting. This would seem to make irrelevant a number of time-honored scholarly approaches, fundamental to which were, first, the \"literally true\" vs. \"literary fictions\" debate, and, second, the assumption that there was a unified line of development from the established Eucharist of later centuries back close to the time of the historical Jesus.<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March 2005</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ The six Eucharists in the New Testament, according to Bruce Chilton\n|-\n!width=\"16%\"| Jesus' Table Fellowship\n!width=\"16%\"| The \"Last Supper\"\n!width=\"20%\"| Petrine Christianity\n!width=\"16%\"| The Circle of James\n!width=\"16%\"| Paul and the Synoptics\n!width=\"16%\"| John\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus joined with his followers in meals that were designed to anticipate the coming of God's kingdom. The meals were characterized by a readiness to accept the hospitality and the produce of Israel at large. A willingness to provide for the meals, to join in the fellowship, to forgive and to be forgiven, was seen by Jesus as a sufficient condition for eating in his company and for entry into the kingdom.  Jesus' approach to purity qualification was distinctive in its inclusiveness. For Jesus, the primary markers of purity, the primary requirements for table fellowship in the kingdom were: Israel as forgiven and willing to provide of its own produce.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus sought to influence or reform purity practices associated with the Temple. In his meals, as he shared wine, he started referring to it as the equivalent of the blood of an animal shed in sacrifice, and in sharing bread, claiming that its value was that of sacrificial flesh. \"Here was a sacrifice of sharings which the authorities could not control, and which the nature of Jesus' movement made it impossible for them to ignore. Jesus' meals after his failed occupation of the Temple became a surrogate of sacrifice, the second type of Eucharist.\"\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| In this stage of Eucharistic development, the berakhah prayer of Judaism seems to have become a principal model of Eucharist. Bread took precedence over wine, and, as Acts 1:12-26, 2:46, and 3:14:37 clearly describe, a double domestication took place. Instead of seeking the hospitality of others, as the itinerant Jesus seemed to do, adherents of the movement, under the leadership of Peter and/or the Twelve, gathered in the homes of colleagues where they \"broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people\" (Acts 2:46\u201347). In addition, apparently they also acknowledged the validity of sacrifice in the Temple. In doing this they changed the nature of the meal and the memory of what Jesus had said at that meal. For example, there is no mention of wine, nor does there, in this account of the earliest Christian gatherings, seem to have been any sense of being in tension with the officials of Judaism or its religious practices.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| The tendency to domestication is here pursued further, for the Eucharist is now seen as a Seder meal, open only to Jews in a state of purity, and to be celebrated only once a year, at Passover, in Jerusalem, as prescribed in Exodus 12:48. The effect of this Jacobean program\u2014a possible antecedent to the later Quartodeciman practice?\u2014\"was to integrate Jesus' movement fully within the liturgical institutions of Judaism, to insist upon the Judaic identity of the movement and upon Jerusalem as its governing center,\" but without actually replacing Israel's Seder.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Paul vehemently resisted Jacobean claims. He also emphasized the link between Jesus' death and the Eucharist, and he accepts what Chilton calls the Hellenistic refinement of the Petrine type that presented the Eucharist as a sacrifice for sin. This is also what we find in the Synoptic Gospels which use words to suggest that Jesus' blood is shed in the interests of the communities for which those Gospels were composed: for the \"many\" (in Damascus?) Matthew 26:28 and (in Rome?) Mark 14:24: on behalf of \"you\" (in Antioch?) Luke 22:20.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus identifies himself in John 6 as the manna, now developed to construe the Eucharist as a mystery in which Jesus, not literally but sacramentally, offers/gives his own personal body and blood in Eucharist. This would probably not be a totally new idea to Hellenistic Christians who followed synoptic practice. But Johannine practice now makes this meaning explicit. It was, as is characteristic of the Fourth Gospel, an unambiguous, clear break with Judaism. For with this development, Eucharist has become a \"sacrament\" understandable only in Hellenistic terms, and involving \"a knowing conflict with the ordinary understanding of what Judaism might and might not include.\"\n|}\n\n===Eucharist and its relation to the Last Supper===\n[[Paul F. Bradshaw]] argues in ''Eucharistic Origins'' that it is not until after the 1st century and much later in some areas that the Eucharist and the Last Supper became placed in a relation of dependence: many Eucharists did not relate to the Paschal mystery and/or the Last Supper.<ref>Bradshaw, Paul, ''Eucharistic Origins'' (London, SPCK, 2004) {{ISBN|0281056153}}, p. 10.</ref> On the other hand, in the middle of the 1st century Paul the Apostle explicitly placed the celebration of the Lord's Supper in relation to what Jesus did on the night he was handed over, in giving his disciples bread with the words \"This is my body\" and, after the supper, giving them the cup with a similar declaration about his blood.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201325}}</ref><ref>\"The earliest reference to the Eucharist is in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 11:23\u201324) where he attributes its institution to the actions and words of Jesus at the Last Supper\" ([http://www.culham.ac.uk/christiancontent/aspects/c2d3.php Culham Institute: Knowledge Content in Religious Education: Christianity \u2013 A Guide For Teachers New To Religious Education])</ref>\n\n[[John Dominic Crossan]] suggests that there are two traditions \"as old as we can trace them\" of the eucharist, that of Paul, reflecting the Antioch Church's tradition, and that of the [[Didache]], the first document to give explicit instruction regarding prayers to be said at a celebration that it called the Eucharist.\n\nThe cup/bread liturgy of the Didache, from the Jerusalem tradition, does not mention Passover, or Last Supper, or Death of Jesus/blood/body, and the sequence is meal + thanksgiving ritual.  For Crossan, it is dispositive that <blockquote>even late in the first century C.E., at least some (southern?) Syrian Christians could celebrate a Eucharist of bread and wine with absolutely no hint of Passover meal, Last Supper or passion symbolism built into its origins or development.  I cannot believe that they knew about those elements and studiously avoided them.  I can only presume that they were not there for everyone from the beginning, that is, from solemn formal and final institution by Jesus himself.<ref>Crossan, John Dominic, \"The Historical Jesus\" HarperCollins 1992 p. 364</ref></blockquote>\nPaul's first letter to the Corinthians, in the context of correcting the habits of the Corinthians serves to reestablish \"the Pre-Pauline tradition, ritual of bread/body + meal + ritual of cup/blood.\" <ref>Crossan, John Dominic \"The Birth of Christianity, Harper/Collins, 2002, p. 436</ref>  Hellenized Jew Paul references a Greek weekly Lord's Supper, which is not an annual Jewish Passover meal, and does not have the participants giving thanks (\"Eucharistia\"), rather the purpose is to proclaim Jesus' death until he comes again, in the manner of Hellenic societies formed \"to hold meals in remembrance of those who had died and to drink a cup in honor of some god.\"<ref>Funk, ibid. at 139\u2013140</ref> Some authors would consider Paul to be the \"Founder\" of the Eucharist in a pagan context appealing to the Jewish prohibition against drinking blood, the pervasive history of Greek memorial dining societies, and Paul's own hellenistic background.\"<ref>Funk, Robert, and the Jesus Seminar, \"The Acts of Jesus\" Harper Collins, 1998, p. 139</ref> Paul, however, explicitly stated that he was rehearsing a Christian tradition, something that he himself had \"received\" and had already \"handed on\" to the Corinthians.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QaFu25KmgiIC&pg=PA425&dq=paul+eucharist+corinthians&hl=en&ei=I58eTtnEH4exhQeYk_WnAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=paul%20eucharist%20corinthians&f=false Raymond F.

Crossan maintains that table fellowship was central to Jesus' ministry in that was infamous for violating codes of honor to eat freely with outsiders, termed \"sinners and tax collectors\" in the Gospels. Jesus presumably taught at the table, as was customary. This emphasis on table fellowship is reflected in the large number of eating scenes in early Christian art.<ref name=\"EJ\">Crossan, John Dominic. The essential Jesus. Edison: Castle Books. 1998.</ref> In the Jerusalem tradition, of James and Peter, the ''meal'' is of higher importance than blood and body since the Didache fails to mention them. Both traditions reflect the pitfalls of a shared meal among social unequals, namely ''freeloading''.  The Didache says in 12:3\u20134, \"If (a traveler) wants to settle with you and is an artisan, he must work for his living. If, however, he has no trade, use your judgment in taking steps for him to live with you as a Christian without being idle.\"<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/richardson/fathers.viii.i.iii.html English translation]</ref>   Paul, in {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|3:10}} says: \"If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.\" In Crossan's view, \"both stipulations must presume a communal share-meal or they make no sense.\"<ref>Crossan, Ibid.</ref>\n\n====Crossan's ''Preliminary Stages''====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Five Preliminary stages to \"2000 years of eucharistic theology\" and \"Last Supper iconography\", according to Crossan'''<ref>Crossan, John Dominic, ''The Historical Jesus'',\" pp. 360\u2013367</ref>\n|-\n! 1.

The sound of scholarly silence]''</ref> in the Biblical Theology Bulletin, Michael J. Cahill surveyed the state of scholarly literature from some seventy cited sources, dating from the 1950s to the present, on the question of the likelihood of a Jewish Jesus proposing the drinking of blood in the Eucharist.<ref>For instance, [[Hyam Maccoby]] proposes that \"Paul, not Jesus, was the originator of the eucharist, and that the eucharist itself is not a Jewish, but an essentially Hellenistic rite, showing principal affinities not with the Jewish qiddush, but with the ritual meal of the mystery religions.\" John M. G. Barclay \"stresses the anomalous nature of Paul. If Paul's status were to be determined on the single issue of the drinking of blood, it would have to be conceded that Paul simply moves off the scale.\" [[A. N. Wilson]], whose work, Cahill says, synthesizes scholarly trends, distinguishes between the Jewishness of Jesus and Paul: \"... the idea that a pious Jew such as Jesus would have spent his last evening on earth asking his disciples to drink a cup of blood, even symbolically, is unthinkable\". He sees no problem, however, in proposing \"the genius of Paul,\" \"Paul's fertile brain,\" as the source of the Christian Eucharist incorporating the blood-drinking element.\nCahill writes: \"It is instructive to recall the context in which the drinking of blood was acceptable. First-century folk who participated in mystery cult rituals were no more tolerant of cannibalism than we are. There is no evidence that, in itself, drinking of blood was not revolting for them, generally speaking. Yet, we find it in religious ritual. The reason is that they were drinking the blood of an animal that had been numinized in some way and had come to be identified with the god. Drinking the blood of a god was acceptable.\" Otfried Hofius, argues for the authenticity of the passage in 1 Corinthians where Paul speaks of the Eucharist, writing: \"A convincing proof that the Apostle has himself encroached on the wording of the tradition delivered to him has not thus far been adduced.\" David Wenham writes: \"Jesus typically uses vivid, almost shocking metaphors (e.g., Matt 18:8\u20139; Mark 9:43\u201348). Furthermore, that the shocking eucharistic words came to be accepted by Jewish Christians (including Matthew) may suggest that they were not quite as unacceptable as Vermes supposes or that they had a strong claim to authenticity, since they would not easily have been accepted if they were not in the Jewish Christian tradition.\" John Meier, too, insists on Jesus' propensity to use \"shocking symbols\", in reference to the words of the institution narrative and in his \"deliberate flouting of certain social conventions\". He gives particular attention to \"a subversive aphorism of Jesus,\" referring to \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"</ref> After examining the various theories that have been suggested, he concludes:\n<blockquote>\nThe survey of opinion, old and new, reveals wide disagreement with a fundamental divide between those who can accept that the notion of drinking blood could have a Jewish origin and those who insist that this is a later development to be located in the Hellenistic world. What both sides share is an inability to proffer a rationally convincing argument that can provide a historical explanation for the presence of this particular component of the Eucharistic rite. Those who hold for the literal institution by Jesus have not been able to explain plausibly how the drinking of blood could have arisen in a Jewish setting. In fact, this difficulty has been turned into an argument for authenticity. For example, Jeremiah ''[sic]'' quotes Dalman: \"Exactly that which seems scandalous will be historical\" (170\u201371). [[W. D. Davies]] draws attention to the fact that Dalman also argued that the Pauline version of the institution arose in a gentile environment to eliminate the difficulties presented by the more direct Markan form (246). It would appear to be obvious that the difficulties would have been greater in a Jewish environment. Davies' conclusion is apt: \"When such divergent conclusons ''[sic]'' have been based upon the same evidence any dogmatism would be foolish\" (246). On the other hand, I have earlier argued that previous suggestions supporting the non-Jewish source have been vitiated by vague generalities or by association with inappropriate pagan rituals.\n</blockquote>\nIn the account of the [[Last Supper]] in Luke chapter 22, the wine that is consumed at the [[passover]] meal is shown to not be literally blood, but represents the blood that Jesus will shed by his death on the cross. It was a deliberate act of tying the Passover story from the [[Book of Exodus]] to the [[Crucifixion]], and the shed blood of the passover lamb being painted on the lintels of the Hebrews' doors, to Jesus \"...the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\" and his sacrifice at the time of passover.\n<blockquote>\n'And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u201cThis is my body given for you; do this ''in remembrance of me''.\u201d In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\"' (Luke 22:19-20)\n</blockquote>\n\n==Possible cultural influences==\n\n===Jewish ritual meal practice===\nScholars have associated Jesus' Last Supper and the 1st-century Eucharist practices with three  [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jewish]] meal practices: the [[kiddush]] blessing with wine, and the chaburah fellowship and the [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]] meal.\n\n====Kiddush====\nThe Johannine Supper, Ratcliff has suggested,<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\">Ratcliff, E.C., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [13th edition] (1926), Eucharist (vol. 8, p. 793)</ref> was the Jewish ordinance known as ''Kiddush'', the details of which involved the leader of the mixed-sex ceremony taking a cup of wine, sanctifying it by reciting a thanksgiving blessing, and passing it around. There was a similar blessing and breaking of bread.<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\nKiddush is the \"Jewish benediction and prayer recited over a cup of wine immediately before the meal on the eve of the sabbath or of a festival.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-317334/Kiddush Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online].</ref> After reciting the kiddush the master of the house sips from the cup, and then passes it to his wife and to the others at the table; then all wash their hands, and the master of the house blesses the bread, cuts it, and passes a morsel to each person at the table.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=204&letter=K Adler, Cyrus & Dembitz, Lewis N., The Jewish Encyclopedia (1911) \u1e32IDDUSH]</ref>\n\nRatcliff wrote: \"Though the kiddush accounts for the '[Johannine]' Last Supper, it affords no explanation on the origin of the eucharist ... the Last Supper and the Sabbath-Passover Kiddush was therefore no unusual occurrence.  It represented consistent practice since Jesus had first formed the group. It is from this practice, rather than from any direct institution from Jesus, that the eucharist derives its origin. The practice was too firmly established for the group to abandon it, when its Master had been taken away; the primitive apostolic eucharist is no other than the continuation of Jesus's chaburah meal. This is the 'breaking of bread' of  Acts ii. 42.\"<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\n\nJoachim Jeremias disputed the view that the Last Supper was kiddush,<ref>Joachim Jeremias, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref> because the Kiddush was always associated with the Sabbath, and even if there was a Passover kiddush, it would have taken place immediately before the seder, not the day before.\n\n====Chaburah====\nThe chaburah (also 'haburah', pl 'chaburoth') is not the name of a rite, rather it was the name of a group of male friends who met at regular intervals (weekly for Dix) for conversation and a formal meal appurtenant to that meeting.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5hEnxn3QPsC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=chaburoth&source=web&ots=EkvA9vjpU-&sig=fX4q8msCyu3rm_g483lO7hW4unk Dix, Gregory, The Shape of the Liturgy, p. 50]</ref><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\">[http://www.stmarksottawa.ca/info.html#special Rev. Dr. Frank Peake, Manual: The Evolution of the Eucharist]</ref> Nothing is said about them in the Bible but scholars have been able to discover some things about them from other sources. The corporate meeting of a chaburah usually took the form of a supper, held at regular intervals, often on the eve of sabbaths or holy days. Each member of the society contributed towards the provision of this common meal.\n\nThe form of the supper was largely the same as the chief meal of the day in every pious Jewish household. Each kind of food was blessed when it was first brought to the table. At the end of the meal came the grace after meals \u2013 the Blessing or Benediction as it was called. This long prayer was said by the host or father of the family in the name of all who had eaten the meal. On important occasions, and at a chaburah supper, it was recited over a special cup of wine known quite naturally as \"the cup of blessing.\" At the end of the Thanksgiving prayer this cup was sipped by the leader and then by each of those present. The chaburah supper was concluded by the singing of a psalm, after which the meeting broke up.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\"/>\n\nJeremias also disputed that the Last Supper was a chaburah meal, interposing the objection that the chaburah was a \"duty\" meal, held appurtenant to a formal occasion such as a 'bris' or a betrothal.<ref>Jeremias, Joachim, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref>\n\n====Passover Seder====\nPassover commemorates God's saving of his chosen people, the Israelites, who, according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:1\u201329}}, were spared death through the blood of lambs. The [[Passover Seder]] involves [[Passover Seder#The Four Cups|four cups of wine]].\n\nWhether the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover Meal (as the chronology of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] would suggest) or not (as [[Gospel of John|St John]]), it is clear that the Eucharist was instituted at Passover time, and Christian writers from Saint Paul ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:7}}) onwards have stressed that the death of Christ was the fulfilment of the sacrifice foreshadowed by the Passover.\"<ref>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0192802903}}), article ''Passover''</ref>\n\nEnrico Mazza has argued that the view that the Last Supper was a Passover meal \"remains a theological interpretation.

By the 2nd century BC, [[Ben Sira|Jesus Ben Sirach]] described Jewish feasting, with numerous parallels to Hellenic practice, without disapproval.<ref>{{bibleverse||Sirach|31:12-32:13|NAB}}</ref><ref name=Smith/> Gentile and Jewish practice was that the all-male participants reclined at table on their left elbows, and after a benediction given by the host (in the case of a Jewish meal), would have a ''deipnon'' (late afternoon or evening meal) of bread with various vegetables, perhaps some fish or even meat if the meal was extravagant.\n\nAmong the Greeks, a ritual libation, or sacrificial pouring out of wine, followed, with another benediction or blessing, leading to the 'symposion' (as in Plato's Symposium) or wine-drinking course and entertainment.  Thus was established an order of breaking bread and drinking wine. Cups of wine were even passed from diner to diner as a way to pass responsibility for speaking next.  \"Plutarch spoke in the highest terms of the bonds created by the shared wine bowl. His words are echoed by Paul who spoke of the sharing of bread and wine as the act that created the one body, that is to say, it was a community-creating ritual.\"<ref>[http://www.philipharland.com/meals/2003%20Smith%20Paper.pdf Smith, Dennis (2003).

Jewish feast practices had taken on Hellenic forms as noted above.

Upper Saddle River, New Jersey:  Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998.</ref> In contrast, the ancient Greek tragedy, [[The Bacchae]], a ritual involving the wine of Dionysus is not drunk, but poured out as a libation. In the Greek novel, [[Leucippe and Clitophon]] by [[Achilles Tatius]], Dionysus is said to have given a sheperd of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] his first wine. When Dionysus shows the grape cluster where he got the wine from, Tatius parodies the Christian eucharist rite.<ref>Reardon, B.P., ''Collected Ancient Greek Novels'' (University of California Press 2nd ed.) p. 192.</ref>\n\n====Totem-sacrifices====\nIn the chapter \"Totem-Sacrifices and Eucharists\" of his 1920 book ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'', [[Edward Carpenter]] advanced the theory that the Christian Eucharist arose from an almost universal practice of a tribe occasionally eating the animal that it identified with, a practice that he saw as developing into ceremonial eatings of shared food by lamas in Nepal and Tibet, ancient Egyptians, Aztecs, Peruvians, Chinese and Tartars. He concluded: \"These few instances are sufficient to show the extraordinarily wide diffusion of Totem-sacraments and Eucharistic rites all over the world.\"<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/pcc/index.htm Edward Carpenter, ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'' (1920), pp. 54\u201368]</ref>\n\n===Pre-Pauline confluence of Greek and Jewish traditions and ''agap\u0113''===\n\nBy the time of the Roman conquest, Jews practiced festive dining in essentially the same form as the Greeks, with a dinner (deipnon) followed by the symposium proper, where guests drank wine and enjoyed entertainment or conversation. There were, to be sure, cultic differences, such as a [[berakhah]] over the wine cup instead of the Greeks' libation to Dionysus. But eating together was a central activity for Jewish religious groups such as Pharisees and Essenes.\n\n\"Thanksgiving\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\" [eucharistia]) is probably to be regarded as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew \"\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4\" [berakhah, berakah], the Jewish \"blessing\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\" [eulogia]) \"addressed to God at meals for and over the food and drink.  It is in this sense that the term was originally used in connection with the common meal of the early Christian community, at which the 'blessing' or 'thanksgiving' had special reference to Jesus Christ.\"<ref>Ratcliff, E.C., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [1944 (13th) edition], Eucharist (vol. 8, p. 793)</ref>\n\nOne formulation had it that \"(t)he eucharistia was the berakhah without the chaburah supper, and the agape is the chaburah meal without the berakhah.<ref>Dix, Gregory, The Shape of the Liturgy, p. 99</ref>\n\n;[[Agape feast]]\nThe Eucharistic celebrations of the early Christians were embedded in, or simply took the form of, a meal. These were often called [[agape feast]]s, although terminology varied in the first few centuries along with other aspects of practice. ''[[Agape]]'' is one of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''love,'' and so \"agape feasts\" are also referred to in English as \"love-feasts\".\n\nThis Hellenic ritual was apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing a contribution to the meal according to their means. Perhaps predictably enough, it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking, or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community of the type criticised by Paul in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:20\u201322}}.\n<!-- The [[Councils of Carthage|Third Council of Carthage]] (393) and the [[Council of Orl\u00e9ans|Second Council of Orleans]] (541)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EeoAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22&hl=en&ei=MuvlTaSJHY-6hAeK7aHbCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q=%22second%20council%20of%20orleans%22&f=false The Gospel Advocate, volume 3 (1823),] Richard Lee Cole, ''Love-feasts: A History of the Christian Agape'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBdnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&hl=en&ei=gt_lTYitJMS5hAfCw-TLCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ The Antiquaries Journal (Oxford University Press 1975)] and several other books mention a prohibition of the Agape by the Second Council of Orleans in AD 541.

In the 18th century, ''[[Pietism|Pietist]]'' Christians began to hold [[Agape feast|''Love Feasts'']] that looked back to the ancient ''Agape''. Many Christians today after celebrating the Eucharist or another liturgy, now routinely participate in an informal sharing of light refreshments and conversation. This post-Eucharistic gathering is often called \"fellowship hour\" or \"coffee hour\" and is regarded by many clergy as a particularly opportune time for engaging adults in Christian education. Others hold ritual Agape meals.<ref>Sample services can be consulted at [http://thebillabong.info/otm_lent/otm07_p19.html An Agape for Easter] and [http://thebillabong.info/otm_pcost/otm47_p22.html A Pentecost Agape]</ref> -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Paintings of the Last Supper}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=xhUY2AslyF4C Enrico Mazza: \"The Eucharist in the First Four Centuries\", in Anscar J.

They had written him regarding numerous matters of concern ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7:1}}).  Criticizing what he had heard of their meetings, at which they had communal meals, one paragraph in Paul's response reminded them about what he asserted he had \"received from the Lord\" and had \"passed on\" about Jesus' actions and directives at his Last Supper.

At first, they spread through word of mouth, but within a generation Christians had begun writing about Jesus and about Christian practice, the Eucharist included. The theology of the Eucharist and its role as a sacrament developed during this period.\n\nBasing himself on the ''First Apology'' and the ''Dialogue with Trypho'' of [[Justin Martyr]] writing around 150 AD, K.W. Noakes deduces the following liturgical structure was in use at that time:\n# Scripture Readings and Homily.\n# Intercessions and Kiss-of-Peace.\n# Bread and Cup are brought to the Celebrant.\n# Eucharistic Prayer (flexible) but following a fixed pattern with congregational \u201cAmen\u201d\n# Distribution of the elements by the deacons to those present and absent.\n# Collection.\nThis corresponds in general outline to the structure of the rite as used today and is the earliest known example. The theology is as follows: the bread and wine are transformed into the Flesh and Blood of Jesus; they are the pure sacrifice spoken of by Malachi (1:11) and the eucharistic prayer itself is both a thanksgiving for creation and redemption and an ''[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]]'' (Greek: memorial) of the passion (and possibly the incarnation).<ref name=\"Noakes 1979 171f\"/>\n\nInformation from the intervening period is scanty.<ref>{{citation | last=Noakes | first=K.W. |contribution= The Eucharist: 2 From the Apostolic Fathers to Irenaeus| title=The Study of Liturgy | editor-last=Jones |editor-first= Cheslyn| location= London| publisher=SPCK | year=1979|page=170}}</ref>  Both the author of 1 Clement (about 96) and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] (about 108) are concerned that due order be maintained;<ref>\"Let that eucharist alone be considered valid which is celebrated in the presence of the bishop, or of him to whom he shall have entrusted it. ...

London: SPCK (1970) p. vii</ref>  They therefore try to decide where the distinct components of the later rite originated by examining possible cultural elements, both Jewish and Hellenic, which already existed in the period under study.  The underlying debate is over the relative contributions of Paul and Jesus and the possible intervention of other factors.  One key consideration in this is the problem of the Jewish prohibition of drinking blood (see below).\n\nProfessor Robert J. Daly, S.J., argues that Jesus did indeed institute the Eucharist, though it took generations and centuries of guidance from the Holy Spirit for the Eucharist to reach its current form. \"What Jesus did at the Last Supper is obviously at least the generative moment of the institution of the Eucharist.\"  But it was not the Eucharist as we know it. \"The Eucharist that Christians now celebrate is what the Church, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit of the risen Jesus, and over the course of generations and centuries, learned to do as it celebrated table fellowship with its risen Lord.\"<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March, 2005</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Bruce Chilton suggests that we can find in the New Testament six different ways of celebrating what Christians came to call the Eucharist, and can locate each of these in its own specific socio-religio-political setting. This would seem to make irrelevant a number of time-honored scholarly approaches, fundamental to which were, first, the \"literally true\" vs. \"literary fictions\" debate, and, second, the assumption that there was a unified line of development from the established Eucharist of later centuries back close to the time of the historical Jesus.<ref>Daly, Robert J., S.J., 'Eucharistic origins: from the new testament to the liturgies of the golden age.\" Theological Studies March 2005</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ The six Eucharists in the New Testament, according to Bruce Chilton\n|-\n!width=\"16%\"| Jesus' Table Fellowship\n!width=\"16%\"| The \"Last Supper\"\n!width=\"20%\"| Petrine Christianity\n!width=\"16%\"| The Circle of James\n!width=\"16%\"| Paul and the Synoptics\n!width=\"16%\"| John\n|-\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus joined with his followers in meals that were designed to anticipate the coming of God's kingdom. The meals were characterized by a readiness to accept the hospitality and the produce of Israel at large. A willingness to provide for the meals, to join in the fellowship, to forgive and to be forgiven, was seen by Jesus as a sufficient condition for eating in his company and for entry into the kingdom.  Jesus' approach to purity qualification was distinctive in its inclusiveness. For Jesus, the primary markers of purity, the primary requirements for table fellowship in the kingdom were: Israel as forgiven and willing to provide of its own produce.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus sought to influence or reform purity practices associated with the Temple. In his meals, as he shared wine, he started referring to it as the equivalent of the blood of an animal shed in sacrifice, and in sharing bread, claiming that its value was that of sacrificial flesh. \"Here was a sacrifice of sharings which the authorities could not control, and which the nature of Jesus' movement made it impossible for them to ignore. Jesus' meals after his failed occupation of the Temple became a surrogate of sacrifice, the second type of Eucharist.\"\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| In this stage of Eucharistic development, the berakhah prayer of Judaism seems to have become a principal model of Eucharist. Bread took precedence over wine, and, as Acts 1:12-26, 2:46, and 3:14:37 clearly describe, a double domestication took place. Instead of seeking the hospitality of others, as the itinerant Jesus seemed to do, adherents of the movement, under the leadership of Peter and/or the Twelve, gathered in the homes of colleagues where they \"broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people\" (Acts 2:46\u201347). In addition, apparently they also acknowledged the validity of sacrifice in the Temple. In doing this they changed the nature of the meal and the memory of what Jesus had said at that meal. For example, there is no mention of wine, nor does there, in this account of the earliest Christian gatherings, seem to have been any sense of being in tension with the officials of Judaism or its religious practices.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| The tendency to domestication is here pursued further, for the Eucharist is now seen as a Seder meal, open only to Jews in a state of purity, and to be celebrated only once a year, at Passover, in Jerusalem, as prescribed in Exodus 12:48. The effect of this Jacobean program\u2014a possible antecedent to the later Quartodeciman practice?\u2014\"was to integrate Jesus' movement fully within the liturgical institutions of Judaism, to insist upon the Judaic identity of the movement and upon Jerusalem as its governing center,\" but without actually replacing Israel's Seder.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Paul vehemently resisted Jacobean claims. He also emphasized the link between Jesus' death and the Eucharist, and he accepts what Chilton calls the Hellenistic refinement of the Petrine type that presented the Eucharist as a sacrifice for sin. This is also what we find in the Synoptic Gospels which use words to suggest that Jesus' blood is shed in the interests of the communities for which those Gospels were composed: for the \"many\" (in Damascus?) Matthew 26:28 and (in Rome?) Mark 14:24: on behalf of \"you\" (in Antioch?) Luke 22:20.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top\"| Jesus identifies himself in John 6 as the manna, now developed to construe the Eucharist as a mystery in which Jesus, not literally but sacramentally, offers/gives his own personal body and blood in Eucharist. This would probably not be a totally new idea to Hellenistic Christians who followed synoptic practice. But Johannine practice now makes this meaning explicit. It was, as is characteristic of the Fourth Gospel, an unambiguous, clear break with Judaism. For with this development, Eucharist has become a \"sacrament\" understandable only in Hellenistic terms, and involving \"a knowing conflict with the ordinary understanding of what Judaism might and might not include.\"\n|}\n\n===Eucharist and its relation to the Last Supper===\n[[Paul F. Bradshaw]] argues in ''Eucharistic Origins'' that it is not until after the 1st century and much later in some areas that the Eucharist and the Last Supper became placed in a relation of dependence: many Eucharists did not relate to the Paschal mystery and/or the Last Supper.<ref>Bradshaw, Paul, ''Eucharistic Origins'' (London, SPCK, 2004) {{ISBN|0281056153}}, p. 10.</ref> On the other hand, in the middle of the 1st century Paul the Apostle explicitly placed the celebration of the Lord's Supper in relation to what Jesus did on the night he was handed over, in giving his disciples bread with the words \"This is my body\" and, after the supper, giving them the cup with a similar declaration about his blood.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201325}}</ref><ref>\"The earliest reference to the Eucharist is in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 11:23\u201324) where he attributes its institution to the actions and words of Jesus at the Last Supper\" ([http://www.culham.ac.uk/christiancontent/aspects/c2d3.php Culham Institute: Knowledge Content in Religious Education: Christianity \u2013 A Guide For Teachers New To Religious Education])</ref>\n\n[[John Dominic Crossan]] suggests that there are two traditions \"as old as we can trace them\" of the eucharist, that of Paul, reflecting the Antioch Church's tradition, and that of the [[Didache]], the first document to give explicit instruction regarding prayers to be said at a celebration that it called the Eucharist.\n\nThe cup/bread liturgy of the Didache, from the Jerusalem tradition, does not mention Passover, or Last Supper, or Death of Jesus/blood/body, and the sequence is meal + thanksgiving ritual.  For Crossan, it is dispositive that <blockquote>even late in the first century C.E., at least some (southern?) Syrian Christians could celebrate a Eucharist of bread and wine with absolutely no hint of Passover meal, Last Supper or passion symbolism built into its origins or development.  I cannot believe that they knew about those elements and studiously avoided them.  I can only presume that they were not there for everyone from the beginning, that is, from solemn formal and final institution by Jesus himself.<ref>Crossan, John Dominic, \"The Historical Jesus\" HarperCollins 1992 p. 364</ref></blockquote>\nPaul's first letter to the Corinthians, in the context of correcting the habits of the Corinthians serves to reestablish \"the Pre-Pauline tradition, ritual of bread/body + meal + ritual of cup/blood.\" <ref>Crossan, John Dominic \"The Birth of Christianity, Harper/Collins, 2002, p. 436</ref>  Hellenized Jew Paul references a Greek weekly Lord's Supper, which is not an annual Jewish Passover meal, and does not have the participants giving thanks (\"Eucharistia\"), rather the purpose is to proclaim Jesus' death until he comes again, in the manner of Hellenic societies formed \"to hold meals in remembrance of those who had died and to drink a cup in honor of some god.\"<ref>Funk, ibid. at 139\u2013140</ref> Some authors would consider Paul to be the \"Founder\" of the Eucharist in a pagan context appealing to the Jewish prohibition against drinking blood, the pervasive history of Greek memorial dining societies, and Paul's own hellenistic background.\"<ref>Funk, Robert, and the Jesus Seminar, \"The Acts of Jesus\" Harper Collins, 1998, p. 139</ref> Paul, however, explicitly stated that he was rehearsing a Christian tradition, something that he himself had \"received\" and had already \"handed on\" to the Corinthians.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QaFu25KmgiIC&pg=PA425&dq=paul+eucharist+corinthians&hl=en&ei=I58eTtnEH4exhQeYk_WnAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=paul%20eucharist%20corinthians&f=false Raymond F.

Crossan maintains that table fellowship was central to Jesus' ministry in that was infamous for violating codes of honor to eat freely with outsiders, termed \"sinners and tax collectors\" in the Gospels.

The sound of scholarly silence]''</ref> in the Biblical Theology Bulletin, Michael J. Cahill surveyed the state of scholarly literature from some seventy cited sources, dating from the 1950s to the present, on the question of the likelihood of a Jewish Jesus proposing the drinking of blood in the Eucharist.<ref>For instance, [[Hyam Maccoby]] proposes that \"Paul, not Jesus, was the originator of the eucharist, and that the eucharist itself is not a Jewish, but an essentially Hellenistic rite, showing principal affinities not with the Jewish qiddush, but with the ritual meal of the mystery religions.\" John M. G. Barclay \"stresses the anomalous nature of Paul. If Paul's status were to be determined on the single issue of the drinking of blood, it would have to be conceded that Paul simply moves off the scale.\" [[A. N. Wilson]], whose work, Cahill says, synthesizes scholarly trends, distinguishes between the Jewishness of Jesus and Paul: \"... the idea that a pious Jew such as Jesus would have spent his last evening on earth asking his disciples to drink a cup of blood, even symbolically, is unthinkable\". He sees no problem, however, in proposing \"the genius of Paul,\" \"Paul's fertile brain,\" as the source of the Christian Eucharist incorporating the blood-drinking element.\nCahill writes: \"It is instructive to recall the context in which the drinking of blood was acceptable. First-century folk who participated in mystery cult rituals were no more tolerant of cannibalism than we are. There is no evidence that, in itself, drinking of blood was not revolting for them, generally speaking. Yet, we find it in religious ritual. The reason is that they were drinking the blood of an animal that had been numinized in some way and had come to be identified with the god. Drinking the blood of a god was acceptable.\" Otfried Hofius, argues for the authenticity of the passage in 1 Corinthians where Paul speaks of the Eucharist, writing: \"A convincing proof that the Apostle has himself encroached on the wording of the tradition delivered to him has not thus far been adduced.\" David Wenham writes: \"Jesus typically uses vivid, almost shocking metaphors (e.g., Matt 18:8\u20139; Mark 9:43\u201348). Furthermore, that the shocking eucharistic words came to be accepted by Jewish Christians (including Matthew) may suggest that they were not quite as unacceptable as Vermes supposes or that they had a strong claim to authenticity, since they would not easily have been accepted if they were not in the Jewish Christian tradition.\" John Meier, too, insists on Jesus' propensity to use \"shocking symbols\", in reference to the words of the institution narrative and in his \"deliberate flouting of certain social conventions\". He gives particular attention to \"a subversive aphorism of Jesus,\" referring to \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"</ref> After examining the various theories that have been suggested, he concludes:\n<blockquote>\nThe survey of opinion, old and new, reveals wide disagreement with a fundamental divide between those who can accept that the notion of drinking blood could have a Jewish origin and those who insist that this is a later development to be located in the Hellenistic world. What both sides share is an inability to proffer a rationally convincing argument that can provide a historical explanation for the presence of this particular component of the Eucharistic rite. Those who hold for the literal institution by Jesus have not been able to explain plausibly how the drinking of blood could have arisen in a Jewish setting. In fact, this difficulty has been turned into an argument for authenticity. For example, Jeremiah ''[sic]'' quotes Dalman: \"Exactly that which seems scandalous will be historical\" (170\u201371). [[W. D. Davies]] draws attention to the fact that Dalman also argued that the Pauline version of the institution arose in a gentile environment to eliminate the difficulties presented by the more direct Markan form (246). It would appear to be obvious that the difficulties would have been greater in a Jewish environment. Davies' conclusion is apt: \"When such divergent conclusons ''[sic]'' have been based upon the same evidence any dogmatism would be foolish\" (246). On the other hand, I have earlier argued that previous suggestions supporting the non-Jewish source have been vitiated by vague generalities or by association with inappropriate pagan rituals.\n</blockquote>\nIn the account of the [[Last Supper]] in Luke chapter 22, the wine that is consumed at the [[passover]] meal is shown to not be literally blood, but represents the blood that Jesus will shed by his death on the cross. It was a deliberate act of tying the Passover story from the [[Book of Exodus]] to the [[Crucifixion]], and the shed blood of the passover lamb being painted on the lintels of the Hebrews' doors, to Jesus \"...the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\" and his sacrifice at the time of passover.\n<blockquote>\n'And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \u201cThis is my body given for you; do this ''in remembrance of me''.\u201d In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \u201cThis cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\"' (Luke 22:19-20)\n</blockquote>\n\n==Possible cultural influences==\n\n===Jewish ritual meal practice===\nScholars have associated Jesus' Last Supper and the 1st-century Eucharist practices with three  [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Jewish]] meal practices: the [[kiddush]] blessing with wine, and the chaburah fellowship and the [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]] meal.\n\n====Kiddush====\nThe Johannine Supper, Ratcliff has suggested,<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\">Ratcliff, E.C., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [13th edition] (1926), Eucharist (vol. 8, p. 793)</ref> was the Jewish ordinance known as ''Kiddush'', the details of which involved the leader of the mixed-sex ceremony taking a cup of wine, sanctifying it by reciting a thanksgiving blessing, and passing it around. There was a similar blessing and breaking of bread.<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\nKiddush is the \"Jewish benediction and prayer recited over a cup of wine immediately before the meal on the eve of the sabbath or of a festival.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-317334/Kiddush Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online].</ref> After reciting the kiddush the master of the house sips from the cup, and then passes it to his wife and to the others at the table; then all wash their hands, and the master of the house blesses the bread, cuts it, and passes a morsel to each person at the table.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=204&letter=K Adler, Cyrus & Dembitz, Lewis N., The Jewish Encyclopedia (1911) \u1e32IDDUSH]</ref>\n\nRatcliff wrote: \"Though the kiddush accounts for the '[Johannine]' Last Supper, it affords no explanation on the origin of the eucharist ... the Last Supper and the Sabbath-Passover Kiddush was therefore no unusual occurrence.  It represented consistent practice since Jesus had first formed the group. It is from this practice, rather than from any direct institution from Jesus, that the eucharist derives its origin. The practice was too firmly established for the group to abandon it, when its Master had been taken away; the primitive apostolic eucharist is no other than the continuation of Jesus's chaburah meal. This is the 'breaking of bread' of  Acts ii. 42.\"<ref name=\"Ratcliff, E.C. 1926 p. 793\"/>\n\nJoachim Jeremias disputed the view that the Last Supper was kiddush,<ref>Joachim Jeremias, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref> because the Kiddush was always associated with the Sabbath, and even if there was a Passover kiddush, it would have taken place immediately before the seder, not the day before.\n\n====Chaburah====\nThe chaburah (also 'haburah', pl 'chaburoth') is not the name of a rite, rather it was the name of a group of male friends who met at regular intervals (weekly for Dix) for conversation and a formal meal appurtenant to that meeting.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5hEnxn3QPsC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=chaburoth&source=web&ots=EkvA9vjpU-&sig=fX4q8msCyu3rm_g483lO7hW4unk Dix, Gregory, The Shape of the Liturgy, p. 50]</ref><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\">[http://www.stmarksottawa.ca/info.html#special Rev. Dr. Frank Peake, Manual: The Evolution of the Eucharist]</ref> Nothing is said about them in the Bible but scholars have been able to discover some things about them from other sources. The corporate meeting of a chaburah usually took the form of a supper, held at regular intervals, often on the eve of sabbaths or holy days. Each member of the society contributed towards the provision of this common meal.\n\nThe form of the supper was largely the same as the chief meal of the day in every pious Jewish household. Each kind of food was blessed when it was first brought to the table. At the end of the meal came the grace after meals \u2013 the Blessing or Benediction as it was called. This long prayer was said by the host or father of the family in the name of all who had eaten the meal. On important occasions, and at a chaburah supper, it was recited over a special cup of wine known quite naturally as \"the cup of blessing.\" At the end of the Thanksgiving prayer this cup was sipped by the leader and then by each of those present. The chaburah supper was concluded by the singing of a psalm, after which the meeting broke up.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=\"stmarksottawa.ca\"/>\n\nJeremias also disputed that the Last Supper was a chaburah meal, interposing the objection that the chaburah was a \"duty\" meal, held appurtenant to a formal occasion such as a 'bris' or a betrothal.<ref>Jeremias, Joachim, Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1960, first ed. 1935): ET: The Eucharistic Words of Jesus [with author's revisions to 1964 ed.] (London: SCM. 1966: repr., Philadelphia: Westminster. 1977)</ref>\n\n====Passover Seder====\nPassover commemorates God's saving of his chosen people, the Israelites, who, according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|12:1\u201329}}, were spared death through the blood of lambs. The [[Passover Seder]] involves [[Passover Seder#The Four Cups|four cups of wine]].\n\nWhether the [[Last Supper]] was a Passover Meal (as the chronology of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] would suggest) or not (as [[Gospel of John|St John]]), it is clear that the Eucharist was instituted at Passover time, and Christian writers from Saint Paul ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|5:7}}) onwards have stressed that the death of Christ was the fulfilment of the sacrifice foreshadowed by the Passover.\"<ref>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0192802903}}), article ''Passover''</ref>\n\nEnrico Mazza has argued that the view that the Last Supper was a Passover meal \"remains a theological interpretation. The historical fact is that the Last Supper was not a Passover celebration and, consequently, that its liturgy was not that of the Jewish Passover.\"<ref>The Celebration of the Eucharist: The Origin of the Rite and the Development of Its Interpretation [Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999] pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nJoachim Jeremias, having rejected the previous two possible backgrounds for the Last Supper argues forcibly that it was a ''Passover Seder'' while recognising that there are difficulties.  His case may be summed as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Was the Last Supper a Passover Seder?  according to Joachim Jeremias<ref>[http://www.abcog.org/green1.htm Eucharistic Sacrifice in the New Testament]</ref>\n|-\n! Ten factors substantiating Passover\n! Nine factors in objection to Passover actions that would be in violation of ritual regulations\n!

By the 2nd century BC, [[Ben Sira|Jesus Ben Sirach]] described Jewish feasting, with numerous parallels to Hellenic practice, without disapproval.<ref>{{bibleverse||Sirach|31:12-32:13|NAB}}</ref><ref name=Smith/> Gentile and Jewish practice was that the all-male participants reclined at table on their left elbows, and after a benediction given by the host (in the case of a Jewish meal), would have a ''deipnon'' (late afternoon or evening meal) of bread with various vegetables, perhaps some fish or even meat if the meal was extravagant.\n\nAmong the Greeks, a ritual libation, or sacrificial pouring out of wine, followed, with another benediction or blessing, leading to the 'symposion' (as in Plato's Symposium) or wine-drinking course and entertainment.  Thus was established an order of breaking bread and drinking wine. Cups of wine were even passed from diner to diner as a way to pass responsibility for speaking next.  \"Plutarch spoke in the highest terms of the bonds created by the shared wine bowl. His words are echoed by Paul who spoke of the sharing of bread and wine as the act that created the one body, that is to say, it was a community-creating ritual.\"<ref>[http://www.philipharland.com/meals/2003%20Smith%20Paper.pdf Smith, Dennis (2003).

Still more important in the present context is the fact that [[Tertullian]] speaks of the Lord's Supper (the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] \"\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd ''\u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd''\") precisely as the \"dominicum ''convivium''\" (see [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tertullian/tertullian.uxor2.shtml Ad uxorem 2:4:2], and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.v.ii.iv.html translation]).</ref> The number of participants at such meals in private houses, as opposed to other specially designated places, would be at most a dozen.<ref>\"The term ''convivium'' labels a late afternoon or evening meal taking place in a domestic dining room or garden, hosted by the proprietor of the residence, involving some combination of family members and guests numbering anywhere from a very few up to perhaps a dozen (nine is an ideal but not necessarily standard number), and ordinarily employing a single ''triclinium'', the three-sided arrangement of couches commonly used for dining during the period of this study. ... \"civic\" dining, which occurred on special occasions such as festivals, was publicly sponsored or paid for by a single donor, and might involve large numbers of people spread over many triclinia in the public spaces of cities and towns; or, alternatively, involved a college of priests or magistrates whose meals might be paid for publicly or by an endowment, and might occur in specially designated spaces.\" ([http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8190.html Matthew B. Roller: ''Dining Posture in Ancient Rome: Bodies, Values, and Status'', Introduction])</ref> The symposium after the meal was the time for teaching and conversation, for the singing of hymns, for the contributions of those who prophesied or spoke in tongues.<ref name=Smith/>\n\n====Mystery cults====\nParallel to the religious duties to god and state, \"the Hellenic world also fostered a number of 'underground' religions, which countless thousands of people found intellectually and emotionally satisfying.\"<ref name=\"Harris, Stephen L. p 286\">Harris, Stephen L. 'Understanding the Bible' Fourth Edition p. 286</ref>  They were known as the \"mysteries,\" because their adherents took oaths never to reveal their rites to the uninitiated.

Jewish feast practices had taken on Hellenic forms as noted above. [[Dionysus]] was \"god of 'the vine' - representing wine, the most universally popular beverage in the ancient world.\" <ref>Harris, Stephen L., ''Understanding the Bible.'' (Mayfield Publishing Company 4th ed.) p. 287.{{ISBN|1559346558}}</ref> [[Barry B. Powell|Barry Powell]] suggests that Christian notions of eating and drinking the \"flesh\" and \"blood\" of Jesus were influenced by the cult of Dionysus.<ref>Powell, Barry B.,  ''Classical Myth''  Second ed.  With new translations of ancient texts by Herbert M. Howe.  Upper Saddle River, New Jersey:  Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998.</ref> In contrast, the ancient Greek tragedy, [[The Bacchae]], a ritual involving the wine of Dionysus is not drunk, but poured out as a libation. In the Greek novel, [[Leucippe and Clitophon]] by [[Achilles Tatius]], Dionysus is said to have given a sheperd of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] his first wine. When Dionysus shows the grape cluster where he got the wine from, Tatius parodies the Christian eucharist rite.<ref>Reardon, B.P., ''Collected Ancient Greek Novels'' (University of California Press 2nd ed.) p. 192.</ref>\n\n====Totem-sacrifices====\nIn the chapter \"Totem-Sacrifices and Eucharists\" of his 1920 book ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'', [[Edward Carpenter]] advanced the theory that the Christian Eucharist arose from an almost universal practice of a tribe occasionally eating the animal that it identified with, a practice that he saw as developing into ceremonial eatings of shared food by lamas in Nepal and Tibet, ancient Egyptians, Aztecs, Peruvians, Chinese and Tartars. He concluded: \"These few instances are sufficient to show the extraordinarily wide diffusion of Totem-sacraments and Eucharistic rites all over the world.\"<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/pcc/index.htm Edward Carpenter, ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'' (1920), pp. 54\u201368]</ref>\n\n===Pre-Pauline confluence of Greek and Jewish traditions and ''agap\u0113''===\n\nBy the time of the Roman conquest, Jews practiced festive dining in essentially the same form as the Greeks, with a dinner (deipnon) followed by the symposium proper, where guests drank wine and enjoyed entertainment or conversation. There were, to be sure, cultic differences, such as a [[berakhah]] over the wine cup instead of the Greeks' libation to Dionysus. But eating together was a central activity for Jewish religious groups such as Pharisees and Essenes.\n\n\"Thanksgiving\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\" [eucharistia]) is probably to be regarded as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew \"\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d4\" [berakhah, berakah], the Jewish \"blessing\" (in Greek, \"\u03b5\u1f50\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\" [eulogia]) \"addressed to God at meals for and over the food and drink.  It is in this sense that the term was originally used in connection with the common meal of the early Christian community, at which the 'blessing' or 'thanksgiving' had special reference to Jesus Christ.\"<ref>Ratcliff, E.C., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica [1944 (13th) edition], Eucharist (vol. 8, p. 793)</ref>\n\nOne formulation had it that \"(t)he eucharistia was the berakhah without the chaburah supper, and the agape is the chaburah meal without the berakhah.<ref>Dix, Gregory, The Shape of the Liturgy, p. 99</ref>\n\n;[[Agape feast]]\nThe Eucharistic celebrations of the early Christians were embedded in, or simply took the form of, a meal. These were often called [[agape feast]]s, although terminology varied in the first few centuries along with other aspects of practice. ''[[Agape]]'' is one of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''love,'' and so \"agape feasts\" are also referred to in English as \"love-feasts\".\n\nThis Hellenic ritual was apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing a contribution to the meal according to their means. Perhaps predictably enough, it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking, or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community of the type criticised by Paul in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:20\u201322}}.\n<!-- The [[Councils of Carthage|Third Council of Carthage]] (393) and the [[Council of Orl\u00e9ans|Second Council of Orleans]] (541)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EeoAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22&hl=en&ei=MuvlTaSJHY-6hAeK7aHbCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q=%22second%20council%20of%20orleans%22&f=false The Gospel Advocate, volume 3 (1823),] Richard Lee Cole, ''Love-feasts: A History of the Christian Agape'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBdnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&dq=%22second+council+of+orleans%22+agape&hl=en&ei=gt_lTYitJMS5hAfCw-TLCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ The Antiquaries Journal (Oxford University Press 1975)] and several other books mention a prohibition of the Agape by the Second Council of Orleans in AD 541.

In the 18th century, ''[[Pietism|Pietist]]'' Christians began to hold [[Agape feast|''Love Feasts'']] that looked back to the ancient ''Agape''. Many Christians today after celebrating the Eucharist or another liturgy, now routinely participate in an informal sharing of light refreshments and conversation. This post-Eucharistic gathering is often called \"fellowship hour\" or \"coffee hour\" and is regarded by many clergy as a particularly opportune time for engaging adults in Christian education. Others hold ritual Agape meals.<ref>Sample services can be consulted at [http://thebillabong.info/otm_lent/otm07_p19.html An Agape for Easter] and [http://thebillabong.info/otm_pcost/otm47_p22.html A Pentecost Agape]</ref> -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Paintings of the Last Supper}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=xhUY2AslyF4C Enrico Mazza: \"The Eucharist in the First Four Centuries\", in Anscar J.
