Designed by [[McDonnell Douglas]] (now part of [[Boeing]]) and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] (now part of [[Northrop Grumman]]), the F/A-18 was derived from the latter's [[YF-17]] in the 1970s for use by the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations, and since 1986, by the U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the [[Blue Angels]].\n\nThe F/A-18 was designed to be a highly versatile aircraft due to its avionics, cockpit displays, and excellent aerodynamic characteristics, with the ability to carry a wide variety of weapons. The aircraft can perform [[escort fighter|fighter escort]], fleet [[air defense]], [[suppression of enemy air defenses]], [[air interdiction]], [[close air support]], and [[aerial reconnaissance]]. Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset, though it has been criticized for its lack of range and payload compared to its earlier contemporaries, such as the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] in the fighter and [[strike fighter]] role, and the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]] in the attack role.\n\nThe Hornet first saw combat action during the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya]] and subsequently participated in the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and 2003 [[Iraq War]]. The F/A-18 Hornet served as the baseline for the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], its larger, evolutionary redesign.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|YF-16 and YF-17 prototypes being tested by the U.S. Air Force]]\n\nThe U.S. Navy started the Naval Fighter-Attack, Experimental ([[VFAX]]) program to procure a multirole aircraft to replace the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]], the [[Vought A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair II]], and the remaining [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s, and to complement the [[F-14 Tomcat]]. Vice Admiral [[Kent Lee]], then head of [[Naval Air Systems Command]], was the lead advocate for the VFAX against strong opposition from many Navy officers, including Vice Admiral [[William D. Houser]], deputy chief of naval operations for air warfare \u2013 the highest-ranking naval aviator.<ref name=Kelly_Inside_Story>Kelly, Orr. ''Hornet: the Inside Story of the F/A-18''. Novato, California: Presidio Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-89141-344-8}}.</ref>\n\nIn August 1973, Congress mandated that the Navy pursue a lower-cost alternative to the F-14. [[Grumman]] proposed a stripped F-14 designated the F-14X, while [[McDonnell Douglas]] proposed a naval variant of the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], but both were nearly as expensive as the F-14.<ref name=Jenkins_p19>Jenkins 2000, pp. 19\u201321.</ref>  That summer, [[Secretary of Defense]] [[James R. Schlesinger]] ordered the Navy to evaluate the competitors in the Air Force's [[Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF) program, the [[General Dynamics]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|YF-16]] and [[Northrop YF-17]].<ref name=Navy_History_Hornet>[http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/fa18.htm \"F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18 Super Hornet.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217024406/http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/fa18.htm |date=17 December 2014}} ''U.S. Navy''. Retrieved: 4 July 2008.</ref>  The Air Force competition specified a day fighter with no strike capability. In May 1974, the House Armed Services Committee redirected $34&nbsp;million from the VFAX to a new program, the [[Navy Air Combat Fighter]] (NACF),<ref name=Navy_History_Hornet/> intended to make maximum use of the technology developed for the LWF program.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n===Redesigning the YF-17===\nThough the YF-16 won the LWF competition, the Navy was skeptical that an aircraft with one engine and narrow landing gear could be easily or economically adapted to carrier service, and refused to adopt an F-16 derivative. On 2 May 1975, the Navy announced its selection of the YF-17.<ref>Donald, David ed. \"Boeing F/A-18 Hornet\". ''Warplanes of the Fleet''. London: AIRtime, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-880588-81-9}}.</ref> Since the LWF did not share the design requirements of the VFAX, the Navy asked McDonnell Douglas and Northrop to develop a new aircraft from the design and principles of the YF-17. On 1 March 1977, Secretary of the Navy W. Graham Claytor announced that the F-18 would be named \"Hornet\".<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n[[File:Northrop YF-17 Cobra - in flight.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Northrop YF-17 Cobra]] was developed into the carrier-capable F/A-18.]]\nNorthrop had partnered with McDonnell Douglas as a secondary contractor on NACF to capitalize on the latter's experience in building carrier aircraft, including the widely used F-4 Phantom II. On the F-18, the two companies agreed to evenly split component manufacturing, with McDonnell Douglas conducting final assembly. McDonnell Douglas would build the wings, [[stabilator]]s, and forward fuselage; while Northrop would build the center and aft fuselage and vertical stabilizers. McDonnell Douglas was the prime contractor for the naval versions, and Northrop would be the prime contractor for the F-18L land-based version which Northrop hoped to sell on the export market.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/><ref name=Navy_History_Hornet/>\n\nThe F-18, initially known as McDonnell Douglas Model 267, was drastically modified from the YF-17. For carrier operations, the airframe, undercarriage, and [[tailhook]] were strengthened, folding wings and catapult attachments were added, and the landing gear was widened.<ref name=Jenkins_p22>Jenkins 2000, pp. 22\u201326.</ref> To meet Navy range and reserves requirements, McDonnell increased fuel capacity by {{convert|4460|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, by enlarging the dorsal spine and adding a 96-gallon fuel tank to each wing. A \"snag\" was added to the wing's [[leading edge]] and stabilators to prevent an [[aeroelastic flutter]] discovered in the F-15 stabilator. The wings and stabilators were enlarged, the aft fuselage widened by {{convert|4|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, and the engines canted outward at the front. These changes added {{convert|10000|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} to the gross weight, bringing it to {{convert|37000|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. The YF-17's control system was replaced with a fully digital [[fly-by-wire]] system with quadruple redundancy, the first to be installed in a production fighter.<ref name=Jenkins_p22/>\n\n[[File:First YF-18A Hornet on display in 1978.JPG|thumb|The first preproduction F-18A on display in October 1978]]\nOriginally, plans were to acquire a total of 780 aircraft of three variants: the single-seat F-18A fighter and A-18A attack aircraft, differing only in avionics, and the dual-seat TF-18A, which retained full mission capability of the F-18 with a reduced fuel load.<ref name=FedAmSci/> Following improvements in avionics and multifunction displays, and a redesign of external stores stations, the A-18A and F-18A were able to be combined into one aircraft.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/> Starting in 1980, the aircraft began to be referred to as the F/A-18A, and the designation was officially announced on 1 April 1984. The TF-18A was redesignated F/A-18B.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n===Northrop's F-18L===\nNorthrop developed the F-18L as a potential export aircraft. Since it was not strengthened for carrier service, it was expected to be lighter and better performing, and a strong competitor to the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] then being offered to American allies. The F-18L's normal [[gross weight]] was lighter than the F/A-18A by {{convert|7700|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, via lighter landing gear, lack of wing folding mechanism, reduced part thickness in areas, and lower fuel-carrying capacity. Though the aircraft retained a lightened tailhook, the most obvious external difference was removed \"snags\" on the leading edge of the wings and stabilators. It still retained 71% commonality with the F/A-18 by parts weight, and 90% of the high-value systems, including the avionics, radar, and [[electronic countermeasure]] suite, though alternatives were offered. Unlike the F/A-18, the F-18L carried no fuel in its wings and lacked weapons stations on the intakes. It had three underwing pylons on each side, instead.<ref name=Jenkins_p26>Jenkins 2000, pp. 26\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe F/A-18L version followed to coincide with the US Navy's F/A-18A as a land-based export alternative. This was essentially an F/A-18A lightened by about {{convert|2500|to|3000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}; weight was reduced by removing the folding wing and associated actuators, implementing a simpler landing gear (single wheel nose gear and [[cantilever]] oleo main gear), and changing to a land-based tail hook. The revised F/A-18L included wing fuel tanks and fuselage stations of the F/A-18A. Its weapons capacity would increase from {{convert|13700|to|20000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, largely due to the addition of a third underwing pylon and strengthened wingtips (11 stations in total vs 9 stations of the F/A-18A). Compared to the F-18L, the outboard weapons pylons are moved closer to the wingtip missile rails. Because of the strengthened nonfolding wing, the wingtip missile rails were designed to carry either the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] or [[Skyflash]] medium-range air-to-air missiles, in addition to the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] as found on the F/A-18A. The F/A-18L was strengthened for a 9 g design load factor compared to the F/A-18A's 7.5 g factor.<ref>Northrop F/A-18L design brochure 1978.</ref>\n\nThe partnership between McDonnell Douglas and Northrop soured over competition for foreign sales for the two models. Northrop felt that McDonnell Douglas would put the F/A-18 in direct competition with the F-18L. In October 1979, Northrop filed a series of lawsuits charging that McDonnell was using Northrop technology developed for the F-18L for foreign sales of the F/A-18 in violation of their agreement, and asked for a moratorium on foreign sales of the Hornet.

The gaps, called the [[boundary layer]] air discharge slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of [[parasitic drag]], worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to [[bleed air]] from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme [[structural load]]s, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect.<ref name=Jenkins_p35>Jenkins 2000, p. 35.</ref> F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads. The first production F/A-18A flew on 12 April 1980. After a production run of 380 F/A-18As<ref name=Boeing_Milestones/> (including the nine assigned to flight systems development), manufacture shifted to the F/A-18C in September 1987.<ref name=FedAmSci/>\n\n===Improvements and design changes===\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. Navy faced the need to replace its aging [[A-6 Intruder]]s and A-7 Corsair IIs with no replacement in development.<ref name=Donald_p45>Donald 2004, p. 45.</ref> To answer this deficiency, the Navy commissioned development of the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. Despite its designation, it is not just an upgrade of the F/A-18 Hornet, but rather, a new, larger airframe using the design concepts of the Hornet.\n\nHornets and Super Hornets will serve complementary roles in the U.S. Navy carrier fleet until the Hornet A-D models are completely replaced by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35C Lightning II]].  The Marines have chosen to extend the use of certain F/A-18s up to 10,000 flight hours, due to delays in the F-35B variant.<ref>Munoz, Carlo.

It is highly maneuverable, owing to its good thrust-to-weight ratio, digital [[fly-by-wire]] control system, and [[leading-edge extension]]s, which allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. The [[trapezoidal wing]] has a 20-degree sweepback on the leading edge and a straight trailing edge. The wing has full-span, leading-edge flaps and the trailing edge has single-slotted [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] and [[aileron]]s over the entire span.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 131, 139.</ref>\n\nCanted vertical stabilizers are another distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high [[angle of attack]] ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing-edge flaps that operate as [[flaperon]]s, large full-length [[leading-edge slat]]s, and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 [[High Alpha Research Vehicle]] (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65\u201370 degrees using [[thrust vectoring]] vanes.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-002-DFRC.html \"F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV) fact sheet.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421120737/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-002-DFRC.html |date=21 April 2008 }} ''NASA/Dryden Flight Research Center''.

Its [[mean time between failures]] is three times greater than any other Navy strike aircraft, and requires half the maintenance time.<ref name=FedAmSci/>  Its [[General Electric F404]] engines were also innovative in that they were designed with operability, reliability, and maintainability first.

This is a speed-limiting factor in the Hornet design. Instead, the Hornet uses bleed-air vents on the inboard surface of the engine air intake ducts to slow and reduce the amount of air reaching the engine. While not as effective as variable geometry, the bleed-air technique functions well enough to achieve near [[Mach number|Mach]] 2 speeds, which is within the designed mission requirements.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 24, 147.</ref>\n\nA 1989 USMC study found that single-seat fighters were well suited to air-to-air combat missions, while dual-seat fighters were favored for complex strike missions against heavy air and ground defenses in adverse weather\u2014the question being not so much as to whether a second pair of eyes would be useful, but as to having the second crewman sit in the same fighter or in a second fighter.

The D-model can be configured for training or as an all-weather strike craft. The \"missionized\" D model's rear seat is configured for a Marine Corps [[Naval Flight Officer]] who functions as a Weapons and Sensors Officer to assist in operating the weapons systems. The F/A-18D is primarily operated by the U.S. Marine Corps in the night attack and [[Forward air control|Forward Air Controller]] (Airborne) (FAC(A)) roles.<ref name=Jenkins_p64>Jenkins 2000, pp. 64\u201366.</ref>\n\n[[File:FA-18 inverted above an F-14.jpg|thumb|An F/A-18 inverted above an [[F-14]]]]\nThe F/A-18C and D models are the result of a block upgrade in 1987<ref name=Boeing_Milestones/> incorporating upgraded radar, avionics, and the capacity to carry new missiles such as the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] air-to-air missile and [[AGM-65 Maverick]]<ref name=FedAmSci/> and [[AGM-84 Harpoon]] air-to-surface missiles. Other upgrades include the [[Martin-Baker]] NACES (Navy Aircrew Common [[ejection seat]]), and a self-protection jammer. A [[synthetic aperture radar|synthetic aperture ground mapping radar]] enables the pilot to locate targets in poor visibility conditions. C and D models delivered since 1989 also have improved night attack abilities, consisting of the [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes]] AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, the [[Loral Space & Communications|Loral]] [[AN/AAS-38|AN/AAS-38 NITE Hawk]] [[FLIR]] (forward looking infrared array) targeting pod, night vision goggles, and two full-color (formerly monochrome) [[multi-function display]] (MFDs) and a color moving map.<ref name=FedAmSci/>\n\nIn addition, 60 D-model Hornets are configured as the night attack ''F/A-18D (RC)'' with ability for reconnaissance.<ref name=Jenkins_p64/>  These could be outfitted with the [[ATARS]] electro-optical sensor package that includes a sensor pod and equipment mounted in the place of the M61 cannon.<ref name=Jenkins_p66>Jenkins 2000, pp. 66\u201370.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1992, the F404-GE-402 enhanced performance engine, providing approximately 10% more maximum static thrust became the standard Hornet engine.<ref name=Warplanes>Donald, David. \"Boeing F/A-18 Hornet\".

The Super Hornet has a new, 25% larger airframe, larger rectangular air intakes, more powerful [[General Electric F414|GE F414]] engines based on F/A-18's F404, and an upgraded avionics suite. Like the Marine Corps' F/A-18D, the Navy's F/A-18F carries a [[naval flight officer]] as a second crew member in a weapon systems officer (WSO) role.  The Super Hornet is unofficially known as \"Rhino\" in operational use. This name was chosen to distinguish the newer variants from the legacy F-18A/B/C/D Hornet and avoid confusion during carrier deck operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0121b.shtml|title=Aerospaceweb.org - Ask Us - F-18E/F Rhino|website=Aerospaceweb.org|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011185621/http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0121b.shtml|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aero-pix.com/fighters/sf18page.htm|title=F/A-18 Super Hornet/Rhino|website=aero-pix.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407114521/http://www.aero-pix.com/fighters/sf18page.htm|archive-date=7 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/video/aircraft/jet-fighters/fa-18-ef-rhine-breaks-speed-of-sound/3967325319001|title=F/A-18E/F Rhino Breaks Speed of Sound|website=Military.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224232429/http://www.military.com/video/aircraft/jet-fighters/fa-18-ef-rhine-breaks-speed-of-sound/3967325319001|archive-date=24 December 2017|url-status=live|date=31 December 2014}}</ref>  The Super Hornet is also operated by Australia.\n\n===G Growler===\n{{main|Boeing EA-18G Growler}}\nThe EA-18G Growler is an electronic warfare version of the two-seat F/A-18F, which entered production in 2007.

Assembled in Australia (excluding the first two (A)F/A-18Bs) by Aero-Space Technologies of Australia (ASTA) from 1985 through to 1990, from kits produced by McDonnell Douglas with increasing local content in the later aircraft. Originally the most notable differences between an Australian (A)F/A-18A/B and a US F/A-18A/B were the lack of a [[aircraft catapult|catapult attachment]], replacing the carrier [[tailhook]] with a lighter land arresting hook, and the automatic carrier landing system with an [[Instrument Landing System]]. Australian Hornets have been involved in several major upgrade programs. This program called HUG (Hornet Upgrade) has had a few evolutions over the years. The first was to give Australian Hornets F/A-18C model avionics. The second and current upgrade program (HUG 2.2) updates the fleet's avionics even further.\n\n;[[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet|CF-18 Hornet]]\n* '''CF-18A''': Single-seat fighter/attack version for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].

Designed by [[McDonnell Douglas]] (now [[Boeing]]) and [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] (now part of [[Northrop-Grumman]]), the F/A-18 was derived from the latter's [[YF-17]] in the 1970s for use by the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The Hornet is also used by the air forces of several other nations, and since 1986, by the U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the [[Blue Angels]].\n\nThe F/A-18 was designed to be a highly versatile aircraft due to its avionics, cockpit displays, and excellent aerodynamic characteristics, with the ability to carry a wide variety of weapons. The aircraft can perform [[escort fighter|fighter escort]], fleet [[air defense]], [[suppression of enemy air defenses]], [[air interdiction]], [[close air support]], and [[aerial reconnaissance]]. Its versatility and reliability have proven it to be a valuable carrier asset, though it has been criticized for its lack of range and payload compared to its earlier contemporaries, such as the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] in the fighter and [[strike fighter]] role, and the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]] in the attack role.\n\nThe Hornet first saw combat action during the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya]] and subsequently participated in the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and 2003 [[Iraq War]]. The F/A-18 Hornet served as the baseline for the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], its larger, evolutionary redesign.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight.jpg|thumb|left|YF-16 and YF-17 prototypes being tested by the U.S. Air Force]]\n\nThe U.S. Navy started the Naval Fighter-Attack, Experimental ([[VFAX]]) program to procure a multirole aircraft to replace the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]], the [[Vought A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair II]], and the remaining [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s, and to complement the [[F-14 Tomcat]]. Vice Admiral [[Kent Lee]], then head of [[Naval Air Systems Command]], was the lead advocate for the VFAX against strong opposition from many Navy officers, including Vice Admiral [[William D. Houser]], deputy chief of naval operations for air warfare \u2013 the highest-ranking naval aviator.<ref name=Kelly_Inside_Story>Kelly, Orr. ''Hornet: the Inside Story of the F/A-18''. Novato, California: Presidio Press, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-89141-344-8}}.</ref>\n\nIn August 1973, Congress mandated that the Navy pursue a lower-cost alternative to the F-14. [[Grumman]] proposed a stripped F-14 designated the F-14X, while [[McDonnell Douglas]] proposed a naval variant of the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], but both were nearly as expensive as the F-14.<ref name=Jenkins_p19>Jenkins 2000, pp. 19\u201321.</ref>  That summer, [[Secretary of Defense]] [[James R.

Retrieved: 4 July 2008.</ref>  The Air Force competition specified a day fighter with no strike capability. In May 1974, the House Armed Services Committee redirected $34&nbsp;million from the VFAX to a new program, the [[Navy Air Combat Fighter]] (NACF),<ref name=Navy_History_Hornet/> intended to make maximum use of the technology developed for the LWF program.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n===Redesigning the YF-17===\nThough the YF-16 won the LWF competition, the Navy was skeptical that an aircraft with one engine and narrow landing gear could be easily or economically adapted to carrier service, and refused to adopt an F-16 derivative. On 2 May 1975, the Navy announced its selection of the YF-17.<ref>Donald, David ed. \"Boeing F/A-18 Hornet\". ''Warplanes of the Fleet''. London: AIRtime, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-880588-81-9}}.</ref> Since the LWF did not share the design requirements of the VFAX, the Navy asked McDonnell Douglas and Northrop to develop a new aircraft from the design and principles of the YF-17. On 1 March 1977, Secretary of the Navy W. Graham Claytor announced that the F-18 would be named \"Hornet\".<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n[[File:Northrop YF-17 Cobra - in flight.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Northrop YF-17 Cobra]] was developed into the carrier-capable F/A-18.]]\nNorthrop had partnered with McDonnell Douglas as a secondary contractor on NACF to capitalize on the latter's experience in building carrier aircraft, including the widely used F-4 Phantom II. On the F-18, the two companies agreed to evenly split component manufacturing, with McDonnell Douglas conducting final assembly. McDonnell Douglas would build the wings, [[stabilator]]s, and forward fuselage; while Northrop would build the center and aft fuselage and vertical stabilizers. McDonnell Douglas was the prime contractor for the naval versions, and Northrop would be the prime contractor for the F-18L land-based version which Northrop hoped to sell on the export market.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/><ref name=Navy_History_Hornet/>\n\nThe F-18, initially known as McDonnell Douglas Model 267, was drastically modified from the YF-17. For carrier operations, the airframe, undercarriage, and [[tailhook]] were strengthened, folding wings and catapult attachments were added, and the landing gear was widened.<ref name=Jenkins_p22>Jenkins 2000, pp. 22\u201326.</ref> To meet Navy range and reserves requirements, McDonnell increased fuel capacity by {{convert|4460|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, by enlarging the dorsal spine and adding a 96-gallon fuel tank to each wing. A \"snag\" was added to the wing's [[leading edge]] and stabilators to prevent an [[aeroelastic flutter]] discovered in the F-15 stabilator. The wings and stabilators were enlarged, the aft fuselage widened by {{convert|4|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, and the engines canted outward at the front. These changes added {{convert|10000|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} to the gross weight, bringing it to {{convert|37000|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. The YF-17's control system was replaced with a fully digital [[fly-by-wire]] system with quadruple redundancy, the first to be installed in a production fighter.<ref name=Jenkins_p22/>\n\n[[File:First YF-18A Hornet on display in 1978.JPG|thumb|The first preproduction F-18A on display in October 1978]]\nOriginally, plans were to acquire a total of 780 aircraft of three variants: the single-seat F-18A fighter and A-18A attack aircraft, differing only in avionics, and the dual-seat TF-18A, which retained full mission capability of the F-18 with a reduced fuel load.<ref name=FedAmSci/> Following improvements in avionics and multifunction displays, and a redesign of external stores stations, the A-18A and F-18A were able to be combined into one aircraft.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/> Starting in 1980, the aircraft began to be referred to as the F/A-18A, and the designation was officially announced on 1 April 1984. The TF-18A was redesignated F/A-18B.<ref name=Jenkins_p19/>\n\n===Northrop's F-18L===\nNorthrop developed the F-18L as a potential export aircraft. Since it was not strengthened for carrier service, it was expected to be lighter and better performing, and a strong competitor to the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] then being offered to American allies. The F-18L's normal [[gross weight]] was lighter than the F/A-18A by {{convert|7700|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, via lighter landing gear, lack of wing folding mechanism, reduced part thickness in areas, and lower fuel-carrying capacity. Though the aircraft retained a lightened tailhook, the most obvious external difference was removed \"snags\" on the leading edge of the wings and stabilators. It still retained 71% commonality with the F/A-18 by parts weight, and 90% of the high-value systems, including the avionics, radar, and [[electronic countermeasure]] suite, though alternatives were offered. Unlike the F/A-18, the F-18L carried no fuel in its wings and lacked weapons stations on the intakes. It had three underwing pylons on each side, instead.<ref name=Jenkins_p26>Jenkins 2000, pp. 26\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe F/A-18L version followed to coincide with the US Navy's F/A-18A as a land-based export alternative. This was essentially an F/A-18A lightened by about {{convert|2500|to|3000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}; weight was reduced by removing the folding wing and associated actuators, implementing a simpler landing gear (single wheel nose gear and [[cantilever]] oleo main gear), and changing to a land-based tail hook. The revised F/A-18L included wing fuel tanks and fuselage stations of the F/A-18A. Its weapons capacity would increase from {{convert|13700|to|20000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}}, largely due to the addition of a third underwing pylon and strengthened wingtips (11 stations in total vs 9 stations of the F/A-18A). Compared to the F-18L, the outboard weapons pylons are moved closer to the wingtip missile rails. Because of the strengthened nonfolding wing, the wingtip missile rails were designed to carry either the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] or [[Skyflash]] medium-range air-to-air missiles, in addition to the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] as found on the F/A-18A. The F/A-18L was strengthened for a 9 g design load factor compared to the F/A-18A's 7.5 g factor.<ref>Northrop F/A-18L design brochure 1978.</ref>\n\nThe partnership between McDonnell Douglas and Northrop soured over competition for foreign sales for the two models. Northrop felt that McDonnell Douglas would put the F/A-18 in direct competition with the F-18L. In October 1979, Northrop filed a series of lawsuits charging that McDonnell was using Northrop technology developed for the F-18L for foreign sales of the F/A-18 in violation of their agreement, and asked for a moratorium on foreign sales of the Hornet.  McDonnell Douglas countersued, alleging Northrop illegally used F/A-18 technology in its [[Northrop F-20 Tigershark|F-20 Tigershark]]. A settlement was announced 8 April 1985 for all of the lawsuits.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-09/business/fi-28110_1_mcdonnell-douglas|title=McDonnell Settles Suit by Northrop for $50 Million|first=KATHLEEN|last=DAY|date=9 April 1985|website=Articles.latimes.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011185426/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-09/business/fi-28110_1_mcdonnell-douglas|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite newspaper |title=McDonnell, Northrop Suit The McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the Northrop Corporation yesterday announced |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/09/business/mcdonnell-northrop-suit-mcdonnell-douglas-corporation-northrop-corporation.html |date=April 9, 1985 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=4 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810132945/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/09/business/mcdonnell-northrop-suit-mcdonnell-douglas-corporation-northrop-corporation.html |archive-date=10 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/04/09/mcdonnell-douglas-northrop-settle-jet-feud/736cb2c3-466f-49e1-8c24-7b248911cf71/|title=McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Settle Jet Feud|date=9 April 1985|accessdate=10 April 2018|website=Washingtonpost.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018115242/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/04/09/mcdonnell-douglas-northrop-settle-jet-feud/736cb2c3-466f-49e1-8c24-7b248911cf71/|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book |author=Orr Kelly |title=Hornet: The Inside Story of the F/A-18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdG1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT113 |year=2014 |publisher=Open Road Media |isbn=978-1-4976-4567-7 |page=113}}</ref> McDonnell Douglas paid Northrop $50&nbsp;million for \"rights to sell the F/A-18 wherever it could\".<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> Additionally, the companies agreed on McDonnell Douglas as the prime contractor with Northrop as the principal subcontractor.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/><ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/><ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> As principal subcontractor, Northrop will produce the rear section for the F/A-18 (A/B/C/D/E/F), while McDonnell Douglas will produce the rest with final assembly to be performed by McDonnell Douglas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/FA18EFSuperHornet/Pages/default.aspx|title=F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet|website=Northrop Grumman|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331182635/http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/FA18EFSuperHornet/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=31 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> At the time of the settlement, Northrop had ceased work on the F-18L.

The gaps, called the [[boundary layer]] air discharge slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of [[parasitic drag]], worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to [[bleed air]] from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme [[structural load]]s, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect.<ref name=Jenkins_p35>Jenkins 2000, p. 35.</ref> F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads. The first production F/A-18A flew on 12 April 1980. After a production run of 380 F/A-18As<ref name=Boeing_Milestones/> (including the nine assigned to flight systems development), manufacture shifted to the F/A-18C in September 1987.<ref name=FedAmSci/>\n\n===Improvements and design changes===\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. Navy faced the need to replace its aging [[A-6 Intruder]]s and A-7 Corsair IIs with no replacement in development.<ref name=Donald_p45>Donald 2004, p. 45.</ref> To answer this deficiency, the Navy commissioned development of the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. Despite its designation, it is not just an upgrade of the F/A-18 Hornet, but rather, a new, larger airframe using the design concepts of the Hornet.\n\nHornets and Super Hornets will serve complementary roles in the U.S. Navy carrier fleet until the Hornet A-D models are completely replaced by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35C Lightning II]].  The Marines have chosen to extend the use of certain F/A-18s up to 10,000 flight hours, due to delays in the F-35B variant.<ref>Munoz, Carlo.

It is highly maneuverable, owing to its good thrust-to-weight ratio, digital [[fly-by-wire]] control system, and [[leading-edge extension]]s, which allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. The [[trapezoidal wing]] has a 20-degree sweepback on the leading edge and a straight trailing edge. The wing has full-span, leading-edge flaps and the trailing edge has single-slotted [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] and [[aileron]]s over the entire span.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 131, 139.</ref>\n\nCanted vertical stabilizers are another distinguishing design element, one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high [[angle of attack]] ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing-edge flaps that operate as [[flaperon]]s, large full-length [[leading-edge slat]]s, and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 [[High Alpha Research Vehicle]] (HARV).

The Super Hornet has a new, 25% larger airframe, larger rectangular air intakes, more powerful [[General Electric F414|GE F414]] engines based on F/A-18's F404, and an upgraded avionics suite. Like the Marine Corps' F/A-18D, the Navy's F/A-18F carries a [[naval flight officer]] as a second crew member in a weapon systems officer (WSO) role.  The Super Hornet is unofficially known as \"Rhino\" in operational use. This name was chosen to distinguish the newer variants from the legacy F-18A/B/C/D Hornet and avoid confusion during carrier deck operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0121b.shtml|title=Aerospaceweb.org - Ask Us - F-18E/F Rhino|website=Aerospaceweb.org|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011185621/http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0121b.shtml|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aero-pix.com/fighters/sf18page.htm|title=F/A-18 Super Hornet/Rhino|website=aero-pix.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407114521/http://www.aero-pix.com/fighters/sf18page.htm|archive-date=7 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/video/aircraft/jet-fighters/fa-18-ef-rhine-breaks-speed-of-sound/3967325319001|title=F/A-18E/F Rhino Breaks Speed of Sound|website=Military.com|accessdate=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224232429/http://www.military.com/video/aircraft/jet-fighters/fa-18-ef-rhine-breaks-speed-of-sound/3967325319001|archive-date=24 December 2017|url-status=live|date=31 December 2014}}</ref>  The Super Hornet is also operated by Australia.\n\n===G Growler===\n{{main|Boeing EA-18G Growler}}\nThe EA-18G Growler is an electronic warfare version of the two-seat F/A-18F, which entered production in 2007.

Assembled in Australia (excluding the first two (A)F/A-18Bs) by Aero-Space Technologies of Australia (ASTA) from 1985 through to 1990, from kits produced by McDonnell Douglas with increasing local content in the later aircraft. Originally the most notable differences between an Australian (A)F/A-18A/B and a US F/A-18A/B were the lack of a [[aircraft catapult|catapult attachment]], replacing the carrier [[tailhook]] with a lighter land arresting hook, and the automatic carrier landing system with an [[Instrument Landing System]]. Australian Hornets have been involved in several major upgrade programs. This program called HUG (Hornet Upgrade) has had a few evolutions over the years. The first was to give Australian Hornets F/A-18C model avionics. The second and current upgrade program (HUG 2.2) updates the fleet's avionics even further.\n\n;[[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet|CF-18 Hornet]]\n* '''CF-18A''': Single-seat fighter/attack version for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].

It is the ''N''-hexyl [[Homolog (chemistry)|homolog]] of the more common synthetic cannabinoid compound [[JWH-018]].
