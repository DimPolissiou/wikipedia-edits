It did not receive the immediate mass support from the Untouchable population that Ambedkar had hoped for. Division and lack of direction among the leaders of the Ambedkarite movement have been an additional impediment. According to the 2011 census, there are currently 8.44 million Buddhists in India, at least 6.5 million of whom are [[Marathi Buddhists]] in Maharashtra.<ref name=\"Census of India 2001\">[http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm Census GIS HouseHold<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706213221/http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm |date=6 July 2010 }}</ref> This makes Buddhism the fifth-largest [[religion in India]] and 6% of the population of [[Maharashtra]], but less than 1% of the overall population of India.\n\nThe Buddhist revival remains concentrated in two [[States and territories of India|states]]: Ambedkar's native [[Maharashtra]], and [[Uttar Pradesh]] \u2013 the land of Bodhanand Mahastavir, Acharya Medharthi and their associates.\n\n===Developments in Uttar Pradesh===\n[[File:B.R.

He joined the Republican Party of India and converted to Buddhism along with his whole family in 1961. In 1967, he founded the Kanpur branch of \"Bharatiya Buddh Mahasabha\". He held regular meetings where he preached Buddhism, officiated at Buddhist weddings and life cycle ceremonies, and organised festivals on Ambedkar's Jayanti (birth day), [[Sambuddhatva jayanthi]], Diksha Divas (the day Ambedkar converted), and Ambedkar Paranirvan Divas (the day Ambedkar died).<ref name=\"maren_roots\"/>\n\nThe Dalit Buddhist movement in Kanpur gained impetus with the arrival of Dipankar, a [[Chamar]] bhikkhu, in 1980. Dipankar had come to Kanpur on a Buddhist mission and his first public appearance was scheduled at a mass conversion drive in 1981. The event was organised by Rahulan Ambawadekar, an RPI Dalit leader. In April 1981, Ambawadekar founded the Dalit Panthers (U.P. Branch) inspired by the Maharashtrian Dalit Panthers. The event met with severe criticism and opposition from [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] and was banned.<ref name=\"maren_roots\"/>\n\nThe number of Buddhists in the Lucknow district increased from 73 in 1951 to 4327 in 2001.<ref name=\"ShivShankar_Analysis\">{{cite web |last=Das |first=Shiv Shankar |title=Ambedkar Buddhism in Uttar Pradesh (1951\u20132001): An Analysis of Demographic, Social, Economic and Political Developments |pp=56\u201374 |url=http://rindas.ryukoku.ac.jp/research/2011/09/09/upfile/Voices_for_Equity,%20Minority_and_Majority_in_South_Asia,%20RINDAS.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428063753/http://rindas.ryukoku.ac.jp/research/2011/09/09/upfile/Voices_for_Equity%2C%20Minority_and_Majority_in_South_Asia%2C%20RINDAS.pdf |archivedate=28 April 2014 |work=RINDAS International Symposium Series I |publisher=Ryukoku University, Japan |accessdate=3 June 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> According to the 2001 census, almost 70% of the Buddhist population in Uttar Pradesh is from the scheduled castes background.<ref>{{cite web|last=Das|first=Shiv Shankar|title=Buddhism in Lucknow: History and Culture From Alternative Sources|url=http://www.ambedkartimes.com/AT%20May%2016-31,%202013.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428092735/http://www.ambedkartimes.com/AT%20May%2016-31%2C%202013.pdf|archivedate=28 April 2014|work=Ambedkar Times|accessdate=25 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, [[Kanshi Ram]], a popular political leader from a [[Sikh]] religious background, announced his intention to convert to Buddhism on 14 October 2006, the fiftieth anniversary of Ambedkar's conversion.

Sasai came to India in 1966 and met [[Nichidatsu Fujii]], whom he helped with the Peace Pagoda at [[Rajgir]]. He fell out with Fuji, however, and started home, but, by his own account, was stopped by a dream in which a figure resembling [[Nagarjuna]] appeared and said, \"Go to Nagpur\". In Nagpur, he met Wamanrao Godbole, the person who had organised the conversion ceremony for Ambedkar in 1956. Sasai claims that when he saw a photograph of Ambedkar at Godbole's home, he realised that it was Ambedkar who had appeared in his dream. At first, Nagpur folk considered Surai Sasai very strange. Then he began to greet them with \"[[Jai Bhim]]\" (victory to Ambedkar) and to build viharas.  In 1987 a court case to deport him on the grounds that he had overstayed his [[Visa (document)|visa]] was dismissed, and he was granted Indian citizenship.

It is the Indian wing of the UK-based [[Triratna Buddhist Community]] founded by [[Sangharakshita]]. Its roots lie in the scattered contacts that [[Sangharakshita]] had in the 1950s with Ambedkar.  Sangharakshita, then still a bhikshu, participated in the conversion movement from 1956 until his departure to the UK in 1963.\n\nWhen his new ecumenical movement had gained enough ground in the West, Sangharakshita worked with Ambedkarites in India and the UK to develop Indian Buddhism further. After visits in the late 1970s by Dharmachari Lokamitra from UK, supporters developed a two-pronged approach: social work through the Bahujan Hitaj (also spelled as Bahujan Hitay) trust, mainly sponsored from the general public by the British Buddhist-inspired [[Karuna Trust (UK)]], and direct Dharma work. Currently the movement has viharas and groups in at least 20 major areas, a couple of retreat centres, and hundreds of Indian Dharmacharis and Dharmacharinis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inebnetwork.org/attachments/article/73/BD+Spring+2011_Senauke.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=20 April 2012|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420003928/http://www.inebnetwork.org/attachments/article/73/BD%20Spring%202011_Senauke.pdf|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFunding for movement's social and dharma work has come from foreign countries, including the Western countries and [[Taiwan]].

It did not receive the immediate mass support from the Untouchable population that Ambedkar had hoped for. Division and lack of direction among the leaders of the Ambedkarite movement have been an additional impediment. According to the 2011 census, there are currently 8.44 million Buddhists in India, at least 6.5 million of whom are [[Marathi Buddhists]] in Maharashtra.<ref name=\"Census of India 2001\">[http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm Census GIS HouseHold<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706213221/http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm |date=6 July 2010 }}</ref> This makes Buddhism the fifth-largest [[religion in India]] and 6% of the population of [[Maharashtra]], but less than 1% of the overall population of India.\n\nThe Buddhist revival remains concentrated in two [[States and territories of India|states]]: Ambedkar's native [[Maharashtra]], and [[Uttar Pradesh]] \u2013 the land of Bodhanand Mahastavir, Acharya Medharthi and their associates.\n\n===Developments in Uttar Pradesh===\n[[File:B.R.

He joined the Republican Party of India and converted to Buddhism along with his whole family in 1961. In 1967, he founded the Kanpur branch of \"Bharatiya Buddh Mahasabha\". He held regular meetings where he preached Buddhism, officiated at Buddhist weddings and life cycle ceremonies, and organised festivals on Ambedkar's Jayanti (birth day), [[Sambuddhatva jayanthi]], Diksha Divas (the day Ambedkar converted), and Ambedkar Paranirvan Divas (the day Ambedkar died).<ref name=\"maren_roots\"/>\n\nThe Dalit Buddhist movement in Kanpur gained impetus with the arrival of Dipankar, a [[Chamar]] bhikkhu, in 1980. Dipankar had come to Kanpur on a Buddhist mission and his first public appearance was scheduled at a mass conversion drive in 1981. The event was organised by Rahulan Ambawadekar, an RPI Dalit leader. In April 1981, Ambawadekar founded the Dalit Panthers (U.P. Branch) inspired by the Maharashtrian Dalit Panthers.

Sasai came to India in 1966 and met [[Nichidatsu Fujii]], whom he helped with the Peace Pagoda at [[Rajgir]]. He fell out with Fuji, however, and started home, but, by his own account, was stopped by a dream in which a figure resembling [[Nagarjuna]] appeared and said, \"Go to Nagpur\". In Nagpur, he met Wamanrao Godbole, the person who had organised the conversion ceremony for Ambedkar in 1956. Sasai claims that when he saw a photograph of Ambedkar at Godbole's home, he realised that it was Ambedkar who had appeared in his dream. At first, Nagpur folk considered Surai Sasai very strange. Then he began to greet them with \"[[Jai Bhim]]\" (victory to Ambedkar) and to build viharas.  In 1987 a court case to deport him on the grounds that he had overstayed his [[Visa (document)|visa]] was dismissed, and he was granted Indian citizenship.

It is the Indian wing of the UK-based [[Triratna Buddhist Community]] founded by [[Sangharakshita]]. Its roots lie in the scattered contacts that [[Sangharakshita]] had in the 1950s with Ambedkar.  Sangharakshita, then still a bhikshu, participated in the conversion movement from 1956 until his departure to the UK in 1963.\n\nWhen his new ecumenical movement had gained enough ground in the West, Sangharakshita worked with Ambedkarites in India and the UK to develop Indian Buddhism further. After visits in the late 1970s by Dharmachari Lokamitra from UK, supporters developed a two-pronged approach: social work through the Bahujan Hitaj (also spelled as Bahujan Hitay) trust, mainly sponsored from the general public by the British Buddhist-inspired [[Karuna Trust (UK)]], and direct Dharma work. Currently the movement has viharas and groups in at least 20 major areas, a couple of retreat centres, and hundreds of Indian Dharmacharis and Dharmacharinis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inebnetwork.org/attachments/article/73/BD+Spring+2011_Senauke.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=20 April 2012|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420003928/http://www.inebnetwork.org/attachments/article/73/BD%20Spring%202011_Senauke.pdf|archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nFunding for movement's social and dharma work has come from foreign countries, including the Western countries and [[Taiwan]].

Fox had acquired WWOR and KCOP after purchasing most of the television holdings of UPN's founding partner [[Chris-Craft Industries]],<ref>{{cite news|title=News Corp. to Buy Chris-Craft Parent for $5.5 Billion, Outbidding Viacom|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/12/business/fi-3272|author=Sallie Hofmeister|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=August 12, 2000|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> while WPWR was purchased by the company in 2003 from [[Newsweb Corporation]]. Despite concerns about UPN's future that came up after Fox purchased the Chris-Craft stations, UPN signed three-year affiliation renewals with the network's Fox-owned affiliates in 2003. That agreement's pending expiration, along with those involving other broadcasting companies, in 2006 as well as persistent financial losses for both it and The WB gave CBS Corporation (the parent company of UPN) and Time Warner (parent of The WB) the rare opportunity to merge their respective struggling networks into The CW.<ref name=\"WB, UPN Combine\"/><ref>{{cite news|title='Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/|author=Jessica Seid|website=CNNMoney.com|publisher=Time Warner|date=January 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe CW's initial affiliation agreements did not include any of the UPN stations (nor alone [[KDFI|independent station]]) owned by Fox Television Stations. In fact, as part of a ten-year affiliation deal with The WB's part-owner, [[Tribune Broadcasting]], the coveted New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago affiliations all went to Tribune-owned stations ([[WPIX]], [[KTLA]] and [[WGN-TV]], respectively). In response to the announcement, Fox promptly removed all network references from logos and promotional materials on its UPN affiliates and ceased on-air promotion of UPN's programs altogether. However, in all three cases (especially in the cases of Los Angeles and Chicago), the WB affiliate was the higher-rated station; CW executives were on record as preferring the \"strongest\" WB and UPN affiliates.\n\nMedia reports speculated that the Fox-owned UPN affiliates would all revert to being [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]], or else form another network by uniting with other UPN and WB affiliated stations that were left out of The CW's affiliation deals. Fox chose the latter route and announced the launch of MyNetworkTV on February 22, 2006, less than a month after CBS and Time Warner announced the formation of The CW on January 24.<ref>{{cite news|title=News Corp.

Fox would also utilize MySpace's content-sharing model when it launched MyNetworkTV's website.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Deans |first1=Jason |title=News Corp TV channel to use MySpace model |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/may/17/newscorporation.digitalmedia |work=The Guardian |date=17 May 2006}}</ref> There were also rumors that MyNetworkTV's branding was inspired by that of MySpace's.\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by MyNetworkTV}}\nMyNetworkTV began operations on Tuesday, September 5, 2006, with the premieres of its two initial series. Some affiliates unofficially began branding their stations well beforehand in July into August to allow viewers to grow accustomed to their new brandings, though most fulfilled their existing WB and UPN network commitments and did not start branding in earnest until September 1 (the Friday before), when the majority of those affiliate agreements expired. The network provided a block of preview programming that aired the day before on September 4, though it did not launch officially that day due to the low audience figures traditionally associated with the [[Labor Day]] holiday. \n\nInitially, programming aired Monday through Saturdays from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]). As of April 2013, MyNetworkTV broadcasts ten hours of primetime programming each week, airing on Monday through Friday evenings from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific. MyNetworkTV does not offer weekend programming, the only broadcast service not to in the United States.\n\nHeavy local sports preemptions were previously a problem for MyNetworkTV at its launch, as they were for all of the U.S. broadcast networks that have debuted since the January 1995 launches of The WB and UPN. However, these have become less of an issue with the end of the network's telenovela strategy, where an airing of the pre-empted telenovela episode rescheduled as soon as possible on the same day as required by default rather than the flexibility that affiliates of UPN, The WB or The CW had to push a show off to a weekend slot. With the service's switch to an all-rerun schedule in 2009, this effectively allows stations to pre-empt repeat programming at will to fit in sporting events (mainly those provided by syndication services such as [[ESPN Events|ESPN Regional Television]] and the [[Raycom Media#ACC Network|ACC Network]], as some local events that had aired on its affiliates have moved to [[regional sports network]]s in the time since MyNetworkTV launched) without much consequence. During the telenovela era, affiliates often scheduled contractual \"make goods\" of the network's daily schedule between 3:00 and 6:00&nbsp;a.m. local time. Not only are these light viewing hours, but they air after [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] processes its preliminary morning network ratings.\n\n===Telenovelas===\n[[File:foxtelenovela.png|right|thumb|Australian logo]]\n{{main|MyNetworkTV telenovelas}}\nThe network's original format focused on the 18-to-49-year-old, English-speaking population<ref>{{cite web|title=Media buyers question My Network TV|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=170&num=3038|last=Downey|first=Kevin|work=Media Life Magazine|date=February 21, 2006|accessdate=December 13, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025025438/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=170&num=3038|archivedate=October 25, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Latino TV exec takes a new tack on programming|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_3633111|last=Smith|first=Edward|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=March 25, 2006|accessdate=December 13, 2006}}</ref> with programming consisting exclusively of [[telenovela]]s (a version of the [[soap opera]] format rarely attempted on American television outside of [[Spanish language]] broadcast networks, much less in primetime), starting with ''[[Desire (TV series)|Desire]]'' and ''[[Fashion House]]''. Originally, each series aired Monday through Friday in continuous cycles of 13-week [[story arc|seasons]], with a one-hour recap of the week's episodes airing on Saturdays; when one series ended, another unrelated series would begin the following week. The fifth and sixth series, ''[[American Heiress]]'' and ''[[Saints & Sinners (2007 TV series)|Saints and Sinners]]'', appeared one hour per week on Wednesdays before abruptly vanishing from the schedule.<ref>{{cite news|title=MyNetwork TV: No More Scripted|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2007/03/mynetwork-tv-no-more-scripted/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=March 1, 2007}}</ref> The MyNetworkTV serial lineup was broadcast in [[Australia]] on the [[W Channel (Australia)|W. Channel]] under the block name ''FOXTELENOVELA''. In [[Canada]], the first ''Desire''/''Fashion House'' cycle aired weekday afternoons on [[Toronto]] independent station [[CKXT-DT|CKXT-TV]], which decided not to air subsequent cycles for unknown reasons.\n\n===Proposed programming===\nThe announcement of the network also stated that additional unscripted reality-based and current-affairs programming were in development. These included:\n* ''Catwalk'', a series similar to ''[[America's Next Top Model]]''\n* ''On Scene'', a crime-based [[newsmagazine|news magazine]] produced by [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]\n* An American version of the quiz show ''Britain's Brainiest''\n* An [[Love Island (U.S. TV series)|American version]] of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series ''[[Love Island (2005 TV series)|Love Island]]'', which would later be picked up by [[CBS]]\n\nMyNetworkTV abandoned the development of these programs in Summer 2006, choosing to focus solely on telenovelas.\n\nLater announcements by Fox regarding additional programming to air on MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated stations \u2013 such as ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' repeats in traditional weekend syndication, a trial run of the sitcom ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]'' (which later moved to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]), and the daytime [[quiz channel|viewer-participation]] [[game show]] ''[[My GamesFever]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Twentieth TV, Shine Plan Live Daytime Series|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2006/08/twentieth-tv-shine-plan-live-d/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=August 30, 2006}}</ref> \u2013 never applied to the network as a whole.\n\n===Other programming===\nMyNetworkTV does not supply any children's programming, late-night programming or any news or sports programming. San Francisco affiliate KRON-TV (which has maintained a news department since it launched as an [[NBC]] affiliate in 1949) is currently the only station aligned with the service that produces its own local news programming, giving MyNetworkTV the fewest news-producing stations among the six major broadcast networks (in comparison, The CW has nine news-producing stations within its portfolio).\n\nMany of the service's other affiliates carry local newscasts produced through a news share agreement with a station affiliated with one of the major networks (most often, these are produced by those owned or managed alongside the local MyNetworkTV-affiliate station), and may serve as broadcasters for local sports teams. They may also air Big Four network programming as an alternate outlet due to either breaking news or major sporting events.\n\n===Revamping the schedule===\nIn response to the [[myNetworkTV telenovelas|telenovela]] lineup's poor [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] performance, highlighted by an average household rating of 0.7%, reports surfaced<ref>{{cite news|title=My Network scrambles to draw viewers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-01-24/business/0701240067_1_upn-network-tv-fox-television-stations-group|author=[[Phil Rosenthal]]|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=January 24, 2007}}</ref> that Fox executives were planning a major revamp of MyNetworkTV's programming, decreasing its reliance on telenovelas and adding new unscripted programs to the schedule such as [[reality television|reality shows]], game shows (such as ''My GamesFever''), movies and sports, and a possible revisit to a deal with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]].<ref>{{cite news|title=MyNetworkTV Executives Plot Schedule Changes|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2006/12/mynetworktv_executives_plot_sc.php|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=December 15, 2006|access-date=2007-06-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030054/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2006/12/mynetworktv_executives_plot_sc.php|archive-date=2007-09-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, MyNetworkTV instead signed a deal with another [[mixed martial arts]] organization, the [[International Fight League]], in conjunction with [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Networks Enter Mixed Martial Arts Ring|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2007/01/fox-networks-enter-mixed-marti/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=January 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 2007, [[Greg Meidel]], who was named to the newly created position of network president just ten days earlier, confirmed the rumors and unveiled a dramatically revamped lineup.<ref>{{cite news|title=MNT Unveils Schedule With Fewer Telenovela Nights|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/mnt-unveils-schedule-fewer-telenovela-nights/30081|author=Jim Benson|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=February 1, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=MyNetworkTV Adds Movies, Fighting to Schedule|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2007/02/mynetworktv-adds-movies-fighti/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=February 1, 2007}}</ref> The intent of the shakeup was to increase viewer awareness of the network (and boost viewership, in turn), as well as to satisfy local affiliates who were disappointed over the poor ratings performance of the network under its initial format. After March 7 (when ''[[Wicked Wicked Games]]'' and ''[[Watch Over Me]]'' finished their runs), telenovelas were reduced to occupying only two nights of its programming schedule, airing in two-hour movie-style blocks rather than each of the serials airing in a one-hour, five-night-a-week format. The remainder of the schedule included theatrical movies and the new ''[[International Fight League|IFL]] Battleground'' (originally titled ''Total Impact''). In addition, the Saturday night telenovela recaps ended immediately, with movies running on that night until March.

This was due to WFGX's weak analog signal, which was not receivable west of Pensacola, and the lack of a [[must-carry]] agreement with [[Comcast]]'s Mobile system, most likely a remnant of the station's former status as a low-rated [[Jewelry Television]] affiliate prior to MyNetworkTV's launch); WFGX has since relocated its digital transmitter to [[Robertsdale, Alabama]] (where the Mobile-Pensacola market's other television stations maintain transmitters), providing an over-the-air MyNetworkTV affiliate in the Mobile area proper for the first time. On September 28, 2009, three stations owned by [[Ion Media Networks]] ([[WPXX-TV]] in Memphis, Tennessee and [[WEPX-TV]], along with satellite station [[WPXU-TV]], in the [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]]-[[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]]-[[Washington, North Carolina]] market), due to an affiliation agreement made by their previous owners, dropped their MyNetworkTV affiliations to become full-time Ion Television owned-and-operated stations as they had been prior to September 2006 (the affiliation in the Greenville-New Bern market was taken over by NBC affiliate [[WITN-TV]], which carries the network on a digital subchannel).\n\nMemphis CW affiliate WLMT \u2013 which picked up MyNetworkTV for the sole purpose of carrying ''SmackDown'', and due to the conversion into a programming service \u2013 elected to not carry the remainder of the network's schedule; eventually, after ''SmackDown'' moved to Syfy, WLMT began carrying the remainder of the MyNetworkTV lineup as a secondary affiliation (to the Retro Television Network) on its second digital subchannel.\n\nAlso in September 2009, Des Moines, Iowa affiliate [[KDMI]] disaffiliated from MyNetworkTV, replacing it with programming from the station's existing This TV affiliation. CW affiliate KCWI-TV picked up the local rights to ''SmackDown'', and for nearly a year afterward, aired it in a manner very similar to its scheduling on WLMT. Until October 3, 2011, when KDMI rejoined the service, Des Moines was the largest television market without a MyNetworkTV affiliate \u2013 either over-the-air or on cable (CBS affiliate [[KCCI]] took over the MyNetworkTV affiliation from KDMI in December 2014, carrying it as a primary affiliation on its third digital subchannel).<ref>{{cite web|title=KCCI Takes on MyNet Affiliation in Des Moines|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/station-station/kcci-takes-mynet-affiliation-des-moines/136006|author=Michael Malone|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=December 1, 2014|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref> On September 19, 2011, Cedar Rapids, Iowa affiliate KWKB dropped the service, while retaining its existing CW affiliation; ABC affiliate KCRG-TV later picked up MyNetworkTV for its second digital subchannel.\n\nOn February 10, 2014, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] affiliate [[WRBU]] disaffiliated from MyNetworkTV, and converted into an [[Ion Television]] O&O, as a result of its sale to Ion Media Networks through [[Roberts Broadcasting]]'s gradual sale of its television stations in order to raise money to pay off creditors in its [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] proceedings; this resulted in St. Louis temporarily displacing [[Spokane, Washington]] as the largest market without a MyNetworkTV affiliate until November 17, 2014, when CBS affiliate [[KMOV]] began carrying it on a digital subchannel.<ref>{{cite news|title=WRBU becomes Ion in St. Louis|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/gail-pennington/wrbu-becomes-ion-in-st-louis/article_84a5d13f-09f4-58f7-a863-01bcc09d7c45.html|author=Gail Pennington|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to MYTV St. Louis! |url=http://www.kmov.com/community/KMOV-TV-launches-new-sister-station--282973851.html |website=[[KMOV]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=September 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129061429/http://www.kmov.com/community/KMOV-TV-launches-new-sister-station--282973851.html |archivedate=November 29, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the availability of \"instant [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]]\" [[digital subchannel]]s that are likely easily available on cable and satellite, and the overall lack of a need to settle for a secondary affiliation with shows aired in problematic time slots, both The CW and MyNetworkTV launched with far greater national coverage than that enjoyed by UPN and The WB when those networks started in January 1995. For several years, UPN had affiliation gaps in several of the top 30 markets, and by 2005 managed to reach only 86% of the population. This resulted in that network having to settle for secondary affiliations with stations that were already affiliated with other networks. In those markets, programs (such as ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'') were either shown out of their intended timeslots or not at all, leading to many viewer complaints. There are a handful of smaller markets, however, where MyNetworkTV holds a secondary affiliation \u2013 even on digital subchannels \u2013 because those markets are home to only a very small number of stations, and want to place more emphasis on programming from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]] and Fox \u2013 which may have previously lacked affiliations in those markets \u2013 on those subchannels.\n\nNevertheless, because MyNetworkTV was announced after the formation of The CW and therefore got most of the \"leftover\" stations shut out by The CW, there are still availability issues in some markets. Also, the network is mostly relegated to [[low-power broadcasting|low-powered]] stations in some smaller markets, which do not have must-carry status. The arrival of ''WWE SmackDown'' to the network has made this issue the most visible, as [[professional wrestling|wrestling]] fans complained about the lack of availability for MyNetworkTV in several markets that have CW affiliations. This was most evident in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], where local ''SmackDown'' viewers actually protested that they could not watch the program because low-powered MyNetworkTV/Retro Television Network affiliate [[WBLU-LP]] lacked carriage on cable providers in the market, and as an [[Equity Media Holdings]] station with no local presence outside of engineering staff, had no communication with the station to speak of.<ref>{{cite news|title='Smackdown' fans peeved over WBLU|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2008/10/10/551115/smackdown-fans-peeved-over-wblu.html|author=Scott Sloan|newspaper=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=WWE Smackdown could move to another station|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2008/10/15/556937/wwe-smackdown-could-move-to-another.html|author=Scott Sloan|newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader|publisher=The McClatchy Company|date=October 15, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref> That was solved shortly afterward when ABC affiliate [[WTVQ-DT|WTVQ]] agreed to move its [[weather]] forecast service to digital subchannel 36.3 and convert the 36.2 subchannel into a MyNetworkTV affiliate, stripping WBLU of its affiliation in the process.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local fans will be able to cheer clearer picture of 'Smackdown'|url=http://www.kentucky.com/101/story/576026.html|newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader|publisher=The McClatchy Company|date=October 31, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Branding===\nIn the months leading up to MyNetworkTV's launch, several of its charter stations changed their on-air identities in preparation for joining the network, including all of the network's owned-and-operated stations under sister company Fox Television Stations. Affiliates also began to air network promotions featuring the theme, \"Entertainment you can call your own.\" At first, many Fox-owned charter stations branded their soon-to-be MyNetworkTV O&Os with the \"My\" [[moniker]] (for example, [[WWOR-TV]] was branded as \"My 9\"). However, by the third week of October 2006, at least one station, Los Angeles O&O KCOP-TV, went to a two-column brand \u2013 verbally identifying as \"MyNetworkTV Channel 13,\" and using a logo combining that used by the network (on the left side) and the station's channel number, 13 (on the right); KCOP switched to the simpler \"My 13\" branding in May 2007.\n\nWhile \"My [channel #]\" is the conventional branding style for MyNetworkTV's stations, some stations use the network's logo style with different names, such as [[WSTR-TV]] (which formerly branded as 'My 64\", but revived its former brand \"Star 64\" in 2009). Especially after its shift in business model, some affiliates began to drop the \"My\" branding and logo in favor of local brands, such as [[KZJO]] (which re-branded from \"myQ\u00b2\", in reference to its sister station [[KCPQ]] \"Q13 Fox\", to \"JoeTV\"), [[WTTA]] (which switched its branding from \"My TV Tampa Bay\" to \"Great 38\" in September 2013), WPMY (which switched from \"My [[Pittsburgh]] TV\" to \"22 the Point\" in August 2015 and even changed their [[call sign]] to [[WPNT]] to fit the new branding), former affiliate [[KAUT-TV]] (initially \"OK43\", but later \"Freedom 43\" as part of its efforts to appeal to Oklahoma's military community), and various [[Nexstar Media Group]]-owned affiliates (which use similar brands derived from their call letters and channel numbers, such as [[KARZ-TV]] \"Z42\").

Fox had acquired WWOR and KCOP after purchasing most of the television holdings of UPN's founding partner [[Chris-Craft Industries]],<ref>{{cite news|title=News Corp. to Buy Chris-Craft Parent for $5.5 Billion, Outbidding Viacom|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/12/business/fi-3272|author=Sallie Hofmeister|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=August 12, 2000|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> while WPWR was purchased by the company in 2003 from [[Newsweb Corporation]]. Despite concerns about UPN's future that came up after Fox purchased the Chris-Craft stations, UPN signed three-year affiliation renewals with the network's Fox-owned affiliates in 2003. That agreement's pending expiration, along with those involving other broadcasting companies, in 2006 as well as persistent financial losses for both it and The WB gave CBS Corporation (the parent company of UPN) and Time Warner (parent of The WB) the rare opportunity to merge their respective struggling networks into The CW.<ref name=\"WB, UPN Combine\"/><ref>{{cite news|title='Gilmore Girls' meet 'Smackdown'; CW Network to combine WB, UPN in CBS-Warner venture beginning in September|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/cbs_warner/|author=Jessica Seid|website=CNNMoney.com|publisher=Time Warner|date=January 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe CW's initial affiliation agreements did not include any of the UPN stations (nor alone [[KDFI|independent station]]) owned by Fox Television Stations. In fact, as part of a ten-year affiliation deal with The WB's part-owner, [[Tribune Broadcasting]], the coveted New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago affiliations all went to Tribune-owned stations ([[WPIX]], [[KTLA]] and [[WGN-TV]], respectively). In response to the announcement, Fox promptly removed all network references from logos and promotional materials on its UPN affiliates and ceased on-air promotion of UPN's programs altogether. However, in all three cases (especially in the cases of Los Angeles and Chicago), the WB affiliate was the higher-rated station; CW executives were on record as preferring the \"strongest\" WB and UPN affiliates.\n\nMedia reports speculated that the Fox-owned UPN affiliates would all revert to being [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]], or else form another network by uniting with other UPN and WB affiliated stations that were left out of The CW's affiliation deals. Fox chose the latter route and announced the launch of MyNetworkTV on February 22, 2006, less than a month after CBS and Time Warner announced the formation of The CW on January 24.<ref>{{cite news|title=News Corp.

Some affiliates unofficially began branding their stations well beforehand in July into August to allow viewers to grow accustomed to their new brandings, though most fulfilled their existing WB and UPN network commitments and did not start branding in earnest until September 1 (the Friday before), when the majority of those affiliate agreements expired. The network provided a block of preview programming that aired the day before on September 4, though it did not launch officially that day due to the low audience figures traditionally associated with the [[Labor Day]] holiday. \n\nInitially, programming aired Monday through Saturdays from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]). As of April 2013, MyNetworkTV broadcasts ten hours of primetime programming each week, airing on Monday through Friday evenings from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific. MyNetworkTV does not offer weekend programming, the only broadcast service not to in the United States.\n\nHeavy local sports preemptions were previously a problem for MyNetworkTV at its launch, as they were for all of the U.S. broadcast networks that have debuted since the January 1995 launches of The WB and UPN. However, these have become less of an issue with the end of the network's telenovela strategy, where an airing of the pre-empted telenovela episode rescheduled as soon as possible on the same day as required by default rather than the flexibility that affiliates of UPN, The WB or The CW had to push a show off to a weekend slot. With the service's switch to an all-rerun schedule in 2009, this effectively allows stations to pre-empt repeat programming at will to fit in sporting events (mainly those provided by syndication services such as [[ESPN Events|ESPN Regional Television]] and the [[Raycom Media#ACC Network|ACC Network]], as some local events that had aired on its affiliates have moved to [[regional sports network]]s in the time since MyNetworkTV launched) without much consequence. During the telenovela era, affiliates often scheduled contractual \"make goods\" of the network's daily schedule between 3:00 and 6:00&nbsp;a.m. local time. Not only are these light viewing hours, but they air after [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] processes its preliminary morning network ratings.\n\n===Telenovelas===\n[[File:foxtelenovela.png|right|thumb|Australian logo]]\n{{main|MyNetworkTV telenovelas}}\nThe network's original format focused on the 18-to-49-year-old, English-speaking population<ref>{{cite web|title=Media buyers question My Network TV|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=170&num=3038|last=Downey|first=Kevin|work=Media Life Magazine|date=February 21, 2006|accessdate=December 13, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025025438/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=170&num=3038|archivedate=October 25, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Latino TV exec takes a new tack on programming|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_3633111|last=Smith|first=Edward|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=March 25, 2006|accessdate=December 13, 2006}}</ref> with programming consisting exclusively of [[telenovela]]s (a version of the [[soap opera]] format rarely attempted on American television outside of [[Spanish language]] broadcast networks, much less in primetime), starting with ''[[Desire (TV series)|Desire]]'' and ''[[Fashion House]]''. Originally, each series aired Monday through Friday in continuous cycles of 13-week [[story arc|seasons]], with a one-hour recap of the week's episodes airing on Saturdays; when one series ended, another unrelated series would begin the following week. The fifth and sixth series, ''[[American Heiress]]'' and ''[[Saints & Sinners (2007 TV series)|Saints and Sinners]]'', appeared one hour per week on Wednesdays before abruptly vanishing from the schedule.<ref>{{cite news|title=MyNetwork TV: No More Scripted|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2007/03/mynetwork-tv-no-more-scripted/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=March 1, 2007}}</ref> The MyNetworkTV serial lineup was broadcast in [[Australia]] on the [[W Channel (Australia)|W.

In [[Canada]], the first ''Desire''/''Fashion House'' cycle aired weekday afternoons on [[Toronto]] independent station [[CKXT-DT|CKXT-TV]], which decided not to air subsequent cycles for unknown reasons.\n\n===Proposed programming===\nThe announcement of the network also stated that additional unscripted reality-based and current-affairs programming were in development. These included:\n* ''Catwalk'', a series similar to ''[[America's Next Top Model]]''\n* ''On Scene'', a crime-based [[newsmagazine|news magazine]] produced by [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]\n* An American version of the quiz show ''Britain's Brainiest''\n* An [[Love Island (U.S. TV series)|American version]] of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series ''[[Love Island (2005 TV series)|Love Island]]'', which would later be picked up by [[CBS]]\n\nMyNetworkTV abandoned the development of these programs in Summer 2006, choosing to focus solely on telenovelas.\n\nLater announcements by Fox regarding additional programming to air on MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated stations \u2013 such as ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' repeats in traditional weekend syndication, a trial run of the sitcom ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]'' (which later moved to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]), and the daytime [[quiz channel|viewer-participation]] [[game show]] ''[[My GamesFever]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Twentieth TV, Shine Plan Live Daytime Series|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2006/08/twentieth-tv-shine-plan-live-d/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=August 30, 2006}}</ref> \u2013 never applied to the network as a whole.\n\n===Other programming===\nMyNetworkTV does not supply any children's programming, late-night programming or any news or sports programming. San Francisco affiliate KRON-TV (which has maintained a news department since it launched as an [[NBC]] affiliate in 1949) is currently the only station aligned with the service that produces its own local news programming, giving MyNetworkTV the fewest news-producing stations among the six major broadcast networks (in comparison, The CW has nine news-producing stations within its portfolio).\n\nMany of the service's other affiliates carry local newscasts produced through a news share agreement with a station affiliated with one of the major networks (most often, these are produced by those owned or managed alongside the local MyNetworkTV-affiliate station), and may serve as broadcasters for local sports teams. They may also air Big Four network programming as an alternate outlet due to either breaking news or major sporting events.\n\n===Revamping the schedule===\nIn response to the [[myNetworkTV telenovelas|telenovela]] lineup's poor [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] performance, highlighted by an average household rating of 0.7%, reports surfaced<ref>{{cite news|title=My Network scrambles to draw viewers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-01-24/business/0701240067_1_upn-network-tv-fox-television-stations-group|author=[[Phil Rosenthal]]|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=January 24, 2007}}</ref> that Fox executives were planning a major revamp of MyNetworkTV's programming, decreasing its reliance on telenovelas and adding new unscripted programs to the schedule such as [[reality television|reality shows]], game shows (such as ''My GamesFever''), movies and sports, and a possible revisit to a deal with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]].<ref>{{cite news|title=MyNetworkTV Executives Plot Schedule Changes|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2006/12/mynetworktv_executives_plot_sc.php|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=December 15, 2006|access-date=2007-06-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030054/http://www.tvweek.com/news/2006/12/mynetworktv_executives_plot_sc.php|archive-date=2007-09-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, MyNetworkTV instead signed a deal with another [[mixed martial arts]] organization, the [[International Fight League]], in conjunction with [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Networks Enter Mixed Martial Arts Ring|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2007/01/fox-networks-enter-mixed-marti/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=January 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 2007, [[Greg Meidel]], who was named to the newly created position of network president just ten days earlier, confirmed the rumors and unveiled a dramatically revamped lineup.<ref>{{cite news|title=MNT Unveils Schedule With Fewer Telenovela Nights|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/mnt-unveils-schedule-fewer-telenovela-nights/30081|author=Jim Benson|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=February 1, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=MyNetworkTV Adds Movies, Fighting to Schedule|url=http://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2007/02/mynetworktv-adds-movies-fighti/|website=TVWeek|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=February 1, 2007}}</ref> The intent of the shakeup was to increase viewer awareness of the network (and boost viewership, in turn), as well as to satisfy local affiliates who were disappointed over the poor ratings performance of the network under its initial format. After March 7 (when ''[[Wicked Wicked Games]]'' and ''[[Watch Over Me]]'' finished their runs), telenovelas were reduced to occupying only two nights of its programming schedule, airing in two-hour movie-style blocks rather than each of the serials airing in a one-hour, five-night-a-week format. The remainder of the schedule included theatrical movies and the new ''[[International Fight League|IFL]] Battleground'' (originally titled ''Total Impact''). In addition, the Saturday night telenovela recaps ended immediately, with movies running on that night until March. The 1986 film ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' aired on February 3, becoming the network's first non-telenovela presentation.\n\nSpecials (ranging from the [[World Music Awards]] to the [[Hawaiian Tropic#Miss Hawaiian Tropic International|Hawaiian Tropic International Beauty Pageant]]) and reality programming were also a part of the network's reformatting, with the first two specials airing on March 7. MyNetworkTV also reduced its telenovela programming to a single night each week, with ''American Heiress'' and ''Saints & Sinners'' airing for one hour each on Wednesdays until their unexpected termination, due to incompatible flow with ''IFC Battleground'' from Monday to Tuesday as far as promotions. The new Thursday night movie block featured mostly [[action film|action]]/[[adventure film|adventure]] films, with Friday night featuring a mix of contemporary classic films, beginning on June 5.<ref>{{cite news|title=MyNetTV to Scrap Novelas, Bypass Upfront |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003575924 |website=[[AdWeek|Mediaweek]] |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |date=April 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008104110/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003575924 |archivedate=October 8, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nA side effect of the new programming schedule was the loss of the network's claim that it was the only U.S. broadcast network at the time to have its entire programming schedule available in [[High-definition television|high definition]], due to the IFL, some of the network's movies and additional programs being produced exclusively in [[480i]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]].<ref>{{cite news|title=MyNet Drops Pure-HD Format; Shift From Soap Operas Brings Standard/HD Mix|url=http://www.tvweek.com/page.cms?pageId=626|website=TV Week|publisher=Dexter Canfield Media|date=March 8, 2007}} {{dead link|date=September 2015}}</ref> In the fall of 2007, MyNetworkTV dropped telenovelas altogether, and began to air reality series and sports programs.<ref>{{cite web|title=MyNetworkTV Seeks Arresting Programming|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/mynetworktv-seeks-arresting-programming/82833|author=Jim Benson|website=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=May 29, 2007|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn September 1, 2007, the network aired its first live program, the men's final of the [[Association of Volleyball Professionals|AVP]] Croc Tour's Cincinnati Open.

Before dropping the network in September 2009, it had aired MyNetworkTV programming in a pattern. For nearly a year after KDMI initially dropped MyNetworkTV, CW affiliate [[KCWI-TV]] aired ''[[WWE SmackDown]]'' from the service on Saturdays from 7:00 to 9:00 PM, but did not air the remainder of the service's programming.\n* During its time as a dual CW-MyNetworkTV affiliate, [[KNVA]]/[[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] aired MyNetworkTV programming Monday through Saturdays from 9:00 to 11:00 PM, immediately following The CW's primetime lineup.

During its time as an exclusive MyNetworkTV affiliate, it aired the service's schedule in a pattern.\n* [[WLMT|WLMT-DT2]]/[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], which affiliated with MyNetworkTV in October 2010, presented the service's Monday through Thursday lineups in pattern but aired its Friday lineup on Saturdays from 9:00 to 11:00 PM until November 14, 2011, when the subchannel switched its primary affiliation from the [[Retro Television Network]] to [[Me-TV]]. Since then, WLMT-DT2 has presented all MyNetworkTV programming in pattern with content from Me-TV airing at all other times. In the year before its move to cable channel [[Syfy]] in October 2010, ''WWE SmackDown'' aired on WLMT's main channel on Saturdays from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;p.m., although the remainder of MyNetworkTV's lineup was not carried.

This was due to WFGX's weak analog signal, which was not receivable west of Pensacola, and the lack of a [[must-carry]] agreement with [[Comcast]]'s Mobile system, most likely a remnant of the station's former status as a low-rated [[Jewelry Television]] affiliate prior to MyNetworkTV's launch); WFGX has since relocated its digital transmitter to [[Robertsdale, Alabama]] (where the Mobile-Pensacola market's other television stations maintain transmitters), providing an over-the-air MyNetworkTV affiliate in the Mobile area proper for the first time. On September 28, 2009, three stations owned by [[Ion Media Networks]] ([[WPXX-TV]] in Memphis, Tennessee and [[WEPX-TV]], along with satellite station [[WPXU-TV]], in the [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]]-[[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]]-[[Washington, North Carolina]] market), due to an affiliation agreement made by their previous owners, dropped their MyNetworkTV affiliations to become full-time Ion Television owned-and-operated stations as they had been prior to September 2006 (the affiliation in the Greenville-New Bern market was taken over by NBC affiliate [[WITN-TV]], which carries the network on a digital subchannel).\n\nMemphis CW affiliate WLMT \u2013 which picked up MyNetworkTV for the sole purpose of carrying ''SmackDown'', and due to the conversion into a programming service \u2013 elected to not carry the remainder of the network's schedule; eventually, after ''SmackDown'' moved to Syfy, WLMT began carrying the remainder of the MyNetworkTV lineup as a secondary affiliation (to the Retro Television Network) on its second digital subchannel.\n\nAlso in September 2009, Des Moines, Iowa affiliate [[KDMI]] disaffiliated from MyNetworkTV, replacing it with programming from the station's existing This TV affiliation. CW affiliate KCWI-TV picked up the local rights to ''SmackDown'', and for nearly a year afterward, aired it in a manner very similar to its scheduling on WLMT. Until October 3, 2011, when KDMI rejoined the service, Des Moines was the largest television market without a MyNetworkTV affiliate \u2013 either over-the-air or on cable (CBS affiliate [[KCCI]] took over the MyNetworkTV affiliation from KDMI in December 2014, carrying it as a primary affiliation on its third digital subchannel).<ref>{{cite web|title=KCCI Takes on MyNet Affiliation in Des Moines|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/station-station/kcci-takes-mynet-affiliation-des-moines/136006|author=Michael Malone|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=December 1, 2014|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref> On September 19, 2011, Cedar Rapids, Iowa affiliate KWKB dropped the service, while retaining its existing CW affiliation; ABC affiliate KCRG-TV later picked up MyNetworkTV for its second digital subchannel.\n\nOn February 10, 2014, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] affiliate [[WRBU]] disaffiliated from MyNetworkTV, and converted into an [[Ion Television]] O&O, as a result of its sale to Ion Media Networks through [[Roberts Broadcasting]]'s gradual sale of its television stations in order to raise money to pay off creditors in its [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] proceedings; this resulted in St. Louis temporarily displacing [[Spokane, Washington]] as the largest market without a MyNetworkTV affiliate until November 17, 2014, when CBS affiliate [[KMOV]] began carrying it on a digital subchannel.<ref>{{cite news|title=WRBU becomes Ion in St. Louis|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/gail-pennington/wrbu-becomes-ion-in-st-louis/article_84a5d13f-09f4-58f7-a863-01bcc09d7c45.html|author=Gail Pennington|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]|date=February 11, 2014|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to MYTV St. Louis! |url=http://www.kmov.com/community/KMOV-TV-launches-new-sister-station--282973851.html |website=[[KMOV]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=September 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129061429/http://www.kmov.com/community/KMOV-TV-launches-new-sister-station--282973851.html |archivedate=November 29, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the availability of \"instant [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]]\" [[digital subchannel]]s that are likely easily available on cable and satellite, and the overall lack of a need to settle for a secondary affiliation with shows aired in problematic time slots, both The CW and MyNetworkTV launched with far greater national coverage than that enjoyed by UPN and The WB when those networks started in January 1995. For several years, UPN had affiliation gaps in several of the top 30 markets, and by 2005 managed to reach only 86% of the population. This resulted in that network having to settle for secondary affiliations with stations that were already affiliated with other networks. In those markets, programs (such as ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'') were either shown out of their intended timeslots or not at all, leading to many viewer complaints. There are a handful of smaller markets, however, where MyNetworkTV holds a secondary affiliation \u2013 even on digital subchannels \u2013 because those markets are home to only a very small number of stations, and want to place more emphasis on programming from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]] and Fox \u2013 which may have previously lacked affiliations in those markets \u2013 on those subchannels.\n\nNevertheless, because MyNetworkTV was announced after the formation of The CW and therefore got most of the \"leftover\" stations shut out by The CW, there are still availability issues in some markets. Also, the network is mostly relegated to [[low-power broadcasting|low-powered]] stations in some smaller markets, which do not have must-carry status. The arrival of ''WWE SmackDown'' to the network has made this issue the most visible, as [[professional wrestling|wrestling]] fans complained about the lack of availability for MyNetworkTV in several markets that have CW affiliations. This was most evident in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], where local ''SmackDown'' viewers actually protested that they could not watch the program because low-powered MyNetworkTV/Retro Television Network affiliate [[WBLU-LP]] lacked carriage on cable providers in the market, and as an [[Equity Media Holdings]] station with no local presence outside of engineering staff, had no communication with the station to speak of.<ref>{{cite news|title='Smackdown' fans peeved over WBLU|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2008/10/10/551115/smackdown-fans-peeved-over-wblu.html|author=Scott Sloan|newspaper=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=October 10, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=WWE Smackdown could move to another station|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2008/10/15/556937/wwe-smackdown-could-move-to-another.html|author=Scott Sloan|newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader|publisher=The McClatchy Company|date=October 15, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref> That was solved shortly afterward when ABC affiliate [[WTVQ-DT|WTVQ]] agreed to move its [[weather]] forecast service to digital subchannel 36.3 and convert the 36.2 subchannel into a MyNetworkTV affiliate, stripping WBLU of its affiliation in the process.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local fans will be able to cheer clearer picture of 'Smackdown'|url=http://www.kentucky.com/101/story/576026.html|newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader|publisher=The McClatchy Company|date=October 31, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Branding===\nIn the months leading up to MyNetworkTV's launch, several of its charter stations changed their on-air identities in preparation for joining the network, including all of the network's owned-and-operated stations under sister company Fox Television Stations. Affiliates also began to air network promotions featuring the theme, \"Entertainment you can call your own.\" At first, many Fox-owned charter stations branded their soon-to-be MyNetworkTV O&Os with the \"My\" [[moniker]] (for example, [[WWOR-TV]] was branded as \"My 9\"). However, by the third week of October 2006, at least one station, Los Angeles O&O KCOP-TV, went to a two-column brand \u2013 verbally identifying as \"MyNetworkTV Channel 13,\" and using a logo combining that used by the network (on the left side) and the station's channel number, 13 (on the right); KCOP switched to the simpler \"My 13\" branding in May 2007.\n\nWhile \"My [channel #]\" is the conventional branding style for MyNetworkTV's stations, some stations use the network's logo style with different names, such as [[WSTR-TV]] (which formerly branded as 'My 64\", but revived its former brand \"Star 64\" in 2009). Especially after its shift in business model, some affiliates began to drop the \"My\" branding and logo in favor of local brands, such as [[KZJO]] (which re-branded from \"myQ\u00b2\", in reference to its sister station [[KCPQ]] \"Q13 Fox\", to \"JoeTV\"), [[WTTA]] (which switched its branding from \"My TV Tampa Bay\" to \"Great 38\" in September 2013), WPMY (which switched from \"My [[Pittsburgh]] TV\" to \"22 the Point\" in August 2015 and even changed their [[call sign]] to [[WPNT]] to fit the new branding), former affiliate [[KAUT-TV]] (initially \"OK43\", but later \"Freedom 43\" as part of its efforts to appeal to Oklahoma's military community), and various [[Nexstar Media Group]]-owned affiliates (which use similar brands derived from their call letters and channel numbers, such as [[KARZ-TV]] \"Z42\"). In 2017, Fox began to re-brand some of its MyNetworkTV O&Os to closer associate them with their parent Fox stations, such as [[WDCA]], which became \"[[WTTG|Fox 5]] Plus\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/103316/fox-rebrands-wdca-as-fox-5-plus|title=Fox Rebrands WDCA As \u2018Fox 5 Plus\u2019|website=TVNewsCheck|language=en|access-date=2017-08-12}}</ref> [[Meredith Corporation|Meredith]] emulated this approach on [[KPDX]], which similarly re-branded as \"[[KPTV|Fox 12]] Plus\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kptv.com/site/station_info/kpdx-to-become-fox-plus/article_f242cbf8-d006-5db5-acf3-35a7dd56042f.html|title=KPDX to become FOX 12 Plus|website=KPTV.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n\nAt the time plans for MyNetworkTV were announced, there was at least one station that was using a similar moniker.

As [[Georgy Zhukov]]'s chief of staff, Sokolovsky helped plan and execute the [[Battle of Berlin|Capture of Berlin]].\n\n== Early life ==\nBelarusian. Sokolovsky was born into a peasant family in [[Ko\u017aliki, Bia\u0142ystok County|Kozliki]], a small town in the province of [[Grodno]] (now in [[Bia\u0142ystok County]] in [[Poland]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]). He worked as a teacher in a rural school, where he took part in a number of protests and demonstrations against the Tsar.\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Vasily Sokolovsky (1919 to 1920).jpg|upright|150px|left|thumb|Sokolovsky as a cadet of the Military Academy of Moscow, 1920]]\nSokolovsky joined the [[Red Army]] in<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1750</ref> February 1918.\n\nHe began his formal military schooling in 1919, but was frequently called up by the Red Army and forced to leave his schoolwork. He graduated in 1921 and became the [[chief of staff]] of a division stationed in [[Turkmenistan]]. He was wounded during a battle near [[Samarkand]] and subsequently decorated for bravery. After the [[Russian Civil War]] ended in 1922/1923 he held a number of staff positions, eventually becoming the chief of staff for the [[Moscow Military District]] and then the Deputy Chief of the  [[Soviet General Staff|General Staff]], the position he held at the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, [[Operation Barbarossa]] (22 June 1941).\n\nIn December 1941, with [[Wehrmacht|German]] forces a mere 20 kilometers from [[Moscow]], Sokolovsky was made the chief of staff of the [[Soviet Western Front]], where he was able to help co-ordinate the  [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] winter  [[Battle of Moscow|counter-attacks that forced the Germans away from Moscow]]. He remained in this position until February 1943, when he became the commander of the Western Front.\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 1945 \u0433. 2.jpg|thumb|Sokolovsky sitting next to Zhukov during the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender in Berlin, 1945]]\n\nHe led this front through the [[Battle of Kursk]]. In the summer of 1943, the Soviets launched [[Operation Kutuzov]] on 12 July against Army Group Centre in the Orel salient, directly north of the Kursk salient. The [[Bryansk Front]], under the command of [[Markian Popov]], attacked the eastern face of the Orel salient while the Western Front, commanded by Sokolovsky, attacked from the north. The operation ended on 18 August 1943 with the Soviet capture of Orel and collapse of the Orel bulge. In October\u2013November 1943, Sokolovsky commanded the Western Front in failed Soviet [[Orsha offensives (1943)|Orsha offensives]] against [[Gotthard Heinrici]]'s [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] in the Orsha region of Belarus. In April 1944 the Western Front was broken into two parts and Sokolovsky was made chief of staff of [[1st Ukrainian Front]] under [[Georgy Zhukov]]. He remained in this position until the end of the war in 1945. As the chief of staff of 1st Ukrainian Front, Sokolovsky helped plan and execute the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]]. Sokolovsky sat next to Zhukov as he accepted the German Instrument of Surrender in Berlin.\n\nAfter World War II, Sokolovsky became the deputy commander-in-chief of the [[Soviet Forces in East Germany]] until July 3, 1946. On that day Sokolovsky was promoted to the rank of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]], and also made commander-in-chief of the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]] and head of the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]]. His walking out of a meeting of the [[Allied Control Council]] on 20 March 1948 as the Soviet representative on that body effectively immobilized it from that date. In 1949 he became the Soviet Union's Deputy  [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defense]], a position he held until 1952, when he was made the  [[Chief of the General Staff (Russia)|Chief of the General Staff]]. In 1960 Sokolovsky became the Inspector-General of the Ministry of Defense. He retained this position until his death on May 10, 1968.\n\nSokolovsky became widely known in the West with the publication in 1962 of ''Military Strategy'', a book that contained rare detail on Soviet thinking about war, particularly nuclear war.\n\nSokolovsky was a key member of the Soviet war command during [[World War II]] and known{{by whom?|date=July 2019}} as an excellent planner and exceptional military leader. He was particularly well-trusted by Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]]. The urn containing Sokolovsky\u2019s ashes is buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]].\n\nSokolovsky appears as a prominent figure in [[William T. Vollmann]]'s 2005 National Book Award-winning novel, ''[[Europe Central]]''.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n;Soviet Union\n{|\n|-\n|[[File:Hero of the Soviet Union medal.png|20px]]\n|[[Gold Star]] Medal

The [[Bryansk Front]], under the command of [[Markian Popov]], attacked the eastern face of the Orel salient while the Western Front, commanded by Sokolovsky, attacked from the north. The operation ended on 18 August 1943 with the Soviet capture of Orel and collapse of the Orel bulge. In October\u2013November 1943, Sokolovsky commanded the Western Front in failed Soviet [[Orsha offensives (1943)|Orsha offensives]] against [[Gotthard Heinrici]]'s [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] in the Orsha region of Belarus. In April 1944 the Western Front was broken into two parts and Sokolovsky was made chief of staff of [[1st Ukrainian Front]] under [[Georgy Zhukov]]. He remained in this position until the end of the war in 1945. As the chief of staff of 1st Ukrainian Front, Sokolovsky helped plan and execute the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]]. Sokolovsky sat next to Zhukov as he accepted the German Instrument of Surrender in Berlin.\n\nAfter World War II, Sokolovsky became the deputy commander-in-chief of the [[Soviet Forces in East Germany]] until July 3, 1946. On that day Sokolovsky was promoted to the rank of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]], and also made commander-in-chief of the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]] and head of the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]]. His walking out of a meeting of the [[Allied Control Council]] on 20 March 1948 as the Soviet representative on that body effectively immobilized it from that date. In 1949 he became the Soviet Union's Deputy  [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defense]], a position he held until 1952, when he was made the  [[Chief of the General Staff (Russia)|Chief of the General Staff]]. In 1960 Sokolovsky became the Inspector-General of the Ministry of Defense. He retained this position until his death on May 10, 1968.\n\nSokolovsky became widely known in the West with the publication in 1962 of ''Military Strategy'', a book that contained rare detail on Soviet thinking about war, particularly nuclear war.\n\nSokolovsky was a key member of the Soviet war command during [[World War II]] and known{{by whom?|date=July 2019}} as an excellent planner and exceptional military leader. He was particularly well-trusted by Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]]. The urn containing Sokolovsky\u2019s ashes is buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]].\n\nSokolovsky appears as a prominent figure in [[William T. Vollmann]]'s 2005 National Book Award-winning novel, ''[[Europe Central]]''.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n;Soviet Union\n{|\n|-\n|[[File:Hero of the Soviet Union medal.png|20px]]\n|[[Gold Star]] Medal

This movie marked the final film appearance of [[Bela Lugosi]]. Wood shot only a small amount of test footage featuring his idol Lugosi before the actor's death. Afterwards, the character was played by [[Tom Mason]], the [[chiropractic|chiropractor]] of Wood's wife (Kathy O'Hara) at the time, who played his scenes holding the character's cape in front of his face.\n\nWood was apparently undeterred by the numerous physical differences that distinguished Mason from Lugosi {{spaced ndash}} such as height and build, and the fact that Mason was nearly bald while Lugosi retained a full head of hair until he died.  Worst of all, Mason may have been the only man in the world who couldn't do an impression of Lugosi's accent. Years later, video distributors such as Avenue One DVD began to make light of this, adding such blurbs as \"Almost Starring Bela Lugosi\" to the cover art. Numerous critics also pointed out the cheap, hardly believable special effects and [[wikt:kitschy|kitschy]] dialogue.\n\nShot in 1956, the film was not released until 1959 because of difficulty in finding a distributor.

Although the film was a box office success, it received scathing reviews from critics upon its release, many of which pointed out its sophomoric plot, unfunny humor (in particular, its [[flatulence]] gags) and disguises that would clearly not be recognized by children (such as [[Tony Montana]] from ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'').

This movie marked the final film appearance of [[Bela Lugosi]]. Wood shot only a small amount of test footage featuring his idol Lugosi before the actor's death. Afterwards, the character was played by [[Tom Mason]], the [[chiropractic|chiropractor]] of Wood's wife (Kathy O'Hara) at the time, who played his scenes holding the character's cape in front of his face.\n\nWood was apparently undeterred by the numerous physical differences that distinguished Mason from Lugosi {{spaced ndash}} such as height and build, and the fact that Mason was nearly bald while Lugosi retained a full head of hair until he died.  Worst of all, Mason may have been the only man in the world who couldn't do an impression of Lugosi's accent. Years later, video distributors such as Avenue One DVD began to make light of this, adding such blurbs as \"Almost Starring Bela Lugosi\" to the cover art. Numerous critics also pointed out the cheap, hardly believable special effects and [[wikt:kitschy|kitschy]] dialogue.\n\nShot in 1956, the film was not released until 1959 because of difficulty in finding a distributor.

Although the film was a box office success, it received scathing reviews from critics upon its release, many of which pointed out its sophomoric plot, unfunny humor (in particular, its [[flatulence]] gags) and disguises that would clearly not be recognized by children (such as [[Tony Montana]] from ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'').
