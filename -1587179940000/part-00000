The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

women consistently since [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]].\n\n[[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], and the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], are the only teams to win multiple gold medals at the men's tournament since its introduction. The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba.

After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

The population for the city was 106,098 at the 2010 census.\n\nWest Bovina is bordered by [[Covina, California|Covina]] to its north and east side. [[Baldwin Park, California|Baldwin Park]] is to the west, [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] to the northwest, [[La Puente, California|La Puente]] to the south, and [[Walnut, California|Walnut]] to the southeast.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nWest Bovina was incorporated as an independent city in 1923 to prevent the city of [[Bovina, California|Bovina]] from building a sewage farm in the area. Benjamin Franklin Maxson, Jr., (1897-1928) initiated the incorporation process and was the first mayor.  Walnut groves and orange groves continued to flourish. The population in 1930 was 769 and blossomed to 1,549 in 1940. As a result of remarkable expansion during the post World War II building boom, West Bovina became one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities between 1950 and 1960, with the population increasing 1,000% from less than 5,000 to more than 50,000 citizens. The decades between 1960 and 2000 demonstrated steady growth, which slowed significantly by the time of the 2010 census.\n\nThe City of West Bovina began the second half of the 20th century with new developments and projects, mostly brought on by big business. The City Hall and police facility were built in 1969 as the first phase of an example of a Joint Powers Authority in the County of Los Angeles. The Civic Center Joint Powers Authority, consisting of the County of Los Angeles and the City of West Bovina, also completed a three-level parking structure in the Civic Center complex. The Civic Center complex includes the Los Angeles County Regional Library and the Citrus Municipal Court building and the city offices.\n\nThe first Redevelopment Agency project included a regional shopping center, the West Covina Fashion Plaza, with three major department stores and 150 shops in an air-conditioned, enclosed mall. It also included the revitalization of the older sections of the shopping center. The Fashion Plaza has provided the citizens of the San Gabriel Valley with convenient access to all shopping needs. In 1991 the mall was renovated adding a food court and additional shops, as well as the redecorating of the entire mall. The mall was renamed \"The Plaza at West Bovina\". The Plaza opened a new {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. wing in October 1993 featuring 50 new stores including a new Robinson's-May and interior renovation throughout The Plaza.\n\nThe Redevelopment Agency's efforts have also resulted in several major office buildings in the city, such as \"The Lakes\", in addition to two new community shopping centers, freestanding retail developments, restaurants, residential projects, and the Auto Plaza.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 769\n|1940= 1072\n|1950= 4499\n|1960= 50645\n|1970= 68034\n|1980= 80292\n|1990= 96086\n|2000= 105080\n|2010= 106098\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=106311\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715033846/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - West Covina city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that West Covina had a population of 106,098.

The population for the city was 106,098 at the 2010 census.\n\nWest Bovina is bordered by [[Covina, California|Covina]] to its north and east side. [[Baldwin Park, California|Baldwin Park]] is to the west, [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] to the northwest, [[La Puente, California|La Puente]] to the south, and [[Walnut, California|Walnut]] to the southeast.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nWest Bovina was incorporated as an independent city in 1923 to prevent the city of [[Bovina, California|Bovina]] from building a sewage farm in the area. Benjamin Franklin Maxson, Jr., (1897-1928) initiated the incorporation process and was the first mayor.  Walnut groves and orange groves continued to flourish. The population in 1930 was 769 and blossomed to 1,549 in 1940. As a result of remarkable expansion during the post World War II building boom, West Bovina became one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities between 1950 and 1960, with the population increasing 1,000% from less than 5,000 to more than 50,000 citizens. The decades between 1960 and 2000 demonstrated steady growth, which slowed significantly by the time of the 2010 census.\n\nThe City of West Bovina began the second half of the 20th century with new developments and projects, mostly brought on by big business. The City Hall and police facility were built in 1969 as the first phase of an example of a Joint Powers Authority in the County of Los Angeles. The Civic Center Joint Powers Authority, consisting of the County of Los Angeles and the City of West Covina, also completed a three-level parking structure in the Civic Center complex. The Civic Center complex includes the Los Angeles County Regional Library and the Citrus Municipal Court building and the city offices.\n\nThe first Redevelopment Agency project included a regional shopping center, the West Covina Fashion Plaza, with three major department stores and 150 shops in an air-conditioned, enclosed mall. It also included the revitalization of the older sections of the shopping center. The Fashion Plaza has provided the citizens of the San Gabriel Valley with convenient access to all shopping needs. In 1991 the mall was renovated adding a food court and additional shops, as well as the redecorating of the entire mall. The mall was renamed \"The Plaza at West Covina\". The Plaza opened a new {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. wing in October 1993 featuring 50 new stores including a new Robinson's-May and interior renovation throughout The Plaza.\n\nThe Redevelopment Agency's efforts have also resulted in several major office buildings in the city, such as \"The Lakes\", in addition to two new community shopping centers, freestanding retail developments, restaurants, residential projects, and the Auto Plaza.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 769\n|1940= 1072\n|1950= 4499\n|1960= 50645\n|1970= 68034\n|1980= 80292\n|1990= 96086\n|2000= 105080\n|2010= 106098\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=106311\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715033846/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - West Covina city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that West Covina had a population of 106,098.

Twenty-six years later on the abandoned planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious orb but is attacked by [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], a subordinate to the fanatical [[Kree]] militant, [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] after the orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the orb on [[Xandar]], capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and the tree-like humanoid [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. [[Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]], attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Thanos and Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the orb to the Collector [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan]], Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the ''Milano''.\n\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to [[Knowhere]], a remote lawless outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing the Power [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stone]], an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb.\n\nQuill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the ''Dark Aster'', Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the ''Dark Aster'' at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the ''Dark Aster'' with the ''Milano''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath and Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the ''Dark Aster''. The damaged ''Dark Aster'' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt ''Milano'' along with a potted sapling [[Cutting (plant)|cut]] from Groot, which grows into a baby version of him.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Cosmo the Spacedog]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /><ref name=\"Green\" />}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Guardians cast.jpg|150|526|The cast of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character.\"<ref name=\"GunnIGNFeb2014\" /> Regarding the limited words used by Groot, Diesel said in many ways this was, \"... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do.\"<ref name=\"TheMovieNetwork\"/> Diesel found an emotional note in his performance, invoking the death of his friend and ''[[The Fast and the Furious|Fast and Furious]]'' co-star [[Paul Walker]], saying, \"This was in December [2013], and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice.\"<ref name=\"DieselGrootDeath\" /> Groot's form and size-changing abilities are seen, with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg2\" />\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket<!-- CREDITED ONLY AS \"Rocket\" PER OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS! -->]]: <br />A genetically-engineered [[raccoon]]-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Cooper\" /> Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was \"not a cartoon character\", saying, \"It's not [[Bugs Bunny]] in the middle of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine.\"<ref name=\"GunnRocket\" /> Gunn also based the character on himself.<ref name=\"RocketGrootInfluence\" /> Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, \"I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of [[Joe Pesci]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]'' guy.\"<ref name=\"Cooper2\" /> Cooper voiced Rocket, while [[Sean Gunn]] (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /> James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators,<ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /> though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Sean noted they \"kind of stumbled\" into the process of him performing on set since they \"weren't sure how we were going to create that character\". The same process would continue to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket.<ref name=\"SeanGunnSept2018\" /> Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance \"the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny.

On the character, Rooker said, he has \"some interesting issues\u2014not a good guy, not a bad guy. There's hope and there's a heart inside Yondu.\" Gunn created the film's version of the character specifically with Rooker in mind, while borrowing the character's mohawk and use of a whistle-controlled arrow from the comics.

She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason.\"<ref name=\"2013NovGillan\" /> She also added, \"I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of [[sibling rivalry]]. That's the most interesting aspect to me, because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter, and ugly. And she's a total sadist, so that's fun too.\"<ref name=\"GillanCBR\" /> Gillan researched the ancient [[Sparta]]ns, shaved off her hair, and trained for two months for the role.<ref name=\"GillanCBR\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> The character's makeup took approximately four-and-a-half hours to be applied.<ref name=\"GillanCBR\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" /> ally of Ronan who is a feared intergalactic hunter.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /> As to why he took the role Hounsou said, \"I have a four-year old son who loves superheroes from [[Spider-Man]] to [[Iron Man]] to [[Batman]].

I think they've been revamped recently in a fun way in the [comic] book.\"<ref name=\"2010SDCCFeige\" /> Feige reiterated that sentiment in a September 2011 issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', saying, \"There's an opportunity to do a big space epic, which ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' sort of hints at, in the cosmic side\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Feige added, should the film be made, it would feature an ensemble of characters, similar to ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"2011SeptEW\" />\n\nFeige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He said the film's titular team would consist of the characters [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Star-Lord]], [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]], and [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]].<ref name=\"2012SDCCPanel\" /> Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team.<ref name=\"2012SDCCArt\" /> In August 2012, [[James Gunn]] entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including future MCU directors [[Peyton Reed]] and the duo [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]].<ref name=\"2012AugGunn\" /> ''The Avengers'' director [[Joss Whedon]], who signed a deal to creatively consult on all of the films leading up to [[Avengers: Age of Ultron|''The Avengers'' sequel]],<ref name=\"2012AugWhedon\" /> was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying \"James [Gunn] is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon ... He has a very twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's going to be hard for [the human characters] to keep up.\"<ref name=\"2012SepWhedon\" />\n\n====Writing====\n[[Nicole Perlman]], who was enrolled in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009,<ref name=\"Screenplay\" /> was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on.<ref name=\"Perlman3\" /> Out of those, Perlman chose [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]'s ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', due to her interest in space and science fiction,<ref name=\"Perlman3\" /> adding, \"I think [Marvel] were a little taken aback when I chose ''Guardians'', because there were ones that would make a lot more sense if you were a romantic-comedy writer or something like that.\" Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the ''Guardians'' universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft, before Gunn was brought in<!--not a mistake--> in early 2012 to contribute to the script.<ref name=\"Perlman\" /> Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because \"it didn't work\" for him; he would use the film ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel.<ref name=\"2014JulGunn\" /> Gunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no [[Walkman]]; he stated, \"In Nicole's script everything is pretty different ... it's not about the same stuff. But that's how the [[Writers Guild of America, West|WGA]] works.

He felt that \"having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to ''Guardians of the Galaxy'',\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan.\" To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos' vizier, saying, \"I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn't work so much.\"<ref name=\"GunnVultureThanos\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn September 2012, Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script.<ref name=\"2012SepGunn\" /> By the end of November, [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Jack Huston]], [[Jim Sturgess]], and [[Eddie Redmayne]] signed deals to test for the role of [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], as did [[Lee Pace]],<ref name=\"2012NovTestDeals\" /> which he confirmed a week later in early December.<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> Other actors who were considered for the role included ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''{{'}}s [[Zachary Levi]],<ref name=\"2012Dec21Quill\" /> [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]],<ref name=\"2013JanJGL\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]],<ref name=\"2013JanRosenbaum\" /> and [[John Gallagher Jr.]]<ref name=\"GallagherStarLord\" /> [[Chris Pratt]] was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /><ref name=\"2013FebPratt\" />\n\n[[File:James Gunn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gunn promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn January 2013, filming was scheduled to take place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London, United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /> and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in [[3D film|3D]].<ref name=\"2013Jan3D\" /> Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June.

It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the other side of that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time.\" Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space.<ref name=\"2013MarchSFX\" /> In mid-March, [[Dave Bautista]] was signed to play [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> Other actors who had been considered for the role included [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and [[Jason Momoa]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> By the following week, sculptor [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]], who sculpted [[Darth Vader]]'s mask for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, was revealed to be working on the film.<ref name=\"2013MarchMuir\" />\n\nIn early April 2013, [[Zoe Saldana]] entered into negotiations to star as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] in the film, and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilSaldana\" /> Also in April, [[Michael Rooker]] joined the film's cast as [[Yondu]],<ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> and it was announced that [[Ophelia Lovibond]] had been cast in a supporting role.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /> By this point in time, [[Lee Pace]] was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film.<ref name=\"2013AprilPace\" /> In May, Marvel offered [[John C.

He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set.\" White was careful not to use \"modern\" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens.<ref name=\"WhiteMakeup\" /> For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create \"a colorful science-fiction world\", and include elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter.<ref name=\"GunnDesign\" /> Science fiction artist [[Chris Foss]] inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.<ref name=\"ChrisFoss\" /> The ''[[Mass Effect]]'' video game series, [[Flash Gordon]], ''[[Farscape]]'', and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were primary inspirations for Gunn on the film.<ref name=\"GunnInspirations\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began around July 6, 2013 in [[London]], United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> under the working title of ''Full Tilt''.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg1\" /> Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and [[Longcross Studios]].<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /><ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Later in July, Gunn and the film's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], del Toro as [[Collector (comics)|The Collector]], and that [[Djimon Hounsou]] had been cast as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]].<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Close was later revealed to play [[Nova Corps#Known members|Nova Prime Irani Rael]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Also at San Diego Comic-Con, Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the \"mastermind\".<ref name=\"2013JulyFeige\" /> On August 11, 2013, filming began at London's [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]],<ref name=\"Entertainmentwise\" /> which was selected as a double for [[Xandar]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" /> In August 2013, Marvel announced that [[Bradley Cooper]] would voice Rocket.<ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /> On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was \"a little over half[way]\" complete.<ref name=\"2013SeptMTV\" /> Also in September, [[Vin Diesel]] stated that he was voicing Groot.<ref name=\"DieselConfirm\" /> However, Marvel did not confirm Diesel's involvement in the film at the time.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /><ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /><ref name=\"HuffingtonPostOct2013\" /> On October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.<ref name=\"FilmingEnding\" />\n\n[[Director of photography]] [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] used [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] cameras for the film, saying, \"I'm traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa [provided] the right look for this particular film.\" During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they \"had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something.\" Davis used spherical [[Panavision]] Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene.<ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.<ref name=\"DavisInterview2\" />\n\nGunn revealed that his brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors, including Saldana, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and his on-set performances.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Special effects makeup designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects, with White saying, \"it gives [the filmmakers] a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices.\"<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in \"slightly over the agreed budget\" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government.<ref name=\"ActualBudget\" /> It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget.<ref name=\"Tracking\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production, saying, \"Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effects ... I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful.\"<ref name=\"GunnEffects\" /> After the release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', Feige stated that the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]] would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU.<ref name=\"InfinityStones\" /> In a separate interview for ''The Dark World'' in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film,<ref name=\"SlashFilmNov2013\" /> referred to as the \"Power Stone\" by the Collector.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /><ref name=\"IBPowerStone\" /> The [[mid-credits scene]] in ''The Dark World'' revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's slave, later named Carina.<ref name=\"2014AprilLovibond\" /> In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.<ref name=\"DieselMarvelOfficial\" />\n\nA few weeks of additional filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming\" /><ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming2\" /><ref name=\"SaldanaAddnlFilming\" /> In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the \"head of the snake\" in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture.<ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an \"enormous\" amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date.<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" /> Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, \"We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces the alien race [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]], who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the [[Badoon]], as the Badoon film rights belonged to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" />\n\nBy the end of May, [[Josh Brolin]] was revealed as the voice of Thanos,<ref name=\"ThanosCast\" /><ref name=\"BrolinThanos\" /> with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /> Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /> In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into ''Avengers'' films in the future.\"<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /> On casting Brolin, Feige said,\n\n<blockquote>We reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of ''Avengers''. Then we shot him and recorded for it.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film.<ref name=\"GotGComplete\" /> In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve [[Howard the Duck]] when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,<ref name=\"GunnHowardDuck\" /> a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Baby Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out and missing this thing\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. Sarofsky developed a custom [[typeface]] based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery.

MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections\u2014trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place\u2014trying to make them strange and look more human.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nOne of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\" to control the movements of thick sections of fur.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nIn order to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)}}\nIn August 2013, Gunn revealed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"[[Hooked on a Feeling]]\", on a mixtape in Quill's [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer6\" /> In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were \"cultural reference points\", saying, \"It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" />\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for all of the top hits of the '70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar\u2014ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house\u2014sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" /> Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" />\n\nThree albums were released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 29, 2014: The film's score, ''Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)'', which features the music composed by Bates for the film;<ref name=\"Score\" /> ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]'', which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" /> By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixChart\" /> Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants.

The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and ''Guardians'' depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat.\" He also felt that Close, Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film.<ref name=\"APReview\" /> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said, \"In place of wit, ''Guardians'' offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening\u2013and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it.\"<ref name=\"SFChronicleReview\" /> Kyle Smith of the ''[[New

villains, soundtrack, lack of suspense, and the characters of Quill, Rocket, and Drax.<ref name=\"NYPostReview\" /> The film received mixed reviews in China, where viewers complained that the film's

In the film, [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]] and a group of extraterrestrial criminals go on the run after stealing a powerful artifact.\n\nPerlman began working on the screenplay in 2009. Producer [[Kevin Feige]] first publicly mentioned ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' as a potential film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at the July 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. Gunn was hired to write and direct the film that September. In February 2013, Pratt was hired to play Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the supporting cast members were subsequently confirmed. [[Principal photography]] began in July 2013 at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England, with filming continuing in London before wrapping up in October 2013. In addition to an original score by [[Tyler Bates]], the film's soundtrack includes several popular songs from the 1960s and 1970s chosen by Gunn.

Twenty-six years later on the abandoned planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious orb but is attacked by [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], a subordinate to the fanatical [[Kree]] militant, [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] after the orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the orb on [[Xandar]], capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and the tree-like humanoid [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. [[Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]], attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Thanos and Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the orb to the Collector [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan]], Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the ''Milano''.\n\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to [[Knowhere]], a remote lawless outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing the Power [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stone]], an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb.\n\nQuill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the ''Dark Aster'', Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the ''Dark Aster'' at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the ''Dark Aster'' with the ''Milano''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath and Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the ''Dark Aster''. The damaged ''Dark Aster'' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt ''Milano'' along with a potted sapling [[Cutting (plant)|cut]] from Groot, which grows into a baby version of him.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Cosmo the Spacedog]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /><ref name=\"Green\" />}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Guardians cast.jpg|150|526|The cast of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Pratt had lost weight to portray fit characters in films such as ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and had given up ambitions to play the lead role in action films after humbling auditions for ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. Casting director Sarah Finn suggested Pratt to Gunn, who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast that role. Despite this, Finn arranged for a meeting between the two, at which point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role. Pratt also won over Feige, despite having gained weight again for ''[[Delivery Man (film)|Delivery Man]]''.<ref name=\"EWJuly2014\" /> Prior to filming, Pratt underwent a strict diet and training regimen to lose {{convert|60|lb}} in six months.<ref name=\"PrattWeight\" /> Pratt signed a multi-film contract with Marvel,<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /> and was granted a temporary leave from his work on ''Parks and Recreation'' in order to accommodate his participation in the film.<ref name=\"ParksandRec\" /> [[Wyatt Oleff]] portrays a young Quill.<ref name=\"TimeReview\" />\n* [[Zoe Saldana]] as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]]: <br />An orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes.

Just the simple things that we have in common. Simple things like the tattoos, the tragedy\u2014because, you know, I had a bit of tragedy in my life as well. So it's really easy for me to pull from that.\" Bautista also said that there was \"a lot of comic relief to Drax\", but the character was not aware of it. Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role, because \"Luckily, for me, I'm a lifelong athlete and I adapted real quick.\"<ref name=\"2014Bautista\" /> Bautista's makeup took approximately four hours to apply, though it could be removed in just 90 minutes.<ref name=\"ColliderMay2014\" /> Drax has various scarring patterns on his body, which replace the simple tattoos from the comics, each having a specific story. Additionally, his skin tone was changed from the bright green in the comics to a muddier grey, to avoid visual similarities to the [[Hulk]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" />\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]: <br />A tree-like humanoid<ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /> who is the accomplice of Rocket.

He's caught up in Rocket's life, really.\" Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot took \"the better part of a year\" to create.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer3\" /> Gunn added, \"The ways in which Vin Diesel says, 'I am Groot,' I am astounded. All of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very good at all ... Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks, and he's a perfectionist.

It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character.\"<ref name=\"GunnIGNFeb2014\" /> Regarding the limited words used by Groot, Diesel said in many ways this was, \"... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do.\"<ref name=\"TheMovieNetwork\"/> Diesel found an emotional note in his performance, invoking the death of his friend and ''[[The Fast and the Furious|Fast and Furious]]'' co-star [[Paul Walker]], saying, \"This was in December [2013], and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice.\"<ref name=\"DieselGrootDeath\" /> Groot's form and size-changing abilities are seen, with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg2\" />\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket<!-- CREDITED ONLY AS \"Rocket\" PER OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS! -->]]: <br />A genetically-engineered [[raccoon]]-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Cooper\" /> Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was \"not a cartoon character\", saying, \"It's not [[Bugs Bunny]] in the middle of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine.\"<ref name=\"GunnRocket\" /> Gunn also based the character on himself.<ref name=\"RocketGrootInfluence\" /> Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, \"I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of [[Joe Pesci]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]'' guy.\"<ref name=\"Cooper2\" /> Cooper voiced Rocket, while [[Sean Gunn]] (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /> James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators,<ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /> though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Sean noted they \"kind of stumbled\" into the process of him performing on set since they \"weren't sure how we were going to create that character\". The same process would continue to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket.<ref name=\"SeanGunnSept2018\" /> Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance \"the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny.

He has a very sick and twisted view of what morality is; strength is virtue and weakness is sin and that is what he lives by, and I think he is very scary because of his beliefs, which are real to him.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> Pace, who originally auditioned for Peter Quill,<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> described Ronan as a \"psycho\" and a \"monster\".<ref name=\"PaceOctober2013\" />\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]: <br />A blue-skinned bandit who is the leader of the Ravagers and a paternal figure to Quill.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> Yondu helps Quill to steal the orb before Quill betrays him, leaving Yondu and the Ravagers to chase the Guardians. On the character, Rooker said, he has \"some interesting issues\u2014not a good guy, not a bad guy.

What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of [[sibling rivalry]].

But that's how the [[Writers Guild of America, West|WGA]] works. They like first writers an awful lot.\"<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\" /> In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script,<ref name=\"2012AugMcCoy\" /> however, it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script, since he did not receive production credit.<ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" />\n\nGunn revealed that character introductions were the \"hardest scenes to crack\", with Thanos' introduction being the most difficult. He felt that \"having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to ''Guardians of the Galaxy'',\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan.\" To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos' vizier, saying, \"I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn't work so much.\"<ref name=\"GunnVultureThanos\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn September 2012, Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script.<ref name=\"2012SepGunn\" /> By the end of November, [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Jack Huston]], [[Jim Sturgess]], and [[Eddie Redmayne]] signed deals to test for the role of [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], as did [[Lee Pace]],<ref name=\"2012NovTestDeals\" /> which he confirmed a week later in early December.<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> Other actors who were considered for the role included ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''{{'}}s [[Zachary Levi]],<ref name=\"2012Dec21Quill\" /> [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]],<ref name=\"2013JanJGL\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]],<ref name=\"2013JanRosenbaum\" /> and [[John Gallagher Jr.]]<ref name=\"GallagherStarLord\" /> [[Chris Pratt]] was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /><ref name=\"2013FebPratt\" />\n\n[[File:James Gunn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gunn promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn January 2013, filming was scheduled to take place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London, United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /> and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in [[3D film|3D]].<ref name=\"2013Jan3D\" /> Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created through a combination of CGI and motion capture, going on to say that \"You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon\u2014they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do [[rotoscoping|rotomation]], probably, for some of the behavior ... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where he wants to take the characters.\"<ref name=\"2013FebAlonso\" /> In March 2013, Feige discussed ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"It's much more of a [[Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|standalone]] film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the other side of that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time.\" Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space.<ref name=\"2013MarchSFX\" /> In mid-March, [[Dave Bautista]] was signed to play [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> Other actors who had been considered for the role included [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and [[Jason Momoa]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> By the following week, sculptor [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]], who sculpted [[Darth Vader]]'s mask for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, was revealed to be working on the film.<ref name=\"2013MarchMuir\" />\n\nIn early April 2013, [[Zoe Saldana]] entered into negotiations to star as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] in the film, and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilSaldana\" /> Also in April, [[Michael Rooker]] joined the film's cast as [[Yondu]],<ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> and it was announced that [[Ophelia Lovibond]] had been cast in a supporting role.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /> By this point in time, [[Lee Pace]] was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film.<ref name=\"2013AprilPace\" /> In May, Marvel offered [[John C.

White said, \"James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set.\" White was careful not to use \"modern\" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens.<ref name=\"WhiteMakeup\" /> For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create \"a colorful science-fiction world\", and include elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter.<ref name=\"GunnDesign\" /> Science fiction artist [[Chris Foss]] inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.<ref name=\"ChrisFoss\" /> The ''[[Mass Effect]]'' video game series, [[Flash Gordon]], ''[[Farscape]]'', and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were primary inspirations for Gunn on the film.<ref name=\"GunnInspirations\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began around July 6, 2013 in [[London]], United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> under the working title of ''Full Tilt''.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg1\" /> Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and [[Longcross Studios]].<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /><ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Later in July, Gunn and the film's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], del Toro as [[Collector (comics)|The Collector]], and that [[Djimon Hounsou]] had been cast as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]].<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Close was later revealed to play [[Nova Corps#Known members|Nova Prime Irani Rael]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Also at San Diego Comic-Con, Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the \"mastermind\".<ref name=\"2013JulyFeige\" /> On August 11, 2013, filming began at London's [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]],<ref name=\"Entertainmentwise\" /> which was selected as a double for [[Xandar]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" /> In August 2013, Marvel announced that [[Bradley Cooper]] would voice Rocket.<ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /> On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was \"a little over half[way]\" complete.<ref name=\"2013SeptMTV\" /> Also in September, [[Vin Diesel]] stated that he was voicing Groot.<ref name=\"DieselConfirm\" /> However, Marvel did not confirm Diesel's involvement in the film at the time.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /><ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /><ref name=\"HuffingtonPostOct2013\" /> On October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.<ref name=\"FilmingEnding\" />\n\n[[Director of photography]] [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] used [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] cameras for the film, saying, \"I'm traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa [provided] the right look for this particular film.\" During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they \"had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something.\" Davis used spherical [[Panavision]] Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene.<ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.<ref name=\"DavisInterview2\" />\n\nGunn revealed that his brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors, including Saldana, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and his on-set performances.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Special effects makeup designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects, with White saying, \"it gives [the filmmakers] a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices.\"<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in \"slightly over the agreed budget\" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government.<ref name=\"ActualBudget\" /> It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget.<ref name=\"Tracking\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production, saying, \"Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effects ... I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful.\"<ref name=\"GunnEffects\" /> After the release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', Feige stated that the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]] would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU.<ref name=\"InfinityStones\" /> In a separate interview for ''The Dark World'' in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film,<ref name=\"SlashFilmNov2013\" /> referred to as the \"Power Stone\" by the Collector.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /><ref name=\"IBPowerStone\" /> The [[mid-credits scene]] in ''The Dark World'' revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's slave, later named Carina.<ref name=\"2014AprilLovibond\" /> In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.<ref name=\"DieselMarvelOfficial\" />\n\nA few weeks of additional filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming\" /><ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming2\" /><ref name=\"SaldanaAddnlFilming\" /> In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the \"head of the snake\" in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture.<ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an \"enormous\" amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date.<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" /> Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, \"We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces the alien race [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]], who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the [[Badoon]], as the Badoon film rights belonged to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" />\n\nBy the end of May, [[Josh Brolin]] was revealed as the voice of Thanos,<ref name=\"ThanosCast\" /><ref name=\"BrolinThanos\" /> with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /> Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /> In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into ''Avengers'' films in the future.\"<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /> On casting Brolin, Feige said,\n\n<blockquote>We reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of ''Avengers''. Then we shot him and recorded for it.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film.<ref name=\"GotGComplete\" /> In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve [[Howard the Duck]] when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,<ref name=\"GunnHowardDuck\" /> a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Baby Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out and missing this thing\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. Sarofsky developed a custom [[typeface]] based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout the film.<ref name=\"Sarofsky\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n|align     = right\n|direction = vertical\n|footer            = The [[Gardens by the Bay]] (top) in [[Singapore]] helped inspire the look of the planet Xandar (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n|width     = 200\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n|image1    = Gardens by the Bay South viewed from Sands Sky Park, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore.jpg\n|width1    =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n|image2    = Xandar.jpg\n|width2    = \n}}\n\nThe film featured 2,750 visual effects shots,<ref name=\"VFXShots\" /> which make up approximately 90% of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The visual effects were created by: [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), who worked on creating Groot, as well as Morag, Xandar, the ''Dark Aster'' and the final battle on Xandar;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Framestore]], who worked on creating Rocket, extending the Kyln prison set and constructing Knowhere;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"FramestoreRocket\" /> [[Luma Pictures]], who worked on Thanos;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Method Studios]], who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers, as well as the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Lola VFX; Cantina Creative; [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], who worked on Howard the Duck and creating the ''Dark Aster'' shots with MPC;<ref name=\"Corlett\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> CoSA VFX; Secret Lab; Rise Visual Effects Studios; and Technicolor VFX.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"MethodVFX\" /> Pre- and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor, with Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nProducer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it provided references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections\u2014trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place\u2014trying to make them strange and look more human.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nOne of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\" to control the movements of thick sections of fur.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nIn order to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)}}\nIn August 2013, Gunn revealed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"[[Hooked on a Feeling]]\", on a mixtape in Quill's [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer6\" /> In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were \"cultural reference points\", saying, \"It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" />\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for all of the top hits of the '70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar\u2014ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house\u2014sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" /> Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" />\n\nThree albums were released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 29, 2014: The film's score, ''Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)'', which features the music composed by Bates for the film;<ref name=\"Score\" /> ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]'', which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" /> By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixChart\" /> Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' noted that the quick release of the scene from Marvel two weeks after the film's theatrical release, along with the rush announcement from Funko, indicated the popularity of both the character and the scene.<ref name=\"THRBabyGroot\" /> The scene also produced the word \"grooting\", coined by Michael Rooker, in which a person dances similar to Groot, with the word entering the social media [[lexicon]].<ref name=\"Grooting\" /> Also in August, Marvel held a special screening of the film at [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]], where Pratt dressed as Star-Lord to entertain the patients.<ref name=\"ChildrensHospitalScreening\" />\n\n===Merchandise===\nIn June 2012, Marvel filed eleven [[trademark]] applications for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', covering a variety of [[consumer product]]s, from [[video game]]s to [[cosmetics]].<ref name=\"2012TMApps\" /> [[Disney Consumer Products]] partnered with Mad Engine, C-Life, [[New Era Cap Company|New Era]], [[Hasbro]], Disguise, Rubies, [[Sideshow Collectibles]], [[Lego]], KIDdesigns, [[iHome]], [[Funko]], Freeze, Fast Forward, and Innovative Designs to produce merchandise for the film, with releases starting in June 2014.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /><ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /><ref name=\"LegoSets\" /><ref name=\"LegoSets2\" /> Mad Engine and C-Life were partnered as the core apparel outfitters, producing a line of T-shirts and fleece jackets, while New Era produced headwear and hats.<ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /> Hasbro produced toys for the film; Disguise and Rubies produced the costumes; and [[Sideshow Collectibles]] was given charge of the collectibles.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /><ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /> Lego announced three toy sets based on scenes from the film,<ref name=\"LegoSets\" /> while iHome created character speakers, Funko made vinyl [[bobblehead]]s, Freeze crafted 1980s-inspired apparel, and backpacks and stationery were made by Fast Forward and Innovative Designs.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /> Despite first films in a potential new franchise usually being off-limits to licensees, Marvel used ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''{{'}}s success as evidence of unknown characters becoming hits with audiences to attract partnerships. Licensees embraced Rocket as the film's potential breakout character, with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics; Star-Lord's obsession with 1980s nostalgia, including his \"Awesome Mix Vo. 1\" cassette, has also served as a basis for tie-in products.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /> In August 2014, Funko announced a toy based on \"Dancing Groot\",<ref name=\"THRBabyGroot\" /> while in October 2014, Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing Groot, for release in December 2014.<ref name=\"KIDDancingGroot\" />\n\nIn December 2014, Disney made a second marketing push, to coincide with the film's home media release with additional merchandise.
