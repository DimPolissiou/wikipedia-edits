Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167}} NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change. In 2007, NASA engineers devised a solution so Space Shuttle flights could cross the year-end boundary.<ref name=\"YERO\">{{cite web |last=Bergin |first=Chris |title=NASA solves YERO problem for Shuttle |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5026 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418182718/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5026 |archivedate=April 18, 2008 |date= February 19, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2007}}</ref>\n\nSpace Shuttle missions typically brought a portable general support computer (PGSC) that could integrate with the orbiter vehicle's computers and communication suite, as well as monitor scientific and payload data.

It was {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long and {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} wide, and could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured the in the payload bay to the attachment points on the [[longeron]]s.  The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|62\u201364}}\n\nThe orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission.

The RMS was built by the Canadian company [[Spar Aerospace]], and was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter's flight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm.  The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}, which was later improved to {{convert|586000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|384\u2013385}}\n\n=====Spacelab=====\n{{main|Spacelab}}\n[[File:STS-9 Spacelab 1.jpg|thumb|[[Spacelab]] in orbit on [[STS-9]]]]\n\nThe Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit.  The Spacelab module contained two {{convert|9|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} segments that were mounted in the aft end of the payload bay to maintain the center of gravity during flight.

The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}.

During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, , which reduced the chamber pressue to {{convert|3010|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, as it had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area.

In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|72\u201373}} During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to {{convert|3000|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, but had to keep the orbiter vehicle's aluminum skin temperature below {{convert|350|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The TPS primarily consisted of four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above {{convert|2300|F|C|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and were protected by reinforced carbon-carbon tiles (RCC).  Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from [[space debris|micrometeoroid and orbital debris]], and were further improved after RCC damage caused of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' disaster]].

The LOX tank was housed in the nose of the external tank, and was {{convert|49.3|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The LH<sub>2</sub> comprised the bulk of the external tank, and was {{convert|96.7|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} tall. The orbiter vehicle was attached to the external tank at two umbilical plates, which contained five propellant and two electrical umbilicals, and forward and aft structural attachments. The exterior of the external tank was covered in orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of ascent.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|421\u2013422}}\n\nThe external tank provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoff until main engine cutoff.  The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracts its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords are sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments are sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|422}}\n\nFor the first two missions, STS-1 and [[STS-2]], the external tank was covered in {{convert|595|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of white Fire-Retardant Latex to provide further thermal insulation, but was determined to be unnecessary and removed, increasing the overall payload capacity.<ref name=\"aerospaceweb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/spacecraft/q0285.shtml |title=Space Shuttle External Tank Foam Insulation |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |publisher=Aerospaceweb.org |year=2006 |author=Aerospaceweb.org}}</ref> A light-weight tank (LWT) was first flown on STS-6, which reduced tank weight by {{convert|10300|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=toba>{{cite book |last1=Sivolella |first1=Davide |title=To Orbit and Back Again |date=2012 |publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-0982-3 |page=165}}</ref> The LWT's weight was reduced by removing components from the LH<sub>2</sub> tank and reducing the thickness of some skin panels.

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011.

In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters.

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services.

NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167}} NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013372}} The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|372\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233}} The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|405\u2013408}} The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change.

It was {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long and {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} wide, and could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us}} in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured the in the payload bay to the attachment points on the [[longeron]]s.  The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|62\u201364}}\n\nThe orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission.

The RMS was built by the Canadian company [[Spar Aerospace]], and was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter's flight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom, and had six joints located at three points along the arm.  The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}, which was later improved to {{convert|586000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|384\u2013385}}\n\n=====Spacelab=====\n{{main|Spacelab}}\n[[File:STS-9 Spacelab 1.jpg|thumb|[[Spacelab]] in orbit on [[STS-9]]]]\n\nThe Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit.  The Spacelab module contained two {{convert|9|ft|m|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} segments that were mounted in the aft end of the payload bay to maintain the center of gravity during flight.

The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|bar|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}.

During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust.

It is located in the [[Vale of White Horse]] near the [[River Thames]], across the road from the twelfth-century [[Norman architecture|Norman]] Hall and the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor House]]. The Abbey has been recognised by the [[Historic buildings council|Historic Building Council for England]] (now [[Historic England]]) as a building of outstanding historic and [[architecture|architectural]] interest.<ref name=abbeyarchives>The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay archives.</ref> It is considered to be a \u2018textbook\u2019 example of an English medieval [[manor house]]{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} and has been a [[listed building#Grade I|Grade I-listed]] building since 1952.<ref name=listed />\n\nThe Abbey has its origins in the thirteenth century as a [[clergy house|rectory]] of [[Abingdon Abbey]], a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] up north in [[Abingdon-on-Thames]]. Several construction phases took place during the Middle Ages, carried out by prominent figures like [[Solomon of Rochester]], [[Thomas Beckington]] and [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], but it wasn't until the seventeenth century that the current plan was completed.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}} It was probably during the [[Victorian era]] that the house obtained the name 'The Abbey'.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> From 1495 to 1867, The Abbey was in possession of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]], who leased the estate among others to [[John Fettiplace (politician died 1580)|John Fettiplace]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAfter being inhabited by [[Evelyn St. Croix Fleming]], the estate was bought by [[David Astor]] in 1958, who leased it to the [[Ockenden International|Ockenden Venture]] which offered sanctuary to refugees and displaced children. In the 70s, The Abbey was lent to the exiled Bishop [[Colin Winter]] to house the [[Namibia International Peace Centre]]. In 1978, the [[Astor family]] sold the house and in 1980 it came into possession of The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] led by Dr. [[Fred Blum]] and Bishop [[Stephen Verney]].<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The New Era Centre used The Abbey as a [[retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] and conference centre, and changed its name to '''The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay''' in the 1990s.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> \n\nThe Abbey, Sutton Courtenay is a residential centre in which a [[spiritualism|spiritual]] community offers hospitality to people who are seeking spiritual refreshment, [[personal development|personal growth]] and [[healing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=278687&subid=0|title=The Abbey Sutton Courtenay Limited|website=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> The Abbey also organises public events concerning spirituality, personal development, education, music and the arts.<ref name=abingdon />\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Plan_of_The_Abbey,_Sutton_Courtenay.png|thumb|A plan of the main building (ground floor).]]\nThe Abbey forms a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with an inner [[courtyard]]. It has 28 rooms and a [[great hall]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The building has two storeys and has clay roof tiles on a structure made with stone and timber. Originally, it had a thatched roof. Four ranges are arranged around the central courtyard. The oldest still surviving parts of The Abbey are the north and west ranges, the frames of which were originally from wood, parts of which were later encased in stone in order to stabilise the structure.\n\nNowadays, there is also a guest house which is used for customers, conference guests and visitors. It is adjacent to the main house and it has its own kitchen with a dining area. In total, the guest house has nine rooms, of which five are twin rooms and four single.<ref name=abbeystaying>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/staying-at-the-abbey/|title=Staying at The Abbey|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, The Abbey's main entrance to was through a rear door of the passage separating the service wing from the great hall. Nowadays, the main entrance is on the east side with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arch, a 1980s insertion replacing a narrow door, leading to the courtyard.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}}\n\nNineteenth-century accounts of the site show many inaccuracies.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Edward Blore]] made sketches of the interior of the hall and of the house as seen from the northwest, which served as the basis of the engravings published by [[John Henry Parker]] in 1853.{{sfn|Parker|1853|p=272}} Parker also published a plan, but this was inaccurate in detail.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Peter Spencer Spokes]] and John M.

The wing is largely timber-framed. On the ground floor at the southwest end, the wing seems to incorporate a stone wall of an earlier structure, in which lateral chimney stacks have been built with fire places dating from the nineteenth century. The plastered stone wall on the south side, which is of timber above the first floor, is an underbuilding for an [[overhang (architecture)|overhang]]. The north wall consists of large [[ashlar]] blocks suggesting that that was done between the fifteenth and seventeenth century and it had a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] window. Its timber-framed north wall is also the south wall of the great hall. The [[dormer]] roof between the truss of the great hall and the service wing is done in a thirteenth-century technique. The roof of the service wing itself, however, is post-medieval.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} Today, the service wing houses accommodation and a [[solitary confinement|meditation room]].<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nThe great hall was originally timber-framed and integrated with the contemporary service wing. It was cased in stone between 1320 and 1340 to prevent deforming of the base crucks under [[shear stress]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} The hall has two equal [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and the four two-light windows have been replaced in the twentieth century by three-light Perpendicular windows. The stonework of the northern doorway was largely renewed in the nineteenth century. It has wave-moulded [[jamb]]s, [[voussoir]]s and an [[ogee]]-scroll [[hood mould]]. The original southern doorway was less important and similar in style, but with [[chamfer]]ed jambs. The east wall abuts the north range with a straight joint, while the joint of the north range with the west wall is obscured by plaster. The doorway in the east wall has been rebuilt in brick.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} The west wall of the hall is [[battlement|castellated]] and probably early nineteenth century.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The great hall survives open to the roof, with one cruck truss carrying a [[king post]] which is unique in that a ceiling has never hidden it.<ref name=abbeyhistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/history/|title=The Abbey - 800 Years of History|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref> The workmanship of the timber structure is of exceptional quality. The main timbers are made from very large trees carefully sawn to avoid waney edges.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=231}} All four posts have been made from the same tree. The structure has nineteenth- and twentieth-century renovations.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} It has a wooden floor and can accommodate up to sixty people seated.<ref name=abbeystaying />\n\n=== North range ===\n[[File:Library, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay 01.jpg|thumb|The library.]]\nIn the courtyard between the north and west range is a timber-framed staircase outshut, dating from before the stone casing of the early fourteenth century. The stair is modern and leads to a door on the first floor of the north range. The outshut roof was probably repaired in the seventeenth century with an inserted [[purlin]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe northern range is roofed in six bays. The western three bays were originally also built in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, while the eastern three bays of the northern range have timber work in the roof that indicates a fifteenth-century date.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe finish of the timbers of the three western bays in the north range is of inferior quality to that of the hall. On the ground floor was a [[parlour]] now used as a dining room, located under the two most western bays. The walls of this parlour vary in size. The west wall contains a three-light Perpendicular window, the north wall contains three two-light ones. The present fireplace is modern but there must have been a chimney since the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=234}} East of the parlour, the floor level rises and there is a [[cross passage]]. The door at the north end of the passage became blocked and was reopened only in the 1980s. East to the passage, under the third bay from the west, is a lodged floor. Originally, the bay was divided in a room to the north and a narrow room or corridor to the south.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}} The first floor originally served as a [[great chamber]], the second most important room in a medieval English manor house. This chamber was entered through a door from the staircase outshut. It is dominated by two fourteenth-century two-light [[transom (architecture)|transom]] windows in the west [[gable]] and in the north wall. The reveals of a third window also remain in the north wall.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The present fireplace has [[musician]] [[corbel]]s from the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Wood |1965 |p=XVIIE (plate)}} The roof structure was similar to the open roof of the great hall until probably the seventeenth century, when the room was separated into two rooms, with a corridor on the south side of the eastern room. These rooms now serve as the library and dining room respectively.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\n[[File:Solar, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The [[solar (room)|solar]].]]\nOn the ground floor of the three eastern bays, the third bay from the east was probably open to the roof and is nowadays part of the same room with the third bay from the west (the room east of the parlour). It has a small [[lancet window]] in the northern wall at the base of the chimney. The two eastern most bays formed one room and has a modern partition from a corridor to the south. The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace. There may have been a partition in the middle of the room before the fireplace was built. The solar has a partition to the east behind which was a [[chapel]] and a door from the north to the east range.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}}\n\n=== East range ===\n[[File:Arch, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|East entrance looking into the courtyard.]]\nToday, the east range holds the entrance archway. It was constructed around 1500 and contains three bays. The modern gatehouse, at the northern end of the east range, has a lancet window in its east wall. It has a jettied wooden frame upper part standing on stone walls.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> \n\nSouth of the archway, the wall was timber framed but later partially infilled with brick and rubble as far as the chimney, where it abuts the south range.

Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory.

It is located in the [[Vale of White Horse]] near the [[River Thames]], across the road from the twelfth-century [[Norman architecture|Norman]] Hall and the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor House]]. The Abbey has been recognised by the [[Historic buildings council|Historic Building Council for England]] (now [[Historic England]]) as a building of outstanding historic and [[architecture|architectural]] interest.<ref name=abbeyarchives>The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay archives.</ref> It is considered to be a \u2018textbook\u2019 example of an English medieval [[manor house]]{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} and has been a [[listed building#Grade I|Grade I-listed]] building since 1952.<ref name=listed />\n\nThe Abbey has its origins in the thirteenth century as a [[clergy house|rectory]] of [[Abingdon Abbey]], a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] up north in [[Abingdon-on-Thames]]. Several construction phases took place during the Middle Ages, carried out by prominent figures like [[Solomon of Rochester]], [[Thomas Beckington]] and [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], but it wasn't until the seventeenth century that the current plan was completed.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}} It was probably during the [[Victorian era]] that the house obtained the name 'The Abbey'.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> From 1495 to 1867, The Abbey was in possession of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]], who leased the estate among others to [[John Fettiplace (politician died 1580)|John Fettiplace]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAfter being inhabited by [[Evelyn St. Croix Fleming]], the estate was bought by [[David Astor]] in 1958, who leased it to the [[Ockenden International|Ockenden Venture]] which offered sanctuary to refugees and displaced children. In the 70s, The Abbey was lent to the exiled Bishop [[Colin Winter]] to house the [[Namibia International Peace Centre]]. In 1978, the [[Astor family]] sold the house and in 1980 it came into possession of The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] led by Dr. [[Fred Blum]] and Bishop [[Stephen Verney]].<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The New Era Centre used The Abbey as a [[retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] and conference centre, and changed its name to '''The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay''' in the 1990s.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> \n\nThe Abbey, Sutton Courtenay is a residential centre in which a [[spiritualism|spiritual]] community offers hospitality to people who are seeking spiritual refreshment, [[personal development|personal growth]] and [[healing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=278687&subid=0|title=The Abbey Sutton Courtenay Limited|website=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> The Abbey also organises public events concerning spirituality, personal development, education, music and the arts.<ref name=abingdon />\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Plan_of_The_Abbey,_Sutton_Courtenay.png|thumb|A plan of the main building (ground floor).]]\nThe Abbey forms a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with an inner [[courtyard]]. It has 28 rooms and a [[great hall]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The building has two storeys and has clay roof tiles on a structure made with stone and timber. Originally, it had a thatched roof. Four ranges are arranged around the central courtyard. The oldest still surviving parts of The Abbey are the north and west ranges, the frames of which were originally from wood, parts of which were later encased in stone in order to stabilise the structure.\n\nNowadays, there is also a guest house which is used for customers, conference guests and visitors. It is adjacent to the main house and it has its own kitchen with a dining area. In total, the guest house has nine rooms, of which five are twin rooms and four single.<ref name=abbeystaying>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/staying-at-the-abbey/|title=Staying at The Abbey|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, The Abbey's main entrance to was through a rear door of the passage separating the service wing from the great hall. Nowadays, the main entrance is on the east side with a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arch, a 1980s insertion replacing a narrow door, leading to the courtyard.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}}\n\nNineteenth-century accounts of the site show many inaccuracies.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Edward Blore]] made sketches of the interior of the hall and of the house as seen from the northwest, which served as the basis of the engravings published by [[John Henry Parker]] in 1853.{{sfn|Parker|1853|p=272}} Parker also published a plan, but this was inaccurate in detail.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} [[Peter Spencer Spokes]] and John M.

The wing is largely timber-framed. On the ground floor at the southwest end, the wing seems to incorporate a stone wall of an earlier structure, in which lateral chimney stacks have been built with fire places dating from the nineteenth century. The plastered stone wall on the south side, which is of timber above the first floor, is an underbuilding for an [[overhang (architecture)|overhang]]. The north wall consists of large [[ashlar]] blocks suggesting that that was done between the fifteenth and seventeenth century and it had a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] window. Its timber-framed north wall is also the south wall of the great hall. The [[dormer]] roof between the truss of the great hall and the service wing is done in a thirteenth-century technique. The roof of the service wing itself, however, is post-medieval.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} Today, the service wing houses accommodation and a [[solitary confinement|meditation room]].<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nThe great hall was originally timber-framed and integrated with the contemporary service wing. It was cased in stone between 1320 and 1340 to prevent deforming of the base crucks under [[shear stress]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} The hall has two equal [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and the four two-light windows have been replaced in the twentieth century by three-light Perpendicular windows. The stonework of the northern doorway was largely renewed in the nineteenth century. It has wave-moulded [[jamb]]s, [[voussoir]]s and an [[ogee]]-scroll [[hood mould]]. The original southern doorway was less important and similar in style, but with [[chamfer]]ed jambs. The east wall abuts the north range with a straight joint, while the joint of the north range with the west wall is obscured by plaster. The doorway in the east wall has been rebuilt in brick.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} The west wall of the hall is [[battlement|castellated]] and probably early nineteenth century.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The great hall survives open to the roof, with one cruck truss carrying a [[king post]] which is unique in that a ceiling has never hidden it.<ref name=abbeyhistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/history/|title=The Abbey - 800 Years of History|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref> The workmanship of the timber structure is of exceptional quality. The main timbers are made from very large trees carefully sawn to avoid waney edges.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=231}} All four posts have been made from the same tree. The structure has nineteenth- and twentieth-century renovations.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} It has a wooden floor and can accommodate up to sixty people seated.<ref name=abbeystaying />\n\n=== North range ===\n[[File:Library, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay 01.jpg|thumb|The library.]]\nIn the courtyard between the north and west range is a timber-framed staircase outshut, dating from before the stone casing of the early fourteenth century. The stair is modern and leads to a door on the first floor of the north range. The outshut roof was probably repaired in the seventeenth century with an inserted [[purlin]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe northern range is roofed in six bays. The western three bays were originally also built in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, while the eastern three bays of the northern range have timber work in the roof that indicates a fifteenth-century date.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe finish of the timbers of the three western bays in the north range is of inferior quality to that of the hall. On the ground floor was a [[parlour]] now used as a dining room, located under the two most western bays. The walls of this parlour vary in size. The west wall contains a three-light Perpendicular window, the north wall contains three two-light ones. The present fireplace is modern but there must have been a chimney since the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=234}} East of the parlour, the floor level rises and there is a [[cross passage]]. The door at the north end of the passage became blocked and was reopened only in the 1980s. East to the passage, under the third bay from the west, is a lodged floor. Originally, the bay was divided in a room to the north and a narrow room or corridor to the south.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}} The first floor originally served as a [[great chamber]], the second most important room in a medieval English manor house. This chamber was entered through a door from the staircase outshut. It is dominated by two fourteenth-century two-light [[transom (architecture)|transom]] windows in the west [[gable]] and in the north wall. The reveals of a third window also remain in the north wall.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The present fireplace has [[musician]] [[corbel]]s from the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Wood |1965 |p=XVIIE (plate)}} The roof structure was similar to the open roof of the great hall until probably the seventeenth century, when the room was separated into two rooms, with a corridor on the south side of the eastern room. These rooms now serve as the library and dining room respectively.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\n[[File:Solar, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The [[solar (room)|solar]].]]\nOn the ground floor of the three eastern bays, the third bay from the east was probably open to the roof and is nowadays part of the same room with the third bay from the west (the room east of the parlour). It has a small [[lancet window]] in the northern wall at the base of the chimney. The two eastern most bays formed one room and has a modern partition from a corridor to the south. The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace. There may have been a partition in the middle of the room before the fireplace was built. The solar has a partition to the east behind which was a [[chapel]] and a door from the north to the east range.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}}\n\n=== East range ===\n[[File:Arch, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|East entrance looking into the courtyard.]]\nToday, the east range holds the entrance archway. It was constructed around 1500 and contains three bays. The modern gatehouse, at the northern end of the east range, has a lancet window in its east wall. It has a jettied wooden frame upper part standing on stone walls.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> \n\nSouth of the archway, the wall was timber framed but later partially infilled with brick and rubble as far as the chimney, where it abuts the south range. This timber framed wall is on a different alignment than the gatehouse, probably to unite with the south wall of the southeastern block, which may have been a wall around the building rather than part of a building.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\nThe roof of the southern bay of the east range was black-smokened and may have served as a kitchen or [[brewhouse]] at some time into which a chimney was later inserted.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== South range ===\n[[File:Hearth, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The Hearth, a meeting room in the south range.]]\nThe adjoining southeast corner block appears to have been roofed, probably in the seventeenth century, to connect the east range with the south range. The construction of this block completed the courtyard plan.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} \n\nThe south range extends the service wing and was added during the mid-sixteenth century. The two storey structure consisting of three bays was open to the eaves and was once used for the kitchen.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nNowadays, the southeast corner block contains a meeting room called 'The Hearth', seating up to eighteen people.<ref name=abbeystaying /> The south range now serves as the administration office of The Abbey.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:Avenue1, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The lime tree avenue.]]\n[[File:Courtyard2, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The courtyard garden.]]\nIn 1804, Francis Justice, who was in possession of the estate at the time, was allotted over two acres on the green north of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} As a result of this enlargement of the [[curtilage]], The Abbey now stands in the midst of extensive grounds and is approached by a [[Tilia|lime tree]] [[avenue (landscape)|avenue]] across the enclosure allotment, leading near to the east of the house. Although the avenue across the grounds appears to have existed before the enclosure (some trees are older than 1804) the house stood on the eastern edge of its curtilage until 1798. The old boundary wall survives, only circa two meters beyond the east wall of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} Nowadays, The Abbey consists of six acres of grounds which are of [[archaeology|archaeological]] importance because the remains of ancillary buildings underlie the gardens.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The [[perimeter]] is indicated by old stone walls, wooden fencing and dead hedging.\n\nSome four and a half acres of the land are used as gardens. On the north lawn, there is a [[Platanus|plane tree]] surrounded by [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]]. Here grow [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[beech]], [[bramble]], various [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]], [[Hedera|ivy]], [[oak]], [[Rhododendron|rhododendrons]] and [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]] trees. There are also [[Lauraceae|laurels]], winter-flowering ''[[Viburnum]]'', [[Symphoricarpos|snowberry]], a young [[Prunus serrulata|Japanese cherry]] and [[maple]]. A trunk and several branches from an old [[Fagus sylvatica#Cultivation|copper beech]] serve as a place for [[fungus|fungi]] and [[lichen]]s to grow on. Under the trees, there is a purpose built woodstore. On the west lawn, there is a [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London planetree]]. The south lawn has a [[labyrinth]] in it, where the [[maypole]] is erected. This lawn as young [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and several varieties of [[apple]] and [[plum]] trees. Furthermore, The Abbey has mature [[live oak]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[Prunus subg. Padus|bird cherry]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] and a [[Cedrus libani|cedar of Lebanon]]. In 1991, a project was completed which took care for the trees and [[transplanting|transplanted]] various species around the grounds. Adjacent to the grounds, there is a small secluded [[orchard]] where honey is produced from The Abbey's own [[mason bee|mason]] and [[honey bee]]s. The guest house area contains apple, [[Sambucus|elder]], ivy, [[Euonymus|spindle]], [[Viburnum lantana|wayfarer]] and ywe alongside plants like  [[Rosa setigera|climbing roses]], [[fern]]s and [[Salvia officinalis|sage]].<ref name=abbeygrounds>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/grounds/|title=The Abbey Grounds|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=19 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard garden has a [[Ficus|fig tree]], ''[[Magnolia]]'', [[rose]]s and a medieval style flower bed surrounded by a mature ''[[Buxus]]'' hedging. This garden was restored during the 1990s with [[gravel]]led paths and redesigned by B. Vellacot, a local volunteer. Around the main building there are flower beds with plants such as [[catnip]], [[Helichrysum italicum|curry plants]], ''[[Fuchsia]]'', [[Lavandula|lavender]], [[Vinca|periwinkle]], [[rosemary]], sage, [[Brunnera macrophylla|Siberian bugloss]], [[Spiraea|spirea]] and [[Jasminum nudiflorum|winter jasmine]]. Near the kitchen, there is a herb bed underneath a [[Betula pendula|silver birch]]. The walled [[kitchen garden]] has a [[wildflower]] meadow, a cut flower bed, a bed with [[strawberry|strawberries]] and trees including [[damson]], [[Ficus|fig]], [[greengage]], [[Prunus cerasus|morello cherry]], [[olive]], [[pear]], plum and [[quince]].

In the eleventh century, [[William the Conquerer]] granted the estate of Sutton to the [[House of Courtenay]], and the village became Sutton Courtenay.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> In 1090, King [[William II of England]] granted the [[All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay|church of Sutton]] and its lands and [[tithe]]s to the monks of Abingdon Abbey.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAbingdon Abbey constructed The Abbey as a [[monastic grange]], used as an administrative centre for the abbey's land and tithe holdings.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> However, the owner of the hide of land, Alwi the priest (whose father owned the land before him according to the [[Domesday Book]]), agreed with the [[abbot]] that he should retain Sutton with reversion first to his son and thereafter to the abbey, on condition of giving in [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton]] chapelry immediately.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=28}} Almost certainly in the late twelfth century, Abingdon Abbey took two thirds of the tithes and the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] the remaining third.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=104-5}} In 1258, following a dispute, the land was formally appropriated to the abbey and a [[clergy house|vicarage]] was ordained.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=106}} As it was close to Abingdon Abbey, it was probably run by the monks themselves rather than being left to a steward.<ref name=berkshirehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html|title=The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2004|work=Royal Berkshire History|author=David Nash Ford}}</ref> In 1278, however, [[Hugh de Courtenay]], Lord of the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor of Sutton]], sued the abbey for [[advowson]].

Many of these men rarely visited Sutton, leaving the running of The Abbey to various underlings. William Steele, rector in 1371, left money to each of his four servants in Sutton. Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory. Colnet was the doctor of King [[Henry V of England]] and was rector until 1420. He left money to the church and poor of Sutton.<ref>[[Berkshire Record Office]], D/EP 7/123.</ref> [[Thomas Beckington]], rector since 1420 and secretary of King [[Henry VI of England]], stayed at Sutton twice in 1442 and perhaps on other occasions.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} The ceiling of the solar is attributed to Beckington.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> In 1442, he was accompanied by [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], who succeeded him as rector when Beckington became [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] in 1443.{{sfn |Fletcher |1990 |p=60-2}} In 1444, Say obtained license to celebrate divine office in the house. The chapel was presumably new, and not used for long, since no other license is recorded. \n\nThe south and east ranges at The Abbey were completed around the middle of the fifteenth century, just before [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon]], who was involved in the [[Wars of the Roses]], was beheaded in 1461 and had his lands confiscated.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> Reginald Nutt, [[lease|lessee]] in 1472 and chaplain of Sutton, was obliged to repair all thatched roofs and mud walls on the site, the repair of tiled and slated roofs and the provision of timber being the rector's responsibility.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}}\n\nSome works survive from the period of Abingdon Abbey's control of the rectory before 1284.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} Since 1284 there are three medieval phases that can be closely dated. The first one can be attributed to Solomon of Rochester between 1284 and 1290. The second phase was between ca. 1320 and 1340, when among others the casing of the hall in stone was done. The third phase was around 1444, when William Say constructed the chapel screen and a door from the north to the east range on the first floor.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== College of St George ===\n[[File:St. Georges Chapel, Windsor Castle (2).jpg|thumb|[[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]] was in possession of The Abbey for over 350 years.]]\nIn 1481, [[Walter Devereux, 7th Baron Ferrers of Chartley]], granted the advowson to [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]],<ref>Denton Black Book ff. 42 v., 50 sqq.

In 1634 the buildings included 'a very ancient [[clergy house|parsonage house]]', three barns, a woolhouse, a sheephouse, a stable and a cowhouse. From 1669 onwards, the lease was held by the Justices of Sutton.{{sfn |Dalton |1957 |p=377-8}} In the late eighteenth century, the Justices began to extend the original leasehold curtilage by buying the freehold of adjoining tenements. Thomas Justice bought houses flanking the road on the west in 1773 and 1785.

Sourcing funding was difficult, and some potential investors remained unconvinced that the founders high ideals could lead to anything other than a misuse of funds. However, Blum and Verney remained committed to their project, disputing each critical point. Much of the work was carried out in a co-operative form, such as the 'work camp' of 1981, a community of enthusiastic volunteers.

Truman]].\n\nStalin, Churchill, and Truman gathered to decide how to administer Germany, which had agreed to unconditional surrender nine weeks earlier on 8 May ([[Victory in Europe Day]]).<ref>Attlee participated alongside Churchill while awaiting the outcome of the 1945 general election, and then replaced him as Prime Minister after the Labour Party's defeat of the Conservatives.</ref> The goals of the conference also included the establishment of postwar order, peace treaty issues, and countering the effects of the war.\n\n==Relationships among the leaders==\nA number of changes had taken place in the five months since the [[Yalta Conference]] that greatly affected the relationships among the leaders. The Soviet Union had occupied Central and Eastern Europe, and the Red Army effectively controlled the [[Baltic states]], Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, and refugees were fleeing from those countries. Stalin had set up a puppet communist government in Poland, insisted that his control of Eastern Europe was a defensive measure against possible future attacks and claimed that it was a legitimate sphere of Soviet influence.<ref>Leffler, Melvyn P., \"For the South of Mankind: The United States, the Soviet Union and the Cold War, First Edition, (New York, 2007) pg 31</ref>\n\nAlso, Britain had a new prime minister. [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Winston Churchill]] had served as prime minister in a [[Churchill war ministry|coalition government]]; his Soviet policy, since the early 1940s, had differed considerably from Roosevelt's; Churchill believed Stalin to be a \"devil\"-like tyrant who led a vile system.<ref name=\"miscamble51\">{{Harvnb|Miscamble|2007|p=51}}</ref> A [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] had been held in the UK on 5 July 1945, but the results were delayed to allow the votes of armed forces personnel to be counted in their home constituencies. The outcome became known during the conference, when [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Clement Attlee]] became the new prime minister.\n\nThen,  Roosevelt had died on 12 April 1945, and Vice-President [[Harry Truman]] assumed the presidency; his succession saw [[VE Day]] (Victory in Europe) within a month and [[VJ Day]] (Victory in Japan) on the horizon. During the war and in the name of Allied unity, Roosevelt had brushed off warnings of a potential domination by Stalin in part of Europe, explaining, \"I just have a hunch that Stalin is not that kind of a man.... I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, 'noblesse oblige', he won't try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace\".<ref name=\"miscamble52\">{{Harvnb|Miscamble|2007|p=52}}</ref>\n\nTruman had closely followed the Allied progress of the war. [[George Lenczowski]] noted that \"despite the contrast between his relatively modest background and the international glamour of his aristocratic predecessor, [Truman] had the courage and resolution to reverse the policy that appeared to him naive and dangerous\", which was \"in contrast to the immediate, often ''[[ad hoc]]'' moves and solutions dictated by the demands of the war\".<ref name=\"LenczAmPres\">[[George Lenczowski]], ''American Presidents and the Middle East,'' (1990), pp. 7\u201313</ref> With the end of the war, the priority of Allied unity was replaced with the challenge of the relationship between the two emerging superpowers.<ref name=\"LenczAmPres\"/> Both leading powers continued to sustain a cordial relationship to the public, but suspicions and distrust lingered between them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=35|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nTruman was much more suspicious of the communists than Roosevelt had been, and he became increasingly suspicious of Soviet intentions under Stalin.<ref name=\"LenczAmPres\"/> He and his advisers saw Soviet actions in Eastern Europe as aggressive expansionism that was incompatible with the agreements that Stalin had committed to at Yalta the previous February. In addition, Truman became aware of possible complications elsewhere when Stalin objected to Churchill's proposal for an early Allied withdrawal from Iran, ahead of the schedule agreed at the [[Tehran Conference]]. The Potsdam Conference was the only time that Truman met Stalin in person.<ref>Harry S. Truman, Memoirs, Vol. 1: ''Year of Decisions'' (1955), p.380, cited in Lenczowski, ''American Presidents,'' p.10</ref><ref>Nash, Gary B. \"The Troublesome Polish Question.\" The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society.

France had been a participant in the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]] and was to be an equal member of the [[Allied Control Council]]. Nevertheless, at the insistence of the Americans, [[Charles de Gaulle]] was not invited to Potsdam, just as he had been denied representation at Yalta. The diplomatic slight was a cause of deep and lasting resentment for him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Perils of Peace|last=Reinisch|first=Jessica|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|pages=53}}</ref> Reasons for the omissions included the longstanding personal mutual antagonism between Roosevelt and De Gaulle, ongoing disputes over the French and American occupation zones and anticipated conflicts of interest over [[French Indochina]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The French Empire at War 1940-45|last=Thomas|first=Martin|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1998|pages=215}}</ref> but it also reflected the judgement of both the British and Americans that French aims in respect of many items on the conference's agenda were likely to contradict the Anglo-American agreed objectives.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Between War and Peace; the Potsdam Conference|last=Feis|first=Hebert|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1960|pages=138}}</ref>\n\n== Agreements ==\n=== Potsdam Agreements ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Flight and expulsion of Germans during and after World War II]] -->\n{{main|Potsdam Agreement}}\n[[Image:Vertreibungsgebiet.jpg|300px|thumb|Demographics map used for the border discussions at the conference]]\n[[Image:Oder-neisse.gif|thumb|300px|The [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] (click to enlarge)]]\nAt the end of the conference, the three heads of government agreed on the following actions. All other issues were to be answered by the final peace conference, which was to be called as soon as possible.\n\n==== Germany ====\n\n* Germany and Austria were both to be divided into four occupation zones, as had been agreed in principle at [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], and similarly each capital ([[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]]) was to be divided into four zones.\n* [[Nazi]] war criminals were to be [[Nuremberg trials|put on trial]].\n* All German annexations in Europe were to be reversed, including [[Sudetenland]], [[Alsace-Lorraine]], Austria, and [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|the westernmost parts of Poland]].\n* Germany's eastern border was to be shifted westwards to the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]], effectively reducing Germany in size by approximately 25% from its 1937 borders. The territories east of the new border were [[East Prussia]], [[Silesia]], [[West Prussia]] and two thirds of [[Pomerania]]. Those areas were mainly agricultural, with the exception of [[Upper Silesia]], which was the second-largest centre of German heavy industry.\n* \"Orderly and humane\" expulsions of the German populations remaining beyond the new eastern borders of Germany were to be carried out from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but not Yugoslavia.<ref>Alfred de Zayas ''Nemesis at Potsdam'', Routledge, London 1977.

Stalin proposed, which was accepted, for Poland was to be excluded from division of German compensation and to be later granted 15% of compensation given to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Potsdam-Conference|title=Potsdam Conference {{!}} World War II|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en}}</ref>\n* German standards of living were to be ensured to prevent them from exceeding the European average. The types and amounts of industry to dismantle to achieve that was to be determined later (see [[Allied plans for German industry after World War II]]).\n* German industrial war potential was to be destroyed by the destruction or control of all industry with military potential. To that end, all civilian [[shipyards]] and [[Aircraft parts industry|aircraft factories]] were to be dismantled or otherwise destroyed. All production capacity associated with war potential, such as metals, chemical or machinery, were to be reduced to a minimum level, which would later br determined by the [[Allied Commission|Allied Control Commission]]. Manufacturing capacity thus made \"surplus\" was to be dismantled as reparations or otherwise destroyed. All research and [[international trade]] was to be controlled. The economy was to be decentralised (decartelisation). The economy was also to be reorganised, with the primary emphasis on agriculture and peaceful domestic industries. In early 1946, agreement was reached on the details of the latter: Germany was to be converted into an agricultural and [[light industry|light industrial]] economy. German exports were to be coal, beer, toys, textiles, etc., which would take the place of the [[heavy industry|heavy industrial]] products, which had formed most of Germany's prewar exports.<ref>James Stewart Martin. ''All Honorable Men'' (1950) p. 191.</ref>\n\nFrance, having been excluded from the conference, resisted implementing the Potsdam agreements within its occupation zone. In particular, the French refused to resettle any expelled Germans from the east. Moreover, the French did not accept any obligation to abide by the agreements in the proceedings of the Allied Control Council; in particular, they resisted all proposals to establish common policies and institutions across Germany as a whole and anything that they feared could lead to the emergence of an eventual unified German government.<ref name=\"Ziemke 1990 114\">{{cite book|last= Ziemke| first = Earl Frederick| title = The US Army and the Occupation of Germany 1944\u20131946| publisher = Center of Military History, United States Army| date = 1990| pages = 345}}</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n[[Image:Curzon line en.svg|thumb|[[Poland]]'s old and new borders, 1945.

Leahy]]. The Fleet Admiral in the [[US Navy]] had stood as advisor to Roosevelt during the Yalta Conference and to Truman during the Potsdam Conference. Leahy had a lengthy military background since he had served as the most senior American military officer on active duty during the Second World War. He later stated in his book, ''I Was There: The Personal Story of the Chief of Staff to Presidents Roosevelt and Truman Based on His Notes and Diaries Made at the Time,'' that the Potsdam Conference was one of the most frustrating out of all the conferences because of hostile relations between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. Throughout his work, he refers to the conference as its code name, Terminal. Later in his book, he discusses a tour of Berlin that he took with Truman and describes the experience as \"I never saw such destruction. I don't know whether they learned anything from it or not\".\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-14059-0016, Potsdamer Konferenz, Molotow, Byrnes, Eden.jpg|thumb|The Foreign Ministers: [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[James F.

Truman]].\n\nStalin, Churchill, and Truman gathered to decide how to administer Germany, which had agreed to unconditional surrender nine weeks earlier on 8 May ([[Victory in Europe Day]]).<ref>Attlee participated alongside Churchill while awaiting the outcome of the 1945 general election, and then replaced him as Prime Minister after the Labour Party's defeat of the Conservatives.</ref> The goals of the conference also included the establishment of postwar order, peace treaty issues, and countering the effects of the war.\n\n==Relationships among the leaders==\nA number of changes had taken place in the five months since the [[Yalta Conference]] that greatly affected the relationships among the leaders. The Soviet Union had occupied Central and Eastern Europe, and the Red Army effectively controlled the [[Baltic states]], Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, and refugees were fleeing from those countries. Stalin had set up a puppet communist government in Poland, insisted that his control of Eastern Europe was a defensive measure against possible future attacks and claimed that it was a legitimate sphere of Soviet influence.<ref>Leffler, Melvyn P., \"For the South of Mankind: The United States, the Soviet Union and the Cold War, First Edition, (New York, 2007) pg 31</ref>\n\nAlso, Britain had a new prime minister. [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Winston Churchill]] had served as prime minister in a [[Churchill war ministry|coalition government]]; his Soviet policy, since the early 1940s, had differed considerably from Roosevelt's; Churchill believed Stalin to be a \"devil\"-like tyrant who led a vile system.<ref name=\"miscamble51\">{{Harvnb|Miscamble|2007|p=51}}</ref> A [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] had been held in the UK on 5 July 1945, but the results were delayed to allow the votes of armed forces personnel to be counted in their home constituencies. The outcome became known during the conference, when [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Clement Attlee]] became the new prime minister.\n\nThen,  Roosevelt had died on 12 April 1945, and Vice-President [[Harry Truman]] assumed the presidency; his succession saw [[VE Day]] (Victory in Europe) within a month and [[VJ Day]] (Victory in Japan) on the horizon. During the war and in the name of Allied unity, Roosevelt had brushed off warnings of a potential domination by Stalin in part of Europe, explaining, \"I just have a hunch that Stalin is not that kind of a man.... I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, 'noblesse oblige', he won't try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace\".<ref name=\"miscamble52\">{{Harvnb|Miscamble|2007|p=52}}</ref>\n\nTruman had closely followed the Allied progress of the war. [[George Lenczowski]] noted that \"despite the contrast between his relatively modest background and the international glamour of his aristocratic predecessor, [Truman] had the courage and resolution to reverse the policy that appeared to him naive and dangerous\", which was \"in contrast to the immediate, often ''[[ad hoc]]'' moves and solutions dictated by the demands of the war\".<ref name=\"LenczAmPres\">[[George Lenczowski]], ''American Presidents and the Middle East,'' (1990), pp. 7\u201313</ref> With the end of the war, the priority of Allied unity was replaced with the challenge of the relationship between the two emerging superpowers.<ref name=\"LenczAmPres\"/> Both leading powers continued to sustain a cordial relationship to the public, but suspicions and distrust lingered between them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=35|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nTruman was much more suspicious of the communists than Roosevelt had been, and he became increasingly suspicious of Soviet intentions under Stalin.<ref name=\"LenczAmPres\"/> He and his advisers saw Soviet actions in Eastern Europe as aggressive expansionism that was incompatible with the agreements that Stalin had committed to at Yalta the previous February. In addition, Truman became aware of possible complications elsewhere when Stalin objected to Churchill's proposal for an early Allied withdrawal from Iran, ahead of the schedule agreed at the [[Tehran Conference]]. The Potsdam Conference was the only time that Truman met Stalin in person.<ref>Harry S. Truman, Memoirs, Vol. 1: ''Year of Decisions'' (1955), p.380, cited in Lenczowski, ''American Presidents,'' p.10</ref><ref>Nash, Gary B. \"The Troublesome Polish Question.\" The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society.

France had been a participant in the [[Berlin Declaration (1945)|Berlin Declaration]] and was to be an equal member of the [[Allied Control Council]]. Nevertheless, at the insistence of the Americans, [[Charles de Gaulle]] was not invited to Potsdam, just as he had been denied representation at Yalta. The diplomatic slight was a cause of deep and lasting resentment for him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Perils of Peace|last=Reinisch|first=Jessica|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|pages=53}}</ref> Reasons for the omissions included the longstanding personal mutual antagonism between Roosevelt and De Gaulle, ongoing disputes over the French and American occupation zones and anticipated conflicts of interest over [[French Indochina]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The French Empire at War 1940-45|last=Thomas|first=Martin|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1998|pages=215}}</ref> but it also reflected the judgement of both the British and Americans that French aims in respect of many items on the conference's agenda were likely to contradict the Anglo-American agreed objectives.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Between War and Peace; the Potsdam Conference|last=Feis|first=Hebert|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1960|pages=138}}</ref>\n\n== Agreements ==\n=== Potsdam Agreements ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Flight and expulsion of Germans during and after World War II]] -->\n{{main|Potsdam Agreement}}\n[[Image:Vertreibungsgebiet.jpg|300px|thumb|Demographics map used for the border discussions at the conference]]\n[[Image:Oder-neisse.gif|thumb|300px|The [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]] (click to enlarge)]]\nAt the end of the conference, the three heads of government agreed on the following actions.

The territories east of the new border were [[East Prussia]], [[Silesia]], [[West Prussia]] and two thirds of [[Pomerania]]. Those areas were mainly agricultural, with the exception of [[Upper Silesia]], which was the second-largest centre of German heavy industry.\n* \"Orderly and humane\" expulsions of the German populations remaining beyond the new eastern borders of Germany were to be carried out from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but not Yugoslavia.<ref>Alfred de Zayas ''Nemesis at Potsdam'', Routledge, London 1977.

The types and amounts of industry to dismantle to achieve that was to be determined later (see [[Allied plans for German industry after World War II]]).\n* German industrial war potential was to be destroyed by the destruction or control of all industry with military potential. To that end, all civilian [[shipyards]] and [[Aircraft parts industry|aircraft factories]] were to be dismantled or otherwise destroyed. All production capacity associated with war potential, such as metals, chemical or machinery, were to be reduced to a minimum level, which would later br determined by the [[Allied Commission|Allied Control Commission]]. Manufacturing capacity thus made \"surplus\" was to be dismantled as reparations or otherwise destroyed. All research and [[international trade]] was to be controlled. The economy was to be decentralised (decartelisation). The economy was also to be reorganised, with the primary emphasis on agriculture and peaceful domestic industries. In early 1946, agreement was reached on the details of the latter: Germany was to be converted into an agricultural and [[light industry|light industrial]] economy. German exports were to be coal, beer, toys, textiles, etc., which would take the place of the [[heavy industry|heavy industrial]] products, which had formed most of Germany's prewar exports.<ref>James Stewart Martin. ''All Honorable Men'' (1950) p. 191.</ref>\n\nFrance, having been excluded from the conference, resisted implementing the Potsdam agreements within its occupation zone. In particular, the French refused to resettle any expelled Germans from the east. Moreover, the French did not accept any obligation to abide by the agreements in the proceedings of the Allied Control Council; in particular, they resisted all proposals to establish common policies and institutions across Germany as a whole and anything that they feared could lead to the emergence of an eventual unified German government.<ref name=\"Ziemke 1990 114\">{{cite book|last= Ziemke| first = Earl Frederick| title = The US Army and the Occupation of Germany 1944\u20131946| publisher = Center of Military History, United States Army| date = 1990| pages = 345}}</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n[[Image:Curzon line en.svg|thumb|[[Poland]]'s old and new borders, 1945.

Leahy]]. The Fleet Admiral in the [[US Navy]] had stood as advisor to Roosevelt during the Yalta Conference and to Truman during the Potsdam Conference. Leahy had a lengthy military background since he had served as the most senior American military officer on active duty during the Second World War. He later stated in his book, ''I Was There: The Personal Story of the Chief of Staff to Presidents Roosevelt and Truman Based on His Notes and Diaries Made at the Time,'' that the Potsdam Conference was one of the most frustrating out of all the conferences because of hostile relations between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. Throughout his work, he refers to the conference as its code name, Terminal. Later in his book, he discusses a tour of Berlin that he took with Truman and describes the experience as \"I never saw such destruction. I don't know whether they learned anything from it or not\".\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-14059-0016, Potsdamer Konferenz, Molotow, Byrnes, Eden.jpg|thumb|The Foreign Ministers: [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[James F.
