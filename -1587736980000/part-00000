When completed in 1859, its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world.<ref>{{cite news| title=Why is Big Ben falling silent?|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160704-the-big-ben-renovation-and-how-the-clock-works| last=Excell| first=Jon| publisher=BBC| date=5 July 2016}}</ref> The tower stands {{convert|315|ft|m|0}} tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring {{convert|39|ft|m|0}} on each side. Dials of the clock are {{convert|23|ft|m|1}} in diameter.

The origin of the bell's nickname is open to question; it may be named after Sir [[Benjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover|Benjamin Hall]], who oversaw its installation, or [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion [[Benjamin Caunt]]. Four [[quarter bells]] chime at 15, 30 and 45 minutes past the hour and just before Big Ben tolls on the hour. The clock uses its original Victorian mechanism, but an electric motor can be used as a backup.\n\nThe tower is a [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icon]] recognised all over the world.

Although Barry was the chief architect of the palace, he turned to [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]] for the design of the clock tower, which resembles earlier Pugin designs, including one for [[Scarisbrick Hall]] in Lancashire. The design for the tower was Pugin's last design before his final descent into madness and death, and Pugin himself wrote, at the time of Barry's last visit to him to collect the drawings: \"I never worked so hard in my life for Mr Barry for tomorrow I render all the designs for finishing his bell tower & it is beautiful.\"<ref name=hill>{{cite book| first=Rosemary| last=Hill| title=God's Architect: Pugin & the Building of Romantic Britain|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Architect-Building-Romantic-Britain/dp/B008W30TJO#reader_B008W30TJO| publisher=Yale University Press| date=3 March 2009| page=482| accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nThe tower is designed in Pugin's celebrated [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, and is {{convert|315|ft|m|1}} high.<ref name=Bong>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31002198 |title=Bong!

Each clock dial is set in an iron frame {{convert|23|ft|m|1}} in diameter, supporting 324 pieces of opal glass, rather like a [[Stained glass|stained-glass]] window. Some of the glass pieces may be removed for inspection of the hands. The surrounds of the dials are [[Gilding|gilded]]. At the base of each clock dial in gilt letters is the [[Latin]] inscription:\n\n{{quote|<small>{{lang|la|DOMINE SALVAM FAC REGINAM NOSTRAM VICTORIAM PRIMAM}}</small>}}\n\nwhich means ''O Lord, keep safe our Queen Victoria the First''.\n\nUnlike many other [[Roman numeral]] clock dials, which show the '4' position as {{rn|IIII}}, the Great Clock faces depict '4' as {{rn|IV}}.

The designers were the lawyer and amateur [[Horology|horologist]] [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Edmund Beckett Denison]], and [[George Biddell Airy|George Airy]], the [[Astronomer Royal]].

This [[escapement]] provides the best separation between [[pendulum]] and clock mechanism. The pendulum is installed within an enclosed windproof box beneath the clockroom. It is {{convert|13|ft|m|1}} long, weighs {{convert|300|kg|order=flip}}, suspended on a strip of spring steel {{frac|1|64}} inch (0.40 mm) in thickness, and beats every two seconds. The clockwork mechanism in a room below weighs five tons.\n\n[[File:Winding the mechanism that powers Big Ben.webm|thumb|Winding the clock mechanism]]\nOn top of the pendulum is a small stack of old [[British one penny coin (pre-decimal)|penny coins]]; these are to adjust the time of the clock. Adding a coin has the effect of minutely lifting the position of the pendulum's [[Center of mass|centre of mass]], reducing the effective length of the pendulum rod and hence increasing the rate at which the pendulum swings.

Although Barry was the chief architect of the palace, he turned to [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]] for the design of the clock tower, which resembles earlier Pugin designs, including one for [[Scarisbrick Hall]] in Lancashire. The design for the tower was Pugin's last design before his final descent into madness and death, and Pugin himself wrote, at the time of Barry's last visit to him to collect the drawings: \"I never worked so hard in my life for Mr Barry for tomorrow I render all the designs for finishing his bell tower & it is beautiful.\"<ref name=hill>{{cite book| first=Rosemary| last=Hill| title=God's Architect: Pugin & the Building of Romantic Britain|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Architect-Building-Romantic-Britain/dp/B008W30TJO#reader_B008W30TJO| publisher=Yale University Press| date=3 March 2009| page=482| accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nThe tower is designed in Pugin's celebrated [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, and is {{convert|315|ft|m|1}} high.<ref name=Bong>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31002198 |title=Bong!

Each clock dial is set in an iron frame {{convert|23|ft|m|1}} in diameter, supporting 324 pieces of opal glass, rather like a [[Stained glass|stained-glass]] window.

This [[escapement]] provides the best separation between [[pendulum]] and clock mechanism. The pendulum is installed within an enclosed windproof box beneath the clockroom. It is {{convert|13|ft|m|1}} long, weighs {{convert|300|kg|order=flip}}, suspended on a strip of spring steel {{frac|1|64}} inch (0.40 mm) in thickness, and beats every two seconds. The clockwork mechanism in a room below weighs five tons.\n\n[[File:Winding the mechanism that powers Big Ben.webm|thumb|Winding the clock mechanism]]\nOn top of the pendulum is a small stack of old [[British one penny coin (pre-decimal)|penny coins]]; these are to adjust the time of the clock. Adding a coin has the effect of minutely lifting the position of the pendulum's [[Center of mass|centre of mass]], reducing the effective length of the pendulum rod and hence increasing the rate at which the pendulum swings.

It is {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m|2}} tall and {{convert|9|ft|m|2}} diameter. This new bell first chimed in July 1859; in September it too cracked under the hammer. According to the foundry's manager, George Mears, the horologist Denison had used a hammer more than twice the maximum weight specified.<ref name=wbfbb /> For three years Big Ben was taken out of commission and the hours were struck on the lowest of the quarter bells until it was repaired.

The 2,567 cast-iron roof tiles will be removed and replaced, and a lift will be installed to make access easier, along with a basic washroom with running water. The Ayrton Light at the top of the tower, which is lit when Parliament is sitting, will also be fully dismantled and restored with the other lights in the Belfry, the lights being replaced with low energy [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36138203|title=Big Ben to be silenced for \u00a329m refit|date=2016-04-26|access-date=2019-07-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> One of the most visible changes to the tower will be the restoration of the clock-face framework to its original colour of [[Prussian blue]], used when the tower was first built in 1859, with the black paint used to cover up the soot-stained dial frames being stripped away.

Because of the size of this region and the economic dominance exerted by the Hill lines, Hill became known during his lifetime as \"The Empire Builder\".\n\n==Biography==\n\nChildhood\nHill was born in [[Guelph/Eramosa, Ontario|Eramosa Township]], [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]], [[Upper Canada]] (now [[Ontario]]).

His first job in St. Paul was with a [[steamboat]] company, where he worked as a bookkeeper. By 1860, he was working for [[wholesale]] [[grocer]]s, for whom he handled [[freight]] transfers, especially dealing with railroads and steamboats. Through this work, he learned all aspects of the freight and [[transport]]ation business. During this period, Hill began to work for himself for the first time.

During this same period, Hill also entered into banking and quickly managed to become member of several major [[bank]]s' [[boards of directors]]. He also bought out [[bankrupt]] businesses, built them up again, and then resold them\u2014often gaining a substantial [[Profit (economics)|profit]].  Hill noted that the secret to his success was \"work, hard work, intelligent work, and then more work.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= Highways of Progress |last=Hill |first= James J.|year= 2001 |publisher= Minerva Group |isbn= 0-89499-025-X}}</ref>\n\n===Entry into Gilded Era railroading===\nDuring the [[Panic of 1873]], a number of railroads, including the [[St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] (StP&P), had gone bankrupt. The StP&P in particular was caught in an almost hopeless legal muddle. For James Hill it was a golden opportunity. For three years, Hill researched the StP&P and finally concluded that it would be possible to make a good deal of money off the StP&P, provided that the initial capital could be found. Hill teamed up with [[Norman Kittson]] (the man he had merged steamboat businesses with), [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]],<ref name=\"martin\">{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Joseph E.|title=Titans|journal=Canada's History|date=2017|volume=97|issue=5|pages=47\u201353|issn=1920-9894}}</ref> [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]] and [[John Stewart Kennedy]]. Together they not only bought the railroad, they also vastly expanded it by bargaining for trackage rights with the [[Northern Pacific Railway]]. In May 1879, the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway Co. (StPM&M) formed\u2014with James J. Hill as general manager. His first goal was to expand and upgrade even more.\n\nHill was a hands-on, detail-obsessed manager. A Canadian himself of Scotch-Irish Protestant ancestry, he brought in many men with the same background into high management.<ref>Claire Strom, \"Among Friends: The Power of Ethnicity in the Great Northern Railway Corporation,\" ''Journal of the West'' (2009) 48#4 pp 11-17.</ref>  He wanted people to settle along his rail lines, so he sold homesteads to immigrants while transporting them to their new homes using his rail lines. When he was looking for the best path for one of his tracks to take, he went on horseback and scouted it personally. Under his management, StPM&M prospered. In 1880, its net worth was $728,000 (equal to ${{Inflation|US|728000|1880|fmt=c}} today); in 1885 it was $25,000,000, equal to ${{Inflation|US|25000000|1885|fmt=c}} today.\n\nOne of his challenges at this point was the avoidance of federal action against railroads. If the [[United States Government|federal government]] believed that the railroads were making too much profit, they might see this as an opportunity to force lowering of the railway tariff rates. Hill avoided this by investing a large portion of the railroad's profit back into the railroad itself\u2014and charged those investments to operating expense. It was at this point that Hill went from general manager to the official president of StPM&M, and thereafter decided to expand the rail lines.\n\n[[File:James J. Hill.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Hill ''circa'' 1890]]\n\n===\"Empire Builder\"===\nBetween 1883 and 1889, Hill built his railroads across [[Minnesota]], into [[Wisconsin]], and across [[North Dakota]] to [[Montana]].\n\nWhen there was not enough industry in the areas Hill was building, Hill brought the industry in, often by buying out a company and placing plants along his railroad lines. By 1889, Hill decided that his future lay in expanding into a [[transcontinental railroad]].\n\n\"What we want,\" Hill is quoted as saying, \"is the best possible line, shortest distance, lowest grades, and least curvature we can build. We do not care enough for [[Rocky Mountains]] scenery to spend a large sum of money developing it.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= James J.

The Great Northern was the first transcontinental built without public money and just a few [[land grant]]s,   and was one of the few transcontinental railroads not to go bankrupt.\n\nHill chose to build his railroad north of the competing Northern Pacific line, which had reached the Pacific Northwest over much more difficult terrain with more bridges, steeper grades, and tunnelling. Hill did much of the route planning himself, travelling over proposed routes on horseback. The key to the Great Northern line was Hill's use of the previously unmapped [[Marias Pass]]. The pass had initially been described by Lewis and Clark in 1805, but no one since had been able to find it so Hill hired Santiago Jameson to search it out. Jameson discovered the pass 1889 and it shortened the Great Northern's route by almost one hundred miles.{{sfnp|Folsom|2003|p=28}} The pass had been discovered by [[John Frank Stevens]], principal engineer of the Great Northern Railway, in December 1889, and offered an easier route across the Rockies than that taken by the Northern Pacific. The Great Northern reached Seattle in 1893.\n\nIn 1898 Hill purchased control of large parts of the [[Mesabi Range]] iron mining district in Minnesota, along with its rail lines. The Great Northern began large-scale shipment of ore to the steel mills of the Midwest.<ref>Don L. Hofsommer, \"Ore Docks and Trains: The Great Northern Railway and the Mesabi Range,\" ''Railroad History'' (1996) Issue 174, pp 5-25</ref>\n\n====Settlements====\nThe Great Northern energetically promoted settlement along its lines in North Dakota and Montana, especially by Germans and Scandinavians from Europe. The Great Northern bought its lands from the federal government\u2014it received no land grants\u2014and resold them to farmers at cheap prices. It operated agencies in Germany and Scandinavia that promoted its lands, and brought families over at low cost. Hill also invested in founding schools and churches for these communities and promoted a variety of progressive techniques to ensure they prospered.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Robber Barons|last=Josephson|first=Matthew|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company|year=1934|isbn=|location=New York|pages=237}}</ref> This \"Dakota Boom\" peaked in 1882 as 42,000 immigrants, largely from northern Europe, poured into the Red River Valley running through the region.<ref>{{Cite book|title=James J.

In order to ensure that he did not lose his patronage during the crisis, Hill lowered rail tariff shipping rates for farmers and gave credit to many of the businesses he owned so they could continue paying their workers and starting a \"10 dollar trip\" (equal to ${{Inflation|US|10|1893|r=2}} today) for immigrants. He also took strong measures to economize\u2014in just one year, Hill cut the railway's expense of carrying a ton of freight by 13%. Because of these measures, Hill not only stayed in business, but also increased the net worth of his railroad by nearly $10,000,000 (equal to ${{Inflation|US|10000000|1893|fmt=c}} today). Meanwhile, nearly every other transcontinental railroad went bankrupt. His ability to ride out the depression garnered him fame and admiration.  Hill saved money by repeatedly cutting wages, made possible by a time of deflation when prices were falling generally.{{sfnp|Martin|1976|p=414-415}}\n\nIn 1893, Hill began the process of looking for a source of labor other than Chinese workers. For a brief period of time, he hired Italian and Greek laborers, but company officials were not satisfied with their performance. Hill sent emissaries to the Pacific who found that Japan had the most potential in the market of \"Oriental Trade,\" and he decided to capitalize on this opportunity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pacific Connections|last=Chang|first=Kornel|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=9780520271685|location=|pages=59|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn this time he also began to focus his energies on securing trade with Asian countries. He offered Japanese Industrialists Southern cotton and would even ship it for free if they would compare it with the short staple cotton they were using with the promise of a refund if they were dissatisfied, which they were not. With these friendly relations established, Hill managed to secure the industrializing Japanese order for 15,000 tons of rails against competition from England and Belgium. From 1886 to 1905, American exports to Japan leapt from $7.7 million a year (equal to ${{Inflation|US|7700000|1886|fmt=c}} today) to $51.7 million, equal to ${{Inflation|US|51700000|1905|fmt=c}} today.{{sfnp|Folsom|2003|p=35}}\n\nLeonard says that after 1900 Hill exhibited poor business judgment regarding one Canadian subsidiary,  the Vancouver, Westminster and Yukon Railway Company (VW&Y). He ousted its president John Hendry, thereby worsening the problems, prolonging the delays, and adding to the costs of taking over the VW&Y. Hill's top aides were careless about details, bookkeeping, correspondence, and reports.<ref>Frank Leonard, \"Railroading a Renegade: Great Northern Ousts John Hendry in Vancouver,\" ''BC Studies'' (2007), Issue 155, pp 69-92.</ref>\n\n===The Northern Pacific and the \"short squeeze\" of 1901===\nWith 1901 and the start of the new century, James Hill now had control of both the Great Northern Railway, and the [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific]] (which he had obtained with the help of his friend [[J. P. Morgan]], when that railroad went bankrupt in the depression of the mid-1890s). Hill also wanted control of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]] railroad because of its [[Midwest]]ern lines and access to Chicago. The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] was the biggest competitor of Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railroads. Although Great Northern and Northern Pacific were backed by J. P. Morgan and James J. Hill, the Union Pacific was backed not only by its president, [[Edward H. Harriman]], but by the extremely powerful [[William Rockefeller]] and [[Jacob Schiff]].\n\nQuietly, Harriman began buying stock in Northern Pacific with the intention of gaining control of Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy. He was within 40,000 shares of control when Hill learned of Harriman's activities and quickly contacted J. P. Morgan, who ordered his men to buy everything they could get their hands on.\n\n[[File:James J. Hill House.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Hill's home at 240 [[Summit Avenue (St. Paul)|Summit Avenue]], St. Paul, Minnesota]]\n\nThe result was chaos on Wall Street. Northern Pacific stock was forced up to $1,000 per share. Many speculators, who had sold Northern Pacific \"[[short selling|short]]\" in the anticipation of a drop in the railroad's price, faced ruin. The threat of a real economic panic loomed. Neither side could win a distinct advantage, and the parties soon realized that a truce would have to be called. The winners of that truce were Hill and Morgan, who immediately formed the [[Northern Securities Company]] with the aim of tying together their three major rail lines. As the Hill-Morgan alliance formed the Northern Securities Company, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became president and turned his energies against the great trusts that were monopolizing trade.\n\n===The Hill Lines survive the trust-busting era===\nRoosevelt sent his Justice Department to sue the Northern Securities Company in 1902. The Supreme Court [[Northern Securities Co. v. United States|in 1904 ordered it to be dissolved]] as a monopoly. (Ironically, the Burlington Route, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern would later merge in 1970 to form the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]].) This unfortunately ended Hill's ability to maintain competitive rates in Asian countries and in the subsequent two years American trade with Japan and China dropped 40% (or $41 million).{{sfnp|Folsom|2003|p=28}} Hill moved on without the benefit of a central company, and acquired the [[Colorado and Southern Railway]] lines into Texas. He also built the [[Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway]]. By the time of his death in 1916, James J. Hill was worth more than $53 million (equal to more than ${{Inflation|US|53000000|1916|fmt=c}} today). When his estate was divided his widow received over 16 million, and each of his children received almost 4 million; only 1.5 million was paid in income and inheritance taxes.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=James J.

The Democratic Party's continued enchantment with the populist [[William Jennings Bryan]] led Hill to support Republican presidential candidates [[William McKinley]] (1896 and 1900), [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1904), and [[William Howard Taft]] (1908 and 1912).\n\nHill was also a member of the [[Jekyll Island Club]] (aka The Millionaires Club) on [[Jekyll Island]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], along with [[J. P. Morgan]] and [[William Rockefeller]].\n\nHill was a supporter of [[free trade]] and was one of the few supporters of free trade with [[Canada]]. In St. Paul, the city's main library building and the adjoining Hill Business Library were funded by him. In addition, he donated to numerous schools, including the [[Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity|Saint Paul Seminary]].\n\nIn 1891, after three years of building, construction was completed on a new Hill family home on [[Summit Avenue (St. Paul)|Summit Avenue]] in St. Paul. Over 400 workers labored on the project. Built at a cost of $930,000 and with {{convert|36000|sqft|m2}}, the [[James J. Hill House]] was among the city's largest. As with his business dealings, Hill supervised the construction and design himself, hiring and firing several architects in the process. The house has many early electrical and mechanical systems that predate widespread adoption in modern domestic structures. Upon completion of the Summit Avenue residence, Hill had the family's old house, which he had constructed in 1878, razed. After the death of Hill's wife in 1921, the house was donated to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]]. It was obtained by the [[Minnesota Historical Society]] in 1978 and today is operated as a museum and gallery.\n\nThough a [[Protestant]], Hill maintained a strong philanthropic relationship with the Catholic Church in St. Paul and through the northwest. Hill's historic home is located next to the Cathedral, largely due to the special relationship Hill's wife, a practicing Catholic, had with the Diocese. The Hills maintained close ties with Archbishop [[John Ireland (bishop)|John Ireland]] and Hill was a major contributor to the Saint Paul Seminary, [[Macalester College]], [[Hamline University]], the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]], [[Carleton College]], and other educational, religious and charitable organizations. He was the first major donor to the Marquette University School of Medicine.\n\nIn order to generate business for his railroad, Hill encouraged European immigrants to settle along his line, often paying for Russian and Scandinavian settlers to travel from Europe. To promote settlement and revenue for his rail business, Hill experimented with agriculture and worked to hybridize Russian wheat for Dakota soil and weather conditions. He also ran model experimental farms in Minnesota such as [[North Oaks, Minnesota|North Oaks]] to develop superior livestock and crop yields for the settlers locating near his railroads.\n\nAn enthusiastic conservationist, Hill was invited by President Theodore Roosevelt to a governors' conference on conservation of natural resources, and later appointed to a lands commission.\n\nDrawing on his experience in the development of Minnesota's Iron Range, Hill was, during 1911\u20131912, in close contact with [[Gaspard Farrer]] of [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers & Company]] of London regarding the formation of the Brazilian Iron Ore Company to tap that nation's rich mineral deposits.\n\nNear the end of his life, Hill played what a recent biographer, Albro Martin, called his \"last and greatest role.\" After the first punishing year of [[World War I]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] desperately needed financial support to continue the war effort. To that end, Hill was a major figure in the effort launched by J.P. Morgan to float the [[Anglo-French Bond]] drive of 1915, which allowed the Allies to purchase much-needed foodstuffs and other supplies. In September 1915, the first public loan, the $500,000,000 Anglo-French loan, was floated after negotiations with the [[Anglo-French Financial Commission]]. Concomitantly, the resulting trade in munitions with England and France carried the United States from a depression in 1914 to boom years in 1915 and 1916.<ref>[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/barnesww1.shtml Harry Elmer Barnes: The World War of 1914\u20131918] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201051/http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/barnesww1.shtml |date=2007-09-27 }} at tmh.floonet.net</ref>\n\n[[Hillsboro, North Dakota]]; [[Hill County, Montana]]; and [[Hillyard, Spokane, Washington|Hillyard, Washington]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Meany|first=Edmond S.|title=Origin of Washington geographic names|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027074981;view=1up;seq=130|year=1923|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|page=114}}</ref> (now a neighborhood of [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]), are named for him.\n\nIn 1929, the Great Northern Railway inaugurated a long-distance passenger train extending from Chicago to Seattle, and named it the ''[[Empire Builder]]'' in his honor.

As a result, one feature Hill integrated into the construction of the 1887 company headquarters (the Great Northern General Office Building) was barrel-vaulted ceilings constructed of brick and railroad steel rails that held up a layer of sand several inches deep. The theory was that if a fire broke out and the ceiling caved in, the sand would drop and retard or suppress the fire.\n\nHill was intimately involved in the planning and construction (1914\u20131916) of a new company headquarters in St. Paul (to be known as the Great Northern Office Building), which was to house the corporate staffs of the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific and Hill's banking enterprises.

He was the [[chief executive officer]] of a family of lines headed by the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], which served a substantial area of the Upper [[midwestern United States|Midwest]], the northern [[Great Plains]], and [[Pacific Northwest]]. Because of the size of this region and the economic dominance exerted by the Hill lines, Hill became known during his lifetime as \"The Empire Builder\".\n\n==Biography==\n\nChildhood\nHill was born in [[Guelph/Eramosa, Ontario|Eramosa Township]], [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]], [[Upper Canada]] (now [[Ontario]]). A childhood accident with a bow and arrow blinded him in the right eye. He had nine years of formal [[school]]ing. He attended the [[Rockwood Academy (Ontario)|Rockwood Academy]] for a short while, where the head gave him free tuition.<ref>[http://www.railserve.com/JJHill.html James J. Hill and the Building of His Railroad Empire] [[Railserve]]</ref> He was forced to leave school in 1852 due to the death of his father. By the time he had finished, he was adept at [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[land surveying]], and [[English language|English]]. His particular talents for English and [[mathematics]] would be critical later in his life.\n[[File:JamesJHill1856.jpg|thumb|upright|Hill ''circa'' 1856]]\nAfter working as a clerk in Kentucky (during which he learned [[bookkeeping]]), Hill decided to permanently move to the United States and settled in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], at the age of 18. His first job in St. Paul was with a [[steamboat]] company, where he worked as a bookkeeper. By 1860, he was working for [[wholesale]] [[grocer]]s, for whom he handled [[freight]] transfers, especially dealing with railroads and steamboats. Through this work, he learned all aspects of the freight and [[transport]]ation business. During this period, Hill began to work for himself for the first time. During the winter months when the [[Mississippi River]] was frozen and steamboats could not run, Hill started bidding on other contracts and won several.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Young businessman===\nBecause of his previous experiences in [[shipping]] and [[fuel]] supply, Hill was able to enter both the [[coal]] and steamboat businesses.  In 1870, he and his partners started the Red River Transportation Company, which offered steam boat transportation between St. Paul and Winnipeg.<ref>{{cite web|title=James J. Hill Biography|url=http://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/biographies/james-j-hill-biography/|work=The Oregon Historical Society|publisher=The Oregon Historical Society|accessdate=28 September 2013}}</ref> By 1879 he had a local [[monopoly]] by merging with [[Norman Kittson]]. In 1867, Hill entered the coal business, and by 1879 it had expanded five times over, giving Hill a local monopoly in the [[anthracite coal]] business. During this same period, Hill also entered into banking and quickly managed to become member of several major [[bank]]s' [[boards of directors]]. He also bought out [[bankrupt]] businesses, built them up again, and then resold them\u2014often gaining a substantial [[Profit (economics)|profit]].  Hill noted that the secret to his success was \"work, hard work, intelligent work, and then more work.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= Highways of Progress |last=Hill |first= James J.|year= 2001 |publisher= Minerva Group |isbn= 0-89499-025-X}}</ref>\n\n===Entry into Gilded Era railroading===\nDuring the [[Panic of 1873]], a number of railroads, including the [[St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] (StP&P), had gone bankrupt. The StP&P in particular was caught in an almost hopeless legal muddle. For James Hill it was a golden opportunity. For three years, Hill researched the StP&P and finally concluded that it would be possible to make a good deal of money off the StP&P, provided that the initial capital could be found. Hill teamed up with [[Norman Kittson]] (the man he had merged steamboat businesses with), [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]],<ref name=\"martin\">{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Joseph E.|title=Titans|journal=Canada's History|date=2017|volume=97|issue=5|pages=47\u201353|issn=1920-9894}}</ref> [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]] and [[John Stewart Kennedy]]. Together they not only bought the railroad, they also vastly expanded it by bargaining for trackage rights with the [[Northern Pacific Railway]]. In May 1879, the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway Co. (StPM&M) formed\u2014with James J. Hill as general manager. His first goal was to expand and upgrade even more.\n\nHill was a hands-on, detail-obsessed manager. A Canadian himself of Scotch-Irish Protestant ancestry, he brought in many men with the same background into high management.<ref>Claire Strom, \"Among Friends: The Power of Ethnicity in the Great Northern Railway Corporation,\" ''Journal of the West'' (2009) 48#4 pp 11-17.</ref>  He wanted people to settle along his rail lines, so he sold homesteads to immigrants while transporting them to their new homes using his rail lines. When he was looking for the best path for one of his tracks to take, he went on horseback and scouted it personally. Under his management, StPM&M prospered. In 1880, its net worth was $728,000 (equal to ${{Inflation|US|728000|1880|fmt=c}} today); in 1885 it was $25,000,000, equal to ${{Inflation|US|25000000|1885|fmt=c}} today.\n\nOne of his challenges at this point was the avoidance of federal action against railroads. If the [[United States Government|federal government]] believed that the railroads were making too much profit, they might see this as an opportunity to force lowering of the railway tariff rates. Hill avoided this by investing a large portion of the railroad's profit back into the railroad itself\u2014and charged those investments to operating expense. It was at this point that Hill went from general manager to the official president of StPM&M, and thereafter decided to expand the rail lines.\n\n[[File:James J. Hill.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Hill ''circa'' 1890]]\n\n===\"Empire Builder\"===\nBetween 1883 and 1889, Hill built his railroads across [[Minnesota]], into [[Wisconsin]], and across [[North Dakota]] to [[Montana]].\n\nWhen there was not enough industry in the areas Hill was building, Hill brought the industry in, often by buying out a company and placing plants along his railroad lines. By 1889, Hill decided that his future lay in expanding into a [[transcontinental railroad]].\n\n\"What we want,\" Hill is quoted as saying, \"is the best possible line, shortest distance, lowest grades, and least curvature we can build. We do not care enough for [[Rocky Mountains]] scenery to spend a large sum of money developing it.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= James J. Hill and the opening of the Northwest|last= Marin |first= Albro |year= 1991 |publisher= Minnesota Historical Society Press |isbn= 0-87351-261-8 |page= 366}}</ref> Hill got what he wanted, and in January 1893 his [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], running from St. Paul, Minnesota to Seattle, Washington \u2014 a distance of more than {{convert|1700|mi|km}} \u2014 was completed. The Great Northern was the first transcontinental built without public money and just a few [[land grant]]s,   and was one of the few transcontinental railroads not to go bankrupt.\n\nHill chose to build his railroad north of the competing Northern Pacific line, which had reached the Pacific Northwest over much more difficult terrain with more bridges, steeper grades, and tunnelling. Hill did much of the route planning himself, travelling over proposed routes on horseback. The key to the Great Northern line was Hill's use of the previously unmapped [[Marias Pass]]. The pass had initially been described by Lewis and Clark in 1805, but no one since had been able to find it so Hill hired Santiago Jameson to search it out. Jameson discovered the pass 1889 and it shortened the Great Northern's route by almost one hundred miles.{{sfnp|Folsom|2003|p=28}} The pass had been discovered by [[John Frank Stevens]], principal engineer of the Great Northern Railway, in December 1889, and offered an easier route across the Rockies than that taken by the Northern Pacific. The Great Northern reached Seattle in 1893.\n\nIn 1898 Hill purchased control of large parts of the [[Mesabi Range]] iron mining district in Minnesota, along with its rail lines. The Great Northern began large-scale shipment of ore to the steel mills of the Midwest.<ref>Don L. Hofsommer, \"Ore Docks and Trains: The Great Northern Railway and the Mesabi Range,\" ''Railroad History'' (1996) Issue 174, pp 5-25</ref>\n\n====Settlements====\nThe Great Northern energetically promoted settlement along its lines in North Dakota and Montana, especially by Germans and Scandinavians from Europe. The Great Northern bought its lands from the federal government\u2014it received no land grants\u2014and resold them to farmers at cheap prices. It operated agencies in Germany and Scandinavia that promoted its lands, and brought families over at low cost. Hill also invested in founding schools and churches for these communities and promoted a variety of progressive techniques to ensure they prospered.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Robber Barons|last=Josephson|first=Matthew|publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company|year=1934|isbn=|location=New York|pages=237}}</ref> This \"Dakota Boom\" peaked in 1882 as 42,000 immigrants, largely from northern Europe, poured into the Red River Valley running through the region.<ref>{{Cite book|title=James J.

In order to ensure that he did not lose his patronage during the crisis, Hill lowered rail tariff shipping rates for farmers and gave credit to many of the businesses he owned so they could continue paying their workers and starting a \"10 dollar trip\" (equal to ${{Inflation|US|10|1893|r=2}} today) for immigrants. He also took strong measures to economize\u2014in just one year, Hill cut the railway's expense of carrying a ton of freight by 13%. Because of these measures, Hill not only stayed in business, but also increased the net worth of his railroad by nearly $10,000,000 (equal to ${{Inflation|US|10000000|1893|fmt=c}} today). Meanwhile, nearly every other transcontinental railroad went bankrupt. His ability to ride out the depression garnered him fame and admiration.  Hill saved money by repeatedly cutting wages, made possible by a time of deflation when prices were falling generally.{{sfnp|Martin|1976|p=414-415}}\n\nIn 1893, Hill began the process of looking for a source of labor other than Chinese workers. For a brief period of time, he hired Italian and Greek laborers, but company officials were not satisfied with their performance. Hill sent emissaries to the Pacific who found that Japan had the most potential in the market of \"Oriental Trade,\" and he decided to capitalize on this opportunity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pacific Connections|last=Chang|first=Kornel|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=9780520271685|location=|pages=59|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn this time he also began to focus his energies on securing trade with Asian countries. He offered Japanese Industrialists Southern cotton and would even ship it for free if they would compare it with the short staple cotton they were using with the promise of a refund if they were dissatisfied, which they were not. With these friendly relations established, Hill managed to secure the industrializing Japanese order for 15,000 tons of rails against competition from England and Belgium. From 1886 to 1905, American exports to Japan leapt from $7.7 million a year (equal to ${{Inflation|US|7700000|1886|fmt=c}} today) to $51.7 million, equal to ${{Inflation|US|51700000|1905|fmt=c}} today.{{sfnp|Folsom|2003|p=35}}\n\nLeonard says that after 1900 Hill exhibited poor business judgment regarding one Canadian subsidiary,  the Vancouver, Westminster and Yukon Railway Company (VW&Y). He ousted its president John Hendry, thereby worsening the problems, prolonging the delays, and adding to the costs of taking over the VW&Y. Hill's top aides were careless about details, bookkeeping, correspondence, and reports.<ref>Frank Leonard, \"Railroading a Renegade: Great Northern Ousts John Hendry in Vancouver,\" ''BC Studies'' (2007), Issue 155, pp 69-92.</ref>\n\n===The Northern Pacific and the \"short squeeze\" of 1901===\nWith 1901 and the start of the new century, James Hill now had control of both the Great Northern Railway, and the [[Northern Pacific Railway|Northern Pacific]] (which he had obtained with the help of his friend [[J. P. Morgan]], when that railroad went bankrupt in the depression of the mid-1890s). Hill also wanted control of the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington and Quincy]] railroad because of its [[Midwest]]ern lines and access to Chicago. The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] was the biggest competitor of Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railroads. Although Great Northern and Northern Pacific were backed by J. P. Morgan and James J. Hill, the Union Pacific was backed not only by its president, [[Edward H. Harriman]], but by the extremely powerful [[William Rockefeller]] and [[Jacob Schiff]].\n\nQuietly, Harriman began buying stock in Northern Pacific with the intention of gaining control of Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy. He was within 40,000 shares of control when Hill learned of Harriman's activities and quickly contacted J. P. Morgan, who ordered his men to buy everything they could get their hands on.\n\n[[File:James J. Hill House.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Hill's home at 240 [[Summit Avenue (St. Paul)|Summit Avenue]], St. Paul, Minnesota]]\n\nThe result was chaos on Wall Street. Northern Pacific stock was forced up to $1,000 per share. Many speculators, who had sold Northern Pacific \"[[short selling|short]]\" in the anticipation of a drop in the railroad's price, faced ruin. The threat of a real economic panic loomed. Neither side could win a distinct advantage, and the parties soon realized that a truce would have to be called. The winners of that truce were Hill and Morgan, who immediately formed the [[Northern Securities Company]] with the aim of tying together their three major rail lines. As the Hill-Morgan alliance formed the Northern Securities Company, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became president and turned his energies against the great trusts that were monopolizing trade.\n\n===The Hill Lines survive the trust-busting era===\nRoosevelt sent his Justice Department to sue the Northern Securities Company in 1902. The Supreme Court [[Northern Securities Co. v. United States|in 1904 ordered it to be dissolved]] as a monopoly. (Ironically, the Burlington Route, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern would later merge in 1970 to form the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]].) This unfortunately ended Hill's ability to maintain competitive rates in Asian countries and in the subsequent two years American trade with Japan and China dropped 40% (or $41 million).{{sfnp|Folsom|2003|p=28}} Hill moved on without the benefit of a central company, and acquired the [[Colorado and Southern Railway]] lines into Texas. He also built the [[Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway]]. By the time of his death in 1916, James J. Hill was worth more than $53 million (equal to more than ${{Inflation|US|53000000|1916|fmt=c}} today). When his estate was divided his widow received over 16 million, and each of his children received almost 4 million; only 1.5 million was paid in income and inheritance taxes.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=James J.

This last attempt lasted from 1955 until final Supreme Court approval and merger in March, 1970, which created the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]]. In 1995, Burlington Northern merged with the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] to become the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]].\n\n===Family life===\nIn 1867, James J. Hill married Mary Theresa Mehegan, born in 1846 in New York City. They had ten children:\n\n# Mary Francis Hill Hill (1869\u20131947), who married [[Samuel Hill]] of Washington D.C. and Seattle.

In addition, he donated to numerous schools, including the [[Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity|Saint Paul Seminary]].\n\nIn 1891, after three years of building, construction was completed on a new Hill family home on [[Summit Avenue (St. Paul)|Summit Avenue]] in St. Paul. Over 400 workers labored on the project. Built at a cost of $930,000 and with {{convert|36000|sqft|m2}}, the [[James J. Hill House]] was among the city's largest. As with his business dealings, Hill supervised the construction and design himself, hiring and firing several architects in the process. The house has many early electrical and mechanical systems that predate widespread adoption in modern domestic structures. Upon completion of the Summit Avenue residence, Hill had the family's old house, which he had constructed in 1878, razed. After the death of Hill's wife in 1921, the house was donated to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]]. It was obtained by the [[Minnesota Historical Society]] in 1978 and today is operated as a museum and gallery.\n\nThough a [[Protestant]], Hill maintained a strong philanthropic relationship with the Catholic Church in St. Paul and through the northwest. Hill's historic home is located next to the Cathedral, largely due to the special relationship Hill's wife, a practicing Catholic, had with the Diocese. The Hills maintained close ties with Archbishop [[John Ireland (bishop)|John Ireland]] and Hill was a major contributor to the Saint Paul Seminary, [[Macalester College]], [[Hamline University]], the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]], [[Carleton College]], and other educational, religious and charitable organizations. He was the first major donor to the Marquette University School of Medicine.\n\nIn order to generate business for his railroad, Hill encouraged European immigrants to settle along his line, often paying for Russian and Scandinavian settlers to travel from Europe. To promote settlement and revenue for his rail business, Hill experimented with agriculture and worked to hybridize Russian wheat for Dakota soil and weather conditions. He also ran model experimental farms in Minnesota such as [[North Oaks, Minnesota|North Oaks]] to develop superior livestock and crop yields for the settlers locating near his railroads.\n\nAn enthusiastic conservationist, Hill was invited by President Theodore Roosevelt to a governors' conference on conservation of natural resources, and later appointed to a lands commission.\n\nDrawing on his experience in the development of Minnesota's Iron Range, Hill was, during 1911\u20131912, in close contact with [[Gaspard Farrer]] of [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers & Company]] of London regarding the formation of the Brazilian Iron Ore Company to tap that nation's rich mineral deposits.\n\nNear the end of his life, Hill played what a recent biographer, Albro Martin, called his \"last and greatest role.\" After the first punishing year of [[World War I]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] desperately needed financial support to continue the war effort. To that end, Hill was a major figure in the effort launched by J.P. Morgan to float the [[Anglo-French Bond]] drive of 1915, which allowed the Allies to purchase much-needed foodstuffs and other supplies. In September 1915, the first public loan, the $500,000,000 Anglo-French loan, was floated after negotiations with the [[Anglo-French Financial Commission]]. Concomitantly, the resulting trade in munitions with England and France carried the United States from a depression in 1914 to boom years in 1915 and 1916.<ref>[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/barnesww1.shtml Harry Elmer Barnes: The World War of 1914\u20131918] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201051/http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/barnesww1.shtml |date=2007-09-27 }} at tmh.floonet.net</ref>\n\n[[Hillsboro, North Dakota]]; [[Hill County, Montana]]; and [[Hillyard, Spokane, Washington|Hillyard, Washington]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Meany|first=Edmond S.|title=Origin of Washington geographic names|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027074981;view=1up;seq=130|year=1923|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|page=114}}</ref> (now a neighborhood of [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]), are named for him.\n\nIn 1929, the Great Northern Railway inaugurated a long-distance passenger train extending from Chicago to Seattle, and named it the ''[[Empire Builder]]'' in his honor.

It was designed by [[James Brodie (architect)|James Brodie]], who also built the Hill house on Summit Avenue. The 1887 building was converted between 2000 and 2004 to a 53 unit condo in the [[Lowertown Historic District (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Historic Lowertown District of St. Paul]].<ref>[http://www.yourstpaulhome.com/GreatNorthernLofts Great Northern Lofts - Condo and Loft Directory] at http://www.yourstpaulhome.com</ref> Hill had seen the devastation done downtown by the [[Great Chicago Fire]]. As a result, one feature Hill integrated into the construction of the 1887 company headquarters (the Great Northern General Office Building) was barrel-vaulted ceilings constructed of brick and railroad steel rails that held up a layer of sand several inches deep. The theory was that if a fire broke out and the ceiling caved in, the sand would drop and retard or suppress the fire.\n\nHill was intimately involved in the planning and construction (1914\u20131916) of a new company headquarters in St. Paul (to be known as the Great Northern Office Building), which was to house the corporate staffs of the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific and Hill's banking enterprises. The 14-story building cost $14 million to construct.\n\nHill's heirs established the [[James J.
