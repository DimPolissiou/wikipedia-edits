It is sometimes also known as the ''[[isentropic]] expansion factor'' and is denoted by {{math|\u03b3}} ([[Gamma (letter)|gamma]]) for an ideal gas<ref group=note>\u03b3 first appeared in a paper by the French mathematician, engineer, and physicist [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]]:  \n*  {{cite journal |last1=Poisson |title=M\u00e9moire sur la th\u00e9orie du son |journal=Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique |date=1808 |volume=7 |issue=14 |pages=319\u2013392 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074785588&view=1up&seq=327 |trans-title=Memoir on the theory of sound |language=French}}  On p. 332, Poisson defines \u03b3 merely as a small deviation from equilibrium which causes small variations of the equilibrium value of the density \u03c1. \nIn Poisson's paper of 1823 \u2013\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Poisson |title=Sur la vitesse du son |journal=Annales de chimie et de physique |date=1823 |volume=23 |pages=5\u201316 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858046217836&view=1up&seq=11 |series=2nd series |trans-title=On the speed of sound |language=French}}\n\u03b3 was expressed as a function of density D (p. 8) or of pressure P (p. 9).<br> \nMeanwhile, in 1816 the French mathematician and physicist [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] had found that the speed of sound depends on the ratio of the specific heats.\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Laplace |title=Sur la vitesse du son dans l'air et dans l'eau |journal=Annales de chimie et de physique |date=1816 |volume=3 |pages=238\u2013241 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hx3dvc&view=1up&seq=244 |series=2nd series |trans-title=On the speed of sound in air and in water |language=French}}\nHowever, he didn't denote the ratio as \u03b3.<br>\nIn 1825, Laplace stated that the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the specific heats:\n*  {{cite book |last1=Laplace |first1=P.S. |title=Trait\u00e9 de mecanique celeste |trans-title=Treatise on celestial mechanics |date=1825 |publisher=Bachelier |location=Paris, France |volume=vol. 5 |pages=127\u2013137 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t9d532b05&view=1up&seq=137 |language=French}}  On p. 127, Laplace defines the symbols for the specific heats, and on p. 137 (at the bottom of the page), Laplace presents the equation for the speed of sound in a perfect gas.\nIn 1851, the Scottish mechanical engineer [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] showed that the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of Poisson's \u03b3:\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Rankine |first1=William John Macquorn |title=On Laplace's ''Theory of Sound'' |journal=Philosophical Magazine |date=1851 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=225\u2013227 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951000614090i&view=1up&seq=239 |series=4th series}}\nIt follows that Poisson's \u03b3 is the ratio of the specific heats \u2014 although Rankine didn't state that explicitly.\n*  See also:  {{cite book |last1=Krehl |first1=Peter O.

The symbol gamma is used by aerospace and chemical engineers.\n\n:<math> \\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V} = \\frac{\\bar{C}_P}{\\bar{C}_V} = \\frac{c_P}{c_V} </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|C}} is the heat capacity, <math>{\\bar{C}}</math> the [[molar heat capacity]] (heat capacity per mol of a gas) and {{mvar|c}} the [[specific heat capacity]] (heat capacity per unit mass) of a gas. The suffixes {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|V}} refer to constant pressure and constant volume conditions respectively.\n\nThe heat capacity ratio is important for its applications in [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|thermodynamical reversible processes]], especially involving [[ideal gases]]; the [[speed of sound]] depends on that factor.\n\nTo understand this relation, consider the following [[thought experiment]]. A closed [[pneumatic cylinder]] contains air. The [[piston]] is locked. The pressure inside is equal to atmospheric pressure. This cylinder is heated to a certain target temperature. Since the piston cannot move, the volume is constant. The temperature and pressure will rise. When the target temperature is reached, the heating is stopped. The amount of energy added equals {{math|''C<sub>V</sub>''\u0394''T''}}, with {{math|\u0394''T''}} representing the change in temperature.  The piston is now freed and moves outwards, stopping as the pressure inside the chamber reaches atmospheric pressure.  We assume the expansion occurs without exchange of heat ([[Adiabatic process|adiabatic expansion]]). Doing this [[Mechanical work|work]], air inside the cylinder will cool to below the target temperature. To return to the target temperature (still with a free piston), the air must be heated, but is no longer under constant volume, since the piston is free to move as the gas is reheated. This extra heat amounts to about 40% more than the previous amount added. In this example, the amount of heat added with a locked piston is proportional to {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}}, whereas the total amount of heat added is proportional to {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}}. Therefore, the heat capacity ratio in this example is 1.4.\n\nAnother way of understanding the difference between {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}} and {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} is that {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}} applies if work is done to the system, which causes a change in volume (such as by moving a piston so as to compress the contents of a cylinder), or if work is done by the system, which changes its temperature (such as heating the gas in a cylinder to cause a piston to move). {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} applies only if {{mvar|P dV}} \u2013 that is, the work done \u2013 is zero. Consider the difference between adding heat to the gas with a locked piston and adding heat with a piston free to move, so that pressure remains constant. In the second case, the gas will both heat and expand, causing the piston to do mechanical work on the atmosphere. The heat that is added to the gas goes only partly into heating the gas, while the rest is transformed into the mechanical work performed by the piston. In the first, constant-volume case (locked piston) there is no external motion, and thus no mechanical work is done on the atmosphere; {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} is used. In the second case, additional work is done as the volume changes, so the amount of heat required to raise the gas temperature (the specific heat capacity) is higher for this constant pressure case.\n\n== Ideal gas relations ==\n\nFor an ideal gas, the heat capacity is constant with temperature. Accordingly, we can express the [[enthalpy]]  as {{math|1=''H'' = ''C<sub>P</sub>T''}} and the [[internal energy]] as {{math|1=''U'' = ''C<sub>V</sub>T''}}. Thus, it can also be said that the heat capacity ratio is the ratio between the enthalpy to the internal energy:\n:<math> \\gamma = \\frac{H}{U}\\, .</math>\n\nFurthermore, the heat capacities can be expressed in terms of heat capacity ratio ({{math|\u03b3}}) and the [[gas constant]] ({{mvar|R}}):\n:<math> C_P = \\frac{\\gamma n R}{\\gamma - 1} \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad C_V = \\frac{n R}{\\gamma - 1}\\, ,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|n}} is the [[amount of substance]]  in moles.\n\n[[Mayer's relation]] allows to deduce the value of {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} from the more commonly tabulated value of {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}}:\n:<math>C_V = C_P - nR\\, .</math>\n\n=== Relation with degrees of freedom ===\nThe heat capacity ratio ({{math|\u03b3}}) for an ideal gas can be related to the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] ({{mvar|&thinsp;f&thinsp;}}) of a molecule by\n:<math> \\gamma = 1 + \\frac{2}{f},\\quad \\text{or} \\quad f = \\frac{2}{\\gamma - 1}.</math>\n\nThus we observe that for a [[monatomic]] gas, with 3 degrees of freedom:\n:<math> \\gamma = \\frac{5}{3} = 1.6666\\ldots,</math>\n\nwhile for a [[diatomic]] gas, with 5 degrees of freedom (at room temperature: 3 translational and 2 [[rotational degrees of freedom]]; the vibrational degree of freedom is not involved, except at high temperatures):\n:<math> \\gamma = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4.</math>\n\nFor example, the terrestrial air is primarily made up of [[diatomic]] gases (around 78% [[nitrogen]], N<sub>2</sub>, and 21% [[oxygen]], O<sub>2</sub>), and at standard conditions it can be considered to be an ideal gas. The above value of 1.4 is highly consistent with the measured adiabatic indices for dry air within a temperature range of 0\u2013200&nbsp;\u00b0C, exhibiting a deviation of only 0.2% (see tabulation above).\n\n== Real-gas relations ==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nAs temperature increases, higher-energy rotational and vibrational states become accessible to molecular gases, thus increasing the number of degrees of freedom and lowering {{math|\u03b3}}. For a real gas, both {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}} and {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} increase with increasing temperature, while continuing to differ from each other by a fixed constant (as above, {{math|1=''C<sub>P</sub>'' = ''C<sub>V</sub>'' + ''nR''}}), which reflects the relatively constant {{mvar|PV}} difference in work done during expansion for constant pressure vs. constant volume conditions. Thus, the ratio of the two values, {{math|\u03b3}}, decreases with increasing temperature. For more information on mechanisms for storing heat in gases, see the gas section of [[specific heat capacity]]. While at 273 K (0&nbsp;\u00b0C), Monatomic gases such as the noble gases He, Ne, and Ar all have the same value of {{math|\u03b3}}, that being 1.664. However, once you start getting in to diatomic gases and gas compounds, the values for {{math|\u03b3}} change quite often.\n\n== Thermodynamic expressions ==\n\nValues based on approximations (particularly {{math|1=''C<sub>P</sub>'' \u2212 ''C<sub>V</sub>'' = ''nR''}}) are in many cases not sufficiently accurate for practical engineering calculations, such as flow rates through pipes and valves. An experimental value should be used rather than one based on this approximation, where possible.

It is sometimes also known as the ''[[isentropic]] expansion factor'' and is denoted by {{math|\u03b3}} ([[Gamma (letter)|gamma]]) for an ideal gas<ref group=note>\u03b3 first appeared in a paper by the French mathematician, engineer, and physicist [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]]:  \n*  {{cite journal |last1=Poisson |title=M\u00e9moire sur la th\u00e9orie du son |journal=Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique |date=1808 |volume=7 |issue=14 |pages=319\u2013392 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074785588&view=1up&seq=327 |trans-title=Memoir on the theory of sound |language=French}}  On p. 332, Poisson defines \u03b3 merely as a small deviation from equilibrium which causes small variations of the equilibrium value of the density \u03c1. \nIn Poisson's paper of 1823 \u2013\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Poisson |title=Sur la vitesse du son |journal=Annales de chimie et de physique |date=1823 |volume=23 |pages=5\u201316 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858046217836&view=1up&seq=11 |series=2nd series |trans-title=On the speed of sound |language=French}}\n\u03b3 was expressed as a function of density D (p. 8) or of pressure P (p. 9).<br> \nMeanwhile, in 1816 the French mathematician and physicist [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] had found that the speed of sound depends on the ratio of the specific heats.\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Laplace |title=Sur la vitesse du son dans l'air et dans l'eau |journal=Annales de chimie et de physique |date=1816 |volume=3 |pages=238\u2013241 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hx3dvc&view=1up&seq=244 |series=2nd series |trans-title=On the speed of sound in air and in water |language=French}}\nHowever, he didn't denote the ratio as \u03b3.<br>\nIn 1825, Laplace stated that the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the specific heats:\n*  {{cite book |last1=Laplace |first1=P.S. |title=Trait\u00e9 de mecanique celeste |trans-title=Treatise on celestial mechanics |date=1825 |publisher=Bachelier |location=Paris, France |volume=vol. 5 |pages=127\u2013137 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t9d532b05&view=1up&seq=137 |language=French}}  On p. 127, Laplace defines the symbols for the specific heats, and on p. 137 (at the bottom of the page), Laplace presents the equation for the speed of sound in a perfect gas.\nIn 1851, the Scottish mechanical engineer [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] showed that the speed of sound is proportional to the square root of Poisson's \u03b3:\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Rankine |first1=William John Macquorn |title=On Laplace's ''Theory of Sound'' |journal=Philosophical Magazine |date=1851 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=225\u2013227 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951000614090i&view=1up&seq=239 |series=4th series}}\nIt follows that Poisson's \u03b3 is the ratio of the specific heats \u2014 although Rankine didn't state that explicitly.\n*  See also:  {{cite book |last1=Krehl |first1=Peter O.

The symbol gamma is used by aerospace and chemical engineers.\n\n:<math> \\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V} = \\frac{\\bar{C}_P}{\\bar{C}_V} = \\frac{c_P}{c_V} </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|C}} is the heat capacity, <math>{\\bar{C}}</math> the [[molar heat capacity]] (heat capacity per mol of a gas) and {{mvar|c}} the [[specific heat capacity]] (heat capacity per unit mass) of a gas. The suffixes {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|V}} refer to constant pressure and constant volume conditions respectively.\n\nThe heat capacity ratio is important for its applications in [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|thermodynamical reversible processes]], especially involving [[ideal gases]]; the [[speed of sound]] depends on that factor.\n\nTo understand this relation, consider the following [[thought experiment]]. A closed [[pneumatic cylinder]] contains air. The [[piston]] is locked. The pressure inside is equal to atmospheric pressure. This cylinder is heated to a certain target temperature. Since the piston cannot move, the volume is constant. The temperature and pressure will rise. When the target temperature is reached, the heating is stopped. The amount of energy added equals {{math|''C<sub>V</sub>''\u0394''T''}}, with {{math|\u0394''T''}} representing the change in temperature.  The piston is now freed and moves outwards, stopping as the pressure inside the chamber reaches atmospheric pressure.  We assume the expansion occurs without exchange of heat ([[Adiabatic process|adiabatic expansion]]). Doing this [[Mechanical work|work]], air inside the cylinder will cool to below the target temperature. To return to the target temperature (still with a free piston), the air must be heated, but is no longer under constant volume, since the piston is free to move as the gas is reheated. This extra heat amounts to about 40% more than the previous amount added. In this example, the amount of heat added with a locked piston is proportional to {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}}, whereas the total amount of heat added is proportional to {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}}. Therefore, the heat capacity ratio in this example is 1.4.\n\nAnother way of understanding the difference between {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}} and {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} is that {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}} applies if work is done to the system, which causes a change in volume (such as by moving a piston so as to compress the contents of a cylinder), or if work is done by the system, which changes its temperature (such as heating the gas in a cylinder to cause a piston to move). {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} applies only if {{mvar|P dV}} \u2013 that is, the work done \u2013 is zero. Consider the difference between adding heat to the gas with a locked piston and adding heat with a piston free to move, so that pressure remains constant. In the second case, the gas will both heat and expand, causing the piston to do mechanical work on the atmosphere. The heat that is added to the gas goes only partly into heating the gas, while the rest is transformed into the mechanical work performed by the piston. In the first, constant-volume case (locked piston) there is no external motion, and thus no mechanical work is done on the atmosphere; {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} is used. In the second case, additional work is done as the volume changes, so the amount of heat required to raise the gas temperature (the specific heat capacity) is higher for this constant pressure case.\n\n== Ideal gas relations ==\n\nFor an ideal gas, the heat capacity is constant with temperature. Accordingly, we can express the [[enthalpy]]  as {{math|1=''H'' = ''C<sub>P</sub>T''}} and the [[internal energy]] as {{math|1=''U'' = ''C<sub>V</sub>T''}}. Thus, it can also be said that the heat capacity ratio is the ratio between the enthalpy to the internal energy:\n:<math> \\gamma = \\frac{H}{U}\\, .</math>\n\nFurthermore, the heat capacities can be expressed in terms of heat capacity ratio ({{math|\u03b3}}) and the [[gas constant]] ({{mvar|R}}):\n:<math> C_P = \\frac{\\gamma n R}{\\gamma - 1} \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad C_V = \\frac{n R}{\\gamma - 1}\\, ,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|n}} is the [[amount of substance]]  in moles.\n\n[[Mayer's relation]] allows to deduce the value of {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} from the more commonly tabulated value of {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}}:\n:<math>C_V = C_P - nR\\, .</math>\n\n=== Relation with degrees of freedom ===\nThe heat capacity ratio ({{math|\u03b3}}) for an ideal gas can be related to the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] ({{mvar|&thinsp;f&thinsp;}}) of a molecule by\n:<math> \\gamma = 1 + \\frac{2}{f},\\quad \\text{or} \\quad f = \\frac{2}{\\gamma - 1}.</math>\n\nThus we observe that for a [[monatomic]] gas, with 3 degrees of freedom:\n:<math> \\gamma = \\frac{5}{3} = 1.6666\\ldots,</math>\n\nwhile for a [[diatomic]] gas, with 5 degrees of freedom (at room temperature: 3 translational and 2 [[rotational degrees of freedom]]; the vibrational degree of freedom is not involved, except at high temperatures):\n:<math> \\gamma = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4.</math>\n\nFor example, the terrestrial air is primarily made up of [[diatomic]] gases (around 78% [[nitrogen]], N<sub>2</sub>, and 21% [[oxygen]], O<sub>2</sub>), and at standard conditions it can be considered to be an ideal gas. The above value of 1.4 is highly consistent with the measured adiabatic indices for dry air within a temperature range of 0\u2013200&nbsp;\u00b0C, exhibiting a deviation of only 0.2% (see tabulation above).\n\n== Real-gas relations ==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nAs temperature increases, higher-energy rotational and vibrational states become accessible to molecular gases, thus increasing the number of degrees of freedom and lowering {{math|\u03b3}}. For a real gas, both {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}} and {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} increase with increasing temperature, while continuing to differ from each other by a fixed constant (as above, {{math|1=''C<sub>P</sub>'' = ''C<sub>V</sub>'' + ''nR''}}), which reflects the relatively constant {{mvar|PV}} difference in work done during expansion for constant pressure vs. constant volume conditions. Thus, the ratio of the two values, {{math|\u03b3}}, decreases with increasing temperature. For more information on mechanisms for storing heat in gases, see the gas section of [[specific heat capacity]]. While at 273 K (0&nbsp;\u00b0C), Monatomic gases such as the noble gases He, Ne, and Ar all have the same value of {{math|\u03b3}}, that being 1.664. However, once you start getting in to diatomic gases and gas compounds, the values for {{math|\u03b3}} change quite often.\n\n== Thermodynamic expressions ==\n\nValues based on approximations (particularly {{math|1=''C<sub>P</sub>'' \u2212 ''C<sub>V</sub>'' = ''nR''}}) are in many cases not sufficiently accurate for practical engineering calculations, such as flow rates through pipes and valves. An experimental value should be used rather than one based on this approximation, where possible. A rigorous value for the ratio {{mvar|{{sfrac|C<sub>P</sub>|C<sub>V</sub>}}}} can also be calculated by determining {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} from the residual properties expressed as\n\n:<math> C_P - C_V = -T \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_P^2}{\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_T} = -T \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V^2}{\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_T}.</math>\n\nValues for {{mvar|C<sub>P</sub>}} are readily available and recorded, but values for {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} need to be determined via relations such as these. See [[relations between specific heats]] for the derivation of the thermodynamic relations between the heat capacities.\n\nThe above definition is the approach used to develop rigorous expressions from equations of state (such as [[Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state|Peng\u2013Robinson]]), which match experimental values so closely that there is little need to develop a database of ratios or {{mvar|C<sub>V</sub>}} values.

[[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] buys [[Uncle Fester|Fester]] time to evacuate Gomez, Morticia, and [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]. Gomez and Morticia decide to move to [[New Jersey]], a place \"no one would be caught dead in.\" There, Gomez, Morticia, and Thing find their \"perfect\" home in an abandoned asylum on a hill. They meet [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], an escaped mental patient whom they hit when Thing was distracted driving the car, and immediately recruit him as their butler.\n\nThirteen years later, the Addams family continue to live their gloomy lives in isolation from the outside world. Gomez prepares his son [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] for his upcoming [[Mazurka]], a rite of passage that every Addams family member takes. Morticia struggles to keep their daughter, [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], from wanting to experience the world outside of the mansion after a balloon and confetti appear on their property, as the fog surrounding it begins to lift.\n\nElsewhere, reality TV host Margaux Needler, who is building a perfect [[planned community]] called \"Assimilation\" so her show will have a successful season finale, discovers the Addams family's household and becomes determined to rid the town of it when the family refuses to change. Wednesday then meets Margaux's neglected daughter Parker and convinces Morticia to let her attend junior high school. Pugsley struggles with the complicated traditions and pressure of his Mazurka, even with the guidance of Gomez and Uncle Fester. Grandmama arrives at the house for the event.\n\nAt school, Wednesday defends Parker and her twin friends Layla and Kayla from the school bully named Bethany and befriends them after she resurrects some [[dissection|dead frogs]] and commands them to attack Bethany. Later on, the two discuss their frustrations and change their dressing habits \u2013 Parker becomes more [[Goth subculture|gothic]] and Wednesday dresses more colorfully \u2013 to the shock of both of their mothers. After an argument with Morticia, Wednesday decides to run away in secret and stay with Parker for a while, which Pugsley inadvertently tells Morticia.\n\nWednesday and Parker discover a secret room under Parker's house revealing that Margaux has planted hidden cameras in every house she designed in town and has been spreading rumors about the Addams family through social media, claiming that they are freaks. Margaux catches the two and locks them in the attic, but Wednesday breaks them out. Margaux rallies an angry mob to attack the mansion just as [[Cousin Itt]] and the entire Addams clan arrive for Pugsley's Mazurka.\n\nDuring the Mazurka, Pugsley fails miserably in front of the whole family, but Gomez reassures him that he is an Addams nonetheless. The mob arrives flinging boulders, severely damaging the mansion and trapping the family inside. Pugsley uses his love of bombs and destruction to defend his family and manages to destroy the mob's [[trebuchet]]. Wednesday and Parker join in and help everyone out of the wreckage safely with help of the living tree Ichabod.\n\nAs Margaux tries to take control once more, her treachery is revealed by Parker. They see that the Addams are not monsters, but a family, and Wednesday states that everyone is weird in their own unique way. Margaux's agent Glenn carries a message from the network stating that her show is now cancelled because Parker was live streaming the whole thing with her phone. As Fester comes up with a compromise to Margaux, Assimilation's civilians realize the error of their ways.\n\nAfter they work together to rebuild the mansion, the Addams family and Assimilation's civilians live in peace. Margaux becomes Fester's business partner selling homes to the other members of the Addams clan. Pugsley completes his Mazurka.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as [[Gomez Addams]], Morticia's husband.\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Morticia Addams|Morticia Addams (n\u00e9e Frump)]], Gomez's wife.\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as [[Wednesday Addams]], Gomez and Morticia's daughter.\n* [[Finn Wolfhard]] as [[Pugsley Addams]], Gomez and Morticia's son.\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as [[Uncle Fester]], Gomez's brother.\n* [[Bette Midler]] as [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama Addams]], Gomez and Fester's mother\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as:\n** [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], the Addams Family's butler.\n** An unnamed [[priest]] that presides over Gomez and Morticia's wedding and is one of their relatives.\n** The spirit that haunts the abandoned asylum that Gomez and Morticia move into.\n** Dr. Flambe, a [[devil]]-like relative of the Addams family whose head can light on fire.\n* [[Snoop Dogg]] as [[Cousin Itt]], Gomez and Fester's hairy cousin.\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Margaux Needler, a sly and greedy reality TV show host and homemaking [[guru]].\n* [[Tituss Burgess]] as Glenn, Margaux's agent.\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Great Auntie Sloom, Grandmama's sister with a missing left eye and has stilts under her dress.\n* [[Elsie Fisher]] as Parker Needler, Margaux's neglected and rebellious daughter who befriends Wednesday.\n* [[Martin Short]] as Grandpa Frump, Morticia's late father who Morticia contacts through a [[s\u00e9ance]].\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Grandma Frump, Morticia's late mother who Morticia contacts through a s\u00e9ance.\n* [[Aimee Garcia]] as Denise, a camera operator who works for Margaux.\n* [[Scott Underwood]] as Mitch, a member of Margaux's film crew.\n* [[Mikey Madison]] as Candi, a [[barista]].\n* Chelsea Frei as Bethany, a girl who picks on Parker.\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as Layla and Kayla, twin girls who are Parker's friends.\n* [[Deven Green]] as Ms. Gravely, a teacher at Parker's school.\n* [[Maggie Wheeler]] as Trudy Pickering, an inhabitant of Assimilation.\n* [[Harland Williams]] as Norman Pickering, the husband of Trudy.\n** Williams also voices Ggerri.\n\n==Production==\nIn 2010, after [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]] acquired the rights to ''The Addams Family'' comics, they began work on the film at [[Universal Pictures]] as a [[stop-motion]] animation directed by [[Tim Burton]] and produced by [[Chris Meledandri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2010/03/tim-burton-next-3d-animated-film-da-da-da-snap-snap-the-addams-family-28841/|title=Tim Burton's Next 3D Animated Film?

[[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] buys [[Uncle Fester|Fester]] time to evacuate Gomez, Morticia, and [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]. Gomez and Morticia decide to move to [[New Jersey]], a place \"no one would be caught dead in.\" There, Gomez, Morticia, and Thing find their \"perfect\" home in an abandoned asylum on a hill. They meet [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], an escaped mental patient whom they hit when Thing was distracted driving the car, and immediately recruit him as their butler.\n\nThirteen years later, the Addams family continue to live their gloomy lives in isolation from the outside world. Gomez prepares his son [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] for his upcoming [[Mazurka]], a rite of passage that every Addams family member takes. Morticia struggles to keep their daughter, [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], from wanting to experience the world outside of the mansion after a balloon and confetti appear on their property, as the fog surrounding it begins to lift.\n\nElsewhere, reality TV host Margaux Needler, who is building a perfect [[planned community]] called \"Assimilation\" so her show will have a successful season finale, discovers the Addams family's household and becomes determined to rid the town of it when the family refuses to change. Wednesday then meets Margaux's neglected daughter Parker and convinces Morticia to let her attend junior high school. Pugsley struggles with the complicated traditions and pressure of his Mazurka, even with the guidance of Gomez and Uncle Fester. Grandmama arrives at the house for the event.\n\nAt school, Wednesday defends Parker and her twin friends Layla and Kayla from the school bully named Bethany and befriends them after she resurrects some [[dissection|dead frogs]] and commands them to attack Bethany. Later on, the two discuss their frustrations and change their dressing habits \u2013 Parker becomes more [[Goth subculture|gothic]] and Wednesday dresses more colorfully \u2013 to the shock of both of their mothers. After an argument with Morticia, Wednesday decides to run away in secret and stay with Parker for a while, which Pugsley inadvertently tells Morticia.\n\nWednesday and Parker discover a secret room under Parker's house revealing that Margaux has planted hidden cameras in every house she designed in town and has been spreading rumors about the Addams family through social media, claiming that they are freaks. Margaux catches the two and locks them in the attic, but Wednesday breaks them out. Margaux rallies an angry mob to attack the mansion just as [[Cousin Itt]] and the entire Addams clan arrive for Pugsley's Mazurka.\n\nDuring the Mazurka, Pugsley fails miserably in front of the whole family, but Gomez reassures him that he is an Addams nonetheless. The mob arrives flinging boulders, severely damaging the mansion and trapping the family inside. Pugsley uses his love of bombs and destruction to defend his family and manages to destroy the mob's [[trebuchet]]. Wednesday and Parker join in and help everyone out of the wreckage safely with help of the living tree Ichabod.\n\nAs Margaux tries to take control once more, her treachery is revealed by Parker. They see that the Addams are not monsters, but a family, and Wednesday states that everyone is weird in their own unique way. Margaux's agent Glenn carries a message from the network stating that her show is now cancelled because Parker was live streaming the whole thing with her phone. As Fester comes up with a compromise to Margaux, Assimilation's civilians realize the error of their ways.\n\nAfter they work together to rebuild the mansion, the Addams family and Assimilation's civilians live in peace. Margaux becomes Fester's business partner selling homes to the other members of the Addams clan. Pugsley completes his Mazurka.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as [[Gomez Addams]], Morticia's husband.\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Morticia Addams|Morticia Addams (n\u00e9e Frump)]], Gomez's wife.\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as [[Wednesday Addams]], Gomez and Morticia's daughter.\n* [[Finn Wolfhard]] as [[Pugsley Addams]], Gomez and Morticia's son.\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as [[Uncle Fester]], Gomez's brother.\n* [[Bette Midler]] as [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama Addams]], Gomez and Fester's mother\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as:\n** [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], the Addams Family's butler.\n** An unnamed [[priest]] that presides over Gomez and Morticia's wedding and is one of their relatives.\n** The spirit that haunts the abandoned asylum that Gomez and Morticia move into.\n** Dr. Flambe, a [[devil]]-like relative of the Addams family whose head can light on fire.\n* [[Snoop Dogg]] as [[Cousin Itt]], Gomez and Fester's hairy cousin.\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Margaux Needler, a sly and greedy reality TV show host and homemaking [[guru]].\n* [[Martin Short]] as Grandpa Frump, Morticia's late father who Morticia contacts through a [[s\u00e9ance]].\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Grandma Frump, Morticia's late mother who Morticia contacts through a s\u00e9ance.\n* [[Tituss Burgess]] as Glenn, Margaux's agent.\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Great Auntie Sloom, Grandmama's sister with a missing left eye and has stilts under her dress.\n* [[Elsie Fisher]] as Parker Needler, Margaux's neglected and rebellious daughter who befriends Wednesday.\n* [[Aimee Garcia]] as Denise, a camera operator who works for Margaux.\n* [[Scott Underwood]] as Mitch, a member of Margaux's film crew.\n* [[Mikey Madison]] as Candi, a [[barista]].\n* Chelsea Frei as Bethany, a girl who picks on Parker.\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as Layla and Kayla, twin girls who are Parker's friends.\n* [[Deven Green]] as Ms. Gravely, a teacher at Parker's school.\n* [[Maggie Wheeler]] as Trudy Pickering, an inhabitant of Assimilation.\n* [[Harland Williams]] as:\n** Norman Pickering, the husband of Trudy.\n** Ggerri\n\n==Production==\nIn 2010, after [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]] acquired the rights to ''The Addams Family'' comics, they began work on the film at [[Universal Pictures]] as a [[stop-motion]] animation directed by [[Tim Burton]] and produced by [[Chris Meledandri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2010/03/tim-burton-next-3d-animated-film-da-da-da-snap-snap-the-addams-family-28841/|title=Tim Burton's Next 3D Animated Film?
