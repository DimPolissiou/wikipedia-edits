Dustin Roberts, a 379th Air Expeditionary Wing Public Affairs broadcaster, checks his tires at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, Jan. 10, 2014 140110-Z-QD538-010.jpg|thumb|Checking tire pressure with a tire pressure gauge]]\n\n'''Pressure measurement''' is the analysis of an applied [[force]] by a [[fluid]] ([[liquid]] or [[gas]]) on a surface. [[Pressure]] is typically measured in units of force per unit of [[surface area]]. Many techniques have been developed for the measurement of pressure and [[vacuum]]. Instruments used to measure and display pressure in an integral unit are called '''pressure meters''' or '''pressure gauges''' or '''vacuum gauges'''. A '''manometer''' is a good example, as it uses the surface area and weight of a column of liquid to both measure and indicate pressure. Likewise the widely used Bourdon gauge is a mechanical device, which both measures and indicates and is probably the best known type of gauge.\n\nA vacuum gauge is a pressure gauge used to measure pressures lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure, which is set as the zero point, in negative values (e.g.: \u221215&nbsp;[[psig]] or \u2212760&nbsp;[[mmHg]] equals total vacuum). Most gauges measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure as the zero point, so this form of reading is simply referred to as \"gauge pressure\". However, anything greater than total vacuum is technically a form of pressure. For very accurate readings, especially at very low pressures, a gauge that uses total vacuum as the zero point may be used, giving pressure readings in an [[absolute scale]].\n\nOther methods of pressure measurement involve sensors that can transmit the pressure reading to a remote indicator or control system ([[telemetry]]).\n\n==Absolute, gauge and differential pressures \u2014 zero reference==\n{{Anchor|Absolute|Gauge|Differential|Absolute, gauge and differential}}\n\nEveryday pressure measurements, such as for vehicle tire pressure, are usually made relative to ambient air pressure. In other cases measurements are made relative to a vacuum or to some other specific reference. When distinguishing between these zero references, the following terms are used:\n*'''{{visible anchor|Absolute pressure}}''' is zero-referenced against a perfect vacuum, using an [[absolute scale]], so it is equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Gauge pressure}}''' is zero-referenced against ambient air pressure, so it is equal to absolute pressure minus atmospheric pressure. Negative signs are usually omitted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} To distinguish a negative pressure, the value may be appended with the word \"vacuum\" or the gauge may be labeled a \"vacuum gauge\". These are further divided into two subcategories: high and low vacuum (and sometimes [[ultra-high vacuum]]). The applicable pressure ranges of many of the techniques used to measure vacuums have an overlap. Hence, by combining several different types of gauge, it is possible to measure system pressure continuously from 10&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] down to 10<sup>\u221211</sup>&nbsp;mbar.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Differential pressure}}''' is the difference in pressure between two points.\n\nThe zero reference in use is usually implied by context, and these words are added only when clarification is needed. [[Tire-pressure gauge|Tire pressure]] and [[sphygmomanometer|blood pressure]] are gauge pressures by convention, while [[atmospheric pressure]]s, deep vacuum pressures, and [[altimeter|altimeter pressures]] must be absolute.\n\nFor most [[working fluid]]s where a fluid exists in a [[closed system]], gauge pressure measurement prevails. Pressure instruments connected to the system will indicate pressures relative to the current atmospheric pressure. The situation changes when extreme vacuum pressures are measured, then absolute pressures are typically used instead.\n\nDifferential pressures are commonly used in industrial process systems. Differential pressure gauges have two inlet ports, each connected to one of the volumes whose pressure is to be monitored.  In effect, such a gauge performs the mathematical operation of subtraction through mechanical means, obviating the need for an operator or control system to watch two separate gauges and determine the difference in readings.\n\nModerate vacuum pressure readings can be ambiguous without the proper context, as they may represent absolute pressure or gauge pressure without a negative sign. Thus a vacuum of 26&nbsp;inHg gauge is equivalent to an absolute pressure of 30&nbsp;inHg (typical atmospheric pressure) \u2212 26&nbsp;inHg = 4&nbsp;inHg.\n\nAtmospheric pressure is typically about 100&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] at sea level, but is variable with altitude and weather. If the absolute pressure of a fluid stays constant, the gauge pressure of the same fluid will vary as atmospheric pressure changes. For example, when a car drives up a mountain, the (gauge) tire pressure goes up because atmospheric pressure goes down. The absolute pressure in the tire is essentially unchanged.\n\nUsing atmospheric pressure as reference is usually signified by a \"g\" for gauge after the pressure unit, e.g. 70&nbsp;psig, which means that the pressure measured is the total pressure minus [[atmospheric pressure]].  There are two types of gauge reference pressure: vented gauge (vg) and sealed gauge (sg).\n\nA vented-gauge [[pressure transmitter]], for example, allows the outside air pressure to be exposed to the negative side of the pressure-sensing diaphragm, through a vented cable or a hole on the side of the device, so that it always measures the pressure referred to ambient [[barometric pressure]].  Thus a vented-gauge reference [[pressure sensor]] should always read zero pressure when the process pressure connection is held open to the air.\n\nA sealed gauge reference is very similar, except that atmospheric pressure is sealed on the negative side of the diaphragm.  This is usually adopted on high pressure ranges, such as [[hydraulics]], where atmospheric pressure changes will have a negligible effect on the accuracy of the reading, so venting is not necessary.  This also allows some manufacturers to provide secondary pressure containment as an extra precaution for pressure equipment safety if the burst pressure of the primary pressure sensing [[diaphragm seal|diaphragm]] is exceeded.\n\nThere is another way of creating a sealed gauge reference, and this is to seal a high [[vacuum]] on the reverse side of the sensing diaphragm.  Then the output signal is offset, so the pressure sensor reads close to zero when measuring atmospheric pressure.\n\nA sealed gauge reference [[pressure transducer]] will never read exactly zero because atmospheric pressure is always changing and the reference in this case is fixed at 1 bar.\n\nTo produce an [[absolute pressure sensor]], the manufacturer seals a high vacuum behind the sensing diaphragm. If the process-pressure connection of an absolute-pressure transmitter is open to the air, it will read the actual [[barometric pressure]].\n\n==Units==\n{{Pressure Units}}\n\n[[File:Psidial.jpg|thumb|A [[pressure gauge]] reading in [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (red scale) and [[kPa]] (black scale)]]\n\nThe [[SI]] unit for pressure is the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), equal to one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]] (N\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup> or kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>). This special name for the unit was added in 1971; before that, pressure in SI was expressed in units such as N\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup>. When indicated, the zero reference is stated in parenthesis following the unit, for example 101 kPa (abs). The [[pounds per square inch|pound per square inch]] (psi) is still in widespread use in the US and Canada, for measuring, for instance, tire pressure. A letter is often appended to the psi unit to indicate the measurement's zero reference; psia for absolute, psig for gauge, psid for differential, although this practice is discouraged by the [[NIST]].<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.4 NIST]</ref>\n\nBecause pressure was once commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (''e.g.,'' inches of water). Manometric measurement is the subject of [[pressure head]] calculations. The most common choices for a manometer's fluid are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's density allows for a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to measure a given pressure. The abbreviation \"W.C.\" or the words \"water column\" are often printed on gauges and measurements that use water for the manometer.\n\nFluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. So measurements in \"[[millimetres of mercury]]\" or \"[[inHg|inches of mercury]]\" can be converted to SI units as long as attention is paid to the local factors of fluid density and [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]]. Temperature fluctuations change the value of fluid density, while location can affect gravity.\n\nAlthough no longer preferred, these '''manometric units''' are still encountered in many fields. [[Blood pressure]] is measured in millimetres of mercury (see [[torr]]) in most of the world, [[central venous pressure]] and lung pressures in [[centimetre of water|centimeters of water]] are still common, as in settings for CPAP machines. Natural gas pipeline pressures are measured in [[inch of water|inches of water]], expressed as \"inches W.C.\"\n\n[[Underwater diving|Underwater divers]] use manometric units: the ambient pressure is measured in units of [[Metre sea water|metres sea water]] (msw) which is defined as equal to one tenth of a bar. {{sfn|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2016|loc=Table 2\u201110. Pressure Equivalents.}}<ref name=\"IMCA D022\" /> The unit used in the US is the '''foot sea water''' ('''fsw'''), based on [[standard gravity]] and a sea-water density of 64&nbsp;lb/ft<sup>3</sup>.

Pressure Equivalents.}}<ref name=\"IMCA D022\" /> though elsewhere it states that 33&nbsp;fsw is {{val|14.7|u=psi}} (one atmosphere), which gives one fsw equal to about 0.445&nbsp;psi.<ref>Page 2-12.</ref> The msw and fsw are the conventional units for measurement of [[Underwater diving|diver]] pressure exposure used in [[decompression tables]] and the unit of calibration for [[pneumofathometer]]s and [[hyperbaric chamber]] [[pressure gauge]]s.{{sfn|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2016|loc=Section 18\u20112.8.3}} Both msw and fsw are measured relative to normal atmospheric pressure.\n\nIn vacuum systems, the units [[torr]] (millimeter of mercury), [[Micron (disambiguation)|micron]] (micrometer of mercury),<ref>http://vacaero.com/information-resources/vacuum-pump-practice-with-howard-tring/1290-understanding-vacuum-measurement-units.html</ref> and inch of mercury ([[inHg]]) are most commonly used. Torr and micron usually indicates an absolute pressure, while inHg usually indicates a gauge pressure.\n\nAtmospheric pressures are usually stated using hectopascal (hPa), kilopascal (kPa), millibar (mbar) or atmospheres ([[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]). In American and Canadian engineering, [[Stress (physics)|stress]] is often measured in [[kip (unit)|kip]]. Note that stress is not a true pressure since it is not [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]. In the [[cgs]] system the unit of pressure was the [[barye]] (ba), equal to 1 dyn\u00b7cm<sup>\u22122</sup>. In the [[Metre-tonne-second system of units|mts]] system, the unit of  pressure was the [[pieze]], equal to 1 [[sthene]] per square metre.\n\nMany other hybrid units are used such as mmHg/cm<sup>2</sup> or grams-force/cm<sup>2</sup> (sometimes as [[kg/cm<sup>2</sup>]] without properly identifying the force units). Using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as a unit of force is prohibited in SI; the unit of force in SI is the newton (N).\n\n==Static and dynamic pressure==\n[[Static pressure]] is uniform in all directions, so pressure measurements are independent of direction in an immovable (static) fluid. Flow, however, applies additional pressure on surfaces perpendicular to the flow direction, while having little impact on surfaces parallel to the flow direction. This directional component of pressure in a moving (dynamic) fluid is called [[dynamic pressure]]. An instrument facing the flow direction measures the sum of the static and dynamic pressures; this measurement is called the [[total pressure]] or [[stagnation pressure]]. Since dynamic pressure is referenced to static pressure, it is neither gauge nor absolute; it is a differential pressure.\n\nWhile static gauge pressure is of primary importance to determining net loads on pipe walls, dynamic pressure is used to measure flow rates and airspeed. Dynamic pressure can be measured by taking the differential pressure between instruments parallel and perpendicular to the flow. [[Pitot tube|Pitot-static tube]]s, for example perform this measurement on airplanes to determine airspeed. The presence of the measuring instrument inevitably acts to divert flow and create turbulence, so its shape is critical to accuracy and the calibration curves are often non-linear.\n\n===Applications===\n* [[Altimeter]]\n* [[Barometer]]\n* [[Depth gauge]]\n* [[MAP sensor]]\n* [[Pitot tube]]\n* [[Sphygmomanometer]]\n\n==Instruments==\n[[File:Manometer anim 01.gif|thumb|A [[pressure gauge]] in action]]\n\nMany instruments have been invented to measure pressure, with different advantages and disadvantages. Pressure range, sensitivity, dynamic response and cost all vary by several orders of magnitude from one instrument design to the next. The oldest type is the liquid column (a vertical tube filled with mercury) manometer invented by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643.  The U-Tube was invented by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1661.\n\n===Hydrostatic===\n'''Hydrostatic''' gauges (such as the mercury column manometer) compare pressure to the hydrostatic force per unit area at the base of a column of fluid. Hydrostatic gauge measurements are independent of the type of gas being measured, and can be designed to have a very linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response.\n\n====Piston====\nPiston-type gauges counterbalance the pressure of a fluid with a spring (for example [[tire-pressure gauge]]s of comparatively low accuracy) or a solid weight, in which case it is known as a [[deadweight tester]] and may be used for calibration of other gauges.\n\n====Liquid column (manometer)====\n[[File:Utube.PNG|thumb|upright|The difference in fluid height in a liquid-column manometer is proportional to the pressure difference: <math>h = \\frac{P_a - P_o}{g \\rho}</math>]]\nLiquid-column gauges consist of a column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight (a force applied due to gravity) is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube (a force applied due to fluid pressure). A very simple version is a U-shaped tube half-full of liquid, one side of which is connected to the region of interest while the [[reference]] pressure (which might be the [[atmospheric pressure]] or a vacuum) is applied to the other. The difference in liquid levels represents the applied pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of fluid of height ''h'' and density ''\u03c1'' is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation, ''P'' = ''hg\u03c1''. Therefore, the pressure difference between the applied pressure ''P<sub>a</sub>'' and the reference pressure ''P''<sub>0</sub> in a U-tube manometer can be found by solving {{nowrap|''P<sub>a</sub>'' \u2212 ''P''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''hg\u03c1''}}. In other words, the pressure on either end of the liquid (shown in blue in the figure) must be balanced (since the liquid is static), and so {{nowrap|''P<sub>a</sub>'' {{=}}  ''P''<sub>0</sub> + ''hg\u03c1''}}.\n\nIn most liquid-column measurements, the result of the measurement is the height ''h'', expressed typically in mm, cm, or inches. The ''h'' is also known as the [[pressure head]]. When expressed as a pressure head, pressure is specified in units of length and the measurement fluid must be specified. When accuracy is critical, the temperature of the measurement fluid must likewise be specified, because liquid density is a function of [[temperature]]. So, for example, pressure head might be written \"742.2&nbsp;mm<sub>Hg</sub>\" or \"4.2&nbsp;in<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> at 59&nbsp;\u00b0F\" for measurements taken with mercury or water as the manometric fluid respectively. The word \"gauge\" or \"vacuum\" may be added to such a measurement to distinguish between a pressure above or below the atmospheric pressure. Both mm of mercury and inches of water are common pressure heads, which can be converted to S.I. units of pressure using [[unit conversion]] and the above formulas.\n\nIf the fluid being measured is significantly dense, hydrostatic corrections may have to be made for the height between the moving surface of the manometer working fluid and the location where the pressure measurement is desired, except when measuring differential pressure of a fluid (for example, across an [[orifice plate]] or venturi), in which case the density \u03c1 should be corrected by subtracting the density of the fluid being measured.<ref>{{cite book |title=Methods for the Measurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes, Part 1. Orifice Plates, Nozzles and Venturi Tubes |date=1964 |publisher=[[British Standards Institute]] |page=36}}</ref>\n\nAlthough any fluid can be used, [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is preferred for its high density (13.534&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and low [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]]. For low pressure differences, light oil or water are commonly used (the latter giving rise to units of measurement such as [[Inch of water|inches water gauge]] and [[Millimeters, water gauge|millimetres H<sub>2</sub>O]]. Liquid-column pressure gauges have a highly linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response because the fluid in the column may react slowly to a pressure change.\n\nWhen measuring vacuum, the working liquid may evaporate and contaminate the vacuum if its [[vapor pressure]] is too high. When measuring liquid pressure, a loop filled with gas or a light fluid can isolate the liquids to prevent them from mixing, but this can be unnecessary, for example, when mercury is used as the manometer fluid to measure differential pressure of a fluid such as water. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from a few [[torr]]s (a few 100&nbsp;Pa) to a few atmospheres (approximately {{val|1,000,000|u=Pa}}).\n\nA single-limb liquid-column manometer has a larger reservoir instead of one side of the U-tube and has a scale beside the narrower column. The column may be inclined to further amplify the liquid movement. Based on the use and structure, following types of manometers are used<ref name=manometer_types>[Was: \"fluidengineering.co.nr/Manometer.htm\". At 1/2010 that took me to bad link. Types of fluid Manometers]</ref>\n# Simple manometer\n# Micromanometer\n# Differential manometer\n# Inverted differential manometer\n\n====McLeod gauge====\n[[File:McLeod gauge.jpg|thumb|upright|A McLeod gauge, drained of mercury]]\n\nA [[McLeod gauge]] isolates a sample of gas and compresses it in a modified mercury manometer until the pressure is a few [[Millimeter of mercury|millimetres of mercury]]. The technique is very slow and unsuited to continual monitoring, but is capable of good accuracy. Unlike other manometer gauges, the McLeod gauge reading is dependent on the composition of the gas, since the interpretation relies on the sample compressing as an [[ideal gas]]. Due to the compression process, the McLeod gauge completely ignores partial pressures from non-ideal vapors that condense, such as pump oils, mercury, and even water if compressed enough.\n\n: '''Useful range''': from around 10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;Torr<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/~phchlab/experiments/vacuum/Techniques_of_high_vacuum/Vacuum5.html |title=Techniques of High Vacuum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504124236/http://www.tau.ac.il/~phchlab/experiments/vacuum/Techniques_of_high_vacuum/Vacuum5.html |website=[[Tel Aviv University]] |date=2006-05-04 |archivedate=2006-05-04}}</ref>  (roughly 10<sup>\u22122</sup>&nbsp;Pa) to vacuums as high as 10<sup>\u22126</sup>&nbsp;Torr (0.1&nbsp;mPa),\n\n0.1&nbsp;mPa is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology.

However, aneroid gauges can be used to measure the pressure of a liquid as well as a gas, and they are not the only type of gauge that can operate without fluid. For this reason, they are often called '''mechanical''' gauges in modern language. Aneroid gauges are not dependent on the type of gas being measured, unlike thermal and ionization gauges, and are less likely to contaminate the system than hydrostatic gauges. The pressure sensing element may be a '''Bourdon tube''', a diaphragm, a capsule, or a set of bellows, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. The deflection of the pressure sensing element may be read by a linkage connected to a needle, or it may be read by a secondary transducer. The most common secondary transducers in modern vacuum gauges measure a change in capacitance due to the mechanical deflection. Gauges that rely on a change in capacitance are often referred to as capacitance manometers.\n\n====Bourdon gauge====\n[[File:Manometer 104026.jpg|thumb|Membrane-type manometer]]\n\nThe Bourdon pressure gauge uses the principle that a flattened tube tends to straighten or regain its circular form in cross-section when pressurized. This change in cross-section may be hardly noticeable, involving moderate [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]es within the elastic range of easily workable materials. The [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] of the material of the tube is magnified by forming the tube into a C shape or even a helix, such that the entire tube tends to straighten out or uncoil elastically as it is pressurized. [[Eug\u00e8ne Bourdon]] patented his gauge in France in 1849, and it was widely adopted because of its superior sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy; Edward Ashcroft purchased Bourdon's American patent rights in 1852 and became a major manufacturer of gauges.  Also in 1849, Bernard Schaeffer in Magdeburg, Germany patented a successful diaphragm (see below) pressure gauge, which, together with the Bourdon gauge, revolutionized pressure measurement in industry.<ref>[http://www.archivingindustry.com/Indicator/discspring.htm  ''The Engine Indicator'' Canadian Museum of Making]</ref> But in 1875 after Bourdon's patents expired, his company [[Budenberg Gauge Company|Schaeffer and Budenberg]] also manufactured Bourdon tube gauges.\n\n[[File:E Bourdons Patent Compound Gauge.jpg|thumb|An original 19th century Eugene Bourdon compound gauge, reading pressure both below and above ambient with great sensitivity.]]In practice, a flattened thin-wall, closed-end tube is connected at the hollow end to a fixed pipe containing the fluid pressure to be measured. As the pressure increases, the closed end moves in an arc, and this motion is converted into the rotation of a (segment of a) gear by a connecting link that is usually adjustable. A small-diameter pinion gear is on the pointer shaft, so the motion is magnified further by the [[gear ratio]]. The positioning of the indicator card behind the pointer, the initial pointer shaft position, the linkage length and initial position, all provide means to calibrate the pointer to indicate the desired range of pressure for variations in the behavior of the Bourdon tube itself. Differential pressure can be measured by gauges containing two different Bourdon tubes, with connecting linkages.\n\nBourdon tubes measure [[gauge pressure]], relative to ambient atmospheric pressure, as opposed to [[absolute pressure]]; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below).  When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a [[reciprocating pump]], an [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or [[glycerin]]. Tapping on the face of the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of \u00b12% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Boyes |first = Walt |title = Instrumentation Reference Book |edition = Fourth |publisher = [[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |date = 2008 |pages = 1312}}</ref>\n\nForce-balanced fused quartz bourdon tube sensors work on the same principle but uses the reflection of a beam of light from a mirror to sense the angular displacement and current is applied to electromagnets to balance the force of the tube and bring the angular displacement back to zero, the current that is applied to the coils is used as the measurement. Due to the extremely stable and repeatable mechanical and thermal properties of quartz and the force balancing which eliminates nearly all physical movement these sensors can be accurate to around 1[[Parts per million|PPM]] of full scale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230966593_Characterization_of_quartz_Bourdon-type_high-pressure_transducers|title=(PDF) Characterization of quartz Bourdon-type high-pressure transducers|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref> Due to the extremely fine fused quartz structures which must be made by hand these sensors are generally limited to scientific and calibration purposes.\n\nIn the following illustrations the transparent cover face of the pictured combination pressure and vacuum gauge has been removed and the mechanism removed from the case.

A small motion of the tube results in a large motion of the indicator needle.\n# Hair spring to preload the gear train to eliminate gear lash and [[hysteresis]].\n\n====Diaphragm====\nA second type of aneroid gauge uses  [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of a flexible [[Artificial membrane|membrane]] that separates regions of different pressure. The amount of deflection is repeatable for known pressures so the pressure can be determined by using calibration. The deformation of a thin diaphragm is dependent on the difference in pressure between its two faces.  The reference face can be open to atmosphere to measure gauge pressure, open to a second port to measure differential pressure, or can be sealed against a vacuum or other fixed reference pressure to measure absolute pressure. The deformation can be measured using mechanical, optical or capacitive techniques. Ceramic and metallic diaphragms are used.\n:'''Useful range''': above 10<sup>\u22122</sup> [[Torr]] <ref name=schoonoverinc>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040102031317/http://schoonoverinc.com/PDFs/Sky%20Brochure.pdf Product brochure from Schoonover, Inc]</ref> (roughly 1 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]])\nFor absolute measurements, welded pressure capsules with diaphragms on either side are often used.\n\nshape:\n* Flat\n* Corrugated\n* Flattened tube\n* Capsule\n\n====Bellows====\n[[File:Barograph 03.jpg|thumb|A pile of pressure capsules with corrugated diaphragms in an aneroid [[barograph]]]]\n\nIn gauges intended to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may be driven by an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an '''aneroid''', which means \"without liquid\". (Early [[barometer]]s used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]] suspended by a [[vacuum]].) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), [[altimeter]]s, altitude recording [[barograph]]s, and the altitude [[telemetry]] instruments used in [[weather balloon]] [[radiosonde]]s. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as [[airspeed indicator|air speed indicators]] and rate of climb indicators ([[variometer]]s) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.\n\n====Magnetic coupling====\nThese gauges use the attraction of two magnets to translate differential pressure into motion of a dial pointer. As differential pressure increases, a magnet attached to either a piston or rubber diaphragm moves. A rotary magnet that is attached to a pointer then moves in unison. To create different pressure ranges, the spring rate can be increased or decreased.\n\n===Spinning-rotor gauge===\nThe spinning-rotor gauge works by measuring the amount a rotating ball is slowed by the viscosity of the gas being measured.  The ball is made of steel and is magnetically levitated inside a steel tube closed at one end and exposed to the gas to be measured at the other.  The ball is brought up to speed (about 2500&nbsp;[[radian|rad]]/s), and the speed measured after switching off the drive, by electromagnetic transducers.<ref>A. Chambers, ''Basic Vacuum Technology'', pp. 100\u2013102, CRC Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0585254915}}.</ref>  The range of the instrument is 10<sup>\u22125</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Pa (10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Pa with less accuracy).  It is accurate and stable enough to be used as a [[secondary standard]].  The instrument requires some skill and knowledge to use correctly.  Various corrections must be applied and the ball must be spun at a pressure well below the intended measurement pressure for five hours before using.  It is most useful in calibration and research laboratories where high accuracy is required and qualified technicians are available.<ref>John F. O'Hanlon, ''A User's Guide to Vacuum Technology'', pp. 92\u201394, John Wiley & Sons, 2005. {{ISBN|0471467154}}.</ref>\n\n==Electronic pressure instruments{{anchor|Electronic}}==\n{{Main|Pressure sensor}}\n{{merge from|Pressure sensor|date=February 2019}}\n\n; Metal strain gauge\n:The strain gauge is generally glued (foil strain gauge) or deposited (thin-film strain gauge) onto a membrane. Membrane deflection due to pressure causes a resistance change in the strain gauge which can be electronically measured.\n; Piezoresistive strain gauge\n:Uses the [[piezoresistive]] effect of bonded or formed strain gauges to detect strain due to applied pressure.\n; Piezoresistive Silicon Pressure Sensor\n:The Sensor is generally a temperature compensated, [[piezoresistive]] silicon pressure sensor chosen for its excellent performance and long-term stability. Integral temperature compensation is provided over a range of 0-50\u00b0C using laser-trimmed resistors. An additional laser-trimmed resistor is included to normalize pressure sensitivity variations by programming the gain of an external differential amplifier. This provides good sensitivity and long-term stability. The two ports of the sensor, apply pressure to the same single transducer, please see pressure flow diagram below.\n[[File:Piezoresistive Silicon Pressure Sensor.png|thumb]]\nThis is an over simplified diagram, but you can see fundamental design of the internal ports in the sensor. The important item here to note is the \u201cDiaphragm\u201d as this is the sensor itself. Please note that is it slightly convex in shape (highly exaggerated in the drawing), this is important as it effects the accuracy of the sensor in use. \nThe shape of the sensor is important because it is calibrated to work in the direction of Air flow as shown by the RED Arrows. This is normal operation for the pressure sensor, providing a positive reading on the display of the digital pressure meter. Applying pressure in the reverse direction can induce errors in the results as the movement of the air pressure is trying to force the diaphragm to move in the opposite direction. The errors induced by this are small but, can be significant and therefore it is always preferable to ensure that the more positive pressure is always applied to the positive (+ve) port and the lower pressure is applied to the negative (-ve) port, for normal 'Gauge Pressure' application. The same applies to measuring the difference between two vacuums, the larger vacuum should always be applied to the negative (-ve) port.\nThe measurement of pressure via the Wheatstone Bridge looks something like this....\n[[File:Measuring Circuit.png|thumb|Application Schematic]]\nThe effective electrical model of the transducer, together with a basic signal conditioning circuit, is shown in the application schematic. The pressure sensor is a fully active Wheatstone bridge which has been temperature compensated and offset adjusted by means of thick film, laser trimmed resistors. The excitation to the bridge is applied via a constant current. The low-level bridge output is at +O and -O, and the amplified span is set by the gain programming resistor (r). The electrical design is microprocessor controlled, which allows for calibration, the additional functions for the user, such as Scale Selection, Data Hold, Zero and Filter functions, the Record function that stores/displays MAX/MIN. \n; Capacitive\n:Uses a diaphragm and pressure cavity to create a variable [[capacitor]] to detect strain due to applied pressure.\n; Magnetic\n:Measures the displacement of a diaphragm by means of changes in [[inductance]] (reluctance), [[LVDT]], [[Hall effect]], or by [[eddy current]] principle.\n; Piezoelectric\n:Uses the [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] effect in certain materials such as quartz to measure the strain upon the sensing mechanism due to pressure.\n; Optical\n:Uses the physical change of an optical fiber to detect strain due to applied pressure.\n; Potentiometric\n:Uses the motion of a wiper along a resistive mechanism to detect the strain caused by applied pressure.\n; Resonant\n:Uses the changes in [[resonant frequency]] in a sensing mechanism to measure stress, or changes in gas density, caused by applied pressure.\n\n===Thermal conductivity===\nGenerally, as a [[real gas]] increases in density -which may indicate an increase in [[pressure]]- its ability to conduct heat increases. In this type of gauge, a wire [[Electrical filament|filament]] is heated by running current through it. A [[thermocouple]] or [[resistance thermometer]] (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the [[Pirani gauge]], which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10<sup>&minus;3</sup>&nbsp;Torr to 10 [[Torr]], but their calibration is sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.\n\n====Pirani (one wire)====\n[[File:Pirani 02.jpg|thumb|Pirani vacuum gauge (open)]]\n{{Main|Pirani gauge}}\nA [[Pirani gauge]] consists of a metal wire open to the pressure being measured.  The wire is [[Joule heating|heated]] by a current flowing through it and cooled by the gas surrounding it.  If the gas pressure is reduced, the cooling effect will decrease, hence the equilibrium temperature of the wire will increase.  The [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wire is a [[Electrical resistance#Temperature dependence|function of its temperature]]: by measuring the [[volt]]age across the wire and the [[Electric current|current]] flowing through it, the resistance (and so the gas pressure) can be determined. This type of gauge was invented by [[Marcello Pirani]].\n\n====Two-wire====\nIn two-wire gauges, one wire coil is used as a heater, and the other is used to measure temperature due to [[convection]]. '''Thermocouple gauges''' and '''thermistor gauges''' work in this manner using [[thermocouple]] or [[thermistor]], respectively, to measure the temperature of the heated wire.\n\n===Ionization gauge===\n'''Ionization gauges''' are the most sensitive gauges for very low pressures (also referred to as hard or high vacuum). They sense pressure indirectly by measuring the electrical ions produced when the gas is bombarded with electrons. Fewer ions will be produced by lower density gases. The calibration of an ion gauge is unstable and dependent on the nature of the gases being measured, which is not always known. They can be calibrated against a [[McLeod gauge]] which is much more stable and independent of gas chemistry.\n\n[[Thermionic emission]] generates electrons, which collide with gas atoms and generate positive [[ion]]s.  The ions are attracted to a suitably [[Bias (electrical engineering)|biased]] electrode known as the collector.  The current in the collector is proportional to the rate of ionization, which is a function of the pressure in the system.  Hence, measuring the collector current gives the gas pressure.  There are several sub-types of ionization gauge.\n:'''Useful range''': 10<sup>\u221210</sup> - 10<sup>\u22123</sup> torr (roughly 10<sup>\u22128</sup> - 10<sup>\u22121</sup> Pa)\n\nMost ion gauges come in two types: hot [[cathode]] and cold cathode. In the [[Hot-filament ionization gauge|hot cathode]] version, an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10<sup>&minus;3</sup>&nbsp;Torr to 10<sup>&minus;10</sup>&nbsp;Torr. The principle behind [[cold cathode]] version is the same, except that electrons are produced in the discharge of a high voltage. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10<sup>&minus;2</sup>&nbsp;[[Torr]] to 10<sup>&minus;9</sup>&nbsp;Torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a [[mass spectrometer]] must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Robert M.

The three electrodes are a collector or plate, a [[Electrical filament|filament]], and a [[electrical grid|grid]]. The collector current is measured in [[picoampere]]s by an [[electrometer]]. The filament voltage to ground is usually at a potential of 30 volts, while the grid voltage at 180\u2013210 volts DC, unless there is an optional [[electron bombardment]] feature, by heating the grid, which may have a high potential of approximately 565 volts.\n\nThe most common ion gauge is the hot-cathode '''Bayard\u2013Alpert gauge''', with a small ion collector inside the grid. A glass envelope with an opening to the vacuum can surround the electrodes, but usually the '''nude gauge''' is inserted in the vacuum chamber directly, the pins being fed through a ceramic plate in the wall of the chamber. Hot-cathode gauges can be damaged or lose their calibration if they are exposed to atmospheric pressure or even low vacuum while hot. The measurements of a hot-cathode ionization gauge are always logarithmic.\n\nElectrons emitted from the filament move several times in back-and-forth movements around the grid before finally entering the grid. During these movements, some electrons collide with a gaseous molecule to form a pair of an ion and an electron ([[electron ionization]]). The number of these [[ions]] is proportional to the gaseous molecule density multiplied by the electron current emitted from the filament, and these ions pour into the collector to form an ion current. Since the gaseous molecule density is proportional to the pressure, the pressure is estimated by measuring the ion current.\n\nThe low-pressure sensitivity of hot-cathode gauges is limited by the photoelectric effect. Electrons hitting the grid produce x-rays that produce photoelectric noise in the ion collector. This limits the range of older hot-cathode gauges to 10<sup>\u22128</sup>&nbsp;Torr and the Bayard\u2013Alpert to about 10<sup>\u221210</sup>&nbsp;Torr. Additional wires at cathode potential in the line of sight between the ion collector and the grid prevent this effect. In the extraction type the ions are not attracted by a wire, but by an open cone. As the ions cannot decide which part of the cone to hit, they pass through the hole and form an ion beam. This ion beam can be passed on to a:\n* [[Faraday cup]]\n* [[Microchannel plate detector]] with Faraday cup\n* [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] with Faraday cup\n* [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] with microchannel plate detector and Faraday cup\n* [[Ion len]]s and acceleration voltage and directed at a target to form a [[sputtering|sputter gun]]. In this case a valve lets gas into the grid-cage.\n\n{{See also|Electron ionization}}\n\n====Cold cathode====\n[[File:Penning 01.jpg|thumb|Penning vacuum gauge (open)]]\n\nThere are two subtypes of [[Cold cathode|cold-cathode]] ionization gauges: the '''Penning gauge''' (invented by [[Frans Michel Penning]]), and the '''Inverted magnetron''', also called a '''Redhead gauge'''. The major difference between the two is the position of the [[anode]] with respect to the [[cathode]]. Neither has a filament, and each may require a [[direct current|DC]] potential of about 4 [[volt|kV]]  for operation. Inverted magnetrons can measure down to 1{{e|\u221212}}&nbsp; [[Torr]].\n\nLikewise, cold-cathode gauges may be reluctant to start at very low pressures, in that the near-absence of a gas makes it difficult to establish an electrode current - in particular in Penning gauges, which use an axially symmetric magnetic field to create path lengths for electrons that are of the order of metres. In ambient air, suitable ion-pairs are ubiquitously formed by cosmic radiation; in a Penning gauge, design features are used to  ease the set-up of a discharge path. For example, the electrode of a Penning gauge is usually finely tapered to facilitate the field emission of electrons.\n\nMaintenance cycles of cold cathode gauges are, in general, measured in years, depending on the gas type and pressure that they are operated in. Using a cold cathode gauge in gases with substantial organic components, such as pump oil fractions, can result in the growth of delicate carbon films and shards within the gauge that eventually either short-circuit the electrodes of the gauge or impede the generation of a discharge path.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Comparison of pressure measurement instruments<ref name=\"Harris1989\">{{cite book|author=Nigel S.

These disturbances propagate from their source as longitudinal pressure variations along the path of propagation. This is also called sound. Sound pressure is the instantaneous local pressure deviation from the average pressure caused by a sound wave. Sound pressure can be measured using a [[microphone]] in air and a [[hydrophone]] in water. The effective sound pressure is the [[root mean square]] of the instantaneous sound pressure over a given interval of time. Sound pressures are normally small and are often expressed in units of microbar.\n* frequency response of pressure sensors\n* resonance\n\n==Calibration and standards==\n[[File:Dead weight tester, Type PD23, Nagano Keiki Co., Ltd. - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07787.JPG|thumb|Dead-weight tester.

Dustin Roberts, a 379th Air Expeditionary Wing Public Affairs broadcaster, checks his tires at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, Jan. 10, 2014 140110-Z-QD538-010.jpg|thumb|Checking tire pressure with a tire pressure gauge]]\n\n'''Pressure measurement''' is the analysis of an applied [[force]] by a [[fluid]] ([[liquid]] or [[gas]]) on a surface. [[Pressure]] is typically measured in units of force per unit of [[surface area]]. Many techniques have been developed for the measurement of pressure and [[vacuum]]. Instruments used to measure and display pressure in an integral unit are called '''pressure meters''' or '''pressure gauges''' or '''vacuum gauges'''. A '''manometer''' is a good example, as it uses the surface area and weight of a column of liquid to both measure and indicate pressure. Likewise the widely used Bourdon gauge is a mechanical device, which both measures and indicates and is probably the best known type of gauge.\n\nA vacuum gauge is a pressure gauge used to measure pressures lower than the ambient atmospheric pressure, which is set as the zero point, in negative values (e.g.: \u221215&nbsp;[[psig]] or \u2212760&nbsp;[[mmHg]] equals total vacuum). Most gauges measure pressure relative to atmospheric pressure as the zero point, so this form of reading is simply referred to as \"gauge pressure\". However, anything greater than total vacuum is technically a form of pressure. For very accurate readings, especially at very low pressures, a gauge that uses total vacuum as the zero point may be used, giving pressure readings in an [[absolute scale]].\n\nOther methods of pressure measurement involve sensors that can transmit the pressure reading to a remote indicator or control system ([[telemetry]]).\n\n==Absolute, gauge and differential pressures \u2014 zero reference==\n{{Anchor|Absolute|Gauge|Differential|Absolute, gauge and differential}}\n\nEveryday pressure measurements, such as for vehicle tire pressure, are usually made relative to ambient air pressure. In other cases measurements are made relative to a vacuum or to some other specific reference. When distinguishing between these zero references, the following terms are used:\n*'''{{visible anchor|Absolute pressure}}''' is zero-referenced against a perfect vacuum, using an [[absolute scale]], so it is equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Gauge pressure}}''' is zero-referenced against ambient air pressure, so it is equal to absolute pressure minus atmospheric pressure. Negative signs are usually omitted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} To distinguish a negative pressure, the value may be appended with the word \"vacuum\" or the gauge may be labeled a \"vacuum gauge\". These are further divided into two subcategories: high and low vacuum (and sometimes [[ultra-high vacuum]]). The applicable pressure ranges of many of the techniques used to measure vacuums have an overlap. Hence, by combining several different types of gauge, it is possible to measure system pressure continuously from 10&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] down to 10<sup>\u221211</sup>&nbsp;mbar.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Differential pressure}}''' is the difference in pressure between two points.\n\nThe zero reference in use is usually implied by context, and these words are added only when clarification is needed. [[Tire-pressure gauge|Tire pressure]] and [[sphygmomanometer|blood pressure]] are gauge pressures by convention, while [[atmospheric pressure]]s, deep vacuum pressures, and [[altimeter|altimeter pressures]] must be absolute.\n\nFor most [[working fluid]]s where a fluid exists in a [[closed system]], gauge pressure measurement prevails. Pressure instruments connected to the system will indicate pressures relative to the current atmospheric pressure. The situation changes when extreme vacuum pressures are measured, then absolute pressures are typically used instead.\n\nDifferential pressures are commonly used in industrial process systems. Differential pressure gauges have two inlet ports, each connected to one of the volumes whose pressure is to be monitored.  In effect, such a gauge performs the mathematical operation of subtraction through mechanical means, obviating the need for an operator or control system to watch two separate gauges and determine the difference in readings.\n\nModerate vacuum pressure readings can be ambiguous without the proper context, as they may represent absolute pressure or gauge pressure without a negative sign. Thus a vacuum of 26&nbsp;inHg gauge is equivalent to an absolute pressure of 30&nbsp;inHg (typical atmospheric pressure) \u2212 26&nbsp;inHg = 4&nbsp;inHg.\n\nAtmospheric pressure is typically about 100&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] at sea level, but is variable with altitude and weather. If the absolute pressure of a fluid stays constant, the gauge pressure of the same fluid will vary as atmospheric pressure changes. For example, when a car drives up a mountain, the (gauge) tire pressure goes up because atmospheric pressure goes down. The absolute pressure in the tire is essentially unchanged.\n\nUsing atmospheric pressure as reference is usually signified by a \"g\" for gauge after the pressure unit, e.g. 70&nbsp;psig, which means that the pressure measured is the total pressure minus [[atmospheric pressure]].  There are two types of gauge reference pressure: vented gauge (vg) and sealed gauge (sg).\n\nA vented-gauge [[pressure transmitter]], for example, allows the outside air pressure to be exposed to the negative side of the pressure-sensing diaphragm, through a vented cable or a hole on the side of the device, so that it always measures the pressure referred to ambient [[barometric pressure]].  Thus a vented-gauge reference [[pressure sensor]] should always read zero pressure when the process pressure connection is held open to the air.\n\nA sealed gauge reference is very similar, except that atmospheric pressure is sealed on the negative side of the diaphragm.  This is usually adopted on high pressure ranges, such as [[hydraulics]], where atmospheric pressure changes will have a negligible effect on the accuracy of the reading, so venting is not necessary.  This also allows some manufacturers to provide secondary pressure containment as an extra precaution for pressure equipment safety if the burst pressure of the primary pressure sensing [[diaphragm seal|diaphragm]] is exceeded.\n\nThere is another way of creating a sealed gauge reference, and this is to seal a high [[vacuum]] on the reverse side of the sensing diaphragm.  Then the output signal is offset, so the pressure sensor reads close to zero when measuring atmospheric pressure.\n\nA sealed gauge reference [[pressure transducer]] will never read exactly zero because atmospheric pressure is always changing and the reference in this case is fixed at 1 bar.\n\nTo produce an [[absolute pressure sensor]], the manufacturer seals a high vacuum behind the sensing diaphragm. If the process-pressure connection of an absolute-pressure transmitter is open to the air, it will read the actual [[barometric pressure]].\n\n==Units==\n{{Pressure Units}}\n\n[[File:Psidial.jpg|thumb|A [[pressure gauge]] reading in [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (red scale) and [[kPa]] (black scale)]]\n\nThe [[SI]] unit for pressure is the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), equal to one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]] (N\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup> or kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>). This special name for the unit was added in 1971; before that, pressure in SI was expressed in units such as N\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup>. When indicated, the zero reference is stated in parenthesis following the unit, for example 101 kPa (abs). The [[pounds per square inch|pound per square inch]] (psi) is still in widespread use in the US and Canada, for measuring, for instance, tire pressure. A letter is often appended to the psi unit to indicate the measurement's zero reference; psia for absolute, psig for gauge, psid for differential, although this practice is discouraged by the [[NIST]].<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html#7.4 NIST]</ref>\n\nBecause pressure was once commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (''e.g.,'' inches of water). Manometric measurement is the subject of [[pressure head]] calculations. The most common choices for a manometer's fluid are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's density allows for a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to measure a given pressure. The abbreviation \"W.C.\" or the words \"water column\" are often printed on gauges and measurements that use water for the manometer.\n\nFluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. So measurements in \"[[millimetres of mercury]]\" or \"[[inHg|inches of mercury]]\" can be converted to SI units as long as attention is paid to the local factors of fluid density and [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]]. Temperature fluctuations change the value of fluid density, while location can affect gravity.\n\nAlthough no longer preferred, these '''manometric units''' are still encountered in many fields. [[Blood pressure]] is measured in millimetres of mercury (see [[torr]]) in most of the world, [[central venous pressure]] and lung pressures in [[centimetre of water|centimeters of water]] are still common, as in settings for CPAP machines. Natural gas pipeline pressures are measured in [[inch of water|inches of water]], expressed as \"inches W.C.\"\n\n[[Underwater diving|Underwater divers]] use manometric units: the ambient pressure is measured in units of [[Metre sea water|metres sea water]] (msw) which is defined as equal to one tenth of a bar. {{sfn|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2016|loc=Table 2\u201110. Pressure Equivalents.}}<ref name=\"IMCA D022\" /> The unit used in the US is the '''foot sea water''' ('''fsw'''), based on [[standard gravity]] and a sea-water density of 64&nbsp;lb/ft<sup>3</sup>. According to the US Navy Diving Manual, one fsw equals 0.30643&nbsp;msw, {{val|.030643|ul=bar}}, or {{val|0.44444|ul=psi}},{{sfn|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2016|loc=Table 2\u201110. Pressure Equivalents.}}<ref name=\"IMCA D022\" /> though elsewhere it states that 33&nbsp;fsw is {{val|14.7|u=psi}} (one atmosphere), which gives one fsw equal to about 0.445&nbsp;psi.<ref>Page 2-12.</ref> The msw and fsw are the conventional units for measurement of [[Underwater diving|diver]] pressure exposure used in [[decompression tables]] and the unit of calibration for [[pneumofathometer]]s and [[hyperbaric chamber]] [[pressure gauge]]s.{{sfn|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2016|loc=Section 18\u20112.8.3}} Both msw and fsw are measured relative to normal atmospheric pressure.\n\nIn vacuum systems, the units [[torr]] (millimeter of mercury), [[Micron (disambiguation)|micron]] (micrometer of mercury),<ref>http://vacaero.com/information-resources/vacuum-pump-practice-with-howard-tring/1290-understanding-vacuum-measurement-units.html</ref> and inch of mercury ([[inHg]]) are most commonly used. Torr and micron usually indicates an absolute pressure, while inHg usually indicates a gauge pressure.\n\nAtmospheric pressures are usually stated using hectopascal (hPa), kilopascal (kPa), millibar (mbar) or atmospheres ([[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]). In American and Canadian engineering, [[Stress (physics)|stress]] is often measured in [[kip (unit)|kip]]. Note that stress is not a true pressure since it is not [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]. In the [[cgs]] system the unit of pressure was the [[barye]] (ba), equal to 1 dyn\u00b7cm<sup>\u22122</sup>. In the [[Metre-tonne-second system of units|mts]] system, the unit of  pressure was the [[pieze]], equal to 1 [[sthene]] per square metre.\n\nMany other hybrid units are used such as mmHg/cm<sup>2</sup> or grams-force/cm<sup>2</sup> (sometimes as [[kg/cm<sup>2</sup>]] without properly identifying the force units). Using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as a unit of force is prohibited in SI; the unit of force in SI is the newton (N).\n\n==Static and dynamic pressure==\n[[Static pressure]] is uniform in all directions, so pressure measurements are independent of direction in an immovable (static) fluid. Flow, however, applies additional pressure on surfaces perpendicular to the flow direction, while having little impact on surfaces parallel to the flow direction. This directional component of pressure in a moving (dynamic) fluid is called [[dynamic pressure]]. An instrument facing the flow direction measures the sum of the static and dynamic pressures; this measurement is called the [[total pressure]] or [[stagnation pressure]]. Since dynamic pressure is referenced to static pressure, it is neither gauge nor absolute; it is a differential pressure.\n\nWhile static gauge pressure is of primary importance to determining net loads on pipe walls, dynamic pressure is used to measure flow rates and airspeed. Dynamic pressure can be measured by taking the differential pressure between instruments parallel and perpendicular to the flow. [[Pitot tube|Pitot-static tube]]s, for example perform this measurement on airplanes to determine airspeed. The presence of the measuring instrument inevitably acts to divert flow and create turbulence, so its shape is critical to accuracy and the calibration curves are often non-linear.\n\n===Applications===\n* [[Altimeter]]\n* [[Barometer]]\n* [[Depth gauge]]\n* [[MAP sensor]]\n* [[Pitot tube]]\n* [[Sphygmomanometer]]\n\n==Instruments==\n[[File:Manometer anim 01.gif|thumb|A [[pressure gauge]] in action]]\n\nMany instruments have been invented to measure pressure, with different advantages and disadvantages. Pressure range, sensitivity, dynamic response and cost all vary by several orders of magnitude from one instrument design to the next. The oldest type is the liquid column (a vertical tube filled with mercury) manometer invented by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643.  The U-Tube was invented by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1661.\n\n===Hydrostatic===\n'''Hydrostatic''' gauges (such as the mercury column manometer) compare pressure to the hydrostatic force per unit area at the base of a column of fluid. Hydrostatic gauge measurements are independent of the type of gas being measured, and can be designed to have a very linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response.\n\n====Piston====\nPiston-type gauges counterbalance the pressure of a fluid with a spring (for example [[tire-pressure gauge]]s of comparatively low accuracy) or a solid weight, in which case it is known as a [[deadweight tester]] and may be used for calibration of other gauges.\n\n====Liquid column (manometer)====\n[[File:Utube.PNG|thumb|upright|The difference in fluid height in a liquid-column manometer is proportional to the pressure difference: <math>h = \\frac{P_a - P_o}{g \\rho}</math>]]\nLiquid-column gauges consist of a column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight (a force applied due to gravity) is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube (a force applied due to fluid pressure). A very simple version is a U-shaped tube half-full of liquid, one side of which is connected to the region of interest while the [[reference]] pressure (which might be the [[atmospheric pressure]] or a vacuum) is applied to the other. The difference in liquid levels represents the applied pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of fluid of height ''h'' and density ''\u03c1'' is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation, ''P'' = ''hg\u03c1''. Therefore, the pressure difference between the applied pressure ''P<sub>a</sub>'' and the reference pressure ''P''<sub>0</sub> in a U-tube manometer can be found by solving {{nowrap|''P<sub>a</sub>'' \u2212 ''P''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''hg\u03c1''}}. In other words, the pressure on either end of the liquid (shown in blue in the figure) must be balanced (since the liquid is static), and so {{nowrap|''P<sub>a</sub>'' {{=}}  ''P''<sub>0</sub> + ''hg\u03c1''}}.\n\nIn most liquid-column measurements, the result of the measurement is the height ''h'', expressed typically in mm, cm, or inches. The ''h'' is also known as the [[pressure head]]. When expressed as a pressure head, pressure is specified in units of length and the measurement fluid must be specified. When accuracy is critical, the temperature of the measurement fluid must likewise be specified, because liquid density is a function of [[temperature]]. So, for example, pressure head might be written \"742.2&nbsp;mm<sub>Hg</sub>\" or \"4.2&nbsp;in<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> at 59&nbsp;\u00b0F\" for measurements taken with mercury or water as the manometric fluid respectively. The word \"gauge\" or \"vacuum\" may be added to such a measurement to distinguish between a pressure above or below the atmospheric pressure. Both mm of mercury and inches of water are common pressure heads, which can be converted to S.I. units of pressure using [[unit conversion]] and the above formulas.\n\nIf the fluid being measured is significantly dense, hydrostatic corrections may have to be made for the height between the moving surface of the manometer working fluid and the location where the pressure measurement is desired, except when measuring differential pressure of a fluid (for example, across an [[orifice plate]] or venturi), in which case the density \u03c1 should be corrected by subtracting the density of the fluid being measured.<ref>{{cite book |title=Methods for the Measurement of Fluid Flow in Pipes, Part 1. Orifice Plates, Nozzles and Venturi Tubes |date=1964 |publisher=[[British Standards Institute]] |page=36}}</ref>\n\nAlthough any fluid can be used, [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is preferred for its high density (13.534&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and low [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]]. For low pressure differences, light oil or water are commonly used (the latter giving rise to units of measurement such as [[Inch of water|inches water gauge]] and [[Millimeters, water gauge|millimetres H<sub>2</sub>O]]. Liquid-column pressure gauges have a highly linear calibration. They have poor dynamic response because the fluid in the column may react slowly to a pressure change.\n\nWhen measuring vacuum, the working liquid may evaporate and contaminate the vacuum if its [[vapor pressure]] is too high. When measuring liquid pressure, a loop filled with gas or a light fluid can isolate the liquids to prevent them from mixing, but this can be unnecessary, for example, when mercury is used as the manometer fluid to measure differential pressure of a fluid such as water. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from a few [[torr]]s (a few 100&nbsp;Pa) to a few atmospheres (approximately {{val|1,000,000|u=Pa}}).\n\nA single-limb liquid-column manometer has a larger reservoir instead of one side of the U-tube and has a scale beside the narrower column. The column may be inclined to further amplify the liquid movement. Based on the use and structure, following types of manometers are used<ref name=manometer_types>[Was: \"fluidengineering.co.nr/Manometer.htm\". At 1/2010 that took me to bad link.

The technique is very slow and unsuited to continual monitoring, but is capable of good accuracy. Unlike other manometer gauges, the McLeod gauge reading is dependent on the composition of the gas, since the interpretation relies on the sample compressing as an [[ideal gas]]. Due to the compression process, the McLeod gauge completely ignores partial pressures from non-ideal vapors that condense, such as pump oils, mercury, and even water if compressed enough.\n:'''Useful range''': from around 10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;Torr<ref name=THV_V>[http://www.tau.ac.il/~phchlab/experiments/vacuum/Techniques_of_high_vacuum/Vacuum5.html Techniques of high vacuum]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504124236/http://www.tau.ac.il/~phchlab/experiments/vacuum/Techniques_of_high_vacuum/Vacuum5.html |date=2006-05-04 }}</ref>  (roughly 10<sup>\u22122</sup>&nbsp;Pa) to vacuums as high as 10<sup>\u22126</sup>&nbsp;Torr (0.1&nbsp;mPa),\n\n0.1&nbsp;mPa is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology.

However, aneroid gauges can be used to measure the pressure of a liquid as well as a gas, and they are not the only type of gauge that can operate without fluid. For this reason, they are often called '''mechanical''' gauges in modern language. Aneroid gauges are not dependent on the type of gas being measured, unlike thermal and ionization gauges, and are less likely to contaminate the system than hydrostatic gauges. The pressure sensing element may be a '''Bourdon tube''', a diaphragm, a capsule, or a set of bellows, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. The deflection of the pressure sensing element may be read by a linkage connected to a needle, or it may be read by a secondary transducer. The most common secondary transducers in modern vacuum gauges measure a change in capacitance due to the mechanical deflection. Gauges that rely on a change in capacitance are often referred to as capacitance manometers.\n\n====Bourdon gauge====\n[[File:Manometer 104026.jpg|thumb|Membrane-type manometer]]\n\nThe Bourdon pressure gauge uses the principle that a flattened tube tends to straighten or regain its circular form in cross-section when pressurized. This change in cross-section may be hardly noticeable, involving moderate [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]es within the elastic range of easily workable materials. The [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] of the material of the tube is magnified by forming the tube into a C shape or even a helix, such that the entire tube tends to straighten out or uncoil elastically as it is pressurized. [[Eug\u00e8ne Bourdon]] patented his gauge in France in 1849, and it was widely adopted because of its superior sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy; Edward Ashcroft purchased Bourdon's American patent rights in 1852 and became a major manufacturer of gauges.  Also in 1849, Bernard Schaeffer in Magdeburg, Germany patented a successful diaphragm (see below) pressure gauge, which, together with the Bourdon gauge, revolutionized pressure measurement in industry.<ref>[http://www.archivingindustry.com/Indicator/discspring.htm  ''The Engine Indicator'' Canadian Museum of Making]</ref> But in 1875 after Bourdon's patents expired, his company [[Budenberg Gauge Company|Schaeffer and Budenberg]] also manufactured Bourdon tube gauges.\n\n[[File:E Bourdons Patent Compound Gauge.jpg|thumb|An original 19th century Eugene Bourdon compound gauge, reading pressure both below and above ambient with great sensitivity.]]In practice, a flattened thin-wall, closed-end tube is connected at the hollow end to a fixed pipe containing the fluid pressure to be measured. As the pressure increases, the closed end moves in an arc, and this motion is converted into the rotation of a (segment of a) gear by a connecting link that is usually adjustable. A small-diameter pinion gear is on the pointer shaft, so the motion is magnified further by the [[gear ratio]]. The positioning of the indicator card behind the pointer, the initial pointer shaft position, the linkage length and initial position, all provide means to calibrate the pointer to indicate the desired range of pressure for variations in the behavior of the Bourdon tube itself. Differential pressure can be measured by gauges containing two different Bourdon tubes, with connecting linkages.\n\nBourdon tubes measure [[gauge pressure]], relative to ambient atmospheric pressure, as opposed to [[absolute pressure]]; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below).  When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a [[reciprocating pump]], an [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or [[glycerin]]. Tapping on the face of the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of \u00b12% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Boyes |first = Walt |title = Instrumentation Reference Book |edition = Fourth |publisher = [[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |date = 2008 |pages = 1312}}</ref>\n\nForce-balanced fused quartz bourdon tube sensors work on the same principle but uses the reflection of a beam of light from a mirror to sense the angular displacement and current is applied to electromagnets to balance the force of the tube and bring the angular displacement back to zero, the current that is applied to the coils is used as the measurement. Due to the extremely stable and repeatable mechanical and thermal properties of quartz and the force balancing which eliminates nearly all physical movement these sensors can be accurate to around 1[[Parts per million|PPM]] of full scale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230966593_Characterization_of_quartz_Bourdon-type_high-pressure_transducers|title=(PDF) Characterization of quartz Bourdon-type high-pressure transducers|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref> Due to the extremely fine fused quartz structures which must be made by hand these sensors are generally limited to scientific and calibration purposes.\n\nIn the following illustrations the transparent cover face of the pictured combination pressure and vacuum gauge has been removed and the mechanism removed from the case.

A small motion of the tube results in a large motion of the indicator needle.\n# Hair spring to preload the gear train to eliminate gear lash and [[hysteresis]].\n\n====Diaphragm====\nA second type of aneroid gauge uses  [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of a flexible [[Artificial membrane|membrane]] that separates regions of different pressure. The amount of deflection is repeatable for known pressures so the pressure can be determined by using calibration. The deformation of a thin diaphragm is dependent on the difference in pressure between its two faces.  The reference face can be open to atmosphere to measure gauge pressure, open to a second port to measure differential pressure, or can be sealed against a vacuum or other fixed reference pressure to measure absolute pressure. The deformation can be measured using mechanical, optical or capacitive techniques. Ceramic and metallic diaphragms are used.\n:'''Useful range''': above 10<sup>\u22122</sup> [[Torr]] <ref name=schoonoverinc>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040102031317/http://schoonoverinc.com/PDFs/Sky%20Brochure.pdf Product brochure from Schoonover, Inc]</ref> (roughly 1 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]])\nFor absolute measurements, welded pressure capsules with diaphragms on either side are often used.\n\nshape:\n* Flat\n* Corrugated\n* Flattened tube\n* Capsule\n\n====Bellows====\n[[File:Barograph 03.jpg|thumb|A pile of pressure capsules with corrugated diaphragms in an aneroid [[barograph]]]]\n\nIn gauges intended to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may be driven by an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an '''aneroid''', which means \"without liquid\". (Early [[barometer]]s used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]] suspended by a [[vacuum]].) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), [[altimeter]]s, altitude recording [[barograph]]s, and the altitude [[telemetry]] instruments used in [[weather balloon]] [[radiosonde]]s. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as [[airspeed indicator|air speed indicators]] and rate of climb indicators ([[variometer]]s) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external enclosing chamber.\n\n====Magnetic coupling====\nThese gauges use the attraction of two magnets to translate differential pressure into motion of a dial pointer. As differential pressure increases, a magnet attached to either a piston or rubber diaphragm moves. A rotary magnet that is attached to a pointer then moves in unison. To create different pressure ranges, the spring rate can be increased or decreased.\n\n===Spinning-rotor gauge===\nThe spinning-rotor gauge works by measuring the amount a rotating ball is slowed by the viscosity of the gas being measured.  The ball is made of steel and is magnetically levitated inside a steel tube closed at one end and exposed to the gas to be measured at the other.  The ball is brought up to speed (about 2500&nbsp;[[radian|rad]]/s), and the speed measured after switching off the drive, by electromagnetic transducers.<ref>A. Chambers, ''Basic Vacuum Technology'', pp. 100\u2013102, CRC Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0585254915}}.</ref>  The range of the instrument is 10<sup>\u22125</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Pa (10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Pa with less accuracy).  It is accurate and stable enough to be used as a [[secondary standard]].  The instrument requires some skill and knowledge to use correctly.  Various corrections must be applied and the ball must be spun at a pressure well below the intended measurement pressure for five hours before using.  It is most useful in calibration and research laboratories where high accuracy is required and qualified technicians are available.<ref>John F. O'Hanlon, ''A User's Guide to Vacuum Technology'', pp. 92\u201394, John Wiley & Sons, 2005. {{ISBN|0471467154}}.</ref>\n\n==Electronic pressure instruments{{anchor|Electronic}}==\n{{Main|Pressure sensor}}\n{{merge from|Pressure sensor|date=February 2019}}\n\n; Metal strain gauge\n:The strain gauge is generally glued (foil strain gauge) or deposited (thin-film strain gauge) onto a membrane. Membrane deflection due to pressure causes a resistance change in the strain gauge which can be electronically measured.\n; Piezoresistive strain gauge\n:Uses the [[piezoresistive]] effect of bonded or formed strain gauges to detect strain due to applied pressure.\n; Piezoresistive Silicon Pressure Sensor\n:The Sensor is generally a temperature compensated, [[piezoresistive]] silicon pressure sensor chosen for its excellent performance and long-term stability. Integral temperature compensation is provided over a range of 0-50\u00b0C using laser-trimmed resistors. An additional laser-trimmed resistor is included to normalize pressure sensitivity variations by programming the gain of an external differential amplifier. This provides good sensitivity and long-term stability. The two ports of the sensor, apply pressure to the same single transducer, please see pressure flow diagram below.\n[[File:Piezoresistive Silicon Pressure Sensor.png|thumb]]\nThis is an over simplified diagram, but you can see fundamental design of the internal ports in the sensor. The important item here to note is the \u201cDiaphragm\u201d as this is the sensor itself. Please note that is it slightly convex in shape (highly exaggerated in the drawing), this is important as it effects the accuracy of the sensor in use. \nThe shape of the sensor is important because it is calibrated to work in the direction of Air flow as shown by the RED Arrows. This is normal operation for the pressure sensor, providing a positive reading on the display of the digital pressure meter. Applying pressure in the reverse direction can induce errors in the results as the movement of the air pressure is trying to force the diaphragm to move in the opposite direction. The errors induced by this are small but, can be significant and therefore it is always preferable to ensure that the more positive pressure is always applied to the positive (+ve) port and the lower pressure is applied to the negative (-ve) port, for normal 'Gauge Pressure' application. The same applies to measuring the difference between two vacuums, the larger vacuum should always be applied to the negative (-ve) port.\nThe measurement of pressure via the Wheatstone Bridge looks something like this....\n[[File:Measuring Circuit.png|thumb|Application Schematic]]\nThe effective electrical model of the transducer, together with a basic signal conditioning circuit, is shown in the application schematic. The pressure sensor is a fully active Wheatstone bridge which has been temperature compensated and offset adjusted by means of thick film, laser trimmed resistors. The excitation to the bridge is applied via a constant current. The low-level bridge output is at +O and -O, and the amplified span is set by the gain programming resistor (r). The electrical design is microprocessor controlled, which allows for calibration, the additional functions for the user, such as Scale Selection, Data Hold, Zero and Filter functions, the Record function that stores/displays MAX/MIN. \n; Capacitive\n:Uses a diaphragm and pressure cavity to create a variable [[capacitor]] to detect strain due to applied pressure.\n; Magnetic\n:Measures the displacement of a diaphragm by means of changes in [[inductance]] (reluctance), [[LVDT]], [[Hall effect]], or by [[eddy current]] principle.\n; Piezoelectric\n:Uses the [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] effect in certain materials such as quartz to measure the strain upon the sensing mechanism due to pressure.\n; Optical\n:Uses the physical change of an optical fiber to detect strain due to applied pressure.\n; Potentiometric\n:Uses the motion of a wiper along a resistive mechanism to detect the strain caused by applied pressure.\n; Resonant\n:Uses the changes in [[resonant frequency]] in a sensing mechanism to measure stress, or changes in gas density, caused by applied pressure.\n\n===Thermal conductivity===\nGenerally, as a [[real gas]] increases in density -which may indicate an increase in [[pressure]]- its ability to conduct heat increases. In this type of gauge, a wire [[Electrical filament|filament]] is heated by running current through it. A [[thermocouple]] or [[resistance thermometer]] (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the [[Pirani gauge]], which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10<sup>&minus;3</sup>&nbsp;Torr to 10 [[Torr]], but their calibration is sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.\n\n====Pirani (one wire)====\n[[File:Pirani 02.jpg|thumb|Pirani vacuum gauge (open)]]\n{{Main|Pirani gauge}}\nA [[Pirani gauge]] consists of a metal wire open to the pressure being measured.  The wire is [[Joule heating|heated]] by a current flowing through it and cooled by the gas surrounding it.  If the gas pressure is reduced, the cooling effect will decrease, hence the equilibrium temperature of the wire will increase.  The [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wire is a [[Electrical resistance#Temperature dependence|function of its temperature]]: by measuring the [[volt]]age across the wire and the [[Electric current|current]] flowing through it, the resistance (and so the gas pressure) can be determined. This type of gauge was invented by [[Marcello Pirani]].\n\n====Two-wire====\nIn two-wire gauges, one wire coil is used as a heater, and the other is used to measure temperature due to [[convection]]. '''Thermocouple gauges''' and '''thermistor gauges''' work in this manner using [[thermocouple]] or [[thermistor]], respectively, to measure the temperature of the heated wire.\n\n===Ionization gauge===\n'''Ionization gauges''' are the most sensitive gauges for very low pressures (also referred to as hard or high vacuum). They sense pressure indirectly by measuring the electrical ions produced when the gas is bombarded with electrons. Fewer ions will be produced by lower density gases. The calibration of an ion gauge is unstable and dependent on the nature of the gases being measured, which is not always known. They can be calibrated against a [[McLeod gauge]] which is much more stable and independent of gas chemistry.\n\n[[Thermionic emission]] generates electrons, which collide with gas atoms and generate positive [[ion]]s.  The ions are attracted to a suitably [[Bias (electrical engineering)|biased]] electrode known as the collector.  The current in the collector is proportional to the rate of ionization, which is a function of the pressure in the system.  Hence, measuring the collector current gives the gas pressure.  There are several sub-types of ionization gauge.\n:'''Useful range''': 10<sup>\u221210</sup> - 10<sup>\u22123</sup> torr (roughly 10<sup>\u22128</sup> - 10<sup>\u22121</sup> Pa)\n\nMost ion gauges come in two types: hot [[cathode]] and cold cathode. In the [[Hot-filament ionization gauge|hot cathode]] version, an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10<sup>&minus;3</sup>&nbsp;Torr to 10<sup>&minus;10</sup>&nbsp;Torr. The principle behind [[cold cathode]] version is the same, except that electrons are produced in the discharge of a high voltage. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10<sup>&minus;2</sup>&nbsp;[[Torr]] to 10<sup>&minus;9</sup>&nbsp;Torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a [[mass spectrometer]] must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Robert M.

The three electrodes are a collector or plate, a [[Electrical filament|filament]], and a [[electrical grid|grid]]. The collector current is measured in [[picoampere]]s by an [[electrometer]]. The filament voltage to ground is usually at a potential of 30 volts, while the grid voltage at 180\u2013210 volts DC, unless there is an optional [[electron bombardment]] feature, by heating the grid, which may have a high potential of approximately 565 volts.\n\nThe most common ion gauge is the hot-cathode '''Bayard\u2013Alpert gauge''', with a small ion collector inside the grid. A glass envelope with an opening to the vacuum can surround the electrodes, but usually the '''nude gauge''' is inserted in the vacuum chamber directly, the pins being fed through a ceramic plate in the wall of the chamber. Hot-cathode gauges can be damaged or lose their calibration if they are exposed to atmospheric pressure or even low vacuum while hot. The measurements of a hot-cathode ionization gauge are always logarithmic.\n\nElectrons emitted from the filament move several times in back-and-forth movements around the grid before finally entering the grid. During these movements, some electrons collide with a gaseous molecule to form a pair of an ion and an electron ([[electron ionization]]). The number of these [[ions]] is proportional to the gaseous molecule density multiplied by the electron current emitted from the filament, and these ions pour into the collector to form an ion current. Since the gaseous molecule density is proportional to the pressure, the pressure is estimated by measuring the ion current.\n\nThe low-pressure sensitivity of hot-cathode gauges is limited by the photoelectric effect. Electrons hitting the grid produce x-rays that produce photoelectric noise in the ion collector. This limits the range of older hot-cathode gauges to 10<sup>\u22128</sup>&nbsp;Torr and the Bayard\u2013Alpert to about 10<sup>\u221210</sup>&nbsp;Torr. Additional wires at cathode potential in the line of sight between the ion collector and the grid prevent this effect. In the extraction type the ions are not attracted by a wire, but by an open cone. As the ions cannot decide which part of the cone to hit, they pass through the hole and form an ion beam. This ion beam can be passed on to a:\n* [[Faraday cup]]\n* [[Microchannel plate detector]] with Faraday cup\n* [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] with Faraday cup\n* [[Quadrupole mass analyzer]] with microchannel plate detector and Faraday cup\n* [[Ion len]]s and acceleration voltage and directed at a target to form a [[sputtering|sputter gun]]. In this case a valve lets gas into the grid-cage.\n\n{{See also|Electron ionization}}\n\n====Cold cathode====\n[[File:Penning 01.jpg|thumb|Penning vacuum gauge (open)]]\n\nThere are two subtypes of [[Cold cathode|cold-cathode]] ionization gauges: the '''Penning gauge''' (invented by [[Frans Michel Penning]]), and the '''Inverted magnetron''', also called a '''Redhead gauge'''. The major difference between the two is the position of the [[anode]] with respect to the [[cathode]]. Neither has a filament, and each may require a [[direct current|DC]] potential of about 4 [[volt|kV]]  for operation. Inverted magnetrons can measure down to 1{{e|\u221212}}&nbsp; [[Torr]].\n\nLikewise, cold-cathode gauges may be reluctant to start at very low pressures, in that the near-absence of a gas makes it difficult to establish an electrode current - in particular in Penning gauges, which use an axially symmetric magnetic field to create path lengths for electrons that are of the order of metres. In ambient air, suitable ion-pairs are ubiquitously formed by cosmic radiation; in a Penning gauge, design features are used to  ease the set-up of a discharge path. For example, the electrode of a Penning gauge is usually finely tapered to facilitate the field emission of electrons.\n\nMaintenance cycles of cold cathode gauges are, in general, measured in years, depending on the gas type and pressure that they are operated in. Using a cold cathode gauge in gases with substantial organic components, such as pump oil fractions, can result in the growth of delicate carbon films and shards within the gauge that eventually either short-circuit the electrodes of the gauge or impede the generation of a discharge path.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Comparison of pressure measurement instruments<ref name=\"Harris1989\">{{cite book|author=Nigel S.

These disturbances propagate from their source as longitudinal pressure variations along the path of propagation. This is also called sound. Sound pressure is the instantaneous local pressure deviation from the average pressure caused by a sound wave. Sound pressure can be measured using a [[microphone]] in air and a [[hydrophone]] in water. The effective sound pressure is the [[root mean square]] of the instantaneous sound pressure over a given interval of time. Sound pressures are normally small and are often expressed in units of microbar.\n* frequency response of pressure sensors\n* resonance\n\n==Calibration and standards==\n[[File:Dead weight tester, Type PD23, Nagano Keiki Co., Ltd. - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07787.JPG|thumb|Dead-weight tester. This uses known calibrated weights on a piston to generate a known pressure.]]\n\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has developed two separate and distinct standards on pressure Measurement, B40.100 and PTC 19.2.\nB40.100 provides guidelines on Pressure Indicated Dial Type and Pressure Digital Indicating Gauges, Diaphragm Seals, Snubbers, and Pressure Limiter Valves.\nPTC 19.2 provides instructions and guidance for the accurate determination of pressure values in support of the ASME Performance Test Codes. The choice of method, instruments, required calculations, and corrections to be applied depends on the purpose of the measurement, the allowable uncertainty, and the characteristics of the equipment being tested.\n\nThe methods for pressure measurement and the protocols used for data transmission are also provided. Guidance is given for setting up the instrumentation and determining the uncertainty of the measurement. Information regarding the instrument type, design, applicable pressure range, accuracy, output, and relative cost is provided. Information is also provided on pressure-measuring devices that are used in field environments i.e., Piston Gauges, Manometers, and Low-Absolute-Pressure (Vacuum) Instruments.\n\nThese methods are designed to assist in the evaluation of measurement uncertainty based on current technology and engineering knowledge, taking into account published instrumentation specifications and measurement and application techniques. This Supplement provides guidance in the use of methods to establish the pressure-measurement uncertainty.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology}}\n\n==European (CEN) Standard==\n* EN 472 : Pressure gauge - Vocabulary.\n* EN 837-1 : Pressure gauges.

It is the fourth of the network's [[Cartoon Cartoons]]. The series centers on I. M. Weasel, a smart, beloved and highly successful [[weasel]], and I. R. Baboon, an unsuccessful, unintelligent [[Hamadryas baboon|baboon]] who is jealous of Weasel's success and constantly tries to upstage him, usually failing to do so.\n\nIt was originally a part of ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'' from 1997 to 1999, in the first four seasons, often airing as the third of three segments in an episode (except in one occurrence, where it was a second segment between the two other parts).<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Ugliest Weenie - Part 2 |series=[[Cow and Chicken]] |season=1 |number=5 |date=1997}}</ref> Eventually, ''I Am Weasel'' was [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into its own series: a fifth season with 27 new episodes aired from June 10, 1999, to early 2000 and joined the original 61 which were previously part of ''Cow and Chicken''; the entire series includes 79 episodes overall.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series chronicles the random adventures of two [[funny animal]] [[Frenemy|frenemies]]: I.M. Weasel ([[Michael Dorn]]) and I.R. Baboon ([[Charlie Adler]]). The first one is a famous, heroic, eloquent, highly intelligent and very talented [[least weasel]] who always tries to help people out and is thus adored by everybody, constantly shouting his catchphrase \"I am Weasel!\" while pointing high in the air before going after help.<ref name=\"Opening\">Opening sequence of ''I Am Weasel''</ref> The latter is his total opposite, an ugly and idiotic [[hamadryas baboon]] who is envious of Weasel's success and constantly tries to do better than he does (also doing a victory dance to express his joy when thinking he's doing so),<ref name=\"Opening\"/> and failing miserably after all due to his total stupidity.\n\nStarting from season two, the Red Guy (Charlie Adler), a main character in ''Cow and Chicken'', also gets that role in ''I Am Weasel'', where he is also referred to as \"I.B. Red Guy\", an allusion to Weasel's and Baboon's names.<ref name=\"WrongCartoon\"/> His addition to the series makes him gradually take the role of villain from I.R., who becomes more friendly to Weasel, despite still despising him.\n\nAs the series progresses, I.M.

Baboon (''left'') and I.M. Weasel (''right'').]]\n* '''I.M. Weasel''': The [[protagonist]], a highly intelligent, skilled and famous weasel who mostly plays a [[straight man]] role in a world full of idiots. While very helpful and beloved in the beginning of the series, he eventually starts to show frustration with people's antics and his \"hero\" status towards them becomes more fallible.\n* '''I.R. Baboon''': The original [[antagonist]], a dimwitted and jealous baboon, he eventually becomes Weasel's friend. Shown in the beginning as trying to persuade people attention from Weasel, always failing miserably and being hated, he eventually gets a \"hero\" status as the world becomes just as stupid as him. Always wears a white t-shirt with an upside-down \"I.R.\" written by himself on it.\n* '''The Red Guy''': A comical [[devil]] character. Takes the [[antagonist]] role from I.R. and presents himself with a different personality each episode he appears, similar to Cow and Chicken, trying to persuade and scam the central characters. He may sometimes play as a third main character.\n* '''Jolly Roger''': A fat and tall man who always wears a [[tuxedo]] along a [[sailor]] costume, named after the [[Jolly Roger|pirate flag]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Pirate Lessons (Capt. Butz Pirate) |series=Cow and Chicken |season=2 |number=15 |date=1998 |quote=The character first appears suspended over the mast of the pirate ship, where the flag should be.}}</ref> Assumes similar roles to the Red Guy, including as antagonist.\n* '''Loulabelle''': An assistant woman to Weasel, a blonde [[nurse]].

Cartoon Network demanded a second cartoon to join ''Cow and Chicken'' in its half-hour time slot, so David Feiss came up with ''I Am Weasel'', based upon the novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'', one of his favorite books as a teenager.<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/davefeiss.html |title=Platypus Comix Interviews David Feiss |website=Platypus Comix |accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A767289 |title=Cow and Chicken, and I Am Weasel - two animated cartoon series |author=h2g2 |accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ComadrejaVIX\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.vix.com/es/btg/series/62478/recordamos-soy-la-comadreja |title=\u00a1Recordamos Soy la Comadreja! |first=Luz |last=Collioud |website=VIX |language=Spanish |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref> \"I was doodling one day, and drew a weasel, with the title 'I Am Weasel', off of one of my favorite books as a teenager, Richard Matheson's ''I Am Legend''.

Weasel with the caption \"I Am Weasel\" and that suggested many stories to him.<ref name=\"WeaselWorld\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/english/imw/world.html |title=Weasel World - Meet the creator: David Feiss |author=Cartoon Network Latin America |accessdate=December 1, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010802095922/http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/english/imw/world.html |archivedate=August 2, 2001 }}</ref> The concept for the rivalry between a weasel and a baboon came up from the classic [[nursery rhyme]] \"[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]\", where a monkey is said to be chasing a weasel.<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\"/> Also, the fact that the Red Guy doesn't wear panties was controversial for many people, as he said: \"The thing that I never thought that I'd get approval for was the Red Guy.

Animation production was made overseas by [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]], in [[Seoul]].<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\n=== Retooling ===\nFrom season two onward, the show's story, [[recurring character]]s and art style underwent significant changes. I.R. Baboon went on to become gradually more friendly to Weasel and less seen as [[antagonist]], as that role was taken over by the Red Guy. [[Supporting character]]s from seasons one to three, such as Loulabelle and Admiral Bullets, became less and less seen, completely disappearing from season four. Many characters from ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'' were added as supporting or recurring characters.<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\"/> That was explained by Feiss: \"There was a lot of pressure to complete ''Cow and Chicken'' quickly, and I felt that I couldn't dedicate enough time to the second show. But Cartoon Network wanted to spin off ''Weasel'', so we did. I don't really remember asking if I could or could not cross populate the two shows--I just did it because it felt like the same universe, plus I thought it was funny to have the Red Guy in ''I Am Weasel''\".<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\"/>\n\nThe story started to show more of Weasel's shortcomings and at times allowed him to lapse into a [[wise fool]], suffering similar gags as I.R., as opposed of the invincible [[folk hero]] role he played on season one.<ref name=\"Season2to5\">''I Am Weasel'' - Seasons 2 to 5.</ref> I.R. Baboon started to become more like a hero than a villain, also taking that role from Weasel in some episodes of season five, leading to the finale, where he definitely turns out as the [[protagonist]].<ref name=\"IAreLegend\"/> The show never truly dropped its premise of Weasel serving to contrast Baboon's stupidity and failures (the very thing that allowed Baboon to usurp him in the final episode as the key piece of the entertainment) and that Weasel retained more than enough intelligence and morality to serve as his defining characteristics, among the cast.\n\nThe exact same art style of ''Cow and Chicken'' is used starting from season two.<ref name=\"ComadrejaVIX\"/> Season one is a bit different, including the title cards for episodes, which feature animation and Weasel saying the name of the episode with additional commentary and/or events, contrasting with the style also used for ''Cow and Chicken'', with static image.<ref name=\"Season1\">''I Am Weasel'' - Season 1.</ref><ref name=\"Season2to5\" />\n\n=== Humor style ===\nHumor relies on [[slapstick]] comedy and moderate [[off-color humor]], as typical of many 1990s cartoons, and is based on the existent gap between the central characters, with I.R. Baboon being the center of most [[Running gags|running jokes]], which are mostly about his stupidity and big red butt, though some episodes show I.M. Weasel or the Red Guy also taking this role. Butt jokes are also more frequent when the Red Guy is around and [[Parody|parodies]] of popular culture and other shows and [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]] also take place in some episodes.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=I Am My Lifetime |series=I Am Weasel |season=2 |number=20 |date=1998}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=I Am Clich\u00e9d |series=I Am Weasel |season=4 |number=41 |date=1998}}</ref> Despite all the comedic style, important and meaningful messages about friendship, social differences and general lessons for life are given to children through stories or when I.M.

It is the fourth of the network's [[Cartoon Cartoons]]. The series centers on I. M. Weasel, a smart, beloved and highly successful [[weasel]], and I. R. Baboon, an unsuccessful, unintelligent [[Hamadryas baboon|baboon]] who is jealous of Weasel's success and constantly tries to upstage him, usually failing to do so.\n\nIt was originally a part of ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'' from 1997 to 1999, in the first four seasons, often airing as the third of three segments in an episode (except in one occurrence, where it was a second segment between the two other parts).<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Ugliest Weenie - Part 2 |series=[[Cow and Chicken]] |season=1 |number=5 |date=1997}}</ref> Eventually, ''I Am Weasel'' was [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into its own series: a fifth season with 27 new episodes aired from June 10, 1999, to early 2000 and joined the original 61 which were previously part of ''Cow and Chicken''; the entire series includes 79 episodes overall.\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series chronicles the random adventures of two [[funny animal]] [[Frenemy|frenemies]]: I.M. Weasel ([[Michael Dorn]]) and I.R. Baboon ([[Charlie Adler]]). The first one is a famous, heroic, eloquent, highly intelligent and very talented [[least weasel]] who always tries to help people out and is thus adored by everybody, constantly shouting his catchphrase \"I am Weasel!\" while pointing high in the air before going after help.<ref name=\"Opening\">Opening sequence of ''I Am Weasel''</ref> The latter is his total opposite, an ugly and idiotic [[hamadryas baboon]] who is envious of Weasel's success and constantly tries to do better than he does (also doing a victory dance to express his joy when thinking he's doing so),<ref name=\"Opening\"/> and failing miserably after all due to his total stupidity.\n\nStarting from season two, the Red Guy (Charlie Adler), a main character in ''Cow and Chicken'', also gets that role in ''I Am Weasel'', where he is also referred to as \"I.B. Red Guy\", an allusion to Weasel's and Baboon's names.<ref name=\"WrongCartoon\"/> His addition to the series makes him gradually take the role of villain from I.R., who becomes more friendly to Weasel, despite still despising him.\n\nAs the series progresses, I.M. Weasel, initially showed as an invincible hero, gradually loses the focus to I.R. Baboon, because people are shown to get gradually dumber.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=I.R. Role Model |series=I Am Weasel |season=2 |number=23 |date=1998}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=Baboon Man and Weasel Boy |series=I Am Weasel |season=5 |number=60 |date=1999}}</ref> In the [[series finale]], I.R. is finally presented as the true star of the show instead of him.<ref name=\"IAreLegend\">{{Cite episode |title=I Are Legend |series=I Am Weasel |season=5 |number=79 |date=2000}}</ref>\n\nSupporting characters include Loulabelle ([[Susanne Blakeslee]], [[Teresa Ganzel]]), Jolly Roger ([[Dee Bradley Baker]]) and Admiral Bullets ([[Jess Harnell]], [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]]). Many characters from ''Cow and Chicken'' make [[cameo appearance]]s in ''I Am Weasel'' from season two, these include: Cow, Chicken (Charlie Adler), Mom, Teacher ([[Candi Milo]]), Dad ([[Dee Bradley Baker]]), Flem ([[Howard Morris]]), and Earl ([[Dan Castellaneta]]).<ref name=\"Voices\"/><ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\n=== Universe setting ===\nWhile season one does not have any link to ''Cow and Chicken'' universe, from season two, ''I Am Weasel'' usually happens in the same universe of that show, as its characters (mainly the Red Guy) usually appear, but, in most of the time, in different places.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Rodeo Weasel |series=I Am Weasel |season=5 |number=76 |date=1999}}</ref><ref name=\"IAreLegend\"/> David Feiss, in fact, crosspopulated both series as it made the work easier and he felt it was always the same universe.<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\"/> An episode, though, does present ''I Am Weasel'' as a TV show airing in ''Cow and Chicken'' world, suggesting another universe, but Weasel and I.R. are both taken out of TV after all.<ref name=\"WrongCartoon\">{{Cite episode |title=I.R. in Wrong Cartoon |series=I Am Weasel |season=2 |number=24 |date=1998}}</ref> The same occurs in another episode, but with the characters in the same universe.<ref name=\"IAreLegend\"/>\n\n=== Characters ===\n[[File:Weasel and Baboon.png|thumb|left|240px|The central characters: I.R. Baboon (''left'') and I.M. Weasel (''right'').]]\n* '''I.M. Weasel''': The [[protagonist]], a highly intelligent, skilled and famous weasel who mostly plays a [[straight man]] role in a world full of idiots. While very helpful and beloved in the beginning of the series, he eventually starts to show frustration with people's antics and his \"hero\" status towards them becomes more fallible.\n* '''I.R. Baboon''': The original [[antagonist]], a dimwitted and jealous baboon, he eventually becomes Weasel's friend. Shown in the beginning as trying to persuade people attention from Weasel, always failing miserably and being hated, he eventually gets a \"hero\" status as the world becomes just as stupid as him. Always wears a white t-shirt with an upside-down \"I.R.\" written by himself on it.\n* '''The Red Guy''': A comical [[devil]] character. Takes the [[antagonist]] role from I.R. and presents himself with a different personality each episode he appears, similar to Cow and Chicken, trying to persuade and scam the central characters. He may sometimes play as a third main character.\n* '''Jolly Roger''': A fat and tall man who always wears a [[tuxedo]] along a [[sailor]] costume, named after the [[Jolly Roger|pirate flag]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Pirate Lessons (Capt. Butz Pirate) |series=Cow and Chicken |season=2 |number=15 |date=1998 |quote=The character first appears suspended over the mast of the pirate ship, where the flag should be.}}</ref> Assumes similar roles to the Red Guy, including as antagonist.\n* '''Loulabelle''': An assistant woman to Weasel, a blonde [[nurse]]. Also shown as laboratory assistant in one episode.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Time Weasel |series=I Am Weasel |season=3 |number=27 |date=1998}}</ref> Implied as Weasel's girlfriend in seasons two and three.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=I.R. Ice Fisher |series=I Am Weasel |season=2 |number=22 |date=1998}}</ref>\n* '''Admiral Bullets''': A short-sized [[admiral]] always seen standing up over a small bench. He appears only in the early seasons calling up for Weasel's help.\n\n== Development and production ==\n=== Creation and concept ===\n[[File:HannaBarbera.JPG|thumb|270px|Former Hanna-Barbera studio building, in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], seen here in 2007.]]\n''Cow and Chicken'' started out as the pilot episode \"No Smoking\" on [[What a Cartoon!]] in 1995, and was [[Green-light|greenlit]] to become a series. Cartoon Network demanded a second cartoon to join ''Cow and Chicken'' in its half-hour time slot, so David Feiss came up with ''I Am Weasel'', based upon the novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'', one of his favorite books as a teenager.<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/davefeiss.html |title=Platypus Comix Interviews David Feiss |website=Platypus Comix |accessdate=October 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A767289 |title=Cow and Chicken, and I Am Weasel - two animated cartoon series |author=h2g2 |accessdate=December 8, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ComadrejaVIX\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.vix.com/es/btg/series/62478/recordamos-soy-la-comadreja |title=\u00a1Recordamos Soy la Comadreja! |first=Luz |last=Collioud |website=VIX |language=Spanish |accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref> \"I was doodling one day, and drew a weasel, with the title 'I Am Weasel', off of one of my favorite books as a teenager, Richard Matheson's ''I Am Legend''. I thought against type, that instead of a weasel who was a weasel, this guy would be smart and heroic\".<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\"/>\n\nAccording to Feiss, the idea for creating the show begun as a single drawing of I.M. Weasel with the caption \"I Am Weasel\" and that suggested many stories to him.<ref name=\"WeaselWorld\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/english/imw/world.html |title=Weasel World - Meet the creator: David Feiss |author=Cartoon Network Latin America |accessdate=December 1, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010802095922/http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/english/imw/world.html |archivedate=August 2, 2001 }}</ref> The concept for the rivalry between a weasel and a baboon came up from the classic [[nursery rhyme]] \"[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]\", where a monkey is said to be chasing a weasel.<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\"/> Also, the fact that the Red Guy doesn't wear panties was controversial for many people, as he said: \"The thing that I never thought that I'd get approval for was the Red Guy. The mere fact that he didn't wear pants was a challenge for a lot of people and I am glad Cartoon Network let it go - he's my favorite character\".<ref name=\"WeaselWorld\"/>\n\nProduction began around April 1996<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cartoonnetwork.com/doc/im_weasel/featured_episode2/sb/iwsbh00652-96027_pg001.html |title=I Am Weasel - Storyboards |author=Cartoon Network Department of Cartoons |accessdate=December 3, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000831094051/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/doc/im_weasel/featured_episode2/sb/iwsbh00652-96027_pg001.html |archivedate=August 31, 2000 }}</ref> and the show was inserted as a series of segments in ''Cow and Chicken'' until mid 1999. Right after the end of that show, it was [[spin-off (media)|spun-off]] into a new separated series produced until September 16, 1999,<ref name=\"FeissEpisodes\">{{Cite web |url=https://david-feiss.netfirms.com/episodes.html |title=Episode Guide: Cow and Chicken and I Am Weasel |first=David |last=Feiss |date=January 12, 2000 |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212174713/http://david-feiss.netfirms.com/episodes.html |archivedate=December 12, 2006}}</ref> with all the previous episodes incorporated and removed from ''Cow and Chicken''.\n\nGeneral production took place at the studio of Hanna-Barbera, in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], with the series being labeled as part of both the collection of cartoons of that company and Cartoon Network's [[Cartoon Cartoons]]. Animation production was made overseas by [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]], in [[Seoul]].<ref name=\"Credits\"/>\n\n=== Retooling ===\nFrom season two onward, the show's story, [[recurring character]]s and art style underwent significant changes. I.R. Baboon went on to become gradually more friendly to Weasel and less seen as [[antagonist]], as that role was taken over by the Red Guy. [[Supporting character]]s from seasons one to three, such as Loulabelle and Admiral Bullets, became less and less seen, completely disappearing from season four. Many characters from ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'' were added as supporting or recurring characters.<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\"/> That was explained by Feiss: \"There was a lot of pressure to complete ''Cow and Chicken'' quickly, and I felt that I couldn't dedicate enough time to the second show. But Cartoon Network wanted to spin off ''Weasel'', so we did. I don't really remember asking if I could or could not cross populate the two shows--I just did it because it felt like the same universe, plus I thought it was funny to have the Red Guy in ''I Am Weasel''\".<ref name=\"PlatypusComix\"/>\n\nThe story started to show more of Weasel's shortcomings and at times allowed him to lapse into a [[wise fool]], suffering similar gags as I.R., as opposed of the invincible [[folk hero]] role he played on season one.<ref name=\"Season2to5\">''I Am Weasel'' - Seasons 2 to 5.</ref> I.R. Baboon started to become more like a hero than a villain, also taking that role from Weasel in some episodes of season five, leading to the finale, where he definitely turns out as the [[protagonist]].<ref name=\"IAreLegend\"/> The show never truly dropped its premise of Weasel serving to contrast Baboon's stupidity and failures (the very thing that allowed Baboon to usurp him in the final episode as the key piece of the entertainment) and that Weasel retained more than enough intelligence and morality to serve as his defining characteristics, among the cast.\n\nThe exact same art style of ''Cow and Chicken'' is used starting from season two.<ref name=\"ComadrejaVIX\"/> Season one is a bit different, including the title cards for episodes, which feature animation and Weasel saying the name of the episode with additional commentary and/or events, contrasting with the style also used for ''Cow and Chicken'', with static image.<ref name=\"Season1\">''I Am Weasel'' - Season 1.</ref><ref name=\"Season2to5\" />\n\n=== Humor style ===\nHumor relies on [[slapstick]] comedy and moderate [[off-color humor]], as typical of many 1990s cartoons, and is based on the existent gap between the central characters, with I.R. Baboon being the center of most [[Running gags|running jokes]], which are mostly about his stupidity and big red butt, though some episodes show I.M. Weasel or the Red Guy also taking this role. Butt jokes are also more frequent when the Red Guy is around and [[Parody|parodies]] of popular culture and other shows and [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]] also take place in some episodes.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=I Am My Lifetime |series=I Am Weasel |season=2 |number=20 |date=1998}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=I Am Clich\u00e9d |series=I Am Weasel |season=4 |number=41 |date=1998}}</ref> Despite all the comedic style, important and meaningful messages about friendship, social differences and general lessons for life are given to children through stories or when I.M. Weasel directly talks to the audience.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lifestyle.com.vn/i-am-weasel-phim-hoat-hinh-vui-nhon-ve-doi-ban-lac-que-nhat-hanh-tinh/ |title=I Am Weasel: Phim ho\u1ea1t h\u00ecnh vui nh\u1ed9n v\u1ec1 '\u0111\u00f4i b\u1ea1n l\u1ea1c qu\u1ebb nh\u1ea5t h\u00e0nh tinh' |author=LifeStyle |language=Vietnamese |date=March 15, 2017 |accessdate=December 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716054204/http://lifestyle.com.vn/i-am-weasel-phim-hoat-hinh-vui-nhon-ve-doi-ban-lac-que-nhat-hanh-tinh/ |archive-date=July 16, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSeason one shows Weasel as a \"perfect\" character, not leaving a single shortcoming, and Baboon as exact opposite to this, but that gradually changes throughout the series, with Weasel later starting to show some misbehavior and inefficiency, mostly because he notices people around him are getting dumber, and thus I.R. even being dimwitted gets a hero status.<ref name=\"IAreLegend\"/> From season two onward, the Red Guy incorporates the style of humor found in ''Cow and Chicken'', taking the role of villain, but also appearing as a [[tritagonist|third wheel]].<ref name=\"IAreLegend\"/> In season five, Jolly Roger also starts to fill both roles.<ref name=\"BlueHiney\"/>\n\nSome episodes titles make fun of Baboon's misspelling, with grammatically incorrect names such as \"I {{sic|Are|hide=yes}} Big Star\", \"I {{sic|Are|hide=yes}} Good Salesmans\" and \"I {{sic|Are|hide=yes}} {{sic|a|hide=yes}} Artiste\".<ref name=\"Titlecards\"/> The titles also tend to reference the name of the show and Weasel's catchphrase, often being written in [[grammatical person|first person]].<ref name=\"Titlecards\"/>\n\nThe [[fourth wall]] is often broken, mostly at the end of episodes. The characters do it to make some ending commentaries, give advice to spectators or just call for the end of the episode.<ref name=\"BlueHiney\">{{Cite episode |title=My Blue Hiney |series=I Am Weasel |season=5 |number=66 |date=1999}}</ref>\n\n=== Title, credits and music ===\nThe title sequence features I.M.
