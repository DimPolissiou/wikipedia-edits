Born in [[Nova Scotia]], she came west to [[Alberta]] to accept a job as a teacher.  She later moved to [[Calgary]] where she encountered evangelist [[William Aberhart]] and became a convert to his [[social credit]] economic theories.  After advocating these theories across the province, she was elected in the [[1935 Alberta general election|1935 provincial election]] as a candidate of Aberhart's newly formed [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit League]].\n\nLeft out of cabinet despite her loyalty to Aberhart, she sided with the insurgents during the [[1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt]], rejoining Aberhart's followers once a settlement was reached.  She was defeated in the [[1940 Alberta general election|1940 election]].  After her defeat, she abandoned Social Credit for the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]], moved to Edmonton, and served for fifteen years as a school trustee. Edith Rogers died in 1985.\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn in [[Eastville, Nova Scotia]], to Samuel G. and Mahala (n\u00e9e Graham) Cox, Rogers was raised on a farm and attended Eastville High School and [[Normal School]].  She worked as a teacher in Nova Scotia until 1913, when she visited her aunt, Margaret Redmond, in [[Edgerton, Alberta|Edgerton]], [[Alberta]].  While there, she accepted an offer to teach at Bloomington School.  She attended [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]] Normal School in 1914, after which she taught in Edgerton and near [[Tofield]] until 1918.<ref name=\"AC\">{{cite web |url=https://hermis.alberta.ca/PAA/Details.aspx?st=%22Alexander+Cameron+Rutherford%22&cp=1&CollectionID=1&ReturnUrl=%2FPAA%2FSearch.aspx%3Fst%3D%2522Alexander%2BCameron%2BRutherford%2522%26cp%3D1%26CollectionID%3D1&dv=True&DeptID=1&ObjectID=PR1477 |title=Edith and William Rogers fonds (PR1477) |publisher=Provincial Archives of Alberta |accessdate=2017-09-18 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  Disillusioned with teaching in rural schoolhouses, she took a business course and began work as a [[bank teller]] for the Merchants Bank of Canada, which later merged with the [[Bank of Montreal]], in Edgerton;<ref name=\"Cavanaugh\">Cavanaugh 506</ref><ref name=\"Byrne 93\">Byrne 93</ref> this was an unusual career choice for a woman at the time.<ref name=\"Byrne 93\"/>  In 1922 she moved to Tofield, where she continued to work as a teller.

Rogers' first foray into politics took place during the [[1930 Canadian federal election|1930 federal election]], when she assisted with [[R. B. Bennett]]'s successful [[Calgary West]] campaign.  Governments' inability to end or alleviate the effects of the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]] soon disillusioned her with conventional politics.  Upon hearing that Aberhart was beginning to incorporate politics and economics into his weekly gospel radio addresses, she began to listen and soon became a convert to his version of [[social credit]].<ref name=\"Cavanaugh\"/>\n\n==Early involvement in social credit==\n\nIn 1932 Rogers convinced Aberhart to hold public meetings on social credit in Calgary; she subsequently organized neighbourhood study groups on the theory.  In 1933 the Central Council of Social Credit in [[Calgary]], which coordinated the city's sixty social credit study groups, named her women's organizer, in which capacity she held mass meetings designed to recruit women to social credit.  In 1934 she embarked on a sixteen-month speaking tour of Alberta.  At the same time, she organized social credit study groups around the province, including seventy-two in [[Edmonton]].<ref name=\"Cavanaugh\"/>  She concluded her tour by organizing a mass meeting there in the spring of 1935, where Aberhart spoke before 9,000 people.<ref>Byrne 94</ref>\n\nWhen fissures appeared between Aberhart and people who supported the more orthodox version of social credit proposed by [[C.

During the [[1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt]] she sided with the insurgents who threatened to bring down the government unless it took concrete steps to implement social credit.  Once the insurgents reached a settlement with Aberhart, she returned to her former position of loyalty, and sought re-election as a Social Crediter in the [[1940 Alberta general election|1940 election]].  Prior to this election, Social Credit's opponents, including [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservatives]], and those elements of the UFA that had not moved to Social Credit, formed the [[People's League (Alberta)|People's League]], which ran nominally [[independent (politician)|independent]] candidates.<ref name=\"Cavanaugh\"/>  One of these candidates, [[Percy McKelvey]], led Rogers by 13 votes on the first count.

In 1972, when Justin was only 4 years old, his family emigrated to New Zealand, where he lives presently.\n\nJustin spent the next couple of decades in Dunedin. He also went to university in this same city, having completed both a Bachelor of Commerce (1987) and a Bachelor of Arts (1993) at the [[University of Otago]].\n\nIn 1990, Summerton got a studio flat at [[St Clair, New Zealand|St Clair]] Esplanade, in Dunedin, where he did some of his early experiments with oils, working mainly with seascapes. The following year, he would have his first solo exhibition, at O'Brooks Gallery, in Dunedin.\n\n==Traveling and street painting==\nIn 1992, Justin Summerton travelled to [[Liverpool]]. He rented a studio at the [[Bluecoat Chambers]] and worked on Liverpool cityscapes. He then went to paint and explore [[Paris]], and then [[Copenhagen]], in [[Denmark]], where he was commissioned to paint a mural.\n\nTwo years later, he went to the [[United States]]. There, he exhibited in [[Detroit]] and began \"[[live painting]]\" in [[Central Park]], in [[New York City]].

In 1972, when Justin was only 4 years old, his family emigrated to New Zealand, where he lives presently.\n\nJustin spent the next couple of decades in Dunedin. He also went to university in this same city, having completed both a Bachelor of Commerce (1987) and a Bachelor of Arts (1993) at the [[University of Otago]].\n\nIn 1990, Summerton got a studio flat at [[St Clair, New Zealand|St Clair]] Esplanade, in Dunedin, where he did some of his early experiments with oils, working mainly with seascapes. The following year, he would have his first solo exhibition, at O'Brooks Gallery, in Dunedin.\n\n==Traveling and street painting==\nIn 1992, Justin Summerton travelled to [[Liverpool]]. He rented a studio at the [[Bluecoat Chambers]] and worked on Liverpool cityscapes. He then went to paint and explore [[Paris]], and then [[Copenhagen]], in [[Denmark]], where he was commissioned to paint a mural.\n\nTwo years later, he went to the [[United States]]. There, he exhibited in [[Detroit]] and began \"[[live painting]]\" in [[Central Park]], in [[New York City]]. He then continued with street painting in [[Nice]], in the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]], South of [[France]].\n\nIn 1995, Justin could be found working out of a log cabin in [[Mendocino, California|Mendocino]], Northern [[California]].

She began modeling as a child, doing runway work and catalogue ads, and progressed from there to television commercials.\n\nFrom there, she got her first guest-starring role on the Australian medical drama ''Children's Hospital'', and won her first film role, as Mercia in the 1998 film ''15 Amore''.  Shortly thereafter, she won ModelQuest98's Grand Final for the 12-to-15 division, and was cast as \"Jack\" in the [[science fiction film|science fiction]] film ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]''.\n\nGriffith continued to act throughout her teenage years, balancing her career with schooling.  She starred in ''Desperately Seeking Brandi,'' a short film that was broadcast on the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] website to coincide with the 2000 [[Sydney Olympics|Sydney Olympic games]].  Her costars in the film were [[Brandi Chastain]] and [[Oliver Ackland]].  That same year, she was also a guest-star on the Australian comedy TV series ''Backberner.''\n\nIn 2001, she starred in the short film ''Search'' by director Hannah Hilliard.  In 2002, she did a three-month guest-star stint on the popular Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away|Home & Away]]'' and then guest-starred on an episode of the crime drama ''[[White Collar Blue]].''  2003 saw her appearing in a music video by rocker [[Ben Lee]], called \"Running With Scissors,\" directed by [[Nash Edgerton]].\n\nIn 2004 she reprised her role as \"Jack\" from ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'' in the [[anime]] ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury]]''.  She also auditioned to play the role in the feature film sequel to ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]''. Her casting was backed by producer and star [[Vin Diesel]], but Griffith was told she had to \"toughen up\" for the role. Despite enlisting the aid of a kick-boxing trainer, she had only three weeks to prepare, and the role eventually went to [[Alexa Davalos]].\n\n2004 also saw Griffith embark upon her art career in earnest, with two major solo gallery showings.  Her first, ''Chrysalis,'' was held at the Tighes Hill Gallery in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle, Australia]] in January 2004.  Her second, ''A Month in Kaos,'' was held at the Surry Hills Cafe 249 art gallery in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]] in May 2004.  Griffith also acted in another short film, ''A Whole New You,'' and guest-starred in an episode of the hit Australian medical drama ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]].''  As the year came to a close, Griffith portrayed [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]] in print and television ads promoting the Flickerfest film festival.\n\nIn 2005, Griffith held her third art exhibition, a collaboration with her brother, poet Damien Griffith, called ''Sibling Revelry''.

She began modeling as a child, doing runway work and catalogue ads, and progressed from there to television commercials.\n\nFrom there, she got her first guest-starring role on the Australian medical drama ''Children's Hospital'', and won her first film role, as Mercia in the 1998 film ''15 Amore''.  Shortly thereafter, she won ModelQuest98's Grand Final for the 12-to-15 division, and was cast as \"Jack\" in the [[science fiction film|science fiction]] film ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]''.\n\nGriffith continued to act throughout her teenage years, balancing her career with schooling.  She starred in ''Desperately Seeking Brandi,'' a short film that was broadcast on the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] website to coincide with the 2000 [[Sydney Olympics|Sydney Olympic games]].  Her costars in the film were [[Brandi Chastain]] and [[Oliver Ackland]].  That same year, she was also a guest-star on the Australian comedy TV series ''Backberner.''\n\nIn 2001, she starred in the short film ''Search'' by director Hannah Hilliard.  In 2002, she did a three-month guest-star stint on the popular Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away|Home & Away]]'' and then guest-starred on an episode of the crime drama ''[[White Collar Blue]].''  2003 saw her appearing in a music video by rocker [[Ben Lee]], called \"Running With Scissors,\" directed by [[Nash Edgerton]].\n\nIn 2004 she reprised her role as \"Jack\" from ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'' in the [[anime]] ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury]]''.  She also auditioned to play the role in the feature film sequel to ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]''. Her casting was backed by producer and star [[Vin Diesel]], but Griffith was told she had to \"toughen up\" for the role. Despite enlisting the aid of a kick-boxing trainer, she had only three weeks to prepare, and the role eventually went to [[Alexa Davalos]].\n\n2004 also saw Griffith embark upon her art career in earnest, with two major solo gallery showings.  Her first, ''Chrysalis,'' was held at the Tighes Hill Gallery in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle, Australia]] in January 2004.  Her second, ''A Month in Kaos,'' was held at the Surry Hills Cafe 249 art gallery in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]] in May 2004.  Griffith also acted in another short film, ''A Whole New You,'' and guest-starred in an episode of the hit Australian medical drama ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]].''  As the year came to a close, Griffith portrayed [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]] in print and television ads promoting the Flickerfest film festival.\n\nIn 2005, Griffith held her third art exhibition, a collaboration with her brother, poet Damien Griffith, called ''Sibling Revelry''. In conjunction with the art show, they released a limited-edition book of their work, pairing her paintings with his poems.  Griffith also contributed to a [[Wearable Art]] Festival, and will launch a line of clothing later in 2005.  She is working on her second book, a children's book, for release in late 2005, and portrayed the starring role of Clare Newell in a short film, ''[[Wrong Answer]]'', which will be continued in the psychological thriller called ''Volunteer'', to be directed by JD Cohen.\n\nGriffith has a daughter, Poppy, born in 2009.<ref name=\"Inspirational birth\">{{cite news |author=Amy Edwards |title=Inspirational birth re-ignites artistic creativity |work=[[The Newcastle Herald]] |date=February 11, 2011 |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/466466/inspirational-birth-re-ignites-artistic-creativity/ |accessdate=2013-12-29}}</ref>\n\n== Portfolio ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| align=\"center\" | '''Year'''\n| align=\"center\" | '''Work'''\n| align=\"center\" | '''Format'''\n| align=\"center\" | '''Role'''\n| align=\"center\" | '''Status'''\n|-\n| 1998\n| ''Children's Hospital''\n| TV show\n| Kelly\n| Single episode guest appearance\n|-\n| 1999\n| ''[[15 Amore]]''\n| Film\n| Mercia\n| \n|-\n| 2000\n| ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]''\n| Film\n| Jack/Jackie\n| \n|-\n| 2000\n| ''Desperately Seeking Brandi''\n| Short film (internet webcast)\n| Bea\n| \n|-\n| 2000\n| ''Backberner''\n| TV show\n| Kristi Taylor\n| Single episode guest appearance\n|-\n| 2001\n| ''Search''\n| Short film\n| May\n| \n|-\n| 2002\n| ''[[White Collar Blue]]''\n| TV show\n| Lilly Derwent\n| Single episode guest appearance\n|-\n| 2002\n| ''[[Home and Away]]''\n| TV show\n| Aimee Cooper\n| Recurring guest role\n|-\n| 2003\n| ''Running With Scissors''\n| Music video\n| Waitress\n| \n|-\n| 2004\n| ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]]''\n| TV show\n| Cindy\n| Single episode guest appearance \n|-\n| 2004\n| ''A Whole New You''\n| Short film\n| Receptionist\n| \n|-\n| 2004\n| ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury]]''\n| Anime DVD\n| Jack/Jackie\n| \n|-\n| 2004\n| ''A Month in Kaos''\n| Art exhibit\n| Painter\n| \n|-\n| 2004\n| ''Chrysalis''\n| Art exhibit\n| Painter\n| \n|-\n| 2004\n| ''Flickerfest''\n| Advertising campaign\n| [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]\n| \n|-\n| 2005\n| ''[[Wrong Answer]]''\n| Short film\n| Clare Newell\n| Winner of Judges' Choice: Short Film, Audience Choice: Short Film and Best of Fest at the 2005 Frankly Film Fest\n|-\n| 2005\n| ''Sibling Revelry''\n| Art exhibit\n| Painter\n| \n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050307145707/http://www.bladepicturecompany.com/brandi.html The Blade Picture Company presents: Desperately Seeking Brandi]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050307152213/http://www.newfilmmedia.com/showcase.html New Film Media presents: A Whole New You]\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb name|0341587}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Griffith, Rhiana}}\n[[Category:1985 births]]\n[[Category:Australian film actresses]]\n[[Category:Australian child actresses]]\n[[Category:Australian female models]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Australian women painters]]\n[[Category:People from the Hunter Region]]\n[[Category:Actresses from New South Wales]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian actresses]]\n[[Category:21st-century Australian actresses]]\n", "name_user": "Orenburg1", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhiana_Griffith"}

The king refused his consent. The chapter at Salisbury then elected him to succeed [[Josceline de Bohon|Joscelin]] as the Bishop of Salisbury.

The total word count is 505; DO NOT ADD UNLESS NECCESSARY! -->\nCollege students Brit, Candy, and Cotty often spend their time partying while their friend Faith attends a religious youth group. As their classmates head to spring break, they are stuck behind due to a lack of money. Desperate to make the trip, Brit and Candy, after getting high on [[cocaine]], don [[ski masks]] and rob a local restaurant using [[hammers]] and realistic-looking [[squirt guns]]. They are assisted by Cotty, who drives (and later burns) the getaway car stolen from one of their professors. Cotty, Candy, and Brit divulge the details of their crime to a horrified Faith, who keeps quiet about it.\n\nIn [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], the girls attend wild beach [[parties]] fueled by alcohol, drugs, and sex. After a particularly wild party, all four are arrested for using narcotics. They spend the night in a [[holding cell]], but are [[bail]]ed out by Alien, a local rapper, drug hustler, and arms dealer. Alien charms Cotty, Candy, and Brit with his wealth and \"bad boy\" swagger, but Faith feels uneasy. Alien takes the girls to a local club frequented by gang members, where Faith becomes even more uncomfortable with his lifestyle. Despite Alien's attempts to convince her to stay, Faith decides to leave and begs the others to come with her. They refuse, however, and she makes the trip home alone.\n\nAlien takes the remaining girls to a strip club owned by his rival and childhood best friend, Big Arch, who warns Alien to stop selling drugs in his territory. Alien then takes the girls to his mansion, where he flaunts his drug money and cache of weapons, describing his life as the \"[[American Dream]]\". Brit and Candy grab two of his guns and threaten to kill him. Turned on, Alien fellates the gun and declares that he has fallen in love with the girls, claiming that they are his soulmates.\n\nAlien arms the girls with pink ski masks and [[shotguns]], taking them to his pool where he plays the piano while he and the girls sing Britney Spears' \"[[Everytime]],\" later performing several armed robberies. While in Alien's car they are approached by Big Arch and another member of his gang who threaten them and execute a [[drive-by shooting]], wounding Cotty in the process. Alien promises to retaliate, but a traumatized Cotty comes to her senses and chooses to follow in Faith's footsteps, returning home. Brit and Candy stay behind and have [[Threesome|three-way]] sex with Alien in his pool. The three of them decide to take revenge on Big Arch. In a [[flashforward]], the two girls call home, promising to work harder and become better people.\n\nBack in the present, the three travel in a motorboat to Big Arch's mansion. After they dock at the pier, Alien is shot and killed by one of Big Arch's guards. Brit and Candy carry on, killing Big Arch's gang before finally confronting and killing Big Arch himself. During the assault and its aftermath, the camera pans over the dead bodies of Big Arch's gang while the girls speak in a [[voice-over]], first heard earlier in the film, describing the beach's beauty and musing that they have discovered who they truly are.

The total word count is 505; DO NOT ADD UNLESS NECCESSARY! -->\nCollege students Brit, Candy, and Cotty often spend their time partying while their friend Faith attends a religious youth group. As their classmates head to spring break, they are stuck behind due to a lack of money. Desperate to make the trip, Brit and Candy, after getting high on [[cocaine]], don [[ski masks]] and rob a local restaurant using [[hammers]] and realistic-looking [[squirt guns]]. They are assisted by Cotty, who drives (and later burns) the getaway car stolen from one of their professors. Cotty, Candy, and Brit divulge the details of their crime to a horrified Faith, who keeps quiet about it.\n\nIn [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], the girls attend wild beach [[parties]] fueled by alcohol, drugs, and sex. After a particularly wild party, all four are arrested for using narcotics. They spend the night in a [[holding cell]], but are [[bail]]ed out by Alien, a local rapper, drug hustler, and arms dealer. Alien charms Cotty, Candy, and Brit with his wealth and \"bad boy\" swagger, but Faith feels uneasy. Alien takes the girls to a local club frequented by gang members, where Faith becomes even more uncomfortable with his lifestyle. Despite Alien's attempts to convince her to stay, Faith decides to leave and begs the others to come with her. They refuse, however, and she makes the trip home alone.\n\nAlien takes the remaining girls to a strip club owned by his rival and childhood best friend, Big Arch, who warns Alien to stop selling drugs in his territory. Alien then takes the girls to his mansion, where he flaunts his drug money and cache of weapons, describing his life as the \"[[American Dream]]\". Brit and Candy grab two of his guns and threaten to kill him. Turned on, Alien fellates the gun and declares that he has fallen in love with the girls, claiming that they are his soulmates.\n\nAlien arms the girls with pink ski masks and [[shotguns]], taking them to his pool where he plays the piano while he and the girls sing Britney Spears' \"[[Everytime]],\" later performing several armed robberies. While in Alien's car they are approached by Big Arch and another member of his gang who threaten them and execute a [[drive-by shooting]], wounding Cotty in the process. Alien promises to retaliate, but a traumatized Cotty comes to her senses and chooses to follow in Faith's footsteps, returning home. Brit and Candy stay behind and have [[Threesome|three-way]] sex with Alien in his pool. The three of them decide to take revenge on Big Arch. In a [[flashforward]], the two girls call home, promising to work harder and become better people.\n\nBack in the present, the three travel in a motorboat to Big Arch's mansion. After they dock at the pier, Alien is shot and killed by one of Big Arch's guards. Brit and Candy carry on, killing Big Arch's gang before finally confronting and killing Big Arch himself. During the assault and its aftermath, the camera pans over the dead bodies of Big Arch's gang while the girls speak in a [[voice-over]], first heard earlier in the film, describing the beach's beauty and musing that they have discovered who they truly are. Brit and Candy, silent and wearing pensive, ambiguous expressions, drive home in Big Arch's [[Lamborghini]]. A final [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shows the two girls kissing Alien's dead body before departing.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[James Franco]] as Alien, a rapper, drug hustler and arms dealer who takes the girls under his wing.\n*[[Selena Gomez]] as Faith, a girl who tries to devote her life to Christianity but is also friends with party girls Brit, Candy and Cotty.\n*[[Vanessa Hudgens]] as Candy, an irresponsible and uncaring girl in college and Brit's best friend.\n*[[Ashley Benson]] as Brit, a rebellious and danger seeking college girl, also Candy\u2019s best friend.\n*[[Rachel Korine]] as Cotty, a promiscuous girl who likes to party but is a little more careful than her friends Candy and Brit.\n*[[Gucci Mane]] as Archie \"Big Arch\", Alien's childhood best friend turned rival drug dealer.\n\nAdditionally, [[Heather Morris]], Ash Lendzion, and Emma Holzer appear as Faith's friends Bess, Forest and Heather.

Tobe invites much-older Harlan to the beach.  He accepts, which results in his losing his job. At the beach, they share a passionate kiss and, after returning to Harlan's house, they have sex.  He  takes her on a date, and the trio get something to eat. Later that night, they go on their \"real\" date, dancing and meeting up with Tobe's friends for another party, where Harlan takes drugs under the influence of Tobe. She returns home the next day; as she has returned home long after she was expected, Wade, her father, becomes enraged, and she retreats to her room. When she refuses to talk, he pounds on the door and leaves visible damage.\n\nTobe continues to see Harlan.  Her father's rage increases, and he shatters her bedroom window.  The romantically involved couple ride a horse that supposedly belongs to one of Harlan's friends named Charlie.  Upon returning, Charlie claims he has never met Harlan and that the horse was stolen.  The couple are held in police custody until Wade comes to pick up Tobe.  She tells Harlan that they should no longer see each other.  Harlan, however, is persistent and takes Lonnie shooting without Wade's permission. Wade, who is armed, orders Harlan to leave his children alone.\n\nMentally unstable, Harlan is evicted from his apartment after shooting at his reflection in a mirror, imagining a [[Wild West]] style \"shoot-out\".  After an awkward incident at a local synagogue, where he is abruptly ushered out, he breaks into what is presumably the house of his father or foster father, who is revealed to be a [[Hasidic Jew]]. He leaves the letter he has been narrating throughout the film after taking multiple Jewish memorabilia, and the contents of a box, in a closet, inscribed with his name. He breaks into Tobe's house and packs a bag so that they can run away.  When Tobe comes home to find him, she is dumbfounded, happy to see him at first. As she slowly realizes he is deranged, she tells him she does not want to leave her family and that he should go. As they argue, Harlan shoots her in the stomach.\n\nWhen Tobe's father returns home to find Tobe alone on her bed, barely alive, he suspects Harlan, who has failed in an attempt at calling [[9-1-1]] and run away.  Wade rushes Tobe to the hospital, where she is attached to a breathing machine and remains in a coma.  Harlan, who is covered in Tobe's blood, then shoots himself in the side to conceal Tobe's blood and also make it look like it was Wade who had shot them. Harlan finds Lonnie and convinces him that it was really Wade who shot Tobe, and that Harlan was wounded while trying to stop him. Tobe regains consciousness at the hospital and Wade realizes that Harlan has taken Lonnie. At night while Harlan and Lonnie are by a fire, Wade, Charlie and a detective named Sheridan arrive. Harlan shoots Charlie before riding off with Lonnie.\n\nThey stumble upon a Western film set where shooting has just begun. Wade and Sheridan arrive with two more cops. During the shootout, Harlan guns down detective Sheridan and one of the cops.  Harlan and Lonnie escape to a construction site, where Wade finds them and another shootout ensues. Wade shoots Harlan to death to the horror of Lonnie.\n\nLater, Wade drives Tobe and Lonnie to a place where Tobe and Harlan had a pleasant day. Tobe is holding a box that contains her former lover's ashes.  Her brother asks her what they should say about him. She replies, \"Don't say anything, just think it,\" and scatters the ashes.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Actor !!

The film made its debut in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4280015/year/2005.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Down in the Valley |accessdate=2009-12-06|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> on May 13, and made its limited theatrical release in [[North America]] in May 5, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[San Fernando Valley]], rebellious teenager October \"Tobe\" takes a walk with her younger brother, Lonnie.  The next day, Tobe goes to the beach with friends, and when they stop for gasoline, they are assisted by Harlan, a young man who affects a folksy, cowboy style.  Tobe invites much-older Harlan to the beach.  He accepts, which results in his losing his job. At the beach, they share a passionate kiss and, after returning to Harlan's house, they have sex.  He  takes her on a date, and the trio get something to eat. Later that night, they go on their \"real\" date, dancing and meeting up with Tobe's friends for another party, where Harlan takes drugs under the influence of Tobe. She returns home the next day; as she has returned home long after she was expected, Wade, her father, becomes enraged, and she retreats to her room.
