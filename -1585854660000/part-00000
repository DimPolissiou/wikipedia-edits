{"title_page": "Safety Harbor culture", "text_new": "{{short description|Archaeological culture practiced by Native Americans living on the central Gulf coast Florida}}\n[[File:Safety Harbor culture.png|thumb|Map of the approximate area of the Safety Harbor archaeological culture.]]\nThe '''Safety Harbor culture''' was an [[archaeological culture]] practiced by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] living on the central [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf coast]] of the [[Florida]] peninsula, from about 900 CE until after 1700. The Safety Harbor culture is defined by the presence of Safety Harbor ceramics in burial [[mound]]s. The culture is named after the [[Safety Harbor Site]], which is close to the center of the culture area. The Safety Harbor Site is the probable location of the chief town of the [[Tocobaga]], the best known of the groups practicing the Safety Harbor culture.\n\nThe Safety Harbor people were organized into [[chiefdoms]] and lived primarily in villages along the shoreline of [[Tampa Bay]] and the adjacent [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. The chiefdoms may have consisted of about {{convert|15|mi|km}} of shoreline, and extended about {{convert|20|mi|km}} inland. Each chiefdom had a principal town or \"capital\" with a [[temple]] [[Mound#North American archaeology|mound]] and central [[plaza]]. Fifteen such towns have been identified along the Florida Gulf coast from southern [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco County]] to northern [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota County]], an area that includes all of the [[Tampa Bay area]]. Only one principal town has been found inland. \n\nDescriptions of the villages by Spanish visitors mostly agree with archaeological reconstructions. \"Capitals\" had a central rectangular plaza. A truncated pyramidal mound up to {{convert|20|ft|m}} high and up to {{convert|130|ft|m}} long on each side at the base stood on one side of the plaza. One or more buildings stood on top of the mound, and a ramp ran from the top of the mound to the plaza. A burial mound would be located off to the side. A shell mound, or [[midden]], ran along the shore, and other middens were sometimes located on other sides of the plaza. The plaza itself was kept clear of debris. The more important residents of the town had their houses around the plaza, while the lower class lived in huts further from the plaza. The Spanish reported that the chief and his family lived on the main mound, and that a \"temple\" (probably a [[charnel house]]) stood on the opposite side of the plaza. Archaeological excavations suggest that the charnel houses were on the mounds. Village sites without mounds and isolated burial mounds are also known.<ref>Bullen: 50-1, 53-4</ref><ref>Milanich 1998: 103, 105</ref>\n\n==Geography and time span==\nThe Safety Harbor culture area extended along the central Gulf coast of Florida. Bullen described it as running from [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] to [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], with some evidence that it reached the [[Aucilla River]] to the north and [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] to the south. Mitchem limited the northern extent of the culture area to the [[Withlacoochee River (Florida)|Withlacoochee River]], but included the coast south into [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]], and east into eastern [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]]. Milanich defines the culture area as the coast from the Withlacoochee River to Charlotte Harbor, placing the area from Charlotte Harbor to Collier County in the [[Caloosahatchee culture]]. The heart of the culture area was around [[Tampa Bay]], what Mitchem and Milanich call \"Circum-Tampa Bay\". This area included all of what is now [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough]] and [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas]] counties, southern [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco County]], and northern [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee County]]. To the north the area between the Withlacooche River and the Gulf coast, including [[Citrus County, Florida|Citrus County]], [[Hernando County, Florida|Hernando County]] and northern Pasco County, formed the \"Northern Safety Harbor\" area. South of Tampa Bay southern Manatee County, [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota County]] and northern [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte County]] comprised the \"Manasota Safety Harbor\" (Mitchem) or \"South-Central Safety Harbor\" (Milanich) area (\"Manasota\" is also the name given the Weedon Island-related culture that preceded the Safety Harbor culture in most of its area). Mitchem later agreed that \"South-Central Safety Harbor\" was preferable to avoid confusion. [[DeSoto County, Florida|DeSoto County]], [[Hardee County, Florida|Hardee County]] and most of [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]] were part of the \"Inland Safety Harbor\" area. Mitchem called his regional variant south of Charlotte Harbor (southern Charlotte County, [[Lee County, Florida|Lee County]] and western Collier County) \"South Florida\".<ref name=Bullen50>Bullen: 50</ref><ref>Milanich 1994: 392-401</ref><ref>Mitchem: 568, 569</ref>\n\nSafety Harbor ceramics are found in burial mounds in the Caloosahatchee culture area (Mitchem's South Florida Safety Harbor). Milanich ascribes the presence of such objects to trade, but states that future work may clarify the relationship of the Safety Harbor and Caloosahatchee cultures. Luer and Almy note that temple mounds south of Charlotte Harbor differ significantly from Safety Harbor temple mounds in form. Luer has also argued that other materials found in burial mounds south of Charlotte Harbor belong to a south Florida, or \"Glades Cult\", artifact complex. Luer also argues that the presence of [[Mississippian culture]] and [[St. Johns culture]] artifacts in burial mounds shows that such articles, along with Safety Harbor objects, were traded into the area.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Luer|first=George M.|title=Historic Sources at the Pineland Site, Lee County Florida|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=March 1991|volume=44|issue=1|pages=70\u201371|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00046/60j|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"LA146\"/><ref>Milanich 1994: 390-391</ref>\n\nThe Safety Harbor culture developed in-place from the [[Manasota culture]], a [[Weeden Island culture|Weeden Island]]-related culture of the central Florida Gulf coast.

Ceramics found elsewhere at Safety Harbor sites (in [[middens]] and village living areas) are almost always undecorated. Major Safety Harbor sites had platform, or temple, mounds. The term \"temple mound\" is based on the description by members of the de Soto expedition of a temple on a constructed earthwork mound in a Safety Harbor village. Bullen and Milanich state that the temples were likely charnel houses, where bodies were prepared and stored for later burial. Several of the temple mounds have been destroyed since the 19th century, but at least fifteen have been documented as having once existed around Tampa Bay and on the Gulf coast near Tampa Bay. These temple mounds were rectangular and had flat tops, usually with a ramp leading up to the top on one side.<ref>Bullen: 53</ref><ref name=\"Luer 2005 5\">{{cite journal|last=Luer|first=George|title=Introduction|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=March\u2013June 2005|volume=58|issue=1\u20132|pages=5|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00203/7j|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Luer and Almy: 127, 129\">Luer and Almy: 127, 129</ref><ref>Milanich 1994: 389-90, 393-94</ref>\n\n===Temple mounds===\nKnown Safety Harbor sites with \"temple\" mounds include:\n*Anclote Temple Mound, near the mouth of the [[Anclote River]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA130>Luer and Almy: 130</ref>\n*[[Jungle Prada Site|Anderson/Narvaez Temple Mound]], in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].<ref name=LA131>Luer and Almy: 131</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Anderson-Narv\u00e1ez Mound at Jungle Prada Mound Park|url=http://www.trailoffloridasindianheritage.org/o-Anderson-Narvaez_Mound.html|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> \n*Bayshore Homes Temple Mound, in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], now destroyed.<ref>Luer and Almy: 130-31</ref>\n*Dunedin Temple Mound, in [[Dunedin, Florida|Dunedin]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA130/>\n*Fort Brooke Temple Mound, at the site of [[Fort Brooke]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA132>Luer and Almy: 132</ref>\n*Harbor Key Temple Mound (Bishop Harbor Temple Mound), on Bishop Harbor in [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee County]].<ref name=LA133>Luer and Almy: 133</ref>\n*[[Madira Bickel Mound State Archeological Site|Madira Bickel Temple Mound]], in Manatee County, listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=LA133/><ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Preservation - Burial Mounds|url=http://www.mymanatee.org/home/government/departments/building-and-development-services/planning/comprehensive-planning-section/historic-preservation.html#jump5|publisher=Manatee County, Florida government|accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref>  \n*Maximo Point Temple Mound, in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].<ref name=LA131/><ref>{{cite web|title=Maximo Beach Archaeological Site|url=http://www.stpete.org/historic_preservation/historic_landmarks/local_landmarks/docs/Maximo_Beach.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> \n*Mill Point Temple Mound on the [[Alafia River]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA133/>\n*Pillsbury Temple Mound, in Manatee County, mostly destroyed.<ref name=LA134>Luer and Almy: 134</ref>\n*Pinellas Point Temple Mound (or Hirrihigua Mound), in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].<ref name=LA131/><ref>{{cite web|title=Pinellas Point Mound|url=http://www.stpete.org/historic_preservation/historic_landmarks/local_landmarks/docs/Pinellas_Point_Mound.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n*Safety Harbor Temple Mound, at [[Safety Harbor Site]] in [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]], the [[type site]] for the Safety Harbor culture.<ref name=LA132/>\n*Snead Island Temple Mound ([[Portavant Mound]]), in Manatee County.<ref name=LA134/>\n*Weeden Island Temple Mound, at [[Weedon Island Preserve]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], now destroyed, the type site for the [[Weeden Island culture]].<ref name=LA132/>\n*Whitaker Temple Mound, on [[Sarasota Bay]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA134/>\n\nPossible Safety Harbor temple mound sites include:\n*Bahia Beach Mound ([[Smithsonian trinomial|8HI536]]), near the mouth of the [[Little Manatee River]].<ref name=LA146/><ref>Hann 2003: 114</ref>\n*Bull Frog Creek, south of the mouth of the Alafia River.<ref name=LA128146>Luer and Almy: 128, 146</ref>\n*Englewood, near [[Englewood, Florida|Englewood]].<ref name=LA146>Luer and Almy: 146</ref>\n*Harbor Key II, southwest of the Harbor Key Temple Mound.<ref name=LA128146/>\n*Kennedy, on [[Terra Ceia, Florida|Terra Ceia Island]] between the Harbor Key and Madira Bickel temple mounds.<ref name=LA128146/>\n*Oelsner Mound, near [[Port Richey, Florida|Port Richey]] in Pasco County.<ref name=LA146/><ref>{{cite web|title=Oelsner Indian Mound|url=http://www.pascocountyfl.net/index.aspx?NID=1193|publisher=Pasco County|accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref> \n*Thomas Mound ([[Smithsonian trinomial|8HI1]]), near the mouth of the Little Manatee River, now destroyed, possibly the site of [[Uzita (Florida)|Uzita]].<ref>Milanich&Hudson: 66-67</ref>\n\nThree platform mounds east and south of Charlotte Harbor, the Acline Mound ([[Aqui Esta Burial Mound|Aqui Esta site]], near [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]]), Howard Shell Mound (Bokeelia Island, at the north end of [[Pine Island (Lee County, Florida)|Pine Island]]), and Brown's Mound (Pineland site, near [[Pineland, Florida|Pineland]] on Pine Island), differ from Safety Harbor temple mounds in having a \"U\"-shaped platform, and no ramps. This difference in form may indicate the mounds belong to the Caloosahatchee culture instead of the Safety Harbor culture. Luer and Almy also note that the large Bostic Temple Mound in Hardee County, which is associated with a village area and burial mounds, was contemporary with Safety Harbor temple mounds. They suggest that this site was the center for a distinct cultural and political system oriented to the [[Peace River (Florida)|Peace River]] valley. There are two \"truncated rectangular\" mounds at the [[Crystal River Archaeological State Park|Crystal River]] site that have mentioned as possible Safety Harbor temple mounds, but the other mounds there pre-date Safety Harbor, and there is little evidence of Safety Harbor use of the site. A large flat-topped shell mound, the Withlacoochee River Platform Mound, is next to the Withlacoochee River in Citrus County, but it has not been investigated. Whether it has any connection to the Safety Harbor culture is unknown.<ref>Luer and Almy: 146, 149</ref><ref>Mitchem: 15-16, 22-23</ref>\n\nLuer and Almy used the reported height, shape and dimensions of thirteen of the temple mounds to calculate their volume. They used this data to classify the mounds: Class A, consisting of the Anclote and Snead Island temple mounds, had high volumes (7000 to 7700 [[Cubic metre|m\u00b3]]), low heights (4 [[Metre|m]] or less), and large summit platforms (greater than 1000 [[Square metre|m\u00b2]] in area). Class B, including the Safety Harbor and Bayshore Homes temple mounds, had high volumes of 6500 to 6900 m\u00b3, were tall (greater than 5 m), and had a summit platform 440 to 760 m\u00b2 in area. The nine remaining temple mounds varied in height and shape, but were much lower in volume, 3500 m\u00b3 or less. Luer and Almy note that the four mounds in Classes A and B are spaced along the coast line about 25 to 30&nbsp;km apart, while the smaller Class C mounds are often much closer to each other and to the major mounds. Luer and Almy suggest that the temple mounds represent a hierarchy, with the four largest mounds serving as regional centers, and the smaller mounds located at subsidiary villages and serving different purposes. On the other hand, Milanich suggests that the centers of political units may have moved from time to time, and that only some of the temple mounds were in use at any given time.<ref>Luer and Almy: 135-137, 138, 140, 141</ref><ref>Milanich: 398</ref>\n\n===Burial mounds===\nBurial mounds containing Safety Harbor ceramics are common in the Circum-Tampa Bay area, and are found scattered through the outlying areas. Burial mounds in the Northern Safety Harbor region include a mound at [[Weeki Wachee Springs]], and the Ruth Smith and [[Florida Museum of Natural History#Tatham Mound|Tatham]] mounds in the [[Cove of the Withlacoochee]]. Burial mounds south of the Tampa Bay area include the Sarasota and Myakka Valley Ranches mounds.

The Spanish visitors described the bodies as being wrapped in painted deer hides and stored in wooden boxes sitting on the ground. One of the Spanish captives of the Tocobaga reported that he had been assigned to guard a temple at night to keep wolves from carrying off the bodies. [[Garcilaso de la Vega (El Inca)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] reported that lions ([[cougar]]s) would carry away bodies. After the bones had been cleaned, they would be buried. A Spanish account of a chief's funeral states that his body was \"broken up\" and placed in large jars, and the flesh was removed from the bones over two days. The skeleton was then reassembled and left in the temple for four days while the people fasted. At the end of the four days, all the people of the town would take the bones and place them in a burial mound. In some cases bodies were cremated and then buried in the mound on which the charnel house sat.<ref>Bullen: 53, 54, 56<br>Milanich 1998: 104, 109</ref>\n\n===Destruction of mounds===\nAs was the case in much of Florida, a vast majority of the Tampa Bay area's temple mounds, burial mounds, and middens were destroyed during development as the local population grew rapidly in the early to mid 20th century.

Europeans and members of other tribes who had been captured were slaves. A chief who visited de Soto in his camp was carried there on the back of another man. Chiefs were often married to the sisters of other chiefs.<ref>Bullen. 56.</ref>\n\t\nThe Safety Harbor people ate fish, shellfish, deer, turtles and dogs, as well as watercress, [[pumpkin]]s, \"cabbage\" from [[Saw palmettos|palmettos]] or [[Sabal palmetto|cabbage palms]], and beans. [[Maize]] may have been a minor part of the diet, but the southern limit of maize agriculture prior to the arrival of the Europeans was to the north of Tampa Bay. They used bows and arrows, equipped with stone arrowheads or [[stingray]] stingers. Houses were built with wooden posts and covered with palm leaves. \"Temples\" (or charnel houses) and other buildings were decorated with wood carvings. [[Pottery]] used in daily life was largely undecorated, but ceremonial vessels (found in burials) were distinctively decorated (the defining characteristic of the Safety Harbor culture).<ref>Bullen. 53, 56.<br>Milanich 1994. 390.<br>Milanich 1998. 103.</ref>\n\n==Chiefdoms==\nThe name \"Tocobaga\" is often used to refer to all of the indigenous peoples of the Tampa Bay area during the first Spanish colonial period (1513-1763). In a strict sense, Tocobaga was the name of a chiefdom, its main town, and its chief, all of which were probably centered at the Safety Harbor site at the north end of Old Tampa Bay. Other Safety Harbor chiefdoms named in Spanish accounts include [[Mocoso]], on the east side of Tampa Bay, [[Pohoy]] (Capaloey), possibly on the north side of Hillsborough Bay, and [[Uzita (Florida)|Uzita]], on the south side of Tampa Bay. The chief of Mocoso also named Neguarete and Orriygua as neighboring chiefs, but it is not known if they were in the Safety Harbor culture area.<!-- <ref group=Notes>[[Garcilaso de la Vega (El Inca)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] gave \"Hirrihigua\" as the name of the Uzita chief, but this may have been a corruption of Orriygua.(Milanich 1994: 56)</ref> hidden until reliable sources for legend of Princess Hirrihigua found --> It is not known what these chiefdoms shared aside from the Safety Harbor culture. [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]], a captive of south Florida Indians for many years in the early 16th century, described Tocobaga as \"King head chief of that district\", but also described Tocobaga and Mocoso as independent \"Kingdoms\".<ref name=Bullen50/><ref>Hann 1995: 187-8</ref><ref>Hann 2003: 105, 107, 117</ref><ref>Milanich 1994: 56, 122</ref> \n\nThe accounts of the [[Hernando de Soto|de Soto]] expedition (which do not mention Tocobaga) state that Mocoso and Uzita were subject to a chief called [[Urriparacoxi]] or Paracoxi, who lived 30 [[League (unit)#Spain|leagues]] east or northeast of Tampa Bay. The people of Mocoso and of Uzita were noted as having spoken different languages. Hann argues that the language of the Mocoso people was [[Timucua language|Timucuan]]. There is no mention of Mocoso or Uzita in Spanish records after the passage of the de Soto expedition. The chiefdom of Tocobaga was apparently the major power in the Tampa Bay area during the later half of the 16th century, especially at the time of [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]]'s visit in 1567. Tocobaga's power apparently waned in the 17th century, with first the Pohoy, and then the [[Calusa]], becoming the dominant power in the Tampa Bay area.<ref name=Bullen50/><ref>Hann 1995: 187-8</ref><ref>Hann 2003: 105, 107, 117</ref><ref>Milanich 1994: 56, 122</ref> By around 1700, however, the Safety Harbor culture had virtually disappeared due to disease and incursions by other Native Americans from the north.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Bullen|first=Ripley P.|title=Tacachale: Essays on the Indians of Florida and Southeastern Georgia during the Historic Period|year=1978|publisher=The University Presses of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=978-0-8130-0535-5|pages=50\u201358|editor=Milanich, Jerald T. and Samuel Procter|chapter=Tocobago Indians and the Safety Harbor Culture}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Hann|first=John H.|title=Demise of the Pojoy and Bomto|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|date=Fall 1995|volume=74|issue=2|pages=184\u2013200|jstor=30148820}} (Click on link to journal for free access to PDF version of article.)\n*{{cite book|last=Hann|first=John H.|title=Indians of Central and South Florida 1513-1763|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=978-0-8130-2645-9}} \n*{{cite journal|last=Luer|first=George M.|author2=Marion M.

The Safety Harbor culture is defined by the presence of Safety Harbor ceramics in burial [[mound]]s. The culture is named after the [[Safety Harbor Site]], which is close to the center of the culture area. The Safety Harbor Site is the probable location of the chief town of the [[Tocobaga]], the best known of the groups practicing the Safety Harbor culture.\n\nThe Safety Harbor people were organized into [[chiefdoms]] and lived primarily in villages along the shoreline of [[Tampa Bay]] and the adjacent [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast. The chiefdoms may have consisted of about {{convert|15|mi|km}} of shoreline, and extended about {{convert|20|mi|km}} inland. Each chiefdom had a principal town or \"capital\" with a [[temple]] [[Mound#North American archaeology|mound]] and central [[plaza]]. Fifteen such towns have been identified along the Florida Gulf coast from southern [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco County]] to northern [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota County]], an area that includes all of the [[Tampa Bay area]]. Only one principal town has been found inland. \n\nDescriptions of the villages by Spanish visitors mostly agree with archaeological reconstructions. \"Capitals\" had a central rectangular plaza. A truncated pyramidal mound up to {{convert|20|ft|m}} high and up to {{convert|130|ft|m}} long on each side at the base stood on one side of the plaza. One or more buildings stood on top of the mound, and a ramp ran from the top of the mound to the plaza. A burial mound would be located off to the side. A shell mound, or [[midden]], ran along the shore, and other middens were sometimes located on other sides of the plaza. The plaza itself was kept clear of debris. The more important residents of the town had their houses around the plaza, while the lower class lived in huts further from the plaza. The Spanish reported that the chief and his family lived on the main mound, and that a \"temple\" (probably a [[charnel house]]) stood on the opposite side of the plaza. Archaeological excavations suggest that the charnel houses were on the mounds. Village sites without mounds and isolated burial mounds are also known.<ref>Bullen: 50-1, 53-4</ref><ref>Milanich 1998: 103, 105</ref>\n\n==Geography and time span==\nThe Safety Harbor culture area extended along the central Gulf coast of Florida. Bullen described it as running from [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]] to [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], with some evidence that it reached the [[Aucilla River]] to the north and [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] to the south. Mitchem limited the northern extent of the culture area to the [[Withlacoochee River (Florida)|Withlacoochee River]], but included the coast south into [[Collier County, Florida|Collier County]], and east into eastern [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]]. Milanich defines the culture area as the coast from the Withlacoochee River to Charlotte Harbor, placing the area from Charlotte Harbor to Collier County in the [[Caloosahatchee culture]]. The heart of the culture area was around [[Tampa Bay]], what Mitchem and Milanich call \"Circum-Tampa Bay\". This area included all of what is now [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough]] and [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas]] counties, southern [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco County]], and northern [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee County]]. To the north the area between the Withlacooche River and the Gulf coast, including [[Citrus County, Florida|Citrus County]], [[Hernando County, Florida|Hernando County]] and northern Pasco County, formed the \"Northern Safety Harbor\" area. South of Tampa Bay southern Manatee County, [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota County]] and northern [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte County]] comprised the \"Manasota Safety Harbor\" (Mitchem) or \"South-Central Safety Harbor\" (Milanich) area (\"Manasota\" is also the name given the Weedon Island-related culture that preceded the Safety Harbor culture in most of its area). [[DeSoto County, Florida|DeSoto County]], [[Hardee County, Florida|Hardee County]] and most of [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]] were part of the \"Inland Safety Harbor\" area. Mitchem called his regional variant south of Charlotte Harbor (southern Charlotte County, [[Lee County, Florida|Lee County]] and western Collier County) \"South Florida\".<ref name=Bullen50>Bullen: 50</ref><ref>Milanich 1994: 392-401</ref><ref>Mitchem: 568, 569</ref>\n\nSafety Harbor ceramics are found in burial mounds in the Caloosahatchee culture area (Mitchem's South Florida Safety Harbor). Milanich ascribes the presence of such objects to trade, but states that future work may clarify the relationship of the Safety Harbor and Caloosahatchee cultures. Luer and Almy note that temple mounds south of Charlotte Harbor differ significantly from Safety Harbor temple mounds in form. Luer has also argued that other materials found in burial mounds south of Charlotte Harbor belong to a south Florida, or \"Glades Cult\", artifact complex. Luer also argues that the presence of [[Mississippian culture]] and [[St. Johns culture]] artifacts in burial mounds shows that such articles, along with Safety Harbor objects, were traded into the area.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Luer|first=George M.|title=Historic Sources at the Pineland Site, Lee County Florida|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=March 1991|volume=44|issue=1|pages=70\u201371|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00046/60j|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"LA146\"/><ref>Milanich 1994: 390-391</ref>\n\nThe Safety Harbor culture developed in-place from the [[Manasota culture]], a [[Weeden Island culture|Weeden Island]]-related culture of the central Florida Gulf coast. Safety Harbor was influenced by the [[Mississippian culture]], with some ceramics resembling the Mississippian-related [[Fort Walton culture]] and incorporating symbols of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]], but the people of the Safety Harbor culture had not adopted an agricultural economy, and consequently, the culture did not become Mississippian. Safety Harbor mounds generally built on late Weeden Island period mounds.<ref>Milanich 1994: 389, 409, 412</ref><ref>Milanich 1998: 105</ref>\n\nChanges in decorated ceramics and the presence of European artifacts support a division of the Safety Harbor culture into four phases. Pre-contact phases were the Englewood, 900-1100 and the Pinellas, 1100-1500. Phases during the Spanish colonial period included Tatham, 1500-1567, and Bayview, 1567-1725.<ref>Milanich 1994: 389</ref>\n\n==Mounds==\nThe Safety Harbor culture is defined by the presence of burial mounds with ceramics decorated with a distinctive set of designs and symbols. Ceramics found elsewhere at Safety Harbor sites (in [[middens]] and village living areas) are almost always undecorated. Major Safety Harbor sites had platform, or temple, mounds. The term \"temple mound\" is based on the description by members of the de Soto expedition of a temple on a constructed earthwork mound in a Safety Harbor village. Bullen and Milanich state that the temples were likely charnel houses, where bodies were prepared and stored for later burial. Several of the temple mounds have been destroyed since the 19th century, but at least fifteen have been documented as having once existed around Tampa Bay and on the Gulf coast near Tampa Bay. These temple mounds were rectangular and had flat tops, usually with a ramp leading up to the top on one side.<ref>Bullen: 53</ref><ref name=\"Luer 2005 5\">{{cite journal|last=Luer|first=George|title=Introduction|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=March\u2013June 2005|volume=58|issue=1\u20132|pages=5|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00203/7j|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Luer and Almy: 127, 129\">Luer and Almy: 127, 129</ref><ref>Milanich 1994: 389-90, 393-94</ref>\n\n===Temple mounds===\nKnown Safety Harbor sites with \"temple\" mounds include:\n*Anclote Temple Mound, near the mouth of the [[Anclote River]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA130>Luer and Almy: 130</ref>\n*[[Jungle Prada Site|Anderson/Narvaez Temple Mound]], in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].<ref name=LA131>Luer and Almy: 131</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Anderson-Narv\u00e1ez Mound at Jungle Prada Mound Park|url=http://www.trailoffloridasindianheritage.org/o-Anderson-Narvaez_Mound.html|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> \n*Bayshore Homes Temple Mound, in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], now destroyed.<ref>Luer and Almy: 130-31</ref>\n*Dunedin Temple Mound, in [[Dunedin, Florida|Dunedin]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA130/>\n*Fort Brooke Temple Mound, at the site of [[Fort Brooke]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA132>Luer and Almy: 132</ref>\n*Harbor Key Temple Mound (Bishop Harbor Temple Mound), on Bishop Harbor in [[Manatee County, Florida|Manatee County]].<ref name=LA133>Luer and Almy: 133</ref>\n*[[Madira Bickel Mound State Archeological Site|Madira Bickel Temple Mound]], in Manatee County, listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=LA133/><ref>{{cite web|title=Historic Preservation - Burial Mounds|url=http://www.mymanatee.org/home/government/departments/building-and-development-services/planning/comprehensive-planning-section/historic-preservation.html#jump5|publisher=Manatee County, Florida government|accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref>  \n*Maximo Point Temple Mound, in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].<ref name=LA131/><ref>{{cite web|title=Maximo Beach Archaeological Site|url=http://www.stpete.org/historic_preservation/historic_landmarks/local_landmarks/docs/Maximo_Beach.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> \n*Mill Point Temple Mound on the [[Alafia River]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA133/>\n*Pillsbury Temple Mound, in Manatee County, mostly destroyed.<ref name=LA134>Luer and Almy: 134</ref>\n*Pinellas Point Temple Mound (or Hirrihigua Mound), in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].<ref name=LA131/><ref>{{cite web|title=Pinellas Point Mound|url=http://www.stpete.org/historic_preservation/historic_landmarks/local_landmarks/docs/Pinellas_Point_Mound.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n*Safety Harbor Temple Mound, at [[Safety Harbor Site]] in [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]], the [[type site]] for the Safety Harbor culture.<ref name=LA132/>\n*Snead Island Temple Mound ([[Portavant Mound]]), in Manatee County.<ref name=LA134/>\n*Weeden Island Temple Mound, at [[Weedon Island Preserve]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], now destroyed, the type site for the [[Weeden Island culture]].<ref name=LA132/>\n*Whitaker Temple Mound, on [[Sarasota Bay]], now destroyed.<ref name=LA134/>\n\nPossible Safety Harbor temple mound sites include:\n*Bahia Beach Mound ([[Smithsonian trinomial|8HI536]]), near the mouth of the [[Little Manatee River]].<ref name=LA146/><ref>Hann 2003: 114</ref>\n*Bull Frog Creek, south of the mouth of the Alafia River.<ref name=LA128146>Luer and Almy: 128, 146</ref>\n*Englewood, near [[Englewood, Florida|Englewood]].<ref name=LA146>Luer and Almy: 146</ref>\n*Harbor Key II, southwest of the Harbor Key Temple Mound.<ref name=LA128146/>\n*Kennedy, on [[Terra Ceia, Florida|Terra Ceia Island]] between the Harbor Key and Madira Bickel temple mounds.<ref name=LA128146/>\n*Oelsner Mound, near [[Port Richey, Florida|Port Richey]] in Pasco County.<ref name=LA146/><ref>{{cite web|title=Oelsner Indian Mound|url=http://www.pascocountyfl.net/index.aspx?NID=1193|publisher=Pasco County|accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref> \n*Thomas Mound ([[Smithsonian trinomial|8HI1]]), near the mouth of the Little Manatee River, now destroyed, possibly the site of [[Uzita (Florida)|Uzita]].<ref>Milanich&Hudson: 66-67</ref>\n\nThree platform mounds east and south of Charlotte Harbor, the Acline Mound ([[Aqui Esta Burial Mound|Aqui Esta site]], near [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]]), Howard Shell Mound (Bokeelia Island, at the north end of [[Pine Island (Lee County, Florida)|Pine Island]]), and Brown's Mound (Pineland site, near [[Pineland, Florida|Pineland]] on Pine Island), differ from Safety Harbor temple mounds in having a \"U\"-shaped platform, and no ramps. This difference in form may indicate the mounds belong to the Caloosahatchee culture instead of the Safety Harbor culture. Luer and Almy also note that the large Bostic Temple Mound in Hardee County, which is associated with a village area and burial mounds, was contemporary with Safety Harbor temple mounds. They suggest that this site was the center for a distinct cultural and political system oriented to the [[Peace River (Florida)|Peace River]] valley. There are two \"truncated rectangular\" mounds at the [[Crystal River Archaeological State Park|Crystal River]] site that have mentioned as possible Safety Harbor temple mounds, but the other mounds there pre-date Safety Harbor, and there is little evidence of Safety Harbor use of the site. A large flat-topped shell mound, the Withlacoochee River Platform Mound, is next to the Withlacoochee River in Citrus County, but it has not been investigated. Whether it has any connection to the Safety Harbor culture is unknown.<ref>Luer and Almy: 146, 149</ref><ref>Mitchem: 15-16, 22-23</ref>\n\nLuer and Almy used the reported height, shape and dimensions of thirteen of the temple mounds to calculate their volume. They used this data to classify the mounds: Class A, consisting of the Anclote and Snead Island temple mounds, had high volumes (7000 to 7700 [[Cubic metre|m\u00b3]]), low heights (4 [[Metre|m]] or less), and large summit platforms (greater than 1000 [[Square metre|m\u00b2]] in area). Class B, including the Safety Harbor and Bayshore Homes temple mounds, had high volumes of 6500 to 6900 m\u00b3, were tall (greater than 5 m), and had a summit platform 440 to 760 m\u00b2 in area. The nine remaining temple mounds varied in height and shape, but were much lower in volume, 3500 m\u00b3 or less. Luer and Almy note that the four mounds in Classes A and B are spaced along the coast line about 25 to 30&nbsp;km apart, while the smaller Class C mounds are often much closer to each other and to the major mounds. Luer and Almy suggest that the temple mounds represent a hierarchy, with the four largest mounds serving as regional centers, and the smaller mounds located at subsidiary villages and serving different purposes. On the other hand, Milanich suggests that the centers of political units may have moved from time to time, and that only some of the temple mounds were in use at any given time.<ref>Luer and Almy: 135-137, 138, 140, 141</ref><ref>Milanich: 398</ref>\n\n===Burial mounds===\nBurial mounds containing Safety Harbor ceramics are common in the Circum-Tampa Bay area, and are found scattered through the outlying areas. Burial mounds in the Northern Safety Harbor region include a mound at [[Weeki Wachee Springs]], and the Ruth Smith and [[Florida Museum of Natural History#Tatham Mound|Tatham]] mounds in the [[Cove of the Withlacoochee]]. Burial mounds south of the Tampa Bay area include the Sarasota and Myakka Valley Ranches mounds. The Phillip Mound, close to the [[Kissimmee River]] in the Inland Safety Harbor area, contained a large number of Safety Harbor ceramics.<ref name=\"Luer 2005 5\"/><ref name=\"Luer and Almy: 127, 129\"/><ref>Milanich 1994: 389-90, 393-94, 400</ref><ref>Milanich 1995: 28</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Mitchem|first=Jeffery M.|title=The Ruth Smith, Weeki Wachee, and Tatham Mounds: Archaeological Evidence of Early Spanish Contact|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=December 1989|volume=42|issue=4|pages=317\u2013339|url=https://uark.academia.edu/JeffreyMMitchem/Papers/1157973/The_Ruth_Smith_Weeki_Wachee_and_Tatham_Mounds_Archaeological_Evidence_of_Early_Spanish_Contact|accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Tocobaga kept the bodies of recently dead people in their temples or charnel houses until the bones had been cleaned. The Spanish visitors described the bodies as being wrapped in painted deer hides and stored in wooden boxes sitting on the ground. One of the Spanish captives of the Tocobaga reported that he had been assigned to guard a temple at night to keep wolves from carrying off the bodies. [[Garcilaso de la Vega (El Inca)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] reported that lions ([[cougar]]s) would carry away bodies. After the bones had been cleaned, they would be buried. A Spanish account of a chief's funeral states that his body was \"broken up\" and placed in large jars, and the flesh was removed from the bones over two days. The skeleton was then reassembled and left in the temple for four days while the people fasted. At the end of the four days, all the people of the town would take the bones and place them in a burial mound. In some cases bodies were cremated and then buried in the mound on which the charnel house sat.<ref>Bullen: 53, 54, 56<br>Milanich 1998: 104, 109</ref>\n\n===Destruction of mounds===\nAs was the case in much of Florida, a vast majority of the Tampa Bay area's temple mounds, burial mounds, and middens were destroyed during development as the local population grew rapidly in the early to mid 20th century. Developers sought to level land near the water, and road construction crews found that bulldozed shell mounds made for excellent road fill.<ref>{{cite news|last=Capouya|first=John|title=American Indian mounds are Florida's hidden monuments|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/humaninterest/american-indian-mounds-are-floridas-hidden-monuments/1193229|accessdate=8 May 2012|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=September 25, 2011}}</ref> State and federal laws now afford protection to sites that contain human remains or are located on public land, but preservation of other archeological sites on private land is optional and encouraged by offering tax deductions and other incentives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Conservation Easements: Protecting Florida'a Archaeological Sites|url=http://www.flheritage.com/archaeology/education/culturalmgmt/archsite.pdf|publisher=Florida Department of State Division of Historical Resources|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==People==\nThe Spanish reported four social classes among the Safety Harbor people: chiefs, headmen, warriors and ordinary people, and slaves. Europeans and members of other tribes who had been captured were slaves. A chief who visited de Soto in his camp was carried there on the back of another man. Chiefs were often married to the sisters of other chiefs.<ref>Bullen. 56.</ref>\n\t\nThe Safety Harbor people ate fish, shellfish, deer, turtles and dogs, as well as watercress, [[pumpkin]]s, \"cabbage\" from [[Saw palmettos|palmettos]] or [[Sabal palmetto|cabbage palms]], and beans. [[Maize]] may have been a minor part of the diet, but the southern limit of maize agriculture prior to the arrival of the Europeans was to the north of Tampa Bay. They used bows and arrows, equipped with stone arrowheads or [[stingray]] stingers. Houses were built with wooden posts and covered with palm leaves. \"Temples\" (or charnel houses) and other buildings were decorated with wood carvings. [[Pottery]] used in daily life was largely undecorated, but ceremonial vessels (found in burials) were distinctively decorated (the defining characteristic of the Safety Harbor culture).<ref>Bullen. 53, 56.<br>Milanich 1994. 390.<br>Milanich 1998. 103.</ref>\n\n==Chiefdoms==\nThe name \"Tocobaga\" is often used to refer to all of the indigenous peoples of the Tampa Bay area during the first Spanish colonial period (1513-1763). In a strict sense, Tocobaga was the name of a chiefdom, its main town, and its chief, all of which were probably centered at the Safety Harbor site at the north end of Old Tampa Bay. Other Safety Harbor chiefdoms named in Spanish accounts include [[Mocoso]], on the east side of Tampa Bay, [[Pohoy]] (Capaloey), possibly on the north side of Hillsborough Bay, and [[Uzita (Florida)|Uzita]], on the south side of Tampa Bay. The chief of Mocoso also named Neguarete and Orriygua as neighboring chiefs, but it is not known if they were in the Safety Harbor culture area.<!-- <ref group=Notes>[[Garcilaso de la Vega (El Inca)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] gave \"Hirrihigua\" as the name of the Uzita chief, but this may have been a corruption of Orriygua.(Milanich 1994: 56)</ref> hidden until reliable sources for legend of Princess Hirrihigua found --> It is not known what these chiefdoms shared aside from the Safety Harbor culture. [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]], a captive of south Florida Indians for many years in the early 16th century, described Tocobaga as \"King head chief of that district\", but also described Tocobaga and Mocoso as independent \"Kingdoms\".<ref name=Bullen50/><ref>Hann 1995: 187-8</ref><ref>Hann 2003: 105, 107, 117</ref><ref>Milanich 1994: 56, 122</ref> \n\nThe accounts of the [[Hernando de Soto|de Soto]] expedition (which do not mention Tocobaga) state that Mocoso and Uzita were subject to a chief called [[Urriparacoxi]] or Paracoxi, who lived 30 [[League (unit)#Spain|leagues]] east or northeast of Tampa Bay. The people of Mocoso and of Uzita were noted as having spoken different languages. Hann argues that the language of the Mocoso people was [[Timucua language|Timucuan]]. There is no mention of Mocoso or Uzita in Spanish records after the passage of the de Soto expedition. The chiefdom of Tocobaga was apparently the major power in the Tampa Bay area during the later half of the 16th century, especially at the time of [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]]'s visit in 1567. Tocobaga's power apparently waned in the 17th century, with first the Pohoy, and then the [[Calusa]], becoming the dominant power in the Tampa Bay area.<ref name=Bullen50/><ref>Hann 1995: 187-8</ref><ref>Hann 2003: 105, 107, 117</ref><ref>Milanich 1994: 56, 122</ref> By around 1700, however, the Safety Harbor culture had virtually disappeared due to disease and incursions by other Native Americans from the north.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Bullen|first=Ripley P.|title=Tacachale: Essays on the Indians of Florida and Southeastern Georgia during the Historic Period|year=1978|publisher=The University Presses of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=978-0-8130-0535-5|pages=50\u201358|editor=Milanich, Jerald T. and Samuel Procter|chapter=Tocobago Indians and the Safety Harbor Culture}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Hann|first=John H.|title=Demise of the Pojoy and Bomto|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|date=Fall 1995|volume=74|issue=2|pages=184\u2013200|jstor=30148820}} (Click on link to journal for free access to PDF version of article.)\n*{{cite book|last=Hann|first=John H.|title=Indians of Central and South Florida 1513-1763|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=978-0-8130-2645-9}} \n*{{cite journal|last=Luer|first=George M.|author2=Marion M.

The sport is now played in nine cities in China, namely Beijing, Shanghai, [[Shenyang]], [[Dalian]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Shenzhen]], Chongqing, [[Tianjin]] and [[Jinan]]. More than 150 schools have been involved.\n\nChina took part in the [[2009 ACC Trophy Challenge]], their first appearance in a representative tournament. The Chinese lost all of their group matches, including against [[Iran national cricket team|Iran]] and the [[Maldives national cricket team|Maldives]] where they lost by 307 and 315 runs respectively. In the seventh place playoff China recorded their first ever international win when they beat [[Myanmar national cricket team|Myanmar]] by 118 runs.\n\nChina took part in the 2014 ACC Twenty20 Cup in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

During the few years after its foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including the [[Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts]] and [[David Garrick]]'s library of 1,000 printed plays.

A list of donations to the museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of a \"Colossal Foot of an [[Apollo]] in Marble\". It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the [[Royal Society]] in London.\n\n===Growth and change (1800\u20131825)===\n\n[[File:P8282318.1.JPG|thumb|right|Left to Right: [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], Townley Gallery and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s west wing under construction, July 1828]]\n[[File:Mauso03.JPG|thumb|The [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus|Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] Room, 1920s]]\n\nIn the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French campaign]] in the [[Battle of the Nile]], in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] presented the [[Rosetta Stone]] \u2013 key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.<ref>''Wondrous Curiosities \u2013 Ancient Egypt at the British Museum'', pp. 66\u201372 (Stephanie Moser, 2006, {{ISBN|0-226-54209-2}})</ref> Gifts and purchases from [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the [[Younger Memnon|Colossal bust of Ramesses II]] in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture.<ref>''The Story of the British Museum'', p. 24 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})</ref> Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the [[Charles Towneley|Charles Towneley collection]], much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805.

The [[King's Library]], on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn 1840, the museum became involved in its first overseas [[excavation (archeology)|excavation]]s, [[Charles Fellows]]'s expedition to [[Xanthos]], in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient [[Lycia]], among them the [[Nereid Monument|Nereid]] and [[Tomb of Payava|Payava]] monuments. In 1857, [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]] was to discover the 4th-century BC [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum of Halikarnassos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. In the 1840s and 1850s the museum supported excavations in [[Assyria]] by [[Austen Henry Layard|A.H. Layard]] and others at sites such as [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s great library of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]], which helped to make the museum a focus for [[Assyriology|Assyrian studies]].<ref>Reade, Julian (2004). Assyrian Sculpture. London: The British Museum Press, p. 16</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Grenville|Sir Thomas Grenville]] (1755\u20131846), a trustee of the British Museum from 1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] in 1998.\n\n===Collecting from the wider world (1850\u20131875)===\nThe opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]'s 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for [[Assyria]]n sculptures and [[Sydney Smirke]]'s [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in [[South Kensington]], which would later become the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum of Natural History]].\n\nRoughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the \"second founder\" of the British Museum, the Italian librarian [[Anthony Panizzi]]. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now part of the [[British Library]]) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the [[National Library of Paris]].<ref name=\"world and its people\"/> The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dickens Charles Jr. |author-link=Charles Dickens Jr. |year=1879|title=Museum, British|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-mus.htm|accessdate=22 August 2007|quote=Beyond the new Lycian room is the READING ROOM: [...]; circular structure; original suggestion of Thomas Watts, improved by A.

A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the [[Louis, Duke of Blacas|Duke of Blacas]]'s wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and [[John Turtle Wood]] discovered the remains of the 4th century BC [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]], another [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Wonder of the Ancient World]].<ref>South from Ephesus \u2013 An Escape From The Tyranny of Western Art, pp. 33\u201334,(Brian Sewell, 2002, {{ISBN|1-903933-16-1}})</ref>\n\n===Scholarship and legacies (1875\u20131900)===\nThe natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History in 1887, nowadays the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. With the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and [[ethnography]] and the library could further expand. This was a time of innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the Reading Room and exhibition galleries.<ref>{{cite news| title=The Electric Light in the British Museum| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=18 December 1879| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/12/18/80703696.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[William Burges]] collection of [[armoury]] was bequeathed to the museum in 1881. In 1882, the museum was involved in the establishment of the independent [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|A. W. Franks]], was followed by an immense bequest of 3,300 [[Ring (finger)|finger rings]], 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental porcelain, 1,500 [[netsuke]], 850 [[inro]], over 30,000 [[bookplates]] and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the [[Oxus Treasure]].<ref>Caygill, Marjorie (2006).

In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the west, north and east sides of the museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.\n\nAll the while, the collections kept growing. [[Emil Torday]] collected in Central Africa, [[Marc Aurel Stein|Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia, [[David George Hogarth|D.G. Hogarth]], [[Leonard Woolley]] and [[T. E. Lawrence]] excavated at [[Carchemish]]. Around this time, the American collector and philanthropist [[J Pierpont Morgan]] donated a substantial number of objects to the museum,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=101677&peoA=101677-3-9| title=British Museum \u2013 Collection search: You searched for| work=British Museum}}</ref> including [[William Greenwell]]'s collection of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe which he had purchased for \u00a310,000 in 1908. Morgan had also acquired a major part of Sir [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]]'s coin collection, which was later sold to the museum by his son [[J. P. Morgan Jr.|John Pierpont Morgan Junior]] in 1915. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated via the [[London Post Office Railway]] to Holborn, the [[National Library of Wales|National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth)]] and a country house near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence.<ref>Permanent establishment of the Research Laboratory (now the oldest such establishment in continuous existence) {{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_scientific/history.aspx| title=History| work=British Museum}}</ref> In 1923, the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.\n\n===Disruption and reconstruction (1925\u20131950)===\nNew [[mezzanine]] floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931, the art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Sir Joseph Duveen]] offered funds to build a gallery for the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon sculptures]]. Designed by the American architect [[John Russell Pope]], it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting: <blockquote>The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which, though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour<ref>Quoted Ashmole (1994), 125</ref></blockquote>}} However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids, the Parthenon Sculptures, along with the museum's most valued collections, were dispersed to secure basements, [[English country house|country houses]], [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych Underground station]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and a quarry. The evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing.<ref>Cook, B.F. (2005). The Elgin Marbles.

For instance, they arranged for a German researcher to spend several years at the British Museum for the purpose of compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry, which, at the time, with its 562 pages and a bibliography of some 600 items, was an effort more ambitious than hitherto attempted.}}</ref> After the war, the museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC [[Mesopotamia]]n treasure from [[Ur]], discovered during [[Leonard Woolley]]'s 1922\u201334 excavations. Gold, silver and [[garnet]] grave goods from the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from [[Mildenhall Treasure|Mildenhall]], Suffolk (1946). The immediate [[post-war]] years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.\n\n===A new public face (1950\u20131975)===\n[[File:The Duveen Gallery (1980s).jpg|thumb|The re-opened [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Duveen]] Gallery, 1980]]\n\nIn 1953, the museum celebrated its [[200 (number)|bicentenary]]. Many changes followed: the first full-time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, the [[The British Museum Friends|Friends]] organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the [[board of trustees]] changed and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] became fully independent. By 1959 the [[British Museum Department of Coins and Medals|Coins and Medals]] office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] Classical and Near Eastern galleries.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 270</ref> In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery: <blockquote>It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in colour to the marbles...These half-dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside, when the building was projected.<ref>Ashmole (1994), 126</ref></blockquote> It was not until the 1980s that the installation of a lighting scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.}}\n\nBy the 1970s the museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition \"Treasures of [[Tutankhamun]]\" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of [[manuscripts]] and printed books from the British Museum. This left the museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints & drawings; and [[ethnography]]. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra {{convert|1+1/4|mi}} of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.\n\n===The Great Court emerges (1975\u20132000)===\nThe departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] 19th-century central quadrangle into the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] \u2013 the largest covered square in Europe \u2013 which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived [[Museum of Mankind]] at [[6 Burlington Gardens]] from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.\n\nThe museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in \"modern\" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as [[New Guinea]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Indonesia]] and there were excavations in the [[Near East]], Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The [[Weston family|Weston]] Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered [[hoard]]s which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 327</ref>\n\n===The British Museum today===\n[[File:The British Museum today.jpg|thumb|right|Wide view of the Great Court]]\nToday the museum no longer houses collections of [[natural history]], and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over 13 million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and 150 million at the British Library.\n\nThe [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], which was designed by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]], opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]]. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore [[Annenberg Foundation|Annenberg]] Centre.\n\nWith the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the demolition for [[Lord Foster]]'s glass-roofed [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Sainsbury]] family \u2013 with the donation valued at \u00a325 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/africa/room_25_africa.aspx |title=Room 25: Africa |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs part of its very large website, the museum has the largest [[online database]] of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database.aspx |title=Search the collection database |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> There is also a \"Highlights\" database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access).<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights.aspx Highlights] British Museum, [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues.aspx online research catalogues] British Museum and [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_journals.aspx online journals] British Museum</ref> In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\" />\n\nIn 2013 the museum received a record 6.7 million visitors, an increase of 20% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\">{{Cite news| title=British Museum gets record 6.7m visitors for 2013| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-25729616| newspaper=BBC News| accessdate=20 March 2014| date=14 January 2014}}</ref> Popular exhibitions including \"Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum\" and \"Ice Age Art\" are credited with helping fuel the increase in visitors.<ref name=Smithers_tourists>{{Cite news| last=Smithers| first=Rebecca| title=Sunny weather drew record numbers to UK's outdoor tourist hotspots in 2013| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/05/sunny-weather-record-uk-tourists-2013| newspaper=The Guardian| date=5 March 2014}}</ref> Plans were announced in September 2014 to recreate the entire building along with all exhibits in the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'' in conjunction with members of the public.<ref>{{Cite news| title=British Museum to be digitally recreated in Minecraft| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29281051| last1=Miller| first1=Joe| newspaper=BBC News |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe British Museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] through a three-year funding agreement.

The architect Sir [[John James Burnet]] was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906\u201314 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1914.

Reproduced in MacGregor (1994a:29)</ref> from Sir [[Hans Sloane]]. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French]] forces under [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the [[British army]] and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed [[Rosetta Stone]], were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] as [[Consul general|consul]] in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Giovanni Belzoni]]. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]].\n\nBy 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] under the efforts of [[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]]. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from [[Amarna]], [[Bubastis]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]]. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including [[Flinders Petrie]]'s Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the [[Oxford University]] Expedition to [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] and [[Faras]] in Sudan.\n\n[[File:England; London - The British Museum, Egypt Egyptian Sculpture ~ Colossal granite head of Amenhotep III (Room 4).2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Room 4 \u2013 [[Colossal red granite statue of Amenhotep III]], 1350 BC]]\nActive support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including [[Asyut]] (1907), [[El-Badari|Mostagedda]] and [[El-Badari|Matmar]] (1920s), [[Ashmunein]] (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as [[Soba (city)|Soba]], Kawa and the Northern [[Dongola Reach]] (1990s).

Other fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie Klemm ([[University of Munich]]) and William Adams ([[University of Kentucky]]).\n\nThe seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of 140 [[Mummy|mummies]] and coffins, the largest outside [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo]]. A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought-after exhibits by visitors to the museum.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[File:TombofNebamun-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 61 \u2013 The famous false fresco 'Pond in a Garden' from the [[Tomb of Nebamun]], c. 1350 BC]]\n[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 4 \u2013 The [[Rosetta Stone]], key to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, 196 BC]]\n'''Predynastic and Early Dynastic period (c. 6000 BC \u2013 c. 2690 BC)'''\n*Mummy of [[Gebelein predynastic mummies|''Ginger'']] from Gebelein, (c. 3400 BC)\n*The [[Battlefield Palette]] and [[Hunters Palette]], two cosmetic palettes with complex decorative schemes, (c. 3100 BC)\n*Stela of King [[Peribsen]], Abydos, (c. 2720\u20132710 BC)\n\n'''Old Kingdom (2690\u20132181 BC)'''\n*Granite statue of Ankhwa, the shipbuilder, [[Saqqara]], Egypt, 3rd Dynasty, (around 2650 BC)\n*Several of the original casing stones from the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], (c. 2570 BC)\n*Wooden tomb statue of Tjeti, Fifth to Sixth Dynasty, (about 2345\u20132181 BC)\n\n'''Middle Kingdom (2134\u20131690 BC)'''\n*Inner and outer coffin of Sebekhetepi, [[Beni Hasan]], (about 2125\u20131795 BC)\n*Limestone stela of Heqaib, [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], Egypt, 12th Dynasty, (1990\u20131750 BC)\n*Block statue and stela of Sahathor, 12th Dynasty, reign of [[Amenemhat II]], (about 1922\u20131878 BC)\n\n'''New Kingdom (1549\u20131069 BC)'''\n*Fragment of the beard of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], (14th century BC)\n*[[Colossal quartzite statue of Amenhotep III|Colossal head from a statue]] of Amenhotep III, (1350 BC)\n*Colossal limestone bust of [[Amenhotep III]], (1350 BC)\n*[[Amarna letters|Amarna Tablets]], 99 out of 382 [[Clay tablet|tablets]] found, second greatest collection in the world after the Vorderasiatisches Museum, [[Berlin]] (203 tablets), (1350 BC)\n*[[List of pharaohs|List of the kings]] of Egypt from the [[Abydos, Egypt|Temple of Ramesses II]], (1250 BC)\n\n'''Third Intermediate Period (1069\u2013664 BC)'''\n*Mummy case and coffin of Nesperennub, [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], (c.800 BC)\n*[[Statues of Amun in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa|Statue of Amun]] in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa, (683 BC)\n*Inner and outer coffins of the priest Hor, Deir el-Bahari, Thebes, 25th Dynasty, (about 680 BC)\n\n'''Late Period (664\u2013332 BC)'''\n*Saite Sarcophagus of Satsobek, the vizier (prime minister) of the northern part of Egypt in the reign of [[Psammetichus I]], (664\u2013610 BC)\n*Bronze figure of Isis and Horus, North [[Saqqara]], Egypt, (600 BC)\n*[[Obelisks of Nectanebo II|Obelisks]] and sarcophagus of Pharaoh [[Nectanebo II]], (360\u2013343 BC)\n\n'''Ptolemaic dynasty (305\u201330 BC)'''\n*The famous [[Rosetta Stone]], trilingual stela that unlocked the ancient Egyptian civilisation, (196 BC)\n*Giant sculpture of a [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]], (32\u201330 BC)\n*Mummy of [[Hornedjitef]] (inner coffin), Thebes, (3rd century BC)\n\n'''Roman Period (30 BC-641 AD)'''\n*The Meriotic [[Hamadab Stela]] from the [[Kingdom of Kush]] found near the ancient site of Mero\u00eb in Sudan, 24 BC\n*Lid of the coffin of Soter and Cleopatra from Qurna, Thebes, (early 2nd century AD)\n*Mummy of a youth with a portrait of the deceased, [[Hawara]], (100\u2013200 AD)\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:Bm-ginger.jpg|Room 64 -

Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]], [[John Turtle Wood]], [[Robert Murdoch Smith]] and [[Charles Fellows]].\n\nThe Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of [[Magna Graecia]] that include Sicily and southern Italy. The [[Cyclades|Cycladic]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures are represented, and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] collection includes important sculpture from the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, as well as elements of two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] and the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]].<ref name=\"GreeceRome\"/>\n\nBeginning from the early [[Bronze Age]], the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and non-Greek colonies in [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]] on Asia Minor. There is some material from the [[Roman Republic]], but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the [[Roman Empire]], with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).\n\nThe collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s and [[Edm\u00e9-Antoine Durand|Chevalier Durand]]'s collections), [[Glass|Roman glass]] including the famous [[Cameo glass]] Portland Vase, [[Roman mosaic]]s from [[Carthage]] and [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] in North Africa that were excavated by [[Nathan Davis (traveller)|Nathan Davis]], and silver hoards from [[Roman Gaul]] (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee [[Richard Payne Knight]]), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir [[Robert Hamilton Lang]]'s collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the [[Charles Townley#Townley Collection|Townley collection]] as well as residual sculptures from the famous [[Farnese collection]].\n\nObjects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the [[architectural]] monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[Parthenon]]\n*The [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles (Elgin Marbles)]], (447\u2013438 BC)\n\n[[Erechtheion]]\n*A surviving column, (420\u2013415 BC)\n*One of six remaining [[Caryatid]]s, (415 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Athena Nike]]\n*Surviving [[frieze]] slabs, (427\u2013424 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Bassae]]\n*Twenty-three surviving blocks of the [[Bassae Frieze|frieze]] from the interior of the temple, (420\u2013400 BC)\n\n[[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]]\n*Two colossal free-standing figures identified as Maussollos and his wife [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], (c. 350 BC)\n*Part of an impressive horse from the [[chariot]] group adorning the summit of the [[Mausoleum]], (c. 350 BC)\n*The [[Amazonomachy]] frieze \u2013 A long section of relief frieze showing the battle between Greeks and [[Amazons]], (c. 350 BC)\n\n[[Temple of Artemis in Ephesus]]\n*One of the sculptured column bases, (340\u2013320 BC)\n*Part of the [[Ionic order|Ionic]] frieze situated above the colonnade, (330\u2013300 BC)\n\n[[Knidos]] in Asia Minor\n*[[Demeter of Knidos]], (350 BC)\n*[[Lion of Knidos]], (350\u2013200 BC)\n\n[[Xanthos]] in Asia Minor\n*Lion Tomb, (550\u2013500 BC)\n*[[Harpy Tomb]], (480\u2013470 BC)\n*[[Nereid Monument]], partial reconstruction of a large and elaborate Lykian tomb, (390\u2013380 BC)\n*Tomb of Merehi, (390\u2013350 BC)\n*[[Tomb of Payava]], (375\u2013350 BC)\n\n'''Wider collection'''\n\n'''Prehistoric Greece and Italy (3300 BC \u2013 8th century BC)'''\n*Over thirty [[Cycladic art|Cycladic figures]] from islands in the Aegean Sea, many collected by [[James Theodore Bent]], Greece, (3300\u20132000 BC)\n*Material from the [[Knossos|Palace of Knossos]] including a huge pottery storage jar, some donated by Sir [[Arthur Evans]], Crete, Greece, (1900\u20131100 BC)\n*The Minoan gold treasure from [[Aegina Treasure|Aegina]], northern Aegean, Greece, (1850\u20131550 BC)\n*Segments of the columns and architraves from the [[Treasury of Atreus]], Peloponnese, Greece, (1350\u20131250 BC)\n*[[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Elgin]] Amphora, highly decorated pottery vase attributed to the [[Dipylon Master]], Athens, Greece, (8th century BC)\n*[[Bronze Statuette of Athletic Spartan Girl]]\n\n'''Etruscan (8th century BC \u2013 1st century BC)'''\n*Some of the artefacts from the Castellani Tomb in [[Palestrina]], central Italy, (8th\u20136th century BC)\n*Contents of the [[Isis Tomb, Vulci]], (570\u2013560 BC)\n*Painted terracotta plaques (the so-called ''Boccanera Plaques'') from a tomb in [[Cerveteri]], (560\u2013550 BC)\n*[[Oscan Tablet]], one of the most important inscriptions in the Oscan language, (300\u2013100 BC)\n*[[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]] from Chiusi, (150\u2013140 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Greece (8th century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Group of life-size [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] statues from the Sacred Way at [[Didyma]], western Turkey, (600\u2013580 BC)\n*[[Priene Inscription|Dedicatory Inscription by Alexander the Great]] from Priene in Turkey (330 BC)\n*Head from the colossal statue of the [[Asclepius of Milos]], Greece, (325\u2013300 BC)\n*Bronze sculpture of a Greek poet known as the [[Arundel Head]], western Turkey, (2nd\u20131st centuries BC)\n*Remains of the [[Scylla]] monument at [[Bargylia]], south west Anatolia, Turkey, (200\u2013150 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Rome (1st century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Cameo glass [[Portland Vase]], the most famous glass vessel from ancient Rome, (1\u201325 AD)\n*Silver [[Warren Cup]] with homoerotic scenes, found near Jerusalem, (5\u201315 AD)\n*[[Discobolus|Discus-thrower (Discobolos)]]<ref>Tony Kitto, \"The celebrated connoisseur: Charles Townley, 1737\u20131805\" ''Minerva Magazine'' May/June 2005, in connection with a British Museum exhibition celebrating the bicentennial of the Townley purchase.

A collection of immense importance, the holdings of [[Assyrian sculpture]], [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumer]]ian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] from [[Nimrud]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Khorsabad]].\n\nThe collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], parts of Central Asia, [[Syria]], the [[Holy Land]] and [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]] and include objects from the beginning of [[Islam]] in the 7th century.\n\nThe first significant addition of [[Mesopotamian]] objects was from the collection of [[Claudius James Rich]] in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of [[Austen Henry Layard|A. H. Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n sites of [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]] between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]], as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of [[Lamassu]]'s, palace reliefs, [[Stele|stelae]], including the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]], were brought to the British Museum.\n[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 14 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's & Full Projection.3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Room 6 \u2013 Pair of [[Lamassu|Human Headed Winged Lions]] and reliefs from [[Nimrud]] with the [[Balawat Gates]], c. 860 BC]]\n\n[[File:London 307.JPG|thumb|Room 52 \u2013 Ancient Iran with the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], considered to be the world's first charter of [[human rights]], 559\u2013530 BC]]\nLayard's work was continued by his assistant, [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and in 1852\u20131854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' and [[Lachish relief]]s. He also discovered the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]], a large collection of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. [[William Loftus|W. K. Loftus]] excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of [[Nimrud ivories|ivories]] in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] from [[Babylon]], the bronze gates from [[Balawat]], important objects from [[Sippar]], and a fine collection of [[Urartu|Urartian]] bronzes from [[Toprakkale]].\n\nIn the early 20th century excavations were carried out at [[Carchemish]], [[Turkey]] by [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] and [[Leonard Woolley]], the latter assisted by [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern [[Iraq]] after the [[First World War]]. From [[Ubaid period|Tell al-Ubaid]] came the bronze furnishings of a [[Sumer]]ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] in 1919\u201324. Woolley went on to excavate [[Ur]] between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '[[Standard of Ur]]', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '[[Royal Game of Ur]]', and two bull-headed [[lyres]]. The department also has three [[diorite]] statues of the ruler [[Statues of Gudea|Gudea]] from the ancient state of [[Lagash]] and a series of limestone [[kudurru]] or boundary stones from different locations across ancient [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nAlthough the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The [[Achaemenid]] collection was enhanced with the addition of the [[Oxus Treasure]] in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and the Hungarian-British explorer [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of [[Persepolis]] were donated by Sir [[Gore Ouseley]] in 1825 and the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen|5th Earl of Aberdeen]] in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid [[Household silver|silverware]] in the world. The later [[Sasanian Empire]] is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the [[Tharros]] collection from [[Sardinia]] and the large number of Phoenician stelae from [[Carthage]] are outstanding. Another often overlooked highlight is [[Ancient history of Yemen|Yemeni]] antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of [[Dilmun]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of [[A'ali]] and [[Shakhura]] in Bahrain.\n\nFrom the modern state of [[Syria]] come almost forty funerary busts from [[Palmyra]] and a group of stone [[reliefs]] from the excavations of [[Max von Oppenheim]] at [[Tell Halaf]] that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of [[Max Mallowan]] at [[Chagar Bazar]] and [[Tell Brak]] in 1935\u20131938 and from Woolley at [[Alalakh]] in the years just before and after the [[Second World War]]. Mallowan returned with his wife [[Agatha Christie]] to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many [[Nimrud Ivories|important artefacts]] for the museum. The collection of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] material was strengthened by the work of [[Kathleen Kenyon]] at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (Jericho) in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at [[Lachish]] by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932\u20131938.  Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as [[:de:Tell es-Sa'idiyeh|Tell es Sa'idiyeh]] in Jordan.\n\nThe museum's collection of [[Islamic art]], including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pm_partner.php?id=Mus01;uk&type=museum&theme=ISL&|title=Museum With No Frontiers| publisher=Discover Islamic Art| accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from [[Spain]] in the west to [[India]] in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of [[\u0130znik pottery|Iznik]] ceramics (the largest in the world), a highlight of which is the mosque lamp from the [[Dome of the Rock]], mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the [[Zodiac]], a fine selection of [[astrolabes]], and [[Mughal paintings]] and precious artwork including a large [[Jade Terrapin from Allahabad|jade terrapin]] made for the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as [[Siraf]] by [[David Whitehouse]] and [[Alamut Castle]] by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the [[Frederick DuCane Godman|Godman]] bequest of Iznik, [[Hispano-Moresque]] and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.\n\nA representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the [[Middle East]]. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite web

Key benefactors to the department have been [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]], [[Richard Payne Knight]], John Malcolm, [[Campbell Dodgson]], C\u00e9sar Mange de Hauke and [[Tom\u00e1s Harris]].\n\nThere are groups of drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], (including [[Epifania (Michelangelo drawing)|his only surviving full-scale cartoon]]), [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (99 [[engraving]]s, 6 [[etching]]s and most of his 346 [[woodcut]]s), Rembrandt and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]. More than 30,000 British drawings and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] include important examples of work by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Paul Sandby|Sandby]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], [[Thomas Girtin|Girtin]], [[John Constable|Constable]], [[John Sell Cotman|Cotman]], [[David Cox (artist)|Cox]], [[James Gillray|Gillray]], [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]] and [[George Cruikshank|Cruikshank]], as well as all the great [[Victorian era|Victorians]]. There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by [[William Blake]] and [[Thomas Bewick]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The great eleven volume [[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum]] compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints. Over 500,000 objects from the department are now on the online collection database, many with high-quality images.<ref>Searches on 8 January 2012, return totals of 700,000, but many are in other departments</ref> A 2011 donation of \u00a31 million enabled the museum to acquire a complete set of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Vollard Suite]]''.<ref name=\"TelegNov11\">{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8923722/City-fund-manager-in-1m-Picasso-giveaway.html| title=City fund manager in \u00a31m Picasso giveaway| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| first=Anita |last=Singh| accessdate=19 May 2012| date=29 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"190\" heights=\"190\">\nFile:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait of a Young Woman - WGA25729.jpg|[[Rogier van der Weyden]] - Portrait of a Young Woman, c. 1440\nFile:A fool, seated on a basket, about to be shaved by a nun holding a wafer iron by Hieronymus Bosch.jpg|[[Hieronymus Bosch]] - A comical barber scene, c. 1477-1516\nFile:Botticelli, allegoria dell'abbondanza, disegno.jpg|[[Sandro Botticelli]] - Allegory of Abundance, 1480-1485\nFile:Leonardo da vinci, Study for the Burlington House Cartoon.jpg|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] \u2013 The [[Islamic views of Mary|Virgin]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Child]] with [[Saint Anne]] and the Infant Saint [[John the Baptist]] (prep for '[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist|The Burlington House Cartoon]]'), c. 1499\u20131500\nFile:Adam study - Michelangelo.jpg|[[Michelangelo]] \u2013 Studies of a reclining male nude: [[Adam]] in the fresco [[The Creation of Adam|'The Creation of Man']] on the vault of the [[Sistine Chapel]], c. 1511\nFile:Raffaello, studio di testa di madonna e bambino.jpg|[[Raphael]] \u2013 Study of Heads, Mother and Child, c. 1509-11\nFile:Titian - Drowning of the Pharaoh's Host in the Red Sea - WGA22989.jpg|[[Titian]] \u2013 [[Crossing the Red Sea|Drowning of the Pharaoh's Host in the Red Sea]], 1515\u201317\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Walrus - WGA07101.jpg|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] - Drawing of a walrus, 1521\nFile:A Lady, called Anne Boleyn, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]] - Portrait of Anne Boleyn, 1536\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens 077.jpg|[[Peter Paul Rubens]] - Drawing of a lioness, c. 1614-1615\nFile:Head of a monk, 1625-64, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n.

It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as [[Prehistoric]] and neolithic objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods throughout the world, as well as from the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron age]] in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]], and [[Gertrude Caton\u2013Thompson]]. Paleolithic objects from the [[William Allen Sturge|Sturge]], [[Henry Christy|Christy]] and [[\u00c9douard Lartet|Lartet]] collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as [[William Greenwell|Greenwell]] in Britain, [[Thomas Tobin|Tobin]] and Cooke in Ireland, [[William Collings Lukis|Lukis]] and de la Granci\u00e8re in Brittany, [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae|Worsaae]] in Denmark, [[Luis Siret|Siret]] at [[El Argar]] in Spain, and [[Gustav Klemm|Klemm]] and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from [[Hallstatt]] were acquired as a result of the [[Sir John Evans|Evans]]/[[Sir John Lubbock|Lubbock]] excavations and from [[Giubiasco]] in [[Ticino]] through the [[Swiss National Museum]].\n\nIn addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the [[Black Sea]] and from North Africa to [[Scandinavia]]; a representative selection of these has recently been redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections include [[Latvia]]n, [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Gotland]]ic and [[Merovingian]] material from [[Johann Karl B\u00e4hr]], Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period are the magnificent items from the [[Sutton Hoo]] royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner [[Edith Pretty]]. The department includes the national collection of [[horology]] with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the [[Octavius Morgan|Morgan]] and [[Courtenay Adrian Ilbert|Ilbert]] collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of [[Romano-British]] objects \u2013 the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside [[Italy]]. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in [[East Anglia]], the most important of which is the [[Mildenhall Treasure]]. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian [[Charles Roach Smith]] in 1856.  These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection.\n\nObjects from the Department of Prehistory and Europe are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in its [[archive]] facilities, where it is available for [[research]] and study.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n'''Stone Age (c. 3.4 million years BC

Percival David, 2nd Baronet|Percival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics]]\nThe scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad; its collections of over 75,000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian continent (from East, South, Central and South-East Asia) and from the Neolithic up to the present day. Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the [[British Empire]], especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as [[Hindu Stuart|Charles Stuart]], [[James Prinsep]], [[Charles Masson]], Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], Sir [[Harold Arthur Deane|Harold Deane]] and Sir [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]]. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker [[George Eumorfopoulos]] in the 1930s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the [[philanthropist]] PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.<ref>{{cite web|author=Babs.Guthrie|url=http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|title=Collection page|publisher=Untold London|accessdate=4 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921153753/http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|archivedate=21 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|title=Embassy of Japan in the UK|publisher=Japan Embassy|accessdate=4 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427102637/http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|archive-date=27 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia.aspx |title=Department of Asia|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and [[hunter-gatherers]], many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] (much assembled by the British naval officer [[Maurice Vidal Portman|Maurice Portman]]), Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator [[Hugh Nevill]]), Northern Thailand, south-west China, the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist [[John Anderson (zoologist)|John Anderson]]), Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the [[Sarawak]] collection put together by Dr [[Charles Hose]], as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a [[gamelan]] musical set, was assembled by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]].\n\nThe principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33 with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asian objects. An adjacent gallery showcases the Amaravati sculptures and monuments. Other galleries on the upper floors are devoted to its Japanese, Korean, painting and [[calligraphy]], and Chinese ceramics collections.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/departments_all_relationships.aspx?Title=Asia&ContentType=Department&PageId=551 |title=Department of Asia \u2013 Related Highlight Objects |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n*The most comprehensive collection of sculpture from the Indian subcontinent in the world, including the celebrated [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] limestone reliefs from [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]] excavated by Sir [[Walter Elliot (Scottish naturalist)|Walter Elliot]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/galleries/asia/room_33a_amaravati.aspx |title=Room 33a: Amaravati |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n*An outstanding collection of Chinese antiquities, paintings, and porcelain, lacquer, bronze, jade, and other applied arts\n*The most comprehensive collection of [[Japanese art|Japanese pre-20th century art]] in the Western world, many of which originally belonged to the surgeon [[William Anderson (collector)|William Anderson]] and diplomat [[Ernest Mason Satow]]\n\n'''East Asia'''\n*A large collection of [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], (from c. 1500 BC onwards)\n*[[Huixian Bronze Hu]], an identical pair of bronze vessels from the [[Zhou dynasty|Eastern Zhou period]], China, (5th century BC)\n*Japanese antiquities from the [[Kofun period]] excavated by the pioneering archaeologist [[William Gowland]], (3rd\u20136th centuries AD)\n*The famous [[Admonitions Scroll]] by Chinese artist [[Gu Kaizhi]], (344\u2013406 AD)\n*The colossal [[Amit\u0101bha Buddha from Hancui]], China, (585 AD)\n*A set of ceramic [[Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun]], (c.728 AD)\n*[[Seated Luohan from Yixian]], one from a set of eight surviving statues, China, (907\u20131125 AD)\n*A fine assemblage of Buddhist paintings from [[Dunhuang]], western China, collected by the British-Hungarian explorer [[Aurel Stein]], (5th\u201311th centuries AD)\n*[[Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art|Pericival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics, (10th\u201318th centuries AD)\n*Ivory stand in the form of a seated lion, Chos-'khor-yan-rtse monastery in [[Tibet]], (13th century AD)\n*Pair of ceramic [[Kakiemon elephants]] from Japan, (17th century AD)\n*Japanese prints including [[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]], (1829\u201332)\n\n'''South Asia'''\n*Excavated objects from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] sites of [[Mohenjo-daro]], and [[Harappa]], [[Ancient India]] (now in [[Pakistan]]), (2500\u20132000 BC)\n*Sandstone fragment of a [[Pillars of Ashoka|Pillar of Ashoka]] with [[Brahmi]] inscription from [[Meerut]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], (238 BC)\n*The [[Kulu Vase]] found near a monastery in [[Himachal Pradesh]], one of the earliest examples of figurative art from the sub-continent, northern India, (1st century BC)\n*[[Taxila copper plate|Copper plate]] from [[Taxila]], with important Kharoshthi inscription, [[Ancient India]](now in [[Pakistan]]), (1st century BC \u2013 1st century AD)\n*Indo-Scythian sandstone [[Mathura lion capital|Mathura Lion Capital]] and [[Sanchi Yakshi Figure|Bracket figure]] from one of the gateways to the Great Stupa at [[Sanchi]], central India, (1st century AD)\n*[[Bimaran casket|Bimaran Casket]] and [[Wardak Vase]], reliquaries from ancient stupas in Afghanistan, (1st\u20132nd centuries AD)\n*Relic deposits from the stupas at [[Manikyala]], [[Ahin Posh]], [[Sanchi]] and [[Gudivada]], (1st\u20133rd centuries AD)\n*[[Seated Buddha from Gandhara]], and other Gandhara objects from [[Kafir Kot]], [[Jamal Garhi]] and [[Takht-i-Bahi]], [[Pakistan]], (1st\u20133rd centuries AD)\n*The [[Buddhapad Hoard]] of bronze images from southern India, (6th\u20138th centuries AD)\n*Stone statue of Buddha from the [[Sultanganj Buddha|Sultanganj]] hoard, Bihar, eastern India.

Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by [[Henry Christy]], [[Harry Geoffrey Beasley|Harry Beasley]] and [[William Ockelford Oldman|William Oldman]] are outstanding. Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays [[ethnographic]] from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on [[North America]] and [[Mexico]]. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.\n\n'''Africa'''\n[[File:African_throwing_knives.jpg|thumb|left|Room 25 \u2013 Collection of African [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]]]]\nThe Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. Highlights of the African collection include objects found at [[Senegambian stone circles|megalithic circles]] in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in west Africa, the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from [[Ife]], a similar [[terracotta]] head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, an [[Ikom monoliths|Ikom monolith]] from [[Cross River State]], the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the [[Kuba Kingdom]] including three [[Ndop (Kuba)|royal figures]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from [[Gondar]] and [[Amba Mariam|Magdala]], Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] (that includes a unique soapstone, [[anthropomorphic]] figure) and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].\n\n'''Oceania'''\n\nThe British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the [[Pacific Ocean]], stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]] \u2013 Aboriginal art from [[Australia]] is considered separately in its own right.  Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped [[pestle]] and a group of stone [[Pestle and mortar|mortars]] from [[Papua New Guinea]]. The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of [[James Cook|Cook]]'s and [[George Vancouver|Vancouver]]'s expeditions or by colonial administrators such as Sir [[George Grey]], Sir [[Frederick Broome]] and [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Gordon]], before Western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures. A poignant artefact is the wooden [[Gweagal#The_Gweagal_Spears_and_Shield|shield]] found near [[Botany Bay]] during Cook's first voyage in 1770. The [[Henry Wilson (sailor)|Wilson]] cabinet of curiosities from [[Palau]] is another example of pre-contact ware. The department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering [[anthropology|anthropologists]] such as [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] and [[Katherine Routledge]].\n\nIn addition, the [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]] collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many intricately carved wooden and [[Hei-tiki|jade objects]] and the [[Aboriginal art]] collection is distinguished by its wide range of [[bark paintings]], including two very early bark etchings collected by [[John Hunter Kerr]]. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1911, that includes the unique [[statue of A'a from Rurutu]] Island, the rare [[Mangareva Statue|idol]] from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook Islands [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|deity figure]].  Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue of [[K\u016b|K\u016b-ka-ili-moku]] or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and the famous Easter Island statues [[Hoa Hakananai'a]] and [[Relocation of moai objects|Moai Hava]].\n\n'''Americas'''\nThe Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Taino]] and other early cultures are well represented. The [[Kayung totem pole]], which was made in the late nineteenth century in the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide-ranging collections that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the [[Inuit]] population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia. Highlights of the collection include [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal Canadian]] objects from Alaska and Canada collected by the [[Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale|5th Earl of Lonsdale]] and the [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquis of Lorne]], the [[E. G. Squier|Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis|Davis]] collection of prehistoric mound relics from North America, a selection of pottery vessels found in cliff-dwellings at [[Mesa Verde]], a collection of turquoise Aztec [[Double-headed serpent|mosaics]] from Mexico (the largest in Europe), important artefacts from [[Teotihuacan Ocelot|Teotihuacan]] and [[Isla de Sacrificios]], several rare pre-Columbian manuscripts including the [[Codex Zouche-Nuttall]] and [[Codex Waecker-Gotter]], a spectacular series of Mayan [[Yaxchilan Lintel 24|lintels]] from [[Yaxchilan]] excavated by the British Mayanist [[Alfred Maudslay]], a very high quality Mayan collection that includes sculptures from [[Cop\u00e1n Bench Panel|Copan]], [[Tikal Temple I|Tikal]], [[Tulum Stela 1|Tulum]], [[Pusilha]], [[Naranjo]] and [[Nebaj]] (including the celebrated [[Fenton Vase]]), a group of [[Zemi Figures from Vere, Jamaica]], a number of prestigious pre-Columbian gold and [[Lake Guatavita|votive]] objects from Colombia, ethnographic objects from across the Amazon region including the [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk|Schomburgk]] collection, two rare [[Tiwanaku]] pottery vessels from [[Lake Titicaca]] and important items from [[Tierra del Fuego]] donated by Commander [[Phillip Parker King]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:British Museum otter pipe.jpg|Room 26 - Stone pipe representing an otter from [[Hopewell Culture National Historical Park|Mound City]], Ohio, USA, 200 BC - 400 AD\nFile:British Museum tomb guardian.jpg|Room 2 - Stone tomb guardian, part human part jaguar, from [[San Agust\u00edn, Huila|San Agust\u00edn]], Colombia, c. 300-600 AD\nFile:Maya maize god statue.jpg|Room 1 - Maya maize god statue from [[Cop\u00e1n]], Honduras, 600-800 AD\nFile:Gold Lime Flasks (poporos) Quimbaya Culture, Colombia AD 600-1100 - British Museum.jpg|Room 24 - Gold Lime Flasks (poporos), [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya Culture]], Colombia, 600-1100 AD\nFile:Maya, lintel 25, da yaxchilan, 725.JPG|Room 27 - Lintel 25 from [[Yaxchilan]], Late Classic, Mexico, 600-900 AD\nFile:Bird pectoral, Popayan, gold alloy, AD900\u20131600..jpg|Room 24 - Bird pectoral made from gold alloy, [[Popay\u00e1n]], Colombia, 900-1600 AD\nFile:Hoa Hakananai'a - Moai in the British Museum.jpeg|Room 24 \u2013 Rapa Nui statue [[Hoa Hakananai'a]], 1000 AD, [[Wellcome Trust]] Gallery\nFile:Denis Bourez - British Museum, London (8748174360).jpg|Room 27 - [[Double-headed serpent]] turquoise mosaic, Aztec, Mexico, 1400-1500 AD\nFile:Denis Bourez - British Museum, London (8747055335).jpg|Room 27 - Turquoise Mosaic Mask, [[Mixtec]]-[[Aztec]], Mexico, 1400-1500 AD\nFile:Miniature gold llama figurine.jpg|Room 2 - Miniature gold llama figurine, [[Inca]], Peru, about 1500 AD\nFile:Benin Bronzes at the British Museum 1.jpg|Room 25 - Part of the famous collection of Benin brass plaques, [[Nigeria]], 1500-1600 AD\nFile:Benin brass plaque 01.jpg|Room 25 - Detail of one of the [[Benin Empire|Benin]] brass plaques in the museum, Nigeria, 1500-1600 AD\nFile:Idia mask BM Af1910 5-13 1.jpg|Room 25 - [[Benin ivory mask]] of Queen Idia, Nigeria, 16th century AD\nFile:Hawaiian feather helmet, British Museum 3.jpg|Room 24 - Hawaiian feather helmet or [[mahiole]], late 1700s AD\nFile:British museum, totem.JPG|Great Court - Two house frontal [[Kayung totem pole|totem poles]], Haida, British Columbia, Canada, about 1850 AD\nFile:Punu mask BM Af1904 11-22 1.jpg|Room 25 - Mask (wood and pigment); Punu people, [[Gabon]], 19th century AD\nFile:Otobo masquerade.jpg|Room 25 - Otobo masquerade in the Africa Gallery, Nigeria, 20th century AD\nFile:El Anatsui - Man's Cloth.jpg|Room 25 - Modern interpretation of [[kente cloth]] from [[Ghana]], late 20th century AD\n</gallery>\n\n===Department of Coins and Medals===\n    {{main|British Museum Department of Coins and Medals}}\n\nThe British Museum is home to one of the world's finest [[Numismatics|numismatic]] collections, comprising about a million objects, including coins, medals, tokens and paper money.

The museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted by the public on application.

The bequest of a collection of books, [[engraved gem]]s, coins, prints and drawings by [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]] in 1800 did much to raise the museum's reputation; but Montagu House became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion.<ref>BMCE1/5, 1175 (13 May 1820).

A list of donations to the museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of a \"Colossal Foot of an [[Apollo]] in Marble\". It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the [[Royal Society]] in London.\n\n===Growth and change (1800\u20131825)===\n\n[[File:P8282318.1.JPG|thumb|right|Left to Right: [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], Townley Gallery and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s west wing under construction, July 1828]]\n[[File:Mauso03.JPG|thumb|The [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus|Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] Room, 1920s]]\n\nIn the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French campaign]] in the [[Battle of the Nile]], in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] presented the [[Rosetta Stone]] \u2013 key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.<ref>''Wondrous Curiosities \u2013 Ancient Egypt at the British Museum'', pp. 66\u201372 (Stephanie Moser, 2006, {{ISBN|0-226-54209-2}})</ref> Gifts and purchases from [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the [[Younger Memnon|Colossal bust of Ramesses II]] in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture.<ref>''The Story of the British Museum'', p. 24 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})</ref> Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the [[Charles Towneley|Charles Towneley collection]], much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805.

Full control was handed over to the National Gallery in 1868, after the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1840\u20131859|Act of Parliament of 1856]] established the Gallery as an independent body.</ref> the proposed Picture Gallery was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over to the [[Natural history]] collections.<ref>The Story of the British Museum, p. 25 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})</ref>\n\n===The largest building site in Europe (1825\u20131850)===\n[[File:Image-The Grenville Library (1875).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Thomas Grenville|Grenville]] Library, 1875]]\nThe museum became a construction site as [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s grand [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] building gradually arose. The [[King's Library]], on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn 1840, the museum became involved in its first overseas [[excavation (archeology)|excavation]]s, [[Charles Fellows]]'s expedition to [[Xanthos]], in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient [[Lycia]], among them the [[Nereid Monument|Nereid]] and [[Tomb of Payava|Payava]] monuments. In 1857, [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]] was to discover the 4th-century BC [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum of Halikarnassos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. In the 1840s and 1850s the museum supported excavations in [[Assyria]] by [[Austen Henry Layard|A.H. Layard]] and others at sites such as [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s great library of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]], which helped to make the museum a focus for [[Assyriology|Assyrian studies]].<ref>Reade, Julian (2004). Assyrian Sculpture. London: The British Museum Press, p. 16</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Grenville|Sir Thomas Grenville]] (1755\u20131846), a trustee of the British Museum from 1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] in 1998.\n\n===Collecting from the wider world (1850\u20131875)===\nThe opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]'s 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for [[Assyria]]n sculptures and [[Sydney Smirke]]'s [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in [[South Kensington]], which would later become the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum of Natural History]].\n\nRoughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the \"second founder\" of the British Museum, the Italian librarian [[Anthony Panizzi]]. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now part of the [[British Library]]) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the [[National Library of Paris]].<ref name=\"world and its people\"/> The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dickens Charles Jr. |author-link=Charles Dickens Jr. |year=1879|title=Museum, British|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-mus.htm|accessdate=22 August 2007|quote=Beyond the new Lycian room is the READING ROOM: [...]; circular structure; original suggestion of Thomas Watts, improved by A.

A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the [[Louis, Duke of Blacas|Duke of Blacas]]'s wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and [[John Turtle Wood]] discovered the remains of the 4th century BC [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]], another [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Wonder of the Ancient World]].<ref>South from Ephesus \u2013 An Escape From The Tyranny of Western Art, pp. 33\u201334,(Brian Sewell, 2002, {{ISBN|1-903933-16-1}})</ref>\n\n===Scholarship and legacies (1875\u20131900)===\nThe natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History in 1887, nowadays the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]].

In 1882, the museum was involved in the establishment of the independent [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|A. W.

In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated via the [[London Post Office Railway]] to Holborn, the [[National Library of Wales|National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth)]] and a country house near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931.

In 1931, the art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Sir Joseph Duveen]] offered funds to build a gallery for the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon sculptures]]. Designed by the American architect [[John Russell Pope]], it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting: <blockquote>The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which, though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour<ref>Quoted Ashmole (1994), 125</ref></blockquote>}} However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids, the Parthenon Sculptures, along with the museum's most valued collections, were dispersed to secure basements, [[English country house|country houses]], [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych Underground station]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and a quarry.

For instance, they arranged for a German researcher to spend several years at the British Museum for the purpose of compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry, which, at the time, with its 562 pages and a bibliography of some 600 items, was an effort more ambitious than hitherto attempted.}}</ref> After the war, the museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC [[Mesopotamia]]n treasure from [[Ur]], discovered during [[Leonard Woolley]]'s 1922\u201334 excavations. Gold, silver and [[garnet]] grave goods from the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from [[Mildenhall Treasure|Mildenhall]], Suffolk (1946). The immediate [[post-war]] years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.\n\n===A new public face (1950\u20131975)===\n[[File:The Duveen Gallery (1980s).jpg|thumb|The re-opened [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Duveen]] Gallery, 1980]]\n\nIn 1953, the museum celebrated its [[200 (number)|bicentenary]]. Many changes followed: the first full-time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, the [[The British Museum Friends|Friends]] organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the [[board of trustees]] changed and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] became fully independent. By 1959 the [[British Museum Department of Coins and Medals|Coins and Medals]] office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] Classical and Near Eastern galleries.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 270</ref> In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery: <blockquote>It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in colour to the marbles...These half-dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside, when the building was projected.<ref>Ashmole (1994), 126</ref></blockquote> It was not until the 1980s that the installation of a lighting scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.}}\n\nBy the 1970s the museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition \"Treasures of [[Tutankhamun]]\" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of [[manuscripts]] and printed books from the British Museum. This left the museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints & drawings; and [[ethnography]]. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra {{convert|1+1/4|mi}} of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.\n\n===The Great Court emerges (1975\u20132000)===\nThe departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] 19th-century central quadrangle into the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] \u2013 the largest covered square in Europe \u2013 which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived [[Museum of Mankind]] at [[6 Burlington Gardens]] from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.\n\nThe museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in \"modern\" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as [[New Guinea]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Indonesia]] and there were excavations in the [[Near East]], Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The [[Weston family|Weston]] Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered [[hoard]]s which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 327</ref>\n\n===The British Museum today===\n[[File:The British Museum today.jpg|thumb|right|Wide view of the Great Court]]\nToday the museum no longer houses collections of [[natural history]], and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over 13 million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and 150 million at the British Library.\n\nThe [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], which was designed by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]], opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]]. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore [[Annenberg Foundation|Annenberg]] Centre.\n\nWith the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the demolition for [[Lord Foster]]'s glass-roofed [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Sainsbury]] family \u2013 with the donation valued at \u00a325 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/africa/room_25_africa.aspx |title=Room 25: Africa |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs part of its very large website, the museum has the largest [[online database]] of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database.aspx |title=Search the collection database |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> There is also a \"Highlights\" database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access).<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights.aspx Highlights] British Museum, [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues.aspx online research catalogues] British Museum and [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_journals.aspx online journals] British Museum</ref> In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\" />\n\nIn 2013 the museum received a record 6.7 million visitors, an increase of 20% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\">{{Cite news| title=British Museum gets record 6.7m visitors for 2013| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-25729616| newspaper=BBC News| accessdate=20 March 2014| date=2014-01-14}}</ref> Popular exhibitions including \"Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum\" and \"Ice Age Art\" are credited with helping fuel the increase in visitors.<ref name=Smithers_tourists>{{Cite news| last=Smithers| first=Rebecca| title=Sunny weather drew record numbers to UK's outdoor tourist hotspots in 2013| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/05/sunny-weather-record-uk-tourists-2013| newspaper=The Guardian| date=2014-03-05}}</ref> Plans were announced in September 2014 to recreate the entire building along with all exhibits in the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'' in conjunction with members of the public.<ref>{{Cite news| title=British Museum to be digitally recreated in Minecraft| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29281051| last1=Miller| first1=Joe| newspaper=BBC News |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe British Museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] through a three-year funding agreement.

The architect Sir [[John James Burnet]] was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906\u201314 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1914. They now house the museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.\n\nThe [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Duveen]] Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek & Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[John Russell Pope]]. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during [[World War II]] bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south-west corner of the museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase \u2013 this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.<ref>pp. 65\u201366, Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill & Christopher Date 1999</ref>\n\nThe [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers [[Buro Happold]] and the architects [[Foster and Partners]].<ref>Norman Foster and the British Museum, Norman Foster, Deyan Sudjic & Spencer de Grey 2001</ref> The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe.

After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French]] forces under [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the [[British army]] and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed [[Rosetta Stone]], were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] as [[Consul general|consul]] in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Giovanni Belzoni]]. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]].\n\nBy 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] under the efforts of [[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]]. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from [[Amarna]], [[Bubastis]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]].

The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including [[Asyut]] (1907), [[El-Badari|Mostagedda]] and [[El-Badari|Matmar]] (1920s), [[Ashmunein]] (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as [[Soba (city)|Soba]], Kawa and the Northern [[Dongola Reach]] (1990s).

A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought-after exhibits by visitors to the museum.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[File:TombofNebamun-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 61 \u2013 The famous false fresco 'Pond in a Garden' from the [[Tomb of Nebamun]], c. 1350 BC]]\n[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 4 \u2013 The [[Rosetta Stone]], key to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, 196 BC]]\n'''Predynastic and Early Dynastic period (c. 6000 BC \u2013 c. 2690 BC)'''\n*Mummy of [[Gebelein predynastic mummies|''Ginger'']] from Gebelein, (c. 3400 BC)\n*The [[Battlefield Palette]] and [[Hunters Palette]], two cosmetic palettes with complex decorative schemes, (c. 3100 BC)\n*Stela of King [[Peribsen]], Abydos, (c. 2720\u20132710 BC)\n\n'''Old Kingdom (2690\u20132181 BC)'''\n*Granite statue of Ankhwa, the shipbuilder, [[Saqqara]], Egypt, 3rd Dynasty, (around 2650 BC)\n*Several of the original casing stones from the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], (c. 2570 BC)\n*Wooden tomb statue of Tjeti, Fifth to Sixth Dynasty, (about 2345\u20132181 BC)\n\n'''Middle Kingdom (2134\u20131690 BC)'''\n*Inner and outer coffin of Sebekhetepi, [[Beni Hasan]], (about 2125\u20131795 BC)\n*Limestone stela of Heqaib, [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], Egypt, 12th Dynasty, (1990\u20131750 BC)\n*Block statue and stela of Sahathor, 12th Dynasty, reign of [[Amenemhat II]], (about 1922\u20131878 BC)\n\n'''New Kingdom (1549\u20131069 BC)'''\n*Fragment of the beard of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], (14th century BC)\n*[[Colossal quartzite statue of Amenhotep III|Colossal head from a statue]] of Amenhotep III, (1350 BC)\n*Colossal limestone bust of [[Amenhotep III]], (1350 BC)\n*[[Amarna letters|Amarna Tablets]], 99 out of 382 [[Clay tablet|tablets]] found, second greatest collection in the world after the Vorderasiatisches Museum, [[Berlin]] (203 tablets), (1350 BC)\n*[[List of pharaohs|List of the kings]] of Egypt from the [[Abydos, Egypt|Temple of Ramesses II]], (1250 BC)\n\n'''Third Intermediate Period (1069\u2013664 BC)'''\n*Mummy case and coffin of Nesperennub, [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], (c.800 BC)\n*[[Statues of Amun in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa|Statue of Amun]] in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa, (683 BC)\n*Inner and outer coffins of the priest Hor, Deir el-Bahari, Thebes, 25th Dynasty, (about 680 BC)\n\n'''Late Period (664\u2013332 BC)'''\n*Saite Sarcophagus of Satsobek, the vizier (prime minister) of the northern part of Egypt in the reign of [[Psammetichus I]], (664\u2013610 BC)\n*Bronze figure of Isis and Horus, North [[Saqqara]], Egypt, (600 BC)\n*[[Obelisks of Nectanebo II|Obelisks]] and sarcophagus of Pharaoh [[Nectanebo II]], (360\u2013343 BC)\n\n'''Ptolemaic dynasty (305\u201330 BC)'''\n*The famous [[Rosetta Stone]], trilingual stela that unlocked the ancient Egyptian civilisation, (196 BC)\n*Giant sculpture of a [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]], (32\u201330 BC)\n*Mummy of [[Hornedjitef]] (inner coffin), Thebes, (3rd century BC)\n\n'''Roman Period (30 BC-641 AD)'''\n*The Meriotic [[Hamadab Stela]] from the [[Kingdom of Kush]] found near the ancient site of Mero\u00eb in Sudan, 24 BC\n*Lid of the coffin of Soter and Cleopatra from Qurna, Thebes, (early 2nd century AD)\n*Mummy of a youth with a portrait of the deceased, [[Hawara]], (100\u2013200 AD)\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:Bm-ginger.jpg|Room 64 -

Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]], [[John Turtle Wood]], [[Robert Murdoch Smith]] and [[Charles Fellows]].\n\nThe Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of [[Magna Graecia]] that include Sicily and southern Italy. The [[Cyclades|Cycladic]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures are represented, and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] collection includes important sculpture from the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, as well as elements of two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] and the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]].<ref name=\"GreeceRome\"/>\n\nBeginning from the early [[Bronze Age]], the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and non-Greek colonies in [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]] on Asia Minor. There is some material from the [[Roman Republic]], but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the [[Roman Empire]], with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).\n\nThe collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s and [[Edm\u00e9-Antoine Durand|Chevalier Durand]]'s collections), [[Glass|Roman glass]] including the famous [[Cameo glass]] Portland Vase, [[Roman mosaic]]s from [[Carthage]] and [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] in North Africa that were excavated by [[Nathan Davis (traveller)|Nathan Davis]], and silver hoards from [[Roman Gaul]] (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee [[Richard Payne Knight]]), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir [[Robert Hamilton Lang]]'s collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the [[Charles Townley#Townley Collection|Townley collection]] as well as residual sculptures from the famous [[Farnese collection]].\n\nObjects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the [[architectural]] monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[Parthenon]]\n*The [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles (Elgin Marbles)]], (447\u2013438 BC)\n\n[[Erechtheion]]\n*A surviving column, (420\u2013415 BC)\n*One of six remaining [[Caryatid]]s, (415 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Athena Nike]]\n*Surviving [[frieze]] slabs, (427\u2013424 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Bassae]]\n*Twenty-three surviving blocks of the [[Bassae Frieze|frieze]] from the interior of the temple, (420\u2013400 BC)\n\n[[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]]\n*Two colossal free-standing figures identified as Maussollos and his wife [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], (c. 350 BC)\n*Part of an impressive horse from the [[chariot]] group adorning the summit of the [[Mausoleum]], (c. 350 BC)\n*The [[Amazonomachy]] frieze \u2013 A long section of relief frieze showing the battle between Greeks and [[Amazons]], (c. 350 BC)\n\n[[Temple of Artemis in Ephesus]]\n*One of the sculptured column bases, (340\u2013320 BC)\n*Part of the [[Ionic order|Ionic]] frieze situated above the colonnade, (330\u2013300 BC)\n\n[[Knidos]] in Asia Minor\n*[[Demeter of Knidos]], (350 BC)\n*[[Lion of Knidos]], (350\u2013200 BC)\n\n[[Xanthos]] in Asia Minor\n*Lion Tomb, (550\u2013500 BC)\n*[[Harpy Tomb]], (480\u2013470 BC)\n*[[Nereid Monument]], partial reconstruction of a large and elaborate Lykian tomb, (390\u2013380 BC)\n*Tomb of Merehi, (390\u2013350 BC)\n*[[Tomb of Payava]], (375\u2013350 BC)\n\n'''Wider collection'''\n\n'''Prehistoric Greece and Italy (3300 BC \u2013 8th century BC)'''\n*Over thirty [[Cycladic art|Cycladic figures]] from islands in the Aegean Sea, many collected by [[James Theodore Bent]], Greece, (3300\u20132000 BC)\n*Material from the [[Knossos|Palace of Knossos]] including a huge pottery storage jar, some donated by Sir [[Arthur Evans]], Crete, Greece, (1900\u20131100 BC)\n*The Minoan gold treasure from [[Aegina Treasure|Aegina]], northern Aegean, Greece, (1850\u20131550 BC)\n*Segments of the columns and architraves from the [[Treasury of Atreus]], Peloponnese, Greece, (1350\u20131250 BC)\n*[[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Elgin]] Amphora, highly decorated pottery vase attributed to the [[Dipylon Master]], Athens, Greece, (8th century BC)\n*[[Bronze Statuette of Athletic Spartan Girl]]\n\n'''Etruscan (8th century BC \u2013 1st century BC)'''\n*Some of the artefacts from the Castellani Tomb in [[Palestrina]], central Italy, (8th\u20136th century BC)\n*Contents of the [[Isis Tomb, Vulci]], (570\u2013560 BC)\n*Painted terracotta plaques (the so-called ''Boccanera Plaques'') from a tomb in [[Cerveteri]], (560\u2013550 BC)\n*[[Oscan Tablet]], one of the most important inscriptions in the Oscan language, (300\u2013100 BC)\n*[[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]] from Chiusi, (150\u2013140 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Greece (8th century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Group of life-size [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] statues from the Sacred Way at [[Didyma]], western Turkey, (600\u2013580 BC)\n*[[Priene Inscription|Dedicatory Inscription by Alexander the Great]] from Priene in Turkey (330 BC)\n*Head from the colossal statue of the [[Asclepius of Milos]], Greece, (325\u2013300 BC)\n*Bronze sculpture of a Greek poet known as the [[Arundel Head]], western Turkey, (2nd\u20131st centuries BC)\n*Remains of the [[Scylla]] monument at [[Bargylia]], south west Anatolia, Turkey, (200\u2013150 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Rome (1st century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Cameo glass [[Portland Vase]], the most famous glass vessel from ancient Rome, (1\u201325 AD)\n*Silver [[Warren Cup]] with homoerotic scenes, found near Jerusalem, (5\u201315 AD)\n*[[Discobolus|Discus-thrower (Discobolos)]]<ref>Tony Kitto, \"The celebrated connoisseur: Charles Townley, 1737\u20131805\" ''Minerva Magazine'' May/June 2005, in connection with a British Museum exhibition celebrating the bicentennial of the Townley purchase.

A collection of immense importance, the holdings of [[Assyrian sculpture]], [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumer]]ian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] from [[Nimrud]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Khorsabad]].\n\nThe collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], parts of Central Asia, [[Syria]], the [[Holy Land]] and [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]] and include objects from the beginning of [[Islam]] in the 7th century.\n\nThe first significant addition of [[Mesopotamian]] objects was from the collection of [[Claudius James Rich]] in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of [[Austen Henry Layard|A. H. Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n sites of [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]] between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]], as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of [[Lamassu]]'s, palace reliefs, [[Stele|stelae]], including the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]], were brought to the British Museum.\n[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 14 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's & Full Projection.3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Room 6 \u2013 Pair of [[Lamassu|Human Headed Winged Lions]] and reliefs from [[Nimrud]] with the [[Balawat Gates]], c. 860 BC]]\n\n[[File:London 307.JPG|thumb|Room 52 \u2013 Ancient Iran with the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], considered to be the world's first charter of [[human rights]], 559\u2013530 BC]]\nLayard's work was continued by his assistant, [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and in 1852\u20131854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' and [[Lachish relief]]s. He also discovered the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]], a large collection of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. [[William Loftus|W. K. Loftus]] excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of [[Nimrud ivories|ivories]] in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] from [[Babylon]], the bronze gates from [[Balawat]], important objects from [[Sippar]], and a fine collection of [[Urartu|Urartian]] bronzes from [[Toprakkale]].\n\nIn the early 20th century excavations were carried out at [[Carchemish]], [[Turkey]] by [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] and [[Leonard Woolley]], the latter assisted by [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern [[Iraq]] after the [[First World War]]. From [[Ubaid period|Tell al-Ubaid]] came the bronze furnishings of a [[Sumer]]ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] in 1919\u201324. Woolley went on to excavate [[Ur]] between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '[[Standard of Ur]]', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '[[Royal Game of Ur]]', and two bull-headed [[lyres]]. The department also has three [[diorite]] statues of the ruler [[Statues of Gudea|Gudea]] from the ancient state of [[Lagash]] and a series of limestone [[kudurru]] or boundary stones from different locations across ancient [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nAlthough the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The [[Achaemenid]] collection was enhanced with the addition of the [[Oxus Treasure]] in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and the Hungarian-British explorer [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of [[Persepolis]] were donated by Sir [[Gore Ouseley]] in 1825 and the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen|5th Earl of Aberdeen]] in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid [[Household silver|silverware]] in the world. The later [[Sasanian Empire]] is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the [[Tharros]] collection from [[Sardinia]] and the large number of Phoenician stelae from [[Carthage]] are outstanding. Another often overlooked highlight is [[Ancient history of Yemen|Yemeni]] antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of [[Dilmun]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of [[A'ali]] and [[Shakhura]] in Bahrain.\n\nFrom the modern state of [[Syria]] come almost forty funerary busts from [[Palmyra]] and a group of stone [[reliefs]] from the excavations of [[Max von Oppenheim]] at [[Tell Halaf]] that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of [[Max Mallowan]] at [[Chagar Bazar]] and [[Tell Brak]] in 1935\u20131938 and from Woolley at [[Alalakh]] in the years just before and after the [[Second World War]]. Mallowan returned with his wife [[Agatha Christie]] to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many [[Nimrud Ivories|important artefacts]] for the museum. The collection of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] material was strengthened by the work of [[Kathleen Kenyon]] at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (Jericho) in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at [[Lachish]] by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932\u20131938.  Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as [[:de:Tell es-Sa'idiyeh|Tell es Sa'idiyeh]] in Jordan.\n\nThe museum's collection of [[Islamic art]], including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pm_partner.php?id=Mus01;uk&type=museum&theme=ISL&|title=Museum With No Frontiers| publisher=Discover Islamic Art| accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from [[Spain]] in the west to [[India]] in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of [[\u0130znik pottery|Iznik]] ceramics (the largest in the world), a highlight of which is the mosque lamp from the [[Dome of the Rock]], mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the [[Zodiac]], a fine selection of [[astrolabes]], and [[Mughal paintings]] and precious artwork including a large [[Jade Terrapin from Allahabad|jade terrapin]] made for the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as [[Siraf]] by [[David Whitehouse]] and [[Alamut Castle]] by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the [[Frederick DuCane Godman|Godman]] bequest of Iznik, [[Hispano-Moresque]] and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.\n\nA representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the [[Middle East]]. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite web

It ranks as one of the largest and best [[print room]] collections in existence alongside the [[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina]] in Vienna, the Paris collections and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]. The holdings are easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many such collections.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/facilities_and_services/study_room.aspx |title=Study room page |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> The department also has its own exhibition gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several times a year.<ref name=bmgal>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/galleries.aspx |title=Prints and Drawings galleries |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nSince its foundation in 1808, the prints and drawings collection has grown to international renown as one of the richest and most representative collections in the world. There are approximately 50,000 drawings and over two million prints.<ref name=bmgal/> The collection of drawings covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the [[Western art history|European schools]]. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine [[printmaking]] from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century. Key benefactors to the department have been [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]], [[Richard Payne Knight]], John Malcolm, [[Campbell Dodgson]], C\u00e9sar Mange de Hauke and [[Tom\u00e1s Harris]].\n\nThere are groups of drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], (including [[Epifania (Michelangelo drawing)|his only surviving full-scale cartoon]]), [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (99 [[engraving]]s, 6 [[etching]]s and most of his 346 [[woodcut]]s), Rembrandt and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]. More than 30,000 British drawings and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] include important examples of work by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Paul Sandby|Sandby]], [[J. M. W.

There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by [[William Blake]] and [[Thomas Bewick]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The great eleven volume [[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum]] compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints.

It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as [[Prehistoric]] and neolithic objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods throughout the world, as well as from the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron age]] in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]], and [[Gertrude Caton\u2013Thompson]]. Paleolithic objects from the [[William Allen Sturge|Sturge]], [[Henry Christy|Christy]] and [[\u00c9douard Lartet|Lartet]] collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as [[William Greenwell|Greenwell]] in Britain, [[Thomas Tobin|Tobin]] and Cooke in Ireland, [[William Collings Lukis|Lukis]] and de la Granci\u00e8re in Brittany, [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae|Worsaae]] in Denmark, [[Luis Siret|Siret]] at [[El Argar]] in Spain, and [[Gustav Klemm|Klemm]] and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from [[Hallstatt]] were acquired as a result of the [[Sir John Evans|Evans]]/[[Sir John Lubbock|Lubbock]] excavations and from [[Giubiasco]] in [[Ticino]] through the [[Swiss National Museum]].\n\nIn addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the [[Black Sea]] and from North Africa to [[Scandinavia]]; a representative selection of these has recently been redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections include [[Latvia]]n, [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Gotland]]ic and [[Merovingian]] material from [[Johann Karl B\u00e4hr]], Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period are the magnificent items from the [[Sutton Hoo]] royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner [[Edith Pretty]]. The department includes the national collection of [[horology]] with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the [[Octavius Morgan|Morgan]] and [[Courtenay Adrian Ilbert|Ilbert]] collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of [[Romano-British]] objects \u2013 the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside [[Italy]]. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in [[East Anglia]], the most important of which is the [[Mildenhall Treasure]]. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian [[Charles Roach Smith]] in 1856.  These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection.\n\nObjects from the Department of Prehistory and Europe are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in its [[archive]] facilities, where it is available for [[research]] and study.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n'''Stone Age (c. 3.4 million years BC \u2013 c. 2000 BC)'''\n*[[Palaeolithic]] material from across Africa, particularly [[Olduvai Gorge|Olduvai]], [[Kalambo Falls]], [[Olorgesailie]] and [[Cape Flats]], (1.8 million BC onwards)\n*One of

Percival David, 2nd Baronet|Percival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics]]\nThe scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad; its collections of over 75,000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian continent (from East, South, Central and South-East Asia) and from the Neolithic up to the present day. Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the [[British Empire]], especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as [[Hindu Stuart|Charles Stuart]], [[James Prinsep]], [[Charles Masson]], Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], Sir [[Harold Arthur Deane|Harold Deane]] and Sir [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]]. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker [[George Eumorfopoulos]] in the 1930s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the [[philanthropist]] PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.<ref>{{cite web|author=Babs.Guthrie|url=http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|title=Collection page|publisher=Untold London|accessdate=4 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921153753/http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|archivedate=21 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|title=Embassy of Japan in the UK|publisher=Japan Embassy|accessdate=4 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427102637/http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|archive-date=27 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia.aspx |title=Department of Asia|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and [[hunter-gatherers]], many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] (much assembled by the British naval officer [[Maurice Vidal Portman|Maurice Portman]]), Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator [[Hugh Nevill]]), Northern Thailand, south-west China, the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist [[John Anderson (zoologist)|John Anderson]]), Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the [[Sarawak]] collection put together by Dr [[Charles Hose]], as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a [[gamelan]] musical set, was assembled by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]].\n\nThe principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33 with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asian objects. An adjacent gallery showcases the Amaravati sculptures and monuments. Other galleries on the upper floors are devoted to its Japanese, Korean, painting and [[calligraphy]], and Chinese ceramics collections.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/departments_all_relationships.aspx?Title=Asia&ContentType=Department&PageId=551 |title=Department of Asia \u2013 Related Highlight Objects |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n*The most comprehensive collection of sculpture from the Indian subcontinent in the world, including the celebrated [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] limestone reliefs from [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]] excavated by Sir [[Walter Elliot (Scottish naturalist)|Walter Elliot]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/galleries/asia/room_33a_amaravati.aspx |title=Room 33a: Amaravati |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n*An outstanding collection of Chinese antiquities, paintings, and porcelain, lacquer, bronze, jade, and other applied arts\n*The most comprehensive collection of [[Japanese art|Japanese pre-20th century art]] in the Western world, many of which originally belonged to the surgeon [[William Anderson (collector)|William Anderson]] and diplomat [[Ernest Mason Satow]]\n\n'''East Asia'''\n*A large collection of [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], (from c. 1500 BC onwards)\n*[[Huixian Bronze Hu]], an identical pair of bronze vessels from the [[Zhou dynasty|Eastern Zhou period]], China, (5th century BC)\n*Japanese antiquities from the [[Kofun period]] excavated by the pioneering archaeologist [[William Gowland]], (3rd\u20136th centuries AD)\n*The famous [[Admonitions Scroll]] by Chinese artist [[Gu Kaizhi]], (344\u2013406 AD)\n*The colossal [[Amit\u0101bha Buddha from Hancui]], China, (585 AD)\n*A set of ceramic [[Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun]], (c.728 AD)\n*[[Seated Luohan from Yixian]], one from a set of eight surviving statues, China, (907\u20131125 AD)\n*A fine assemblage of Buddhist paintings from [[Dunhuang]], western China, collected by the British-Hungarian explorer [[Aurel Stein]], (5th\u201311th centuries AD)\n*[[Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art|Pericival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics, (10th\u201318th centuries AD)\n*Ivory stand in the form of a seated lion, Chos-'khor-yan-rtse monastery in [[Tibet]], (13th century AD)\n*Pair of ceramic [[Kakiemon elephants]] from Japan, (17th century AD)\n*Japanese prints including [[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]], (1829\u201332)\n\n'''South Asia'''\n*Excavated objects from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] sites of [[Mohenjo-daro]], and [[Harappa]], [[Ancient India]] (now in [[Pakistan]]), (2500\u20132000 BC)\n*Sandstone fragment of a [[Pillars of Ashoka|Pillar of Ashoka]] with [[Brahmi]] inscription from [[Meerut]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], (238 BC)\n*The [[Kulu Vase]] found near a monastery in [[Himachal Pradesh]], one of the earliest examples of figurative art from the sub-continent, northern India, (1st century BC)\n*[[Taxila copper plate|Copper plate]] from [[Taxila]], with important Kharoshthi inscription, [[Ancient India]](now in [[Pakistan]]), (1st century BC \u2013 1st century AD)\n*Indo-Scythian sandstone [[Mathura lion capital|Mathura Lion Capital]] and [[Sanchi Yakshi Figure|Bracket figure]] from one of the gateways to the Great Stupa at [[Sanchi]], central India, (1st century AD)\n*[[Bimaran casket|Bimaran Casket]] and [[Wardak Vase]], reliquaries from ancient stupas in Afghanistan, (1st\u20132nd centuries AD)\n*Relic deposits from the stupas at [[Manikyala]], [[Ahin Posh]], [[Sanchi]] and [[Gudivada]], (1st\u20133rd centuries AD)\n*[[Seated Buddha from Gandhara]], and other Gandhara objects from [[Kafir Kot]], [[Jamal Garhi]] and [[Takht-i-Bahi]], [[Pakistan]], (1st\u20133rd centuries AD)\n*The [[Buddhapad Hoard]] of bronze images from southern India, (6th\u20138th centuries AD)\n*Stone statue of Buddha from the [[Sultanganj Buddha|Sultanganj]] hoard, Bihar, eastern India.

Over 350,000 objects<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/departments/africa,_oceania_and_americas.aspx |title=Africa, Oceania and the Americas |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> spanning thousands of years tells the history of mankind from three major continents and many rich and diverse cultures; the collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing. Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by [[Henry Christy]], [[Harry Geoffrey Beasley|Harry Beasley]] and [[William Ockelford Oldman|William Oldman]] are outstanding. Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays [[ethnographic]] from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on [[North America]] and [[Mexico]]. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.\n\n'''Africa'''\n[[File:African_throwing_knives.jpg|thumb|left|Room 25 \u2013 Collection of African [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]]]]\nThe Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. Highlights of the African collection include objects found at [[Senegambian stone circles|megalithic circles]] in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in west Africa, the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from [[Ife]], a similar [[terracotta]] head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, an [[Ikom monoliths|Ikom monolith]] from [[Cross River State]], the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the [[Kuba Kingdom]] including three [[Ndop (Kuba)|royal figures]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from [[Gondar]] and [[Amba Mariam|Magdala]], Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] (that includes a unique soapstone, [[anthropomorphic]] figure) and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].\n\n'''Oceania'''\n\nThe British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the [[Pacific Ocean]], stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]] \u2013 Aboriginal art from [[Australia]] is considered separately in its own right.  Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped [[pestle]] and a group of stone [[Pestle and mortar|mortars]] from [[Papua New Guinea]]. The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of [[James Cook|Cook]]'s and [[George Vancouver|Vancouver]]'s expeditions or by colonial administrators such as Sir [[George Grey]], Sir [[Frederick Broome]] and [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Gordon]], before Western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures. A poignant artefact is the wooden [[Gweagal#The_Gweagal_Spears_and_Shield|shield]] found near [[Botany Bay]] during Cook's first voyage in 1770. The [[Henry Wilson (sailor)|Wilson]] cabinet of curiosities from [[Palau]] is another example of pre-contact ware. The department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering [[anthropology|anthropologists]] such as [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] and [[Katherine Routledge]].\n\nIn addition, the [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]] collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many intricately carved wooden and [[Hei-tiki|jade objects]] and the [[Aboriginal art]] collection is distinguished by its wide range of [[bark paintings]], including two very early bark etchings collected by [[John Hunter Kerr]]. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1911, that includes the unique [[statue of A'a from Rurutu]] Island, the rare [[Mangareva Statue|idol]] from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook Islands [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|deity figure]].  Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue of [[K\u016b|K\u016b-ka-ili-moku]] or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and the famous Easter Island statues [[Hoa Hakananai'a]] and [[Relocation of moai objects|Moai Hava]].\n\n'''Americas'''\nThe Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Taino]] and other early cultures are well represented. The [[Kayung totem pole]], which was made in the late nineteenth century in the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide-ranging collections that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the [[Inuit]] population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia.

The collection spans the entire history of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day and is representative of both the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. The Department of Coins and Medals was created in 1861 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2011.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/research_publications_series/2011/the_future_of_UK_numismatics.aspx ''The British Museum and the Future of UK Numismatics.

[[Conservation (cultural heritage)|Conservation]] has six specialist areas: ceramics & glass; metals; organic material (including textiles); stone, wall paintings and mosaics; Eastern pictorial art and Western pictorial art. The science department<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/science/index.html|title=British Museum \u2013 Conservation and Scientific Research|work=thebritishmuseum.ac.uk}}</ref> has and continues to develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department also publishes its findings and discoveries.\n\n===Libraries and archives===\nThis department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors, schools, degree level and beyond. The museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted by the public on application.  The [[Anthropology]] Library is especially large, with 120,000 volumes.<ref>See the \"Facilities and Services\" tab on the home page for each department for details on each library; not all are kept at Bloomsbury.

Parthenon Marbles claimed by Greece were also claimed by UNESCO among others for restitution.
