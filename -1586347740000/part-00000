Its name was changed to '''''The Ted Knight Show''''' when the show was retooled for what would turn out to be its final season.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Ted Knight]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] star as Henry and Muriel Rush, respectively; owners of a two-family house in [[San Francisco, California]]. Henry is a conservative cartoonist who authors a comic strip called ''Cosmic Cow.'' During scenes in which Henry draws in his bedroom, Knight used his earlier acquired ventriloquism talents for comical conversations with a hand-puppet version of \"Cosmic Cow.\" Muriel is a laid back freelance photographer, having been a lead singer of a band in her earlier days. They have two grown children, older daughter, brunette Jackie ([[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]]) who works for a bank and younger daughter Sara ([[Lydia Cornell]]), a blonde bombshell and a college student at [[San Francisco State University]].\n\nAt the start of the premiere episode, Jackie and Sara are living with their parents in a cramped, awkward arrangement. Their longtime downstairs tenant, Myron (later called Neville) Rafkin, recently died. The family discovers Rafkin was a [[transvestism|transvestite]] and the many strange women Henry had been opening the door for all those years were actually Rafkin himself. Jackie and Sara convince their parents to allow them to move into the now-vacant downstairs apartment. In a running gag, Henry falls off the girls' ultra-modern chairs or couch every time he attempts to sit down. Despite the daughters' push for independence and moving into the downstairs apartment, Henry proves to be a very protective father and constantly meddles in their affairs.\n\nDue to an actors' strike led by the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]], new programming for the fall 1980 season was pushed back several months. As a result, ''Too Close for Comfort'' did not debut until November 11, 1980, and its initial season consisted of 19 episodes. The show garnered high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], benefiting from its placement in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] powerhouse Tuesday night lineup following hits like ''[[Happy Days]],'' ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Three's Company]].''  Both the latter series and this series were recorded in the same studio, [[CBS Television City]] in [[Los Angeles]], during ''Too Close for Comfort'''s ABC years.\n\nA few episodes into the series, Sara's addle-headed friend Monroe Ficus, played by actor [[Jim J. Bullock]], made an appearance. Although he was originally intended to be used for only a single episode, producers added the character to the series.  Monroe was introduced to Henry by Sara as a depressed, lonely fellow student and street musician.  Although Sara (with help from Jackie) tried to help him and send him on his way, Monroe found himself getting woven into the entire family's affairs and he became just a \"friend\" of Sara's and Henry's principal (if unintended) foil. During the first two seasons, [[Selma Diamond]] made guest appearances as Mildred Rafkin, sister of the late Myron. Sardonic, deadpan Mildred initially showed up to collect belongings left by Myron/Neville in the downstairs apartment, but continued to visit thereafter. Seemingly, there were sentimental reasons, but occasionally she would attempt to make time with the much younger Monroe, with whom she was infatuated.\n\nAlso added in early 1981 was Arthur Wainwright ([[Hamilton Camp]]), Henry's boss and head of Wainwright Publishing, who nearly decided to force the veteran cartoonist and ''Cosmic Cow'' into retirement in order to maintain a youth-oriented staff. The short-statured Mr. Wainwright, who spoke with [[Shakespearean]] diction and fancied himself an amateur detective (as a result of the famous mystery novels his company published), eventually let Henry stay with the firm, after the latter proved adept in helping him solve the mystery of Sara's stolen purse. Wainwright no longer appeared in person after the first season, but was referred to. Later, at the start of the fifth season, [[Graham Jarvis]] began appearing as Wainwright in a few guest appearances.\n\n===Developments in seasons two and three===\n[[Image:Too Close for Comfort.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The cast of ''Too Close for Comfort'' during the show's second season]]\nDuring its second season, the series' principal stories are focused around Muriel's pregnancy. Additionally, Henry's niece April ([[Deena Freeman]]) comes from [[Delaware]] to live with the Rush family. The season concludes with Muriel giving birth to a son, Andrew (later played regularly by twins William and Michael Cannon from 1983 to 1984).\n\nFor the third season, April departs and the character of Muriel's mother, Iris Martin ([[Audrey Meadows]]) is added in order to help take care of Andrew. Also that fall, Jackie becomes engaged to her steady boyfriend, police officer Brad Turner (played by [[Gary Dontzig]] in one episode and by Jordan Suffin thereafter), but they broke it off after a short time. Jackie eventually moved into the field of fashion design, taking courses and producing her own clothing templates, which she later had produced as \"The Jacqueline Rush Collection.\" Sara, meanwhile, decided to major in communications and, while continuing her studies, became a weather girl for a time at a major San Francisco TV station. Monroe seemed to be detached from Sara's circle of friends, but was taking the same major as her and became a security guard around campus.\n\nThe character of Henry Rush became famous for wearing sweatshirts from various American colleges and universities. It was revealed in one episode that he wore the different sweatshirts because he himself had never gone to college. Eventually fans would send in sweatshirts from universities around the country hoping they would be used during taping.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, ABC moved the series to Thursday nights, which proved to be disastrous. Paired with failures such as ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]],'' ''[[Star of the Family]]'' and ''[[It Takes Two (1982 TV series)|It Takes Two]],'' ''Too Close For Comfort'' saw its ratings fall drastically. At the conclusion of the season, the network cancelled the series, after dropping from #6 the previous season to #38. ABC broadcast the last first-run episode broadcast on May 5, 1983, as a pilot for a proposed [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series called ''Family Business''. The series was to have focused on the misadventures of Lucille Garabaldi ([[Lainie Kazan]]) and her two sons (played by [[George Deloy]] and [[Jimmy Baio]]) as they tried to run a construction business. [[Hillary Bailey Smith]] was also featured in this backdoor pilot as the new, attractive female foreman that Lucille hired for her sons.\n\nABC aired reruns of ''Too Close for Comfort'' at 11:00 am ET from June 27 to September 23, 1983.\n\n===First-run syndication===\nDuring the early 1980s, TV station owner [[Metromedia]] was expanding its portfolio of original [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming through its production subsidiary, Metromedia Producers Corporation. Its efforts would eventually lead to the creation of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. When ''Too Close for Comfort'' was canceled by ABC, Metromedia Producers Corporation elected to pick up the series and began producing all-new episodes to run on various stations throughout the country.\n\nStarting in April 1984, a total of 23 new episodes were broadcast for the show's fourth season, featuring the same cast as seen on the ABC episodes. Monroe and Iris were still around to bother Henry (although Meadows had cut back her involvement to guest shots only, so her character moves back to Chicago in the season premiere) and Jackie and Sara were still downstairs. The girls continued to advance in the respective career paths; Sara auditioned for a news anchor position at the TV station, but was passed over in favor of a female candidate who may have not had Sara's looks, but had greater experience in hard news. This caused Sara to learn the valuable lesson that her sex appeal alone would not get her everywhere. Monroe eventually moves into a remodeled attic, with the entrance from the Rushes' kitchen. Henry agreed to have Monroe as a tenant in a fleeting moment of compassion, but Monroe still proved to be a constant annoyance to him.\n\nThe show's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] improved in syndication and Metromedia ordered an additional 30 episodes, airing through November 1985. When the fifth season began, a single child actor, Joshua Goodwin, took over the role of Andrew Rush (which he would hold for the remainder of the series). Henry was now working out of his own fancy office at Wainwright Publishing, as a result of toddler Andrew's \"[[Child development stage|terrible twos]]\" behavior interfering with his concentration at home. Everyone else's worldly or, in the case of Monroe, wacky affairs were also proving to be an intense distraction, considering they were all living under the same roof. Near the end of the season, Jackie accepted a job offer in Italy that would help further her clothing line, with her family and friends giving her a big send-off. With a total of 107 episodes of ''Too Close for Comfort'' having been produced, the show became a popular staple for syndicated reruns throughout the late 1980s.\n\n====''The Ted Knight Show''====\n[[Image:Too_Close_For_Comfort_6th_Season_original.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The sixth season title screen for first run episodes. Note the title change.]]\n[[Image:Too_Close_For_Comfort_6th_Season_retitle.jpg|right|150px|thumb|The sixth season title screen for reruns.]]\nIn late 1985, several changes were made before further episodes were produced. The show's title was changed to ''The Ted Knight Show'' (not to be confused with the short-lived 1978 [[CBS]] [[The Ted Knight Show (1978 TV series)|show of the same name]]; hence it was occasionally referred to as ''The New Ted Knight Show'', such as when Jim J. Bullock made a guest appearance on ''[[Break the Bank (1985 game show)|Break the Bank]]'') and the setting was changed to [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], north of San Francisco. A new arrangement of Johnny Mandel's theme song was recorded, and a new opening title sequence was shot in the surrounding area. Deborah Van Valkenburgh, Lydia Cornell, and Audrey Meadows left the cast (Meadows would make one guest appearance this season). Veteran actress [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]], as well as Lisa Antille were added to the cast along with returning Nancy Dussault, and Jim J. Bullock.\n\nThe Rushes had moved to a larger house near [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]]. Henry retired from cartooning and became editor of the ''Marin Bugler'', a local newspaper. Henry purchased a 49% stake in the publication from Hope Stinson (Carroll), who retained the other 51% and proved to be a thorn in his side. Muriel began working as the paper's staff photographer. Monroe, now living in his own apartment, visited frequently, and worked as a reporter-in-training at the ''Bugler''. The Rushes hired a live-in nanny/housekeeper, a young woman named Lisa Flores (Antille), who would later become involved with Monroe. Antille had made a guest appearance in a fifth season ''Too Close for Comfort'' episode as Yvonne, a housekeeper the Rushes employed until she attempted to marry Monroe to avoid deportation.\n\nFirst-run episodes of ''The Ted Knight Show'' were broadcast starting in April 1986. Twenty-two episodes were produced prior to the summer of 1986 and twelve had aired by mid-July. The revamped show continued to be successful and was scheduled to resume production for another season but Ted Knight, who had been battling [[colon cancer]] since 1985, died on August 26, 1986 at the age of 62 and no further episodes would be produced. The ten remaining first-run episodes were broadcast from September 1986 to February 1987.\n\nWhen the episodes of ''The Ted Knight Show'' were added to the rerun package of ''Too Close for Comfort'', the original show's title graphic was used, but the updated opening theme and sequence remained unchanged.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.facebook.com/PaulsPublicPage/photos/a.488682837895701.1073741838.218281291602525/638643852899598/| title=Miscellaneous - Paul's Public Page| website=Facebook|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.facebook.com/PaulsPublicPage/photos/a.488682837895701.1073741838.218281291602525/638643856232931/| title=Miscellaneous - Paul's Public Page| website=Facebook|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ted Knight]] as Henry Rush\n* [[Nancy Dussault]] as Muriel Rush\n* [[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]] as Jackie Rush (1980-1985)\n* [[Lydia Cornell]] as Sara Rush (1980-1985)\n* [[Jim J.

Its name was changed to '''''The Ted Knight Show''''' when the show was retooled for what would turn out to be its final season.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Ted Knight]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] star as Henry and Muriel Rush, respectively; owners of a two-family house in [[San Francisco, California]]. Henry is a conservative cartoonist who authors a comic strip called ''Cosmic Cow.'' During scenes in which Henry draws in his bedroom, Knight used his earlier acquired ventriloquism talents for comical conversations with a hand-puppet version of \"Cosmic Cow.\" Muriel is a laid back freelance photographer, having been a lead singer of a band in her earlier days. They have two grown children, older daughter, brunette Jackie ([[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]]) who works for a bank and younger daughter Sara ([[Lydia Cornell]]), a blonde bombshell and a college student at [[San Francisco State University]].\n\nAt the start of the premiere episode, Jackie and Sara are living with their parents in a cramped, awkward arrangement. Their longtime downstairs tenant, Myron (later called Neville) Rafkin, recently died. The family discovers Rafkin was a [[transvestism|transvestite]] and the many strange women Henry had been opening the door for all those years were actually Rafkin himself. Jackie and Sara convince their parents to allow them to move into the now-vacant downstairs apartment. In a running gag, Henry falls off the girls' ultra-modern chairs or couch every time he attempts to sit down. Despite the daughters' push for independence and moving into the downstairs apartment, Henry proves to be a very protective father and constantly meddles in their affairs.\n\nDue to an actors' strike led by the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]], new programming for the fall 1980 season was pushed back several months. As a result, ''Too Close for Comfort'' did not debut until November 11, 1980, and its initial season consisted of 19 episodes. The show garnered high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], benefiting from its placement in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] powerhouse Tuesday night lineup following hits like ''[[Happy Days]],'' ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Three's Company]].''  Both the latter series and this series were recorded in the same studio, [[CBS Television City]] in [[Los Angeles]], during ''Too Close for Comfort'''s ABC years.\n\nA few episodes into the series, Sara's addle-headed friend Monroe Ficus, played by actor [[Jim J. Bullock]], made an appearance. Although he was originally intended to be used for only a single episode, producers added the character to the series.  Monroe was introduced to Henry by Sara as a depressed, lonely fellow student and street musician.  Although Sara (with help from Jackie) tried to help him and send him on his way, Monroe found himself getting woven into the entire family's affairs and he became just a \"friend\" of Sara's and Henry's principal (if unintended) foil. During the first two seasons, [[Selma Diamond]] made guest appearances as Mildred Rafkin, sister of the late Myron. Sardonic, deadpan Mildred initially showed up to collect belongings left by Myron/Neville in the downstairs apartment, but continued to visit thereafter. Seemingly, there were sentimental reasons, but occasionally she would attempt to make time with the much younger Monroe, with whom she was infatuated.\n\nAlso added in early 1981 was Arthur Wainwright ([[Hamilton Camp]]), Henry's boss and head of Wainwright Publishing, who nearly decided to force the veteran cartoonist and ''Cosmic Cow'' into retirement in order to maintain a youth-oriented staff. The short-statured Mr. Wainwright, who spoke with [[Shakespearean]] diction and fancied himself an amateur detective (as a result of the famous mystery novels his company published), eventually let Henry stay with the firm, after the latter proved adept in helping him solve the mystery of Sara's stolen purse. Wainwright no longer appeared in person after the first season, but was referred to. Later, at the start of the fifth season, [[Graham Jarvis]] began appearing as Wainwright in a few guest appearances.\n\n===Developments in seasons two and three===\n[[Image:Too Close for Comfort.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The cast of ''Too Close for Comfort'' during the show's second season]]\nDuring its second season, the series' principal stories are focused around Muriel's pregnancy. Additionally, Henry's niece April ([[Deena Freeman]]) comes from [[Delaware]] to live with the Rush family. The season concludes with Muriel giving birth to a son, Andrew (later played regularly by twins William and Michael Cannon from 1983 to 1984).\n\nFor the third season, April departs and the character of Muriel's mother, Iris Martin ([[Audrey Meadows]]) is added in order to help take care of Andrew. Also that fall, Jackie becomes engaged to her steady boyfriend, police officer Brad Turner (played by [[Gary Dontzig]] in one episode and by Jordan Suffin thereafter), but they broke it off after a short time. Jackie eventually moved into the field of fashion design, taking courses and producing her own clothing templates, which she later had produced as \"The Jacqueline Rush Collection.\" Sara, meanwhile, decided to major in communications and, while continuing her studies, became a weather girl for a time at a major San Francisco TV station. Monroe seemed to be detached from Sara's circle of friends, but was taking the same major as her and became a security guard around campus.\n\nThe character of Henry Rush became famous for wearing sweatshirts from various American colleges and universities. It was revealed in one episode that he wore the different sweatshirts because he himself had never gone to college. Eventually fans would send in sweatshirts from universities around the country hoping they would be used during taping.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, ABC moved the series to Thursday nights, which proved to be disastrous. Paired with failures such as ''[[Joanie Loves Chachi]],'' ''[[Star of the Family]]'' and ''[[It Takes Two (1982 TV series)|It Takes Two]],'' ''Too Close For Comfort'' saw its ratings fall drastically. At the conclusion of the season, the network cancelled the series, after dropping from #6 the previous season to #38. ABC broadcast the last first-run episode broadcast on May 5, 1983, as a pilot for a proposed [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series called ''Family Business''. The series was to have focused on the misadventures of Lucille Garabaldi ([[Lainie Kazan]]) and her two sons (played by [[George Deloy]] and [[Jimmy Baio]]) as they tried to run a construction business. [[Hillary Bailey Smith]] was also featured in this backdoor pilot as the new, attractive female foreman that Lucille hired for her sons.\n\nABC aired reruns of ''Too Close for Comfort'' at 11:00 am ET from June 27 to September 23, 1983.\n\n===First-run syndication===\nDuring the early 1980s, TV station owner [[Metromedia]] was expanding its portfolio of original [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming through its production subsidiary, Metromedia Producers Corporation. Its efforts would eventually lead to the creation of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. When ''Too Close for Comfort'' was canceled by ABC, Metromedia Producers Corporation elected to pick up the series and began producing all-new episodes to run on various stations throughout the country.\n\nStarting in April 1984, a total of 23 new episodes were broadcast for the show's fourth season, featuring the same cast as seen on the ABC episodes. Monroe and Iris were still around to bother Henry (although Meadows had cut back her involvement to guest shots only, so her character moves back to Chicago in the season premiere) and Jackie and Sara were still downstairs. The girls continued to advance in the respective career paths; Sara auditioned for a news anchor position at the TV station, but was passed over in favor of a female candidate who may have not had Sara's looks, but had greater experience in hard news. This caused Sara to learn the valuable lesson that her sex appeal alone would not get her everywhere. Monroe eventually moves into a remodeled attic, with the entrance from the Rushes' kitchen. Henry agreed to have Monroe as a tenant in a fleeting moment of compassion, but Monroe still proved to be a constant annoyance to him.\n\nThe show's [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] improved in syndication and Metromedia ordered an additional 30 episodes, airing through November 1985. When the fifth season began, a single child actor, Joshua Goodwin, took over the role of Andrew Rush (which he would hold for the remainder of the series). Henry was now working out of his own fancy office at Wainwright Publishing, as a result of toddler Andrew's \"[[Child development stage|terrible twos]]\" behavior interfering with his concentration at home. Everyone else's worldly or, in the case of Monroe, wacky affairs were also proving to be an intense distraction, considering they were all living under the same roof. Near the end of the season, Jackie accepted a job offer in Italy that would help further her clothing line, with her family and friends giving her a big send-off. With a total of 107 episodes of ''Too Close for Comfort'' having been produced, the show became a popular staple for syndicated reruns throughout the late 1980s.\n\n====''The Ted Knight Show''====\n[[Image:Too_Close_For_Comfort_6th_Season_original.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The sixth season title screen for first run episodes. Note the title change.]]\n[[Image:Too_Close_For_Comfort_6th_Season_retitle.jpg|right|150px|thumb|The sixth season title screen for reruns.]]\nIn late 1985, several changes were made before further episodes were produced. The show's title was changed to ''The Ted Knight Show'' (not to be confused with the short-lived 1978 [[CBS]] [[The Ted Knight Show (1978 TV series)|show of the same name]]; hence it was occasionally referred to as ''The New Ted Knight Show'', such as when Jim J. Bullock made a guest appearance on ''[[Break the Bank (1985 game show)|Break the Bank]]'') and the setting was changed to [[Marin County, California|Marin County]], north of San Francisco. A new arrangement of Johnny Mandel's theme song was recorded, and a new opening title sequence was shot in the surrounding area. Deborah Van Valkenburgh, Lydia Cornell, and Audrey Meadows left the cast (Meadows would make one guest appearance this season). Veteran actress [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]], as well as Lisa Antille were added to the cast along with returning Nancy Dussault, and Jim J. Bullock.\n\nThe Rushes had moved to a larger house near [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]]. Henry retired from cartooning and became editor of the ''Marin Bugler'', a local newspaper. Henry purchased a 49% stake in the publication from Hope Stinson (Carroll), who retained the other 51% and proved to be a thorn in his side. Muriel began working as the paper's staff photographer. Monroe, now living in his own apartment, visited frequently, and worked as a reporter-in-training at the ''Bugler''. The Rushes hired a live-in nanny/housekeeper, a young woman named Lisa Flores (Antille), who would later become involved with Monroe. Antille had made a guest appearance in a fifth season ''Too Close for Comfort'' episode as Yvonne, a housekeeper the Rushes employed until she attempted to marry Monroe to avoid deportation.\n\nFirst-run episodes of ''The Ted Knight Show'' were broadcast starting in April 1986. Twenty-two episodes were produced prior to the summer of 1986 and twelve had aired by mid-July. The revamped show continued to be successful and was scheduled to resume production for another season but Ted Knight, who had been battling [[colon cancer]] since 1985, died on August 26, 1986 at the age of 62 and no further episodes would be produced. The ten remaining first-run episodes were broadcast from September 1986 to February 1987.\n\nWhen the episodes of ''The Ted Knight Show'' were added to the rerun package of ''Too Close for Comfort'', the original show's title graphic was used, but the updated opening theme and sequence remained unchanged.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.facebook.com/PaulsPublicPage/photos/a.488682837895701.1073741838.218281291602525/638643852899598/| title=Miscellaneous - Paul's Public Page| website=Facebook|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.facebook.com/PaulsPublicPage/photos/a.488682837895701.1073741838.218281291602525/638643856232931/| title=Miscellaneous - Paul's Public Page| website=Facebook|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ted Knight]] as Henry Rush\n* [[Nancy Dussault]] as Muriel Rush\n* [[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]] as Jackie Rush (1980-1985)\n* [[Lydia Cornell]] as Sara Rush (1980-1985)\n* [[Jim J.

It was written by [[Ed Robertson]], who is featured on the lead vocal of the rapped verses. [[Steven Page]] sings lead on the song's chorus, while the two co-lead the prechoruses in harmony. The song is notable for its significant number of [[popular culture|pop culture]] references, and remains the band's best known song in the United States. Coincidentally, when the song reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], it remained in the top spot for one week.\n\n\"One Week\" is the band's best-performing single on the charts in both the US and the UK, though it slightly under-performed several other singles in Canada. It was the band's only No. 1 single in the US on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] (for five non-consecutive weeks). The song spent seven weeks at No. 3 on the [[Hot 100 Airplay]] and an additional four weeks at No. 2 behind the [[Goo Goo Dolls]]' \"[[Iris (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Iris]]\". The band has not equaled this level of US chart success since, though singles \"[[It's All Been Done]]\", from the same album, and \"[[Pinch Me]]\", the first single from their subsequent album ''[[Maroon (Barenaked Ladies album)|Maroon]]'', both broke the top 50 of the US Hot 100. Apple used the song at MacWorld 1999 for presenting [[macOS Server|Mac OS X Server]] on a wall of 50 [[iMac G3|iMacs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mac OS X Server at Macworld SF '99|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFIF2496Br0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://allaboutstevejobs.com/videos/keynotes/macworld_1999|title=Macworld 1999 - all about Steve Jobs.com|date=January 7, 1999|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, American parodist [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] recorded a parody titled \"Jerry Springer\", a song about a man's strange obsession with ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'', for his album ''[[Running with Scissors (\"Weird Al\" Yankovic album)|Running with Scissors]]''.\n\nThe song has been featured numerous times in other media, including the films ''[[Digimon: The Movie]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'', the band appear to perform it live in \"[[College Kids]]\", an early season 4 episode of ''[[The West Wing]]'', the season 7 Oscar Special of ''[[On Cinema]]'', a season 2 episode of ''[[Schooled (TV series)|Schooled]]'', the video game ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks (video game)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'', and in the video game ''[[Rock Band Blitz]]''.

Club|date=January 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Ed Robertson]] wrote the ideas for the non-rap \"choruses\" with the concept being the structure of a fight between a man and a woman where the protagonist knows he is wrong and is just trying to save face. Robertson wanted to come up with a rapped verse for the song but all attempts failed. Bandmate [[Steven Page]] suggested he simply improvise the rap, as the two did onstage every night. Robertson heeded the advice and set up a video camera. He improvised the song at a slower pace to make rhyming easier and arrived at about four minutes of rap. He sent it to Page, who told him not to change a word. Two minutes of the improvising was almost directly compiled (with very little, if any, tweaking) into the verses of the song. Due to its improvised nature, the rapped sections are not intended to have any direct relation to the plot of the sung sections. The lyrics in the [[liner notes]] from ''Stunt'' contain some additional lines of rap that did not make it into the recorded version.\n\nBand members have stated that the first live run-through of \"One Week\" did not go well, and that it took some time to get the song to sound good live. The instrumental parts are played by band members, notably Ed Robertson and Steven Page on guitar, and [[Kevin Hearn]] sometimes on guitar and sometimes on keyboards; as well, while Hearn was away from touring shortly after the song's release, his place at shows was taken by one of two other musicians on keyboards who each added their own unique parts to the song, helping to shape its live sound early.\n\nThe song is rife with pop culture references, which includes the following: [[Aquaman]], [[Swiss Chalet]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Bert Kaempfert]], ''[[The X-Files]]'' and its character, [[The Smoking Man]], the film ''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]'' and its star [[Harrison Ford]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[tantric sex]], [[Snickers]], [[sushi]] and [[wasabi]], [[golf clubs]], the film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', [[Akira Kurosawa]] and his film ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s song \"[[Scenario (song)|Scenario]]\", [[Birchmount Stadium]] and its annual Robbie International Soccer Tournament.\n\nThe song is also featured on the third installment of  the ''[[Big Shiny Tunes]]'' series, ''[[Big Shiny Tunes 3]]''.\n\nIn performances starting in 2003, the band developed an acoustic, bluegrass version of the song. It is typically used in a new performance setting they developed on the [[Peepshow Tour]] that year, in which they play acoustically while they stand around and sing into one omni-directional [[microphone]].\n\nWith the departure of Steven Page in January 2009, Kevin Hearn has assumed lead vocal duties on almost most choruses. Hearn often sings the choruses together with drummer [[Tyler Stewart]], who also performs the harmonies during the bridge. Both the third, last chorus and the following, ending part of the song are sung by Robertson, along with Stewart's harmonizing.\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was directed by [[McG]] and begins with the band performing the song in a royal court, featuring a singing girl on a wind-up pedestal (portrayed by Kiva Dawson), similar to a scene from the movie ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''. During the interlude they make an escape and sing while driving a lookalike of [[The General Lee]] from ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (using the numbers 07 instead of 01, minus the Confederate flag on the roof, and being from the 1968 model year as opposed to 1969) and [[Starsky & Hutch]]'s [[Ford Gran Torino]]. The band drives into a suburb, where they perform a concert in front of a 1950s bus, with a female motorcyclist, dressed like [[Evel Knievel]], performing stunts. The video ends with a shot of the cyclist stuck on a tree. The video features [[Carmit Bachar]] from [[the Pussycat Dolls]], playing an angel.\n\n==Track listing==\n;American version\n# \"One Week\" - 2:52\n# \"When You Dream\" <small> (home demo)</small> -

It was written by [[Ed Robertson]], who is featured on the lead vocal of the rapped verses. [[Steven Page]] sings lead on the song's chorus, while the two co-lead the prechoruses in harmony. The song is notable for its significant number of [[popular culture|pop culture]] references, and remains the band's best known song in the United States. Coincidentally, when the song reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], it remained in the top spot for one week.\n\n\"One Week\" is the band's best-performing single on the charts in both the US and the UK, though it slightly under-performed several other singles in Canada. It was the band's only No. 1 single in the US on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] (for five non-consecutive weeks). The song spent seven weeks at No. 3 on the [[Hot 100 Airplay]] and an additional four weeks at No. 2 behind the [[Goo Goo Dolls]]' \"[[Iris (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Iris]]\". The band has not equaled this level of US chart success since, though singles \"[[It's All Been Done]]\", from the same album, and \"[[Pinch Me]]\", the first single from their subsequent album ''[[Maroon (Barenaked Ladies album)|Maroon]]'', both broke the top 50 of the US Hot 100.
