In May 2005, Zade performed at the Library of Congress in Washington DC in celebration of Jordan's National Day by invitation from the Jordanian Ambassador to the United States. He also was invited to perform at the World Economic Forum Extraordinaire 2003 in Jordan.

With UNICEF,  he performed at Al Zaatari Refugee camp in Jordan which later inspired the creation of \"Musiqati\",  the world\u2019s first music therapy program designed specifically for children in refugee camps. The programme helps Syrian refugee children cope with trauma and loss by making music, while also enhancing their skills to communicate and express themselves, and group cooperation.\n\nThe program was designed by child protection and music therapy experts in consultation with children and adults living in Syrian refugee camps in Jordan. The evaluation of the program that was piloted for a year in Azraq refugee camp shows that 65 per cent of child participants displayed significant progress in terms of their participation, ability to wait and take turns, decision-making, working with others, and ability to express themselves confidently.\n\nZade also collaborated with UNICEF on the creation of the song \"Heartbeat.\"  The song, which is composed by Zade, with production by David Santisteban, and lyrics by Jad Rahbani,  is a message of hope from Syria\u2019s children to the children and people of the world, with a simple request to get their childhood back. The song is performed by 10 year-old Ansam, an internally displaced girl in Syria who was born blind. The song was shot in an area of Syria heavily damaged by the fighting. Children performing as part of the choir are all internally displaced and participate, along with Ansam, in UNICEF psychosocial support programmes.\n\n=== '''Un Piano Y Amigos''' ===\nIn February 2020, Zade released his 8th album entitled \"Un Piano y Amigos\", produced by Spanish hitmaker David Santisteban, and featuring vocal collaborations with some of Spain's top artists including India Martinez, David DeMaria, Pitingo, Ana Mena, Eva Ruiz, Lerica, Lorena Gomez, Soraya, and Paula Rojo.  \n<br />\n\n==Awards==\nIn October 2004, Zade was awarded the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee's Distinguished Achievements Award for his work that promotes global understanding through the arts.

The concert was aired on PBS stations in 2010 and 2011.\n\n===Zade Foundation for International Peace and Understanding===\nTo continue cross-cultural understanding through the arts, Zade has launched [[The Zade Foundation]] for International Peace and Understanding aimed at helping young musicians share with the world a deeper understanding of their cultures by offering them a unique opportunity to expand their roles from musicians to proactive peace builders and future community leaders.\n\n===Performances for public figures===\nZade was invited by King Abdullah and [[Queen Rania of Jordan]] to join them on the official state visit to the United Kingdom where he performed before Queen Elizabeth and the British royal family in London. In May 2005, Zade performed at the Library of Congress in Washington DC in celebration of Jordan's National Day by invitation from the Jordanian Ambassador to the United States. He also was invited to perform at the World Economic Forum Extraordinaire 2003 in Jordan. Zade has graced the stage at a tribute to President Nelson Mandela organized by the United Nations Foundation and the Mosaic Foundation in Washington, DC. Other distinctive appearances include \"Exploring Jordan\" held at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.\n\n=== Work with UNICEF ===\n[[File:Zade Dirani with UNICEF at Al Zaatari Refugees Camp Visit in August 2016.jpg|alt=Zade Dirani with UNICEF at Al Zaatari Refugees Camp Visit in August 2016|thumb|Zade Dirani with UNICEF at Al Zaatari Refugees Camp Visit in August 2016]]\nZade was appointed UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for the Middle East and North Africa in August 2016.   With UNICEF,  he performed at Al Zaatari Refugee camp in Jordan which later inspired the creation of \"Musiqati\",  the world\u2019s first music therapy program designed specifically for children in refugee camps. The programme helps Syrian refugee children cope with trauma and loss by making music, while also enhancing their skills to communicate and express themselves, and group cooperation.\n\nThe program was designed by child protection and music therapy experts in consultation with children and adults living in Syrian refugee camps in Jordan. The evaluation of the program that was piloted for a year in Azraq refugee camp shows that 65 per cent of child participants displayed significant progress in terms of their participation, ability to wait and take turns, decision-making, working with others, and ability to express themselves confidently.\n\nZade also collaborated with UNICEF on the creation of the song \"Heartbeat.\"  The song, which is composed by Zade, with production by David Santisteban, and lyrics by Jad Rahbani,  is a message of hope from Syria\u2019s children to the children and people of the world, with a simple request to get their childhood back. The song is performed by 10 year-old Ansam, an internally displaced girl in Syria who was born blind. The song was shot in an area of Syria heavily damaged by the fighting. Children performing as part of the choir are all internally displaced and participate, along with Ansam, in UNICEF psychosocial support programmes.\n\n=== '''Un Piano Y Amigos''' ===\nIn February 2020, Zade released his 8th album entitled \"Un Piano y Amigos\", produced by Spanish hitmaker David Santisteban, and featuring vocal collaborations with some of Spain's top artists including India Martinez, David DeMaria, Pitingo, Ana Mena, Eva Ruiz, Lerica, Lorena Gomez, Soraya, and Paula Rojo.  \n<br />\n\n==Awards==\nIn October 2004, Zade was awarded the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee's Distinguished Achievements Award for his work that promotes global understanding through the arts. He has also received The Jordanian Ministry of Education Award for the Arts and The Arab-American Music, Art, and Literature (AMAL) Award.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.zade.com Official website]\n*[http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-questions-musician-activist 11 Questions with a Musician-Activist]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dirani, Zade}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Jordanian people of Arab descent]]\n[[Category:Jordanian musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Amman]]\n[[Category:1980 births]]\n", "name_user": "102.66.128.133", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zade_Dirani"}

In the 2006 tournament, junior guard Trey Pearson missed a critical 3-point shot in the final seconds of the first-round game against No. 3 seeded defending champion [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]]. UNC was fouled on the rebound and went to the line to sink the game clinching shots to defeat the No. 14 seeded Racers 69-65.\n\nThe Racers won their first-round game in the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010 NCAA tournament]] in dramatic fashion, defeating fourth-seeded [[Vanderbilt Commodores|Vanderbilt]] 66\u201365 on a buzzer beating jump shot by senior Danero Thomas. This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee State]] advanced in 1989.\n\nOne of the more famous tournament games in the program's history was their first-round matchup against #1 seeded [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] in 1990, in which they took to overtime before finally succumbing to the Spartans 75-71, making them one of the closest #16 teams to defeating a #1 seed since the 64-team format came to be in 1985 until it was finally done by [[UMBC Retrievers men's basketball|UMBC]] in 2018.\n\nThe Murray State basketball program first competed in the 1925\u20131926 season under head coach [[Carlisle Cutchin]]. Murray State finished 9-5 in their inaugural season, with the first game being a 31-14 loss to [[Will Mayfield College]]. From 1925 to 1941 Cutchin went on to lead the basketball team to a 296-96 record and three appearances in the NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where the Thoroughbreds finished third in 1938 and second in 1941.\n\nCurrent North Carolina State head basketball coach [[Mark Gottfried]] coached the Racers to three Ohio Valley Conference Championships, all three years he coached there, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com |url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593 |date=2002-05-02 |accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThe Murray State basketball program has been recognized as one of the top 30 basketball programs in modern history by ESPN.

Fulks starred for two seasons at Murray State (1941\u201342 and 1942\u201343), twice earning All-Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference honors, before leaving school to join the Marines during World War II. Fulks scored 621 points in 47 games during his Murray State career, a 13.2 average in an era when teams averaged less than 50 points a game. His fame grew to greater heights as a professional, becoming one of the NBA's early stars as a scoring champ with the [[Philadelphia Warriors]]. He was named to the [[NBA 25th Anniversary Team]] in 1971 and was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1978.\n\nWhile at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds. Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to play 11 seasons in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the [[1992 NBA Draft]]. He's also served as an NBA assistant coach, most recently with the [[Indiana Pacers]].\n\nCanaan and Payne are current NBA players, with Payne Murray State's first NBA first round draft selection, picked 14th overall by the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the [[2016 NBA Draft]].\n\nMurray State's historic basketball rivalry is with nearby [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers|Western Kentucky]]. The two teams became archrivals during their time together in the Ohio Valley Conference. Although the schools no longer share their conference affiliation, the rivalry game remains an annual event on each team's schedule. The two teams have met in basketball 148 times. The Racers' primary OVC rivalry is now with [[Austin Peay State University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://southerntimesgirlsandsports.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/the-25th-greatest-college-basketball-program-in-the-south-murray-state-racers/|title=The 25th Greatest College Basketball Program in the South: Murray State Racers|work=Southern Times, Girls, and Sports|accessdate=14 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707012053/https://southerntimesgirlsandsports.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/the-25th-greatest-college-basketball-program-in-the-south-murray-state-racers/|archive-date=7 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wkusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5400&ATCLID=204861551 |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102052509/http://www.wkusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5400 |archivedate=November 2, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3865828 |title=A look at some of college basketball's lesser-known rivalries|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Murray State basketball program has become a steppingstone to major-college coaching success in recent years. Four of the last five Murray State coaches have gone on to head coaching positions at major conference schools.\n* [[Mark Gottfried]] served as head coach of the Racers from 1995 to 1998. Gottfriend became the first head coach to win three OVC titles in only three seasons. In his last season, the Racers finished 25th in the final AP Poll.

The rivalry with the Hilltoppers began in 1931, and it later became an annual trophy game known as the Battle for the Red Belt.\n\nThe Murray State football program has become a steppingstone to major-college coaching success. Five former Murray State coaches have gone on to head coaching positions at BCS schools.\n* [[Mike Gottfried]] served as head coach of the Racers from 1978 to 1980. He was recognized as OVC Coach of the Year in 1979. Gottfried went on to coach the [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati Bearcats]], [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]], and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]].\n* [[Ron Zook]] served as a secondary coach at Murray State under Gottfried from 1978 to 1980.

In his first two years at Ole Miss, Nutt coached the Rebels to back-to-back [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] victories. Nutt is now a studio analyst for CBS.\n\nIn addition to the success of former Racer football coaches, former players have also gone on to achieve major successes. Former Racer quarterback [[Justin Fuente]] was named head football coach of the [[Memphis Tigers]] in 2011. As a player, Fuente was named Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year in 1999. As a senior in 1999, Fuente set school season records for passing yards (3,498), attempts (400), completions (240) and touchdowns (27). Fuente still holds the MSU record for most 300-yard passing games with 10. He was named head coach at Virginia Tech in 2016, succeeding former Racer head coach Frank Beamer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotigersgo.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/fuente_justin00.html|title=Justin Fuente Bio \u2013 GOTIGERSGO.COM \u2013 The Official Website of the University of Memphis Tigers|accessdate=14 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621211354/http://www.gotigersgo.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/fuente_justin00.html|archivedate=21 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Racers have appeared in only one bowl game, when they were invited to the 1949 Tangerine Bowl.

The Thoroughbreds won or shared 11 conference titles during his 36-year tenure (1958\u20131993). He also led Murray State to 27-straight winning seasons and its first two [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship]] appearances, in 1975 and 1979. Murray State also reached the NCAA Regionals in 2003. Murray State's 1975 team finished the season with a 40\u20139 record, was ranked No. 23 in Division I and led the nation in batting average (.332). The 1979 team (27\u201310\u20132), ranked 17th in Division I, came one win from advancing to the [[College World Series]]. Murray State's 1973 (19th) and 1974 (28th) teams also finished the season ranked in the NCAA poll.\n\nNotable Murray State baseball alumni include [[Pat Jarvis (baseball)|Pat Jarvis]], [[Jack Perconte]], and [[Kirk Rueter]].\n\nAt the time the new athletics nickname was adopted in 1961, the Murray State baseball team had just purchased new uniforms and equipment bags with the Thoroughbreds logo on it, so the team requested and received a one-year extension before adopting the new nickname. Alumni and fans admired the team for keeping the original nickname, so the baseball team remained known as the Thoroughbreds until 2014. In May 2014, athletic director Allen Ward announced that the baseball team would join the rest of the Murray State athletic teams and be identified as the Racers. Ward cited the need for the baseball program to enjoy the same brand identity and benefits that are afforded to the rest of the teams that identify as Racers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goracers.com/news/2014/5/20/BB_0520145918.aspx|title=Murray State University Racers Athletics|work=GoRacers.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Rifle==\nThe Murray State Rifle program has enjoyed a long history of success since it was established in the 1956\u201357 season.

Softball would replace rowing, which would be immediately discontinued as a university sponsored sport. At the time of the announcement, the active roster for the rowing team had less than 10 members. Adding softball would aid the University's Title IX compliance goals by adding additional opportunities for female athletes. Additionally, the sport of softball was seen as more identifiable than rowing in the university's service region. Prior to the announcement, Murray State was the only school in the Ohio Valley Conference that had not sponsored softball at the NCAA level.<ref name=\"goracers.com\">{{cite web |url=http://goracers.com/news/2008/5/17/14587.aspx|title=Murray State University Racers Athletics|work=GoRacers.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nMurray State formed a partnership with the city of Murray in which the softball program would have use of a field at the city park in exchange for significant upgrades to the facility that would remain the property of the city parks.

Historically, the track and field program included both men and women; however, in 2004 the men's program was reduced to a non-scholarship program. In October 2006, athletic director Allen Ward announced that the non-scholarship men's track and field program was being eliminated, effective immediately. Murray State cited budgetary and Title IX concerns as reasons for eliminating the men's track and field program. The men's team had been exceptionally successful in competition, producing ten Olympic athletes, eleven instances of OVC Men's Athlete of the Year honors, and 40 instances of NCAA Men's All-America honors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goracers.com/documents/2014/1/13/Track_and_Field_Media_Guide_13-14.pdf?id=1806 |format=PDF |title=Track and Field |publisher=Goracers.com |accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref>\n\n;Men's team Olympians\n* [[Tommy Turner (athlete)|Tommy Turner]] \u2013 1972 (1600 Relay)\n* Everton Cornelius \u2013 1976 (Long Jump)\n* Cuthbert Jacobs \u2013 1976 (400 Meters & 1600 Relay)\n* [[Fred Sowerby]] \u2013 1976 (400 Meters & 1600 Relay)\n* David Warren \u2013 1980 (800 Meters)\n* Alfred Brown \u2013 1984 (400 Meters)\n* [[Elvis Forde]] \u2013 1984 (400 Meters & 1600 Relay)\n* Patterson Johnson \u2013 1988 (Sprints)\n* Stevon Roberts \u2013 1992 (800 Meters & 1600 Meters)\n* [[Seibert Straughn]] \u2013 1992 (400 Meters & 1600 Meters)\n\n;Women's team Olympians\n* [[Heather Samuel]] \u2013 1992 (100 Meters & 200 Meters)\n\n==Tennis==\nThe Men's Tennis program began play 1954 and won 19 Ohio Valley Conference championships during its existence.

The Racers also have a well known in-conference rivalry with [[Austin Peay State University]].\n\n===Western Kentucky===\nIn 1922, the Murray State Normal School was chartered as a state-supported teacher training institution, because the Western Kentucky State Normal School and Eastern Kentucky State Normal School could no longer produce a sufficient number of teachers to support the growing demand in the state. Located only 120 miles away from one another, and both in the western portion of the state, Murray State and Western Kentucky quickly became known as sister institutions as well as fierce competitors. In 1941, prior to a SIAA championship game between the Racers and Hilltoppers, Murray State President James H. Richmond remarked, \"We are always happy when we can defeat our chief rival and greatest friend.\"\n\n====Football rivalry====\n{{main article|Battle for the Red Belt}}\nThe football rivalry with Western Kentucky began with a Hilltopper victory on October 24, 1931. In 1939, both institutions strengthened the rivalry by scheduling the match up as the final game of their regular seasons. This tradition continued, with only four interruptions, for the next 46 years. In 1948 both schools joined together to form the Ohio Valley Conference, where Murray won the first championship in football. The football rivalry was cemented as an annual trophy game in 1978 known as the Battle for the Red Belt. The annual meetings between the two teams ended in 2000, but the Battle for the Red Belt is still played on in intermittent basis. The last game was played in 2008 when a record crowd of 22,297 in Bowling Green watched the Hilltoppers beat the Racers 50-9 and maintain possession of the Red Belt. The Racers and Hilltoppers have met 67 times in football, with Western Kentucky leading the series 36-24-7.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wkusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5400&ATCLID=1584257 |accessdate=October 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102052509/http://www.wkusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5400 |archivedate=November 2, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dustyluthy.blogspot.com/2008/09/wku-vs-msu-and-red-belt.html|title=And One|author=Dusty Luthy|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Basketball rivalry====\nMurray State and Western Kentucky have met 148 times in basketball since 1932. The basketball rivalry is the oldest in the state of Kentucky. Murray State won the first meeting in 1932 by a score of 26-24 in a game played on the stage at Lovett Auditorium. Western Kentucky leads the overall series 95-53, but Murray State has won 10 of the last 19 games since Western Kentucky left the Ohio Valley Conference in 1982.\n\nThe Murray State-Western Kentucky basketball rivalry has been every bit as bitter as the football rivalry. During the 1954\u201355 season, the teams met four times in a series of contests that also included severe fouls on the court, ejected players, punches thrown by fans in the stands, and even a fainting cheerleader. During the next season, Racers coach Rex Alexander publicly accused the Hilltopper coaching staff of poor sportsmanship and accused Western Kentucky of enjoying an unfair home-court advantage because of \"loose officiating\".

In 2009, [[ESPN the Magazine]] featured the Murray State-Austin Peay rivalry as the best rivalry in the OVC and one of the best in the nation.

The current equestrian club team is operated through the College of Agriculture and has more than 50 participants. The equestrian club team competes in Zone 5, Region I of the [[Intercollegiate Horse Show Association]] (IHSA). In May 2008, Murray State University President Dr. Randy Dunn charged Director of Athletics Allen Ward with the responsibility of moving the sport of equestrian from club status to NCAA varsity status. Equestrian offers high female participation rates, which will help the university meet its Title IX obligations. When Murray State begins competition at the NCAA Division I level, the Racers will join the [[University of Tennessee at Martin]] as the only schools in the Ohio Valley Conference to sponsor equestrian teams at the NCAA level.<ref name=\"goracers.com\"/><ref>[http://www.varsityequestrian.com/universities.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821184148/http://www.varsityequestrian.com/universities.html |date=August 21, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Rodeo===\nMurray State has fielded a Rodeo team since 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MSURodeaTeam/info?ref=page_internal#!/MSURodeaTeam/info?tab=page_info#!/MSURodeaTeam/info?tab=page_owners#!/MSURodeaTeam/info?tab=page_info|title=Murray State University Rodeo Team|work=Facebook|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>  The co-ed team competes in the Ozarks Region of the [[National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.murraystate.edu/academics/CollegesDepartments/HutsonSchoolOfAgriculture/studentorganizations/rodeoteam.aspx|title=Rodeo Team|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>  In 2014, head coach J.D.

In Spring 1996 the plan to establish the rowing team was officially announced. The thought of a primarily ivy league sport at Murray State was met with skepticism among some groups. In fact the Murray State student newspaper printed a column mocking the plan, calling it \"Alexander's Navy.\" The plan called for Murray State to practice as well as host home regattas on [[Kentucky Lake]]. Murray State was the first school in the State of Kentucky with a rowing program, established two years ahead of the [[University of Louisville]].<ref>\"School to Launch Rowing Team on Kentucky Lake\".

The first competition for the new rowing team was a duel race with [[Northwestern State University]] at the Natchitoches River.\n\nIn 1998 the women's program was elevated to NCAA status, while the men's team remained at the club level. The move to NCAA status for the women's team was done out of Title IX considerations; however, it brought increased funding, scholarships, and recognition to the Murray State rowing program. The program began hosting the annual Racer Regatta on Kentucky Lake beginning in 1999. Bill McLean was hired as head coach in 2003 after serving as the head coach at the [[University of Rochester]] for eight seasons. In the following years, McClean made great strides in turning the women's program into an award-winning NCAA rowing program. McClean hired the program's first full-time assistant coach in 2007. Robert Montague joined the program as a full-time assistant coach after serving three years as the head coach of the rowing club at the [[College of William and Mary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goracers.com/news/2007/7/31/97709.aspx|title=Murray State University Racers Athletics|work=GoRacers.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008 Murray State announced that the rowing program would no longer be sponsored at the NCAA level. Athletic Director Allen Ward indicated that the move was necessary to increase female participation while managing costs. As a result, rowing was cut and replaced with women's softball and future plans to add equestrian as a NCAA sponsored sport. Ward noted, \"It was important that we address the annual budget in a manner that does not jeopardize the opportunity for competitive success across the board. Our evaluation concluded that the sport of rowing does not ideally fit programmatically at the university, so we are choosing to replace it with sports that are more identifiable with the Murray State service region.\" Following the loss of university funding and sponsorship at the NCAA level in 2008, the men's and women's programs have continued on in competition as a club program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goracers.com/news/2008/5/17/14587.aspx |title=Murray State University Racers Athletics|work=GoRacers.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenews.org/2.10055/row-row-row-your-boat-admirably-out-of-murray-1.1332733 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406035615/http://www.thenews.org/2.10055/row-row-row-your-boat-admirably-out-of-murray-1.1332733 |archivedate=April 6, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.org/2.10053/rowing-at-murray-state-continues-on-1.1332656 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406035632/http://www.thenews.org/2.10053/rowing-at-murray-state-continues-on-1.1332656 |archivedate=April 6, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Rugby===\nThe Murray State Rugby Club was founded in 1996.

The tournament appearances included one win in 1988 the Racers defeated [[North Carolina State Wolfpack|North Carolina State]] in the first round but lost to [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] in the second round. In 2010, 22 years to the date of the 1988 win, the Racers beat the [[Vanderbilt Commodores]] and lost to the [[Butler Bulldogs]] in the second round. In the 2006 tournament, junior guard Trey Pearson missed a critical 3-point shot in the final seconds of the first-round game against No. 3 seeded defending champion [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]]. UNC was fouled on the rebound and went to the line to sink the game clinching shots to defeat the No. 14 seeded Racers 69-65.\n\nThe Racers won their first-round game in the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010 NCAA tournament]] in dramatic fashion, defeating fourth-seeded [[Vanderbilt Commodores|Vanderbilt]] 66\u201365 on a buzzer beating jump shot by senior Danero Thomas. This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee State]] advanced in 1989.\n\nOne of the more famous tournament games in the program's history was their first-round matchup against #1 seeded [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] in 1990, in which they took to overtime before finally succumbing to the Spartans 75-71, making them one of the closest #16 teams to defeating a #1 seed since the 64-team format came to be in 1985 until it was finally done by [[UMBC Retrievers men's basketball|UMBC]] in 2018.\n\nThe Murray State basketball program first competed in the 1925\u20131926 season under head coach [[Carlisle Cutchin]]. Murray State finished 9-5 in their inaugural season, with the first game being a 31-14 loss to [[Will Mayfield College]]. From 1925 to 1941 Cutchin went on to lead the basketball team to a 296-96 record and three appearances in the NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where the Thoroughbreds finished third in 1938 and second in 1941.\n\nCurrent North Carolina State head basketball coach [[Mark Gottfried]] coached the Racers to three Ohio Valley Conference Championships, all three years he coached there, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com |url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593 |date=2002-05-02 |accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThe Murray State basketball program has been recognized as one of the top 30 basketball programs in modern history by ESPN.

Fulks starred for two seasons at Murray State (1941\u201342 and 1942\u201343), twice earning All-Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference honors, before leaving school to join the Marines during World War II. Fulks scored 621 points in 47 games during his Murray State career, a 13.2 average in an era when teams averaged less than 50 points a game. His fame grew to greater heights as a professional, becoming one of the NBA's early stars as a scoring champ with the [[Philadelphia Warriors]]. He was named to the [[NBA 25th Anniversary Team]] in 1971 and was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1978.\n\nWhile at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds. Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to play 11 seasons in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the [[1992 NBA Draft]]. He's also served as an NBA assistant coach, most recently with the [[Indiana Pacers]].\n\nCanaan and Payne are current NBA players, with Payne Murray State's first NBA first round draft selection, picked 14th overall by the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the [[2016 NBA Draft]].\n\nMurray State's historic basketball rivalry is with nearby [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers|Western Kentucky]]. The two teams became archrivals during their time together in the Ohio Valley Conference. Although the schools no longer share their conference affiliation, the rivalry game remains an annual event on each team's schedule. The two teams have met in basketball 148 times.

The Thoroughbreds won or shared 11 conference titles during his 36-year tenure (1958\u20131993). He also led Murray State to 27-straight winning seasons and its first two [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship]] appearances, in 1975 and 1979. Murray State also reached the NCAA Regionals in 2003. Murray State's 1975 team finished the season with a 40\u20139 record, was ranked No. 23 in Division I and led the nation in batting average (.332). The 1979 team (27\u201310\u20132), ranked 17th in Division I, came one win from advancing to the [[College World Series]]. Murray State's 1973 (19th) and 1974 (28th) teams also finished the season ranked in the NCAA poll.\n\nNotable Murray State baseball alumni include [[Pat Jarvis (baseball)|Pat Jarvis]], [[Jack Perconte]], and [[Kirk Rueter]].\n\nAt the time the new athletics nickname was adopted in 1961, the Murray State baseball team had just purchased new uniforms and equipment bags with the Thoroughbreds logo on it, so the team requested and received a one-year extension before adopting the new nickname. Alumni and fans admired the team for keeping the original nickname, so the baseball team remained known as the Thoroughbreds until 2014. In May 2014, athletic director Allen Ward announced that the baseball team would join the rest of the Murray State athletic teams and be identified as the Racers. Ward cited the need for the baseball program to enjoy the same brand identity and benefits that are afforded to the rest of the teams that identify as Racers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goracers.com/news/2014/5/20/BB_0520145918.aspx|title=Murray State University Racers Athletics|work=GoRacers.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Rifle==\nThe Murray State Rifle program has enjoyed a long history of success since it was established in the 1956\u201357 season.

Softball would replace rowing, which would be immediately discontinued as a university sponsored sport. At the time of the announcement, the active roster for the rowing team had less than 10 members. Adding softball would aid the University's Title IX compliance goals by adding additional opportunities for female athletes. Additionally, the sport of softball was seen as more identifiable than rowing in the university's service region. Prior to the announcement, Murray State was the only school in the Ohio Valley Conference that had not sponsored softball at the NCAA level.<ref name=\"goracers.com\">{{cite web |url=http://goracers.com/news/2008/5/17/14587.aspx|title=Murray State University Racers Athletics|work=GoRacers.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nMurray State formed a partnership with the city of Murray in which the softball program would have use of a field at the city park in exchange for significant upgrades to the facility that would remain the property of the city parks.

Historically, the track and field program included both men and women; however, in 2004 the men's program was reduced to a non-scholarship program. In October 2006, athletic director Allen Ward announced that the non-scholarship men's track and field program was being eliminated, effective immediately. Murray State cited budgetary and Title IX concerns as reasons for eliminating the men's track and field program. The men's team had been exceptionally successful in competition, producing ten Olympic athletes, eleven instances of OVC Men's Athlete of the Year honors, and 40 instances of NCAA Men's All-America honors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goracers.com/documents/2014/1/13/Track_and_Field_Media_Guide_13-14.pdf?id=1806 |format=PDF |title=Track and Field |publisher=Goracers.com |accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref>\n\n;Men's team Olympians\n* [[Tommy Turner (athlete)|Tommy Turner]] \u2013 1972 (1600 Relay)\n* Everton Cornelius \u2013 1976 (Long Jump)\n* Cuthbert Jacobs \u2013 1976 (400 Meters & 1600 Relay)\n* [[Fred Sowerby]] \u2013 1976 (400 Meters & 1600 Relay)\n* David Warren \u2013 1980 (800 Meters)\n* Alfred Brown \u2013 1984 (400 Meters)\n* [[Elvis Forde]] \u2013 1984 (400 Meters & 1600 Relay)\n* Patterson Johnson \u2013 1988 (Sprints)\n* Stevon Roberts \u2013 1992 (800 Meters & 1600 Meters)\n* [[Seibert Straughn]] \u2013 1992 (400 Meters & 1600 Meters)\n\n;Women's team Olympians\n* [[Heather Samuel]] \u2013 1992 (100 Meters & 200 Meters)\n\n==Tennis==\nThe Men's Tennis program began play 1954 and won 19 Ohio Valley Conference championships during its existence.

The Racers also have a well known in-conference rivalry with [[Austin Peay State University]].\n\n===Western Kentucky===\nIn 1922, the Murray State Normal School was chartered as a state-supported teacher training institution, because the Western Kentucky State Normal School and Eastern Kentucky State Normal School could no longer produce a sufficient number of teachers to support the growing demand in the state. Located only 120 miles away from one another, and both in the western portion of the state, Murray State and Western Kentucky quickly became known as sister institutions as well as fierce competitors. In 1941, prior to a SIAA championship game between the Racers and Hilltoppers, Murray State President James H. Richmond remarked, \"We are always happy when we can defeat our chief rival and greatest friend.\"\n\n====Football rivalry====\n{{main article|Battle for the Red Belt}}\nThe football rivalry with Western Kentucky began with a Hilltopper victory on October 24, 1931. In 1939, both institutions strengthened the rivalry by scheduling the match up as the final game of their regular seasons. This tradition continued, with only four interruptions, for the next 46 years. In 1948 both schools joined together to form the Ohio Valley Conference, where Murray won the first championship in football. The football rivalry was cemented as an annual trophy game in 1978 known as the Battle for the Red Belt. The annual meetings between the two teams ended in 2000, but the Battle for the Red Belt is still played on in intermittent basis. The last game was played in 2008 when a record crowd of 22,297 in Bowling Green watched the Hilltoppers beat the Racers 50-9 and maintain possession of the Red Belt. The Racers and Hilltoppers have met 67 times in football, with Western Kentucky leading the series 36-24-7.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wkusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5400&ATCLID=1584257 |accessdate=October 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102052509/http://www.wkusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5400 |archivedate=November 2, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dustyluthy.blogspot.com/2008/09/wku-vs-msu-and-red-belt.html|title=And One|author=Dusty Luthy|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Basketball rivalry====\nMurray State and Western Kentucky have met 148 times in basketball since 1932. The basketball rivalry is the oldest in the state of Kentucky. Murray State won the first meeting in 1932 by a score of 26-24 in a game played on the stage at Lovett Auditorium. Western Kentucky leads the overall series 95-53, but Murray State has won 10 of the last 19 games since Western Kentucky left the Ohio Valley Conference in 1982.\n\nThe Murray State-Western Kentucky basketball rivalry has been every bit as bitter as the football rivalry. During the 1954\u201355 season, the teams met four times in a series of contests that also included severe fouls on the court, ejected players, punches thrown by fans in the stands, and even a fainting cheerleader. During the next season, Racers coach Rex Alexander publicly accused the Hilltopper coaching staff of poor sportsmanship and accused Western Kentucky of enjoying an unfair home-court advantage because of \"loose officiating\". Following a February 1956 victory by the Racers, the winning score of 74-70 was found painted on the sidewalk in front of [[Henry Hardin Cherry Hall]] and paint was thrown on the statue of Henry Hardin Cherry on WKU's campus.<ref>\"WKU comes to CFSB Center for 148th meeting\".

The fans and students from the two towns, located only 60 miles apart, have developed a love-hate relationship with one another that has contributed to the growing intensity of the rivalry. In 2009, [[ESPN the Magazine]] featured the Murray State-Austin Peay rivalry as the best rivalry in the OVC and one of the best in the nation. Murray State holds the overall lead in the series 71-40, with Austin Peay winning only nine times in Murray since the series began in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apsugovernors.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=16900&ATCLID=3660086 |accessdate=October 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714090711/http://www.apsugovernors.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=16900 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goracers.com/documents/2010/7/13/Murray_State_Basketball_09-10_guide.pdf?id=43 |format=PDF |title=Murray State 2009-2010 Basketball |publisher=Goracers.com |accessdate=2015-07-03}}</ref>\n\n==Club sports==\n\n===Equestrian===\nMurray State has enjoyed a long tradition of equestrian teams at the club level. The current equestrian club team is operated through the College of Agriculture and has more than 50 participants. The equestrian club team competes in Zone 5, Region I of the [[Intercollegiate Horse Show Association]] (IHSA). In May 2008, Murray State University President Dr. Randy Dunn charged Director of Athletics Allen Ward with the responsibility of moving the sport of equestrian from club status to NCAA varsity status. Equestrian offers high female participation rates, which will help the university meet its Title IX obligations. When Murray State begins competition at the NCAA Division I level, the Racers will join the [[University of Tennessee at Martin]] as the only schools in the Ohio Valley Conference to sponsor equestrian teams at the NCAA level.<ref name=\"goracers.com\"/><ref>[http://www.varsityequestrian.com/universities.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821184148/http://www.varsityequestrian.com/universities.html |date=August 21, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Rodeo===\nMurray State has fielded a Rodeo team since 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MSURodeaTeam/info?ref=page_internal#!/MSURodeaTeam/info?tab=page_info#!/MSURodeaTeam/info?tab=page_owners#!/MSURodeaTeam/info?tab=page_info|title=Murray State University Rodeo Team|work=Facebook|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>  The co-ed team competes in the Ozarks Region of the [[National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.murraystate.edu/academics/CollegesDepartments/HutsonSchoolOfAgriculture/studentorganizations/rodeoteam.aspx|title=Rodeo Team|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>  In 2014, head coach J.D.

In Spring 1996 the plan to establish the rowing team was officially announced. The thought of a primarily ivy league sport at Murray State was met with skepticism among some groups. In fact the Murray State student newspaper printed a column mocking the plan, calling it \"Alexander's Navy.\" The plan called for Murray State to practice as well as host home regattas on [[Kentucky Lake]]. Murray State was the first school in the State of Kentucky with a rowing program, established two years ahead of the [[University of Louisville]].<ref>\"School to Launch Rowing Team on Kentucky Lake\".

The first competition for the new rowing team was a duel race with [[Northwestern State University]] at the Natchitoches River.\n\nIn 1998 the women's program was elevated to NCAA status, while the men's team remained at the club level. The move to NCAA status for the women's team was done out of Title IX considerations; however, it brought increased funding, scholarships, and recognition to the Murray State rowing program. The program began hosting the annual Racer Regatta on Kentucky Lake beginning in 1999. Bill McLean was hired as head coach in 2003 after serving as the head coach at the [[University of Rochester]] for eight seasons. In the following years, McClean made great strides in turning the women's program into an award-winning NCAA rowing program. McClean hired the program's first full-time assistant coach in 2007. Robert Montague joined the program as a full-time assistant coach after serving three years as the head coach of the rowing club at the [[College of William and Mary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goracers.com/news/2007/7/31/97709.aspx|title=Murray State University Racers Athletics|work=GoRacers.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008 Murray State announced that the rowing program would no longer be sponsored at the NCAA level. Athletic Director Allen Ward indicated that the move was necessary to increase female participation while managing costs. As a result, rowing was cut and replaced with women's softball and future plans to add equestrian as a NCAA sponsored sport. Ward noted, \"It was important that we address the annual budget in a manner that does not jeopardize the opportunity for competitive success across the board. Our evaluation concluded that the sport of rowing does not ideally fit programmatically at the university, so we are choosing to replace it with sports that are more identifiable with the Murray State service region.\" Following the loss of university funding and sponsorship at the NCAA level in 2008, the men's and women's programs have continued on in competition as a club program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goracers.com/news/2008/5/17/14587.aspx |title=Murray State University Racers Athletics|work=GoRacers.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenews.org/2.10055/row-row-row-your-boat-admirably-out-of-murray-1.1332733 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406035615/http://www.thenews.org/2.10055/row-row-row-your-boat-admirably-out-of-murray-1.1332733 |archivedate=April 6, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.org/2.10053/rowing-at-murray-state-continues-on-1.1332656 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406035632/http://www.thenews.org/2.10053/rowing-at-murray-state-continues-on-1.1332656 |archivedate=April 6, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Rugby===\nThe Murray State Rugby Club was founded in 1996.
