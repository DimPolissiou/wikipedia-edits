The [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] offers public tours of the center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBecause much of the installation is a restricted area and only nine percent of the land is developed, the site also serves as an important [[wildlife sanctuary]]; [[Mosquito Lagoon]], [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]], [[Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge]] and [[Canaveral National Seashore]] are other features of the area.

The first of two uncrewed flights, [[Apollo 4]] (Apollo-Saturn 501) on November 9, 1967, was also the first rocket launch from KSC. The Saturn V's first crewed launch on December 21, 1968, was [[Apollo 8]]'s lunar orbiting mission. The next two missions tested the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]: [[Apollo 9]] (Earth orbit) and [[Apollo 10]] (lunar orbit). [[Apollo 11]], launched from Pad A on July 16, 1969, made the first Moon landing on July 20. [[Apollo 12]] followed four months later. From 1970 to 1972, the Apollo program concluded at KSC with the launches of missions 13 through 17.\n\n===Skylab===\n{{Main|Skylab}}\nOn May 14, 1973, the last [[Saturn V]] launch put the Skylab space station in orbit from Pad 39A. By this time, the Cape Kennedy pads 34 and 37 used for the Saturn IB were decommissioned, so Pad 39B was modified to accommodate the Saturn IB, and used to launch three crewed missions to Skylab that year, as well as the final Apollo spacecraft for the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] in 1975.\n\n===Space Shuttle===\n{{main|Space Shuttle program|List of space shuttle missions}}\n[[File:STS-60 Launch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Shuttle ''Discovery'']] launching from Pad 39A on [[STS-60]], February 3, 1994]]\n[[File:STS-36 Rollout - GPN-2000-000680.jpg|thumb|left|[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Shuttle ''Atlantis'']] is moved to Pad 39A for the 1990 launch of [[STS-36]].]]\n[[File:STS-129 Atlantis Ready to Fly - edit1.jpg|thumb|left|The Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' (STS-129) is seen on launch pad 39A at the NASA Kennedy Space Center shortly after the rotating service structure was rolled back on Nov. 15, 2009.]]\nAs the Space Shuttle was being designed, NASA received proposals for building alternative launch-and-landing sites at locations other than KSC, which demanded study. KSC had important advantages, including its existing facilities; location on the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]; and its southern latitude, which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near-equatorial orbits. Disadvantages included: its inability to safely launch military missions into [[polar orbit]], since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the Carolinas or Cuba; corrosion from the salt air; and frequent cloudy or stormy weather. Although building a new site at [[White Sands Missile Range]] in New Mexico was seriously considered, NASA announced its decision in April 1972 to use KSC for the shuttle.<ref name=\"heppenheimer1998\">{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA | author=Heppenheimer, T.

Concurrent with this event, the U.S. flag was painted on the south side of the VAB. During the late 1970s, LC-39 was reconfigured to support the Space Shuttle. Two [[Orbiter Processing Facility|Orbiter Processing Facilities]] were built near the VAB as hangars with a third added in the 1980s.\n\nKSC's {{convert|2.9|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] (SLF) was the orbiters' primary end-of-mission landing site, although the first KSC landing did not take place until the tenth flight, when ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' completed [[STS-41-B]] on February 11, 1984; the primary landing site until then was [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California, subsequently used as a backup landing site. The SLF also provided a [[Return To Launch Site|return-to-launch-site (RTLS) abort]] option, which was not utilized. The SLF is among the longest runways in the world.<ref>[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/facilities/slf.html Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF)]. Science.ksc.nasa.gov. Retrieved on May 5, 2012.</ref>\n\nAfter 24 successful shuttle flights, ''Challenger'' [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|was torn apart]] 73 seconds after the launch of [[STS-51-L]] on January 28, 1986; the first shuttle launch from Pad 39B and the first U.S. crewed launch failure, killing the seven crew members. An [[O-ring]] seal in the right booster rocket failed at liftoff, leading to subsequent structural failures. Flights resumed on September 29, 1988, with [[STS-26]] after modifications to many aspects of the shuttle program.\n\nOn February 1, 2003, ''Columbia'' and her crew of seven were lost during [[re-entry]] over Texas during the [[STS-107]] mission (the 113th shuttle flight); a vehicle breakup triggered by damage sustained during launch from Pad 39A on January 16, when a piece of foam insulation from the orbiter's external fuel tank struck the orbiter's left-wing. During reentry, the damage created a hole allowing hot gases to melt the wing structure. Like the ''Challenger'' disaster, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|resulting investigation and modifications]] interrupted shuttle flight operations at KSC for more than two years until the [[STS-114]] launch on July 26, 2005.\n\nThe shuttle program experienced five [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engine]] shutdowns at LC-39, all within four seconds before launch; and one [[Abort to Orbit]], [[STS-51-F]] on July 29, 1985. Shuttle missions during nearly 30 years of operations included deploying satellites and interplanetary probes, conducting space science and technology experiments, [[Shuttle\u2013Mir Program|visits to the Russian MIR space station]], construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]], deployment and servicing of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and serving as a [[Spacelab|space laboratory]]. The shuttle was retired from service in July 2011 after 135 launches.\n\n===Constellation===\nOn October 28, 2009, the [[Ares I-X]] launch from Pad 39B was the first uncrewed launch from KSC since the Skylab workshop in 1973.\n\n===Expendable launch vehicles (ELVs)===\nBeginning in 1958, NASA and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches (previously referred to as unmanned),<ref>{{cite web|title=Style Guide for NASA History Authors and Editors|url=https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/styleguide.html|website=NASA's History Office|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref> cooperating as they broke ground in the field. In the early 1960s, NASA had as many as two robotic mission launches a month. The frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles, as engineers gathered data, learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades. In 1963, with the intent of KSC [[Expendable launch vehicle|ELV]] work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities, a separate Atlas/Centaur organization was formed under NASA's Lewis Center (now [[Glenn Research Center|Glenn Research Center (GRC)]]), taking that responsibility from the Launch Operations Center (aka KSC).<ref name=Lipartito/>\n\nThough almost all robotics missions launched from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] (CCAFS), KSC \"oversaw the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the Cape.\"<ref name=Lipartito/> In 1965, KSC's Unmanned Launch Operations directorate became responsible all NASA uncrewed launch operations, including those at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. From the 1950s to 1978, KSC chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the U.S., overseeing their near launch processing and checkout. In addition to government missions, KSC performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also, though non-U.S. government entities provided reimbursement. NASA also funded CCAFS launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvements.\n\nAll this changed with the [[Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984]], after which NASA only coordinated its own and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) ELV launches. Companies were able to \"operate their own launch vehicles\"<ref name=Lipartito/> and utilize NASA's launch facilities. Payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of KSC. Reagan's 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from KSC to commercial companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Presidential Directive on National Space Policy|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/policy88.html|website=NASA|publisher=White House|accessdate=November 6, 2015|date=February 11, 1988}}</ref> That same year, launch complexes on CCAFS started transferring from NASA to air force management.<ref name=Lipartito/>\n\nIn the 1990s, though KSC was not performing the hands-on ELV work, engineers still maintained an understanding of ELVs and had contracts allowing them insight in the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight. KSC also worked on ELV research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize KSC personnel as a resource for technical issues. KSC, with the payload and launch vehicle industries, developed advances in automation of the ELV launch and ground operations to enable competitiveness of U.S. rockets against the global market.<ref name=Lipartito/>\n\nIn 1998, the [[Launch Services Program]] (LSP) formed at KSC, pulling together programs (and personnel) that already existed at KSC, GRC, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], and more to manage the launch of NASA and NOAA robotic missions. CCAFS and VAFB are the primary launch sites for LSP missions, though other sites are occasionally used. LSP payloads such as the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] have been processed at KSC before being transferred to a launch pad on CCAFS.\n\n===Space station processing===\n[[file:SSPF_interior.jpg|thumb|right|Node 2 being hoisted by overhead cranes in the [[Space Station Processing Facility]]]]\nAs the [[International Space Station]] modules design began in the early 1990s, KSC began to work with other NASA centers and international partners to prepare for processing before launch onboard the Space Shuttles. KSC utilized its hands-on experience processing the 22 [[Spacelab]] missions in the [[Operations and Checkout Building]] to gather expectations of ISS processing. These experiences were incorporated into the design of the [[Space Station Processing Facility]] (SSPF), which began construction in 1991. The Space Station Directorate formed in 1996. KSC personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processes.<ref name=Lipartito/>\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, KSC planned and performed [[Space Station Processing Facility#Station Integration Testing|on the ground integration tests and checkouts of station modules]]: three Multi-Element Integration Testing (MEIT) sessions and the Integration Systems Test (IST). Numerous issues were found and corrected that would have been difficult to nearly impossible to do on-orbit.\n\nToday KSC continues to process ISS payloads from across the world before launch along with developing its experiments for on orbit.<ref name=\"ISS Payloads\">{{cite web|title=Kennedy Space Center Payload Processing|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/stationpayloads/index.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref> The proposed [[Lunar Gateway]] would be manufactured and processed at the [[Space Station Processing Facility]].\n\n==Current programs and initiatives==\nThe following are current programs and initiatives at Kennedy Space Center:<ref name=\"NASA KSC Home\">{{cite web|title=Kennedy Space Center|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Commercial Crew Program]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Commercial Crew Program|url=https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref>\n*Exploration Ground Systems Program<ref>{{cite web |title=Exploration Ground Systems |url=https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/ground/index.html |publisher=NASA |accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n**NASA is currently designing the next heavy launch vehicle known as the [[Space Launch System|Space Launch System (SLS)]] for continuation of human spaceflight.\n**On December 5, 2014, NASA launched the first uncrewed flight test of the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]] (MPCV), currently under development to facilitate human exploration of the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/orion/about/index.html|title=Orion Overview|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=2015-04-12|newspaper=NASA|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/19292-nasa-orion-space-capsule-explained-infographic.html|title=Orion Explained: NASA's Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Infographic)|newspaper=Space.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref>\n*[[Launch Services Program]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Launching Rockets|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/index.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Launch Services Program#CubeSats|Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa)]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Small Satellite Missions|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/elana/index.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref>\n*Research and Technology<ref name=\"Research & Tech\"/>\n*[[International Space Station]] Payloads<ref name=\"ISS Payloads\"/>\n*Camp KSC: educational camps for schoolchildren in spring and summer, with a focus on space, aviation and robotics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/camp_faq.html |title=Camp Kennedy Space Center and Space Camp |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=NASA  |access-date=18 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Map of Kennedy Space Center.png|thumb|KSC industrial area]]\nThe KSC Industrial Area, where many of the center's support facilities are located, is {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} south of LC-39.

Kennedy]]'s 1961 goal of a crewed lunar landing by 1970 required an expansion of launch operations. On July 1, 1962, the Launch Operations Directorate was separated from MSFC to become the '''Launch Operations Center (LOC).''' Also, Cape Canaveral was inadequate to host the new launch facility design required for the mammoth {{convert|363|ft|m|adj=on}} tall, {{convert|7500000|lbf|kN|adj=on}} thrust [[Saturn V]] rocket, which would be assembled vertically in a large hangar and transported on a mobile platform to one of several launch pads.

The first of two uncrewed flights, [[Apollo 4]] (Apollo-Saturn 501) on November 9, 1967, was also the first rocket launch from KSC. The Saturn V's first crewed launch on December 21, 1968, was [[Apollo 8]]'s lunar orbiting mission. The next two missions tested the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]: [[Apollo 9]] (Earth orbit) and [[Apollo 10]] (lunar orbit). [[Apollo 11]], launched from Pad A on July 16, 1969, made the first Moon landing on July 20. [[Apollo 12]] followed four months later. From 1970 to 1972, the Apollo program concluded at KSC with the launches of missions 13 through 17.\n\n===Skylab===\n{{Main|Skylab}}\nOn May 14, 1973, the last [[Saturn V]] launch put the Skylab space station in orbit from Pad 39A. By this time, the Cape Kennedy pads 34 and 37 used for the Saturn IB were decommissioned, so Pad 39B was modified to accommodate the Saturn IB, and used to launch three crewed missions to Skylab that year, as well as the final Apollo spacecraft for the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] in 1975.\n\n===Space Shuttle===\n{{main|Space Shuttle program|List of space shuttle missions}}\n[[File:STS-60 Launch.jpg|thumb|left|[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Shuttle ''Discovery'']] launching from Pad 39A on [[STS-60]], February 3, 1994]]\n[[File:STS-36 Rollout - GPN-2000-000680.jpg|thumb|left|[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Shuttle ''Atlantis'']] is moved to Pad 39A for the 1990 launch of [[STS-36]].]]\n[[File:STS-129 Atlantis Ready to Fly - edit1.jpg|thumb|left|The Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' (STS-129) is seen on launch pad 39A at the NASA Kennedy Space Center shortly after the rotating service structure was rolled back on Nov. 15, 2009.]]\nAs the Space Shuttle was being designed, NASA received proposals for building alternative launch-and-landing sites at locations other than KSC, which demanded study. KSC had important advantages, including its existing facilities; location on the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]; and its southern latitude, which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near-equatorial orbits. Disadvantages included: its inability to safely launch military missions into [[polar orbit]], since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the Carolinas or Cuba; corrosion from the salt air; and frequent cloudy or stormy weather. Although building a new site at [[White Sands Missile Range]] in New Mexico was seriously considered, NASA announced its decision in April 1972 to use KSC for the shuttle.<ref name=\"heppenheimer1998\">{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA | author=Heppenheimer, T.

Concurrent with this event, the U.S. flag was painted on the south side of the VAB. During the late 1970s, LC-39 was reconfigured to support the Space Shuttle. Two [[Orbiter Processing Facility|Orbiter Processing Facilities]] were built near the VAB as hangars with a third added in the 1980s.\n\nKSC's {{convert|2.9|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] (SLF) was the orbiters' primary end-of-mission landing site, although the first KSC landing did not take place until the tenth flight, when ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' completed [[STS-41-B]] on February 11, 1984; the primary landing site until then was [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California, subsequently used as a backup landing site. The SLF also provided a [[Return To Launch Site|return-to-launch-site (RTLS) abort]] option, which was not utilized. The SLF is among the longest runways in the world.<ref>[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/facilities/slf.html Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF)]. Science.ksc.nasa.gov. Retrieved on May 5, 2012.</ref>\n\nAfter 24 successful shuttle flights, ''Challenger'' [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|was torn apart]] 73 seconds after the launch of [[STS-51-L]] on January 28, 1986; the first shuttle launch from Pad 39B and the first U.S. crewed launch failure, killing the seven crew members. An [[O-ring]] seal in the right booster rocket failed at liftoff, leading to subsequent structural failures. Flights resumed on September 29, 1988, with [[STS-26]] after modifications to many aspects of the shuttle program.\n\nOn February 1, 2003, ''Columbia'' and her crew of seven were lost during [[re-entry]] over Texas during the [[STS-107]] mission (the 113th shuttle flight); a vehicle breakup triggered by damage sustained during launch from Pad 39A on January 16, when a piece of foam insulation from the orbiter's external fuel tank struck the orbiter's left-wing. During reentry, the damage created a hole allowing hot gases to melt the wing structure. Like the ''Challenger'' disaster, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|resulting investigation and modifications]] interrupted shuttle flight operations at KSC for more than two years until the [[STS-114]] launch on July 26, 2005.\n\nThe shuttle program experienced five [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engine]] shutdowns at LC-39, all within four seconds before launch; and one [[Abort to Orbit]], [[STS-51-F]] on July 29, 1985. Shuttle missions during nearly 30 years of operations included deploying satellites and interplanetary probes, conducting space science and technology experiments, [[Shuttle\u2013Mir Program|visits to the Russian MIR space station]], construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]], deployment and servicing of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and serving as a [[Spacelab|space laboratory]]. The shuttle was retired from service in July 2011 after 135 launches.\n\n===Constellation===\nOn October 28, 2009, the [[Ares I-X]] launch from Pad 39B was the first uncrewed launch from KSC since the Skylab workshop in 1973.\n\n===Expendable launch vehicles (ELVs)===\nBeginning in 1958, NASA and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches (previously referred to as unmanned),<ref>{{cite web|title=Style Guide for NASA History Authors and Editors|url=https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/styleguide.html|website=NASA's History Office|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref> cooperating as they broke ground in the field. In the early 1960s, NASA had as many as two robotic mission launches a month. The frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles, as engineers gathered data, learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades. In 1963, with the intent of KSC [[Expendable launch vehicle|ELV]] work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities, a separate Atlas/Centaur organization was formed under NASA's Lewis Center (now [[Glenn Research Center|Glenn Research Center (GRC)]]), taking that responsibility from the Launch Operations Center (aka KSC).<ref name=Lipartito/>\n\nThough almost all robotics missions launched from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] (CCAFS), KSC \"oversaw the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the Cape.\"<ref name=Lipartito/> In 1965, KSC's Unmanned Launch Operations directorate became responsible all NASA uncrewed launch operations, including those at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. From the 1950s to 1978, KSC chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the U.S., overseeing their near launch processing and checkout. In addition to government missions, KSC performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also, though non-U.S. government entities provided reimbursement. NASA also funded CCAFS launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvements.\n\nAll this changed with the [[Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984]], after which NASA only coordinated its own and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) ELV launches. Companies were able to \"operate their own launch vehicles\"<ref name=Lipartito/> and utilize NASA's launch facilities. Payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of KSC. Reagan's 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from KSC to commercial companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Presidential Directive on National Space Policy|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/policy88.html|website=NASA|publisher=White House|accessdate=November 6, 2015|date=February 11, 1988}}</ref> That same year, launch complexes on CCAFS started transferring from NASA to air force management.<ref name=Lipartito/>\n\nIn the 1990s, though KSC was not performing the hands-on ELV work, engineers still maintained an understanding of ELVs and had contracts allowing them insight in the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight. KSC also worked on ELV research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize KSC personnel as a resource for technical issues. KSC, with the payload and launch vehicle industries, developed advances in automation of the ELV launch and ground operations to enable competitiveness of U.S. rockets against the global market.<ref name=Lipartito/>\n\nIn 1998, the [[Launch Services Program]] (LSP) formed at KSC, pulling together programs (and personnel) that already existed at KSC, GRC, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], and more to manage the launch of NASA and NOAA robotic missions. CCAFS and VAFB are the primary launch sites for LSP missions, though other sites are occasionally used. LSP payloads such as the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] have been processed at KSC before being transferred to a launch pad on CCAFS.\n\n===Space station processing===\n[[file:SSPF_interior.jpg|thumb|right|Node 2 being hoisted by overhead cranes in the [[Space Station Processing Facility]]]]\nAs the [[International Space Station]] modules design began in the early 1990s, KSC began to work with other NASA centers and international partners to prepare for processing before launch onboard the Space Shuttles. KSC utilized its hands-on experience processing the 22 [[Spacelab]] missions in the [[Operations and Checkout Building]] to gather expectations of ISS processing. These experiences were incorporated into the design of the [[Space Station Processing Facility]] (SSPF), which began construction in 1991. The Space Station Directorate formed in 1996. KSC personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processes.<ref name=Lipartito/>\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, KSC planned and performed [[Space Station Processing Facility#Station Integration Testing|on the ground integration tests and checkouts of station modules]]: three Multi-Element Integration Testing (MEIT) sessions and the Integration Systems Test (IST).

The peak number of persons working on center was 26,000 in 1968 (3,000 were civil servants). In 1970, [[President Nixon]] announced intent to reduce cost of space operations and major cuts occurred at KSC. By 1974, KSC's workforce was down to 10,000 employees (2,408 civil servants).<ref name=Lipartito/>\n\nA total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011. Approximately 2,100 <!--2010.

She grew up in Berlin, Germany and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had a child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  \n\nThe [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n==Life==\n=== Early life and education ===\nMendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including the composer Felix Mendelssohn.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, n\u00e9e Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3-5</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]]. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny C\u00e4cilia Mendelssohn Bartholdy.<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629</ref><ref>Citron (1994), p. 322</ref>\n\n[[File:Fannymendelssohn-improved.jpg|thumb|upright|Fanny Mendelssohn, sketched by her future husband [[Wilhelm Hensel]]]]\nWhile growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,<ref>Forney (2015), p. 278</ref> Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berliner-Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron, ''Mendelssohn, Fanny'' [Grove]</ref> \n\nAfter studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]], which was led by Zelter at the time.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \"She plays like a man.\"<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]], were equally impressed by both siblings.<ref>Conway (2011), p. 169</ref><ref>Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179</ref>\n\n=== Gender and class limitations ===\nIn the words of the music historian Kristine Forny, at this period \"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\".<ref>Forny et al. (2015), page ref not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n\nThe siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref>\n\nFelix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection,<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at Buckingham Palace, expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, \"Italien\" (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Worl (1997)</ref> Felix would even rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the Roman goddess of wisdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200156440/|title=Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, 1805\u20131847|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299\u2013301</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and later life===\nIn 1829, after a courtship of several years, Fanny married the painter [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=Citron0451 >Citron (2004), p. 51</ref>\n\nWilhelm, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike others of her circle, recommended that she publish her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=Citron0451 /> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> \n\nIn 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, ''Mendelssohn, Fanny''</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846).

They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.<ref>Citron, Marcia J. ''The Letters of Fanny Hensel to Felix Mendelssohn.''</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\n=== Style and form ===\nSince the 1990s, Mendelssohn's works and life history have increasingly gained attention. Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Mendelssohn's authorship of the ''Easter Sonata'', considers that Mendelssohn was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \"harmonic density\" that serves to express emotion.<ref>Mace (2013) p. 10</ref> \n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), no page cited</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), no page cited</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accomaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also displayed by her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, Breitkopf & Hartel. In 1850, the publisher began to distribute Mendelssohn's unreleased works, starting with ''Vier Lieder'' Op. 8.<ref>Todd (2010), p. 351</ref>\n\nFanny's only child, Sebastian Hensel, father of the philosopher [[Paul Hensel]] and the mathematician [[Kurt Hensel]], played a role in the historical preservation of the Mendelssohn family. He acquired 1,000 portraits from his father Wilhelm's possession, some of which depicted the family.<ref>Todd (2010), p. 356</ref> He also wrote a three-volume Mendelssohn family history titled ''Die Familie Mendelssohn 1729\u20131847'' (1879), which chronicled the family up until Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn's deaths. The family history was translated from German to English by Felix Mendelssohn's friend Carl Klingemann.<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref>  With many extracts from the letters and journals of Fanny, Felix and other family members, it remains as a valuable source of information about Mendelssohn's life, although new resources have emerged.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 356-357</ref> The writer Marian Kimber has suggested that its purpose was to depict a socially acceptable version of the Mendelssohn family, and that it therefore falsely claimed that Fanny Mendelssohn had no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the musicologist and editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref>Citron (2004), p. 51</ref> \n\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.komponistenquartier.de/komponistenquartier/ausstellungen/fanny-and-felix-mendelssohn-museum/|title=Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum|website=KomponistenQuartier Hamburg|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Fanny Mendelsshon's music has become better known thanks to concert performances and a number of CDs being released on labels such as [[Hyperion Records|Hyperion]] and [[Classic Produktion Osnabr\u00fcck|CPO]].

She grew up in Berlin, Germany and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had a child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  \n\nThe [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n==Life==\n=== Early life and education ===\nMendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including the composer Felix Mendelssohn.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, n\u00e9e Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3-5</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]].

(2015), page ref not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n\nThe siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref>\n\nFelix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection,<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at Buckingham Palace, expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, \"Italien\" (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Worl (1997)</ref> Felix would even rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the Roman goddess of wisdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200156440/|title=Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, 1805\u20131847|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840.

On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve.

They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.<ref>Citron, Marcia J. ''The Letters of Fanny Hensel to Felix Mendelssohn.''</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\n=== Style and form ===\nSince the 1990s, Mendelssohn's works and life history have increasingly gained attention. Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Mendelssohn's authorship of the ''Easter Sonata'', considers that Mendelssohn was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \"harmonic density\" that serves to express emotion.<ref>Mace (2013) p. 10</ref> \n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), no page cited</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), no page cited</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accomaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also displayed by her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, Breitkopf & Hartel. In 1850, the publisher began to distribute Mendelssohn's unreleased works, starting with ''Vier Lieder'' Op. 8.<ref>Todd (2010), p. 351</ref>\n\nFanny's only child, Sebastian Hensel, father of the philosopher [[Paul Hensel]] and the mathematician [[Kurt Hensel]], played a role in the historical preservation of the Mendelssohn family. He acquired 1,000 portraits from his father Wilhelm's possession, some of which depicted the family.<ref>Todd (2010), p. 356</ref> He also wrote a three-volume Mendelssohn family history titled ''Die Familie Mendelssohn 1729\u20131847'' (1879), which chronicled the family up until Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn's deaths. The family history was translated from German to English by Felix Mendelssohn's friend Carl Klingemann.<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref>  With many extracts from the letters and journals of Fanny, Felix and other family members, it remains as a valuable source of information about Mendelssohn's life, although new resources have emerged.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 356-357</ref> The writer Marian Kimber has suggested that its purpose was to depict a socially acceptable version of the Mendelssohn family, and that it therefore falsely claimed that Fanny Mendelssohn had no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the musicologist and editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref>Citron (2004), p. 51</ref> \n\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.komponistenquartier.de/komponistenquartier/ausstellungen/fanny-and-felix-mendelssohn-museum/|title=Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum|website=KomponistenQuartier Hamburg|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Fanny Mendelsshon's music has become better known thanks to concert performances and a number of CDs being released on labels such as [[Hyperion Records|Hyperion]] and [[Classic Produktion Osnabr\u00fcck|CPO]].
