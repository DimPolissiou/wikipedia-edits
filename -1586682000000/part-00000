She graduated from Sorabol College of the Arts (Today [[Chung-Ang University]]) and began submitting her writing to annual spring literary contests at age 19, but not winning until 1973 when she  won the Seoul Daily annual spring literary contest.\n\nLee's writing was intimately connected to her personal life and when she married a banker many people, including the author herself, worried if this would adversely affect her ability to write. Her marriage was a bit of a surprise as she had always planned to not get married and instead concentrate on writing. In the end, however, marriage and children did not affect Yi's ability to write and her strong dedication to writing helped to bring may contradictions in the state of Korean women to light.<ref>\"Yi Kyoung-ja\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: {{cite web|url=http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\nOne of the salient features of Lee's works is the flowing style of her sentences, which makes her writing fast-paced and readable whether it's a short story or full-length novel. It is within internal character dialogue, however, where her lively prose really shines. Lee often uses such dialogue as a means of revealing characters' conflicts and anguish. In these internal conversations, she uses authentic and colloquial language without excessive embellishment. Her novels feel genuine to readers due to the reality effect created by her natural use of everyday language. Even during the 1980s, when ideological discourse dominated literature, author Lee Kyung-ja's prose offered a sentimental view of women's experiences.

The heroine ultimately ends her marriage after meeting another man, her true love. In Lee's works, most women domesticated under the institution of marriage but later reborn as 'warriors of love,' are originally middle-class housewives enjoying comfortable lives. Lee's full-length novel, [Waking up Alone in the Morning] (1993), is a work of this type.<ref>Source-attribution| \"\uc774\uacbd\uc790\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: {{cite web|url=http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nLee has also used the biographical format in her novels. In one of Lee's works, the reader is introduced to a heroine who had once been full of hope as a little girl, before being cast into tragedy and suffering after marriage, a transformation that Lee describes in minute detail. In the oral tradition that existed before the modern literary era, women verbally recounted their life stories. In the same fashion, narrators in Lee Kyung-ja's works tell us tales from long lives centered on marriage, birth, unfaithful husbands, family feuds, and other critical events. Lee's acclaimed and prize-winning works such as [Love and Hurt] (1998) and [Affection Never Withers] (1999) are good examples of the kind of work described above.

Her marriage was a bit of a surprise as she had always planned to not get married and instead concentrate on writing.

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor, raising concerns about [[nepotism]]. He also stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel.

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor, raising concerns about [[nepotism]]. He also stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel.

The Officers of this Service are responsible for the Accounts and Finance Management of the Indian Railways. About 25-30 IRAS officers are recruited every year through [[Civil Services Examination]] conducted by [[Union Public Service Commission]]. At present, the IRAS Cadre has a Strength of about 800 Officers.\n\n== History of IRAS ==\nIn 1921, the [[William Mitchell Acworth|Acworth]] Committee recommended, and ratified through the Resolution for separation in 1924, that the [[Indian Railway]] finances should be separated from the General Finances. This segregation of Railway Finances together with acceptance in principle at least of the responsibility for the direct operation of its Railways was a watershed moment in the history of Railway Account Service, as it was for the Railways as a whole.<ref name = bookref>{{cite book|last=Verma|first=K. B.|title=Readings in Indian Railway Finance|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LxKUSZkEyoIC&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=1998|publisher= Academic Foundation|location=Delhi|pages=35\u201355}}</ref>\n\nThe growth and genesis of the service can be traced to the Acworth Committee report and becomes evident from these significant recommendations which are quoted below:\n\n<blockquote>\"''We recommend that the Finance Department should cease to control the internal finances of the Railways; that the Railways should have a separate Budget of their own, be responsible for earning and expending their own income and for providing such net revenues as is required to meet the interest on debt incurred on or to be incurred by the Government for Railways purposes; and that the Railways Budget should be presented to the Legislative Assembly not by the Finance minister of the council but by the member in charge of the Railways.\" (Paras 74, 76 and 127 of the Acworth Committee report)''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"''We recommend, that subject to independent audit by Government of India, the Railways Department should employ its own accounting staff and be responsible for its own accounts. We think that the present account and statistics should be thoroughly overhauled and remodeled with the assistance of experts familiar with recent practices in other countries.\" (Paras 129-134 of Acworth Committee Report)''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"''We recommend that greater facilities should be provided for training Indians for the superior posts in Railway service and that the process of their employment in such posts should be accelerated.\" (Paras 182-184 of Acworth Committee Report)''</blockquote>\n\nIt further goes on to recommend that the ''\"title of Railway Board be replaced by the title of Railway Commission and that under the member of Council for Communications there should be 4 commissioners and that out of the 4, one should be in charge of Finance and the organization ...\"''\n\nWith these recommendations not only was the segregation of Railway Finance clearly established, but the office of the Financial Commissioner was envisaged in an embryonic manner, and accordingly, the first Financial Commissioner was appointed on 1 April 1923. The necessity of such an appointment was thus emphasized by the Acworth Committee, The large financial responsibility of the department being perhaps sufficient justification in itself for the addition to the organization of a member competent to advise on the questions of great financial magnitude.<ref name = bookref />\n\nThe need for a new service was reinforced by yet another recommendation of the Acworth Committee which was with regard to the Railway Department having its own accounting staff and being responsible for its accounts, subject to an independent audit by the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|Auditor General of India]].<ref name = bookref />\n\nWith the post of Financial Commissioner firmly in place, the requirement for an organisational set up with staff became imminent, and the ground was clearly laid for the growth of a new service which would henceforth meet the burgeoning needs of the increasingly autonomous finance department of [[Indian Railways]].\n\nConsequently, it was just a matter of time before new service would gently disengage itself from the shackles of the [[Indian Audits and Accounts Service|Indian Audit and Accounts Service]] and the embryonic growth of a new service would announce itself.\n\nThe process was now set in motion and in the late 1920s, the [[Government of India]] decided to form a new Class I central service, viz IRAS, which would occupy top ranks of the Railway Accounts Department gradually replacing [[Indian Audits and Accounts Service|Indian Audit and Accounts Service]] officers.\n\nAccordingly, from 1 April 1929, the responsibility for the compilation of accounts for the Railways was taken over by the Financial Commissioner, Railways from the Auditor General. The Accounts organisation was thus brought under the control of the Financial Commissioner, Railways, and the Indian Railway Accounts Service was constituted simultaneously.<ref name = bookref />\n\nHowever, every process of birth has its hiccups, though technically it was intended that from 1929, recruitment should be for the new IRAS service, procedural formalities delayed this recruitment and so 2 officers of 1929 batch who were recruited for the [[Indian Audits and Accounts Service|Indian Audit and Accounts Service]] were \"permanently seconded\" to the IRAS. Accordingly, for the first time two officers, Mr Apjit Singh & Mr N C Deb joined the service. It was only in 1930 that two officers, Mr C T Venugopal and Mr D P Mathur, were recruited \"directly\" for the first time. The onward march of the service had clearly begun.\n\nThe closing years of the 1950s and the fore part of the 1960s remain perhaps the most memorable for the chronicler of IRAS in many ways. The cadre burgeoned by more than 50 in just three years. Massive investments in the second Five Year Plan provided a windfall for [[Indian Railways]], with the inevitable challenge to finance management. Cadre management came to occupy the attention of the top brass. Modernisation of accounting work with mainframe computers also began in this period. The service continued to wade through these tumultuous waters through the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the position of [[Indian Railway]] Finances deteriorated as the organisation hitherto had been working more for fulfilment of social obligations of the [[Government of India]] like providing employment, affordable and subsidised transport to the common public etc. The Rakesh Mohan Committee report in 2001 on [[Indian Railways]] Finances observed thus ...\n\n''The Indian Railways (IR) has been a vital component of the social, political and economic life of the country. IR's transportation network has played a key role in weaving India into a nation. This network has not only integrated markets but also people across the length and breadth of this huge country. IR's role in times of war and natural calamities has also been commendable: it has always risen to the occasion and transported men and materials in large numbers at short notice. It is because of these reasons that IR is one of the foremost institutions of the country today. At the same time, because of a series of developments in the 1990s, IR is today on the verge of a financial crisis. Urgent action is needed to revitalise it so that it can continue to serve the nation.''\n\n''... These tendencies became accentuated in the 1990s and the economics of IR are now extremely vulnerable. For first time in 17 years last year IR was not able to pay a dividend to the government on its past investment. It is in financial crisis.

The Officers of this Service are responsible for the Accounts and Finance Management of the Indian Railways. About 25-30 IRAS officers are recruited every year through [[Civil Services Examination]] conducted by [[Union Public Service Commission]]. At present, the IRAS Cadre has a Strength of about 800 Officers.\n\n== History of IRAS ==\nIn 1921, the [[William Mitchell Acworth|Acworth]] Committee recommended, and ratified through the Resolution for separation in 1924, that the [[Indian Railway]] finances should be separated from the General Finances. This segregation of Railway Finances together with acceptance in principle at least of the responsibility for the direct operation of its Railways was a watershed moment in the history of Railway Account Service, as it was for the Railways as a whole.<ref name = bookref>{{cite book|last=Verma|first=K. B.|title=Readings in Indian Railway Finance|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LxKUSZkEyoIC&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q&f=false |year=1998|publisher= Academic Foundation|location=Delhi|pages=35\u201355}}</ref>\n\nThe growth and genesis of the service can be traced to the Acworth Committee report and becomes evident from these significant recommendations which are quoted below:\n\n<blockquote>\"''We recommend that the Finance Department should cease to control the internal finances of the Railways; that the Railways should have a separate Budget of their own, be responsible for earning and expending their own income and for providing such net revenues as is required to meet the interest on debt incurred on or to be incurred by the Government for Railways purposes; and that the Railways Budget should be presented to the Legislative Assembly not by the Finance minister of the council but by the member in charge of the Railways.\" (Paras 74, 76 and 127 of the Acworth Committee report)''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"''We recommend, that subject to independent audit by Government of India, the Railways Department should employ its own accounting staff and be responsible for its own accounts. We think that the present account and statistics should be thoroughly overhauled and remodeled with the assistance of experts familiar with recent practices in other countries.\" (Paras 129-134 of Acworth Committee Report)''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"''We recommend that greater facilities should be provided for training Indians for the superior posts in Railway service and that the process of their employment in such posts should be accelerated.\" (Paras 182-184 of Acworth Committee Report)''</blockquote>\n\nIt further goes on to recommend that the ''\"title of Railway Board be replaced by the title of Railway Commission and that under the member of Council for Communications there should be 4 commissioners and that out of the 4, one should be in charge of Finance and the organization ...\"''\n\nWith these recommendations not only was the segregation of Railway Finance clearly established, but the office of the Financial Commissioner was envisaged in an embryonic manner, and accordingly, the first Financial Commissioner was appointed on 1 April 1923. The necessity of such an appointment was thus emphasized by the Acworth Committee, The large financial responsibility of the department being perhaps sufficient justification in itself for the addition to the organization of a member competent to advise on the questions of great financial magnitude.<ref name = bookref />\n\nThe need for a new service was reinforced by yet another recommendation of the Acworth Committee which was with regard to the Railway Department having its own accounting staff and being responsible for its accounts, subject to an independent audit by the [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|Auditor General of India]].<ref name = bookref />\n\nWith the post of Financial Commissioner firmly in place, the requirement for an organisational set up with staff became imminent, and the ground was clearly laid for the growth of a new service which would henceforth meet the burgeoning needs of the increasingly autonomous finance department of [[Indian Railways]].\n\nConsequently, it was just a matter of time before new service would gently disengage itself from the shackles of the [[Indian Audits and Accounts Service|Indian Audit and Accounts Service]] and the embryonic growth of a new service would announce itself.\n\nThe process was now set in motion and in the late 1920s, the [[Government of India]] decided to form a new Class I central service, viz IRAS, which would occupy top ranks of the Railway Accounts Department gradually replacing [[Indian Audits and Accounts Service|Indian Audit and Accounts Service]] officers.\n\nAccordingly, from 1 April 1929, the responsibility for the compilation of accounts for the Railways was taken over by the Financial Commissioner, Railways from the Auditor General. The Accounts organisation was thus brought under the control of the Financial Commissioner, Railways, and the Indian Railway Accounts Service was constituted simultaneously.<ref name = bookref />\n\nHowever, every process of birth has its hiccups, though technically it was intended that from 1929, recruitment should be for the new IRAS service, procedural formalities delayed this recruitment and so 2 officers of 1929 batch who were recruited for the [[Indian Audits and Accounts Service|Indian Audit and Accounts Service]] were \"permanently seconded\" to the IRAS. Accordingly, for the first time two officers, Mr Apjit Singh & Mr N C Deb joined the service. It was only in 1930 that two officers, Mr C T Venugopal and Mr D P Mathur, were recruited \"directly\" for the first time. The onward march of the service had clearly begun.\n\nThe closing years of the 1950s and the fore part of the 1960s remain perhaps the most memorable for the chronicler of IRAS in many ways. The cadre burgeoned by more than 50 in just three years. Massive investments in the second Five Year Plan provided a windfall for [[Indian Railways]], with the inevitable challenge to finance management. Cadre management came to occupy the attention of the top brass. Modernisation of accounting work with mainframe computers also began in this period. The service continued to wade through these tumultuous waters through the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the position of [[Indian Railway]] Finances deteriorated as the organisation hitherto had been working more for fulfilment of social obligations of the [[Government of India]] like providing employment, affordable and subsidised transport to the common public etc. The Rakesh Mohan Committee report in 2001 on [[Indian Railways]] Finances observed thus ...\n\n''The Indian Railways (IR) has been a vital component of the social, political and economic life of the country. IR's transportation network has played a key role in weaving India into a nation. This network has not only integrated markets but also people across the length and breadth of this huge country. IR's role in times of war and natural calamities has also been commendable: it has always risen to the occasion and transported men and materials in large numbers at short notice. It is because of these reasons that IR is one of the foremost institutions of the country today. At the same time, because of a series of developments in the 1990s, IR is today on the verge of a financial crisis. Urgent action is needed to revitalise it so that it can continue to serve the nation.''\n\n''... These tendencies became accentuated in the 1990s and the economics of IR are now extremely vulnerable. For first time in 17 years last year IR was not able to pay a dividend to the government on its past investment. It is in financial crisis. Its ability to invest adequately in providing efficient and cost competitive services in the future is seriously in question. Thus IR is in a watershed period in its history today and therefore drastic action needs to be taken in a number of areas to make this august organisation the country's pride once again.''\n\nThe officers of IRAS along with the executives responded to the challenges and within a short period of 5\u20136 years, [[Indian Railways]] was a financially vibrant organisation. In the year 2007-08, [[Indian Railways]] had a cash surplus of 250 billion rupees.\n\nRecently, Finance department of Railways has embarked upon computerising its whole accounting and finance functions by implementing a customised software called AFRES (Advance Finance Railway Earning & Expenditure System).\n\n'''Firsts in IRAS - '''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| First IRAS Officer\n| Mr Devender yadav, IRAS, 1930\n|-\n| First IRAS Financial Commissioner\n| Mr K S Bhandari, IRAS, 1939\n|-\n| First IRAS officer secretary to Government of India\n| Mr Y T Shah, IRAS, 1944\n|-\n| First IRAS General Manager\n| Mr R Narsimhan, IRAS, 1955\n|-\n| First Lady IRAS Officer\n| Mrs Priya Prakash, IRAS, 1957\n|-\n| First Lady IRAS Financial Commissioner(Railways)\n| Mrs Vijayalakshmi Viswanathan, IRAS, 1967\n|-\n| First lady IRAS officer to be appointed as Secretary to the Govt of India\n| Mrs Usha Mathur, IRAS\n|}\n\n==Attachments with various institutes==\n\n*'''Alma Mater at  '''Indian Railway Institute of Financial Management, (IRIFM), Secunderabad \n\n* '''Railway Foundation Course''' at [[Railway Staff College|National Academy of Indian Railway (NAIR), Vadodara]]. \n* '''Tourism and Hospitality management Training''' at [https://www.irctc.co.in/ Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC)]\n* '''Accounts Training''' at [http://ctara.gov.in/ Centralised Training Academy for Railway Accounts (C-TARA), Secundarabad]\n* '''Secretariat Training''' at [http://www.istm.gov.in/ Institute for Institute of Secretariat Training and Management (ISTM), New Delhi]\n* '''Ethical Governance Training''' at  [http://in.iofc.org/ Initiatives of Change (IofC), Panchgani]\n* '''Accounts Training''' at [http://naaa.gov.in/ National Academy Of Audit and Accounts (NAAA), Shimla]\n* '''Container Logistics Training''' at [http://www.concorindia.com/ Inland Container Depot (ICD), Tughlaqabad]\n* '''Signals and Tele-communications Training''' at [[Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications|Indian Railways Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications (IRISET), Secundarabad]]\n*'''P-Way, Works and Contract Management Training''' at [http://www.iricen.gov.in/iricen/Home Indian Railway Institute of Civil Engineering (IRICEN), Pune]\n* '''Locomotive, Rolling Stock and Workshop Management Training''' at [[Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering|Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (IRIMEE), Jamalpur]]\n* '''Electric Traction and Railway Electrification Management Training''' at [[Indian Railway Institute of Electrical Engineering|Indian Railway Institute of Electrical Engineering (IRIEEN), Nashik]]\n* '''Infrastructure Security Management Training''' at [[Jagjivan Ram Railway Protection Force Academy|Jagjivan Ram Railway Protection Force Academy (JRRPF), Lucknow]]\n* '''Railway Information Infrastructure Management Training''' at [[Centre for Railway Information Systems|Centre for Railway information systems (CRIS), New Delhi]]\n* '''Parliamentary Procedures Training''' at [http://bpst.nic.in/ Bureau of Parliamentary Studies and Training (BPST), New Delhi]\n* '''Divisional attachments''' at 68 divisions spread across the length and breadth of the country\n*'''Industrial Field visits''' - Coal India, Aditya Birla Cements, TATA, Bhilai Steel Plant\n*'''Port Attachments''' - Paradip, Vishakhapatnam, JNPT, Mangalore, Krishnapatnam, Ennore etc.\n* '''Appreciation Visits to various Railway establishments''' situated in difficult terrains - [[Konkan Railway]]s, [[Kothavalasa\u2013Kirandul line|K-K Line]], Shimla-Kalka Toy Train, Nilgiri Railway, [[Jammu\u2013Baramulla line|Udhampur-Srinagar]], Pamban Bridge\n* Foreign attachment at Canada/USA and Germany/France/Russia\n* attachment at RBI\n* Attachment at NADT,Nagpur( IRS IT Academy), at NACEN, Faridabad( IRS Custom Academy), at NAAA, Shimla (IAAS Academy)\n* Attachment at NADFM, PUNE( IDAS Academy)\n* attachment at NIFM, Faridabad\n\n== Role and Function ==\nThe Finance and Accounts functions are integrated with the executive at all levels in the [[Railways]].

He had just turned 17 years of age when he was promoted, on 10 September 1950, from the club's reserve and youth squad for a [[Dublin City Cup]] trip to Limerick's [[Market's Field]]. Keeping his place for the next two games which were away from home he made his [[Oriel Park]] debut on 31 December 1950 in a [[League of Ireland]] as a substitute in a game against Sligo Rovers.\n\nHe was a member of a high quality Dundalk youth squad that had progressed to the semi-finals of both the FAI and Leinster Minor Cups and included some International and Inter-League players. For the next season, his place was with the reserves until injuries saw him line out in a League game against Sligo in early February, on the weekend before the first round 1952 [[FAI Cup]] clash versus St Patrick's Athletic. This time there was no going back to the reserves. A superb Cup game secured his place for the remainder of the season, thanks to a merciless sliding tackle and a deceptive turn of speed. A tough tackling, uncompromising defender, by the season's end he had in his possession a coveted FAI Cup medal, after Dundalk defeated Cork Athletic in a final replay, an Amateur international Cap against Scotland.\n\n===Southampton===\nHe turned down offers from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Manchester City]] to join Southampton in June 1952; he made his debut on 11 October 1952 away to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] making 10 appearances as Saints went on to be relegated from Division 2 at the end of that season.\n\nThe following season, in Division 3, he became the club's regular left-back and his merciless sliding tackles and deceptive turn of pace stood him in good stead as Saints began the long haul back to Division 2. Although he was not the most athletic player, he had a super football brain and a great left foot.\n\nTommy won eight [[Republic of Ireland national football team]] caps between 1954 and 1964 making his debut against Luxembourg in 1954 [http://www.soccerscene.ie/sssenior/matchdetails.php?id=61].\n\nBy the time of Southampton's promotion season in 1966, age was catching up with him and he only made one appearance in his final season, at home to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston]] on 27 November 1965.\n\nIn his later years, he became an influential figure at the club, and he was granted a prestigious testimonial against [[FC Twente]].\n\nDuring his time at The Dell he amassed 487 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals.\n\n==After football==\nTraynor was a founding member of the Southampton Tyro League in the late 1960s. After retiring at the end of the 1965\u201366 season, he briefly ran an off-licence and worked in Southampton Docks.\n\nHe died in September 2006 at the age of 73 after a short illness.\n\n==Honours==\n'''Dundalk'''\n*[[FAI Cup]] winners: 1952\n*[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] \n*[[Football League Division 3]] champions: 1959\u201360\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |\n   author=Duncan Holley & Gary Chalk |\n   title=In That Number - A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC  |\n   publisher=Hagiology Publishing |\n   year=2003|\n   isbn=0-9534474-3-X}}\n*{{cite book |\n   author=Duncan Holley & Gary Chalk |\n   title=The Alphabet of the Saints|\n   publisher= ACL & Polar Publishing |\n   year=1992|\n   isbn=0-9514862-3-3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.irishsaints.moonfruit.com/tommytraynor Irish  Tribute to Tommy Traynor]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929060055/http://www.tyrosouthampton.co.uk/default.aspx?qShow=TommyTraynor&HPIndex=3 Tribute to Tommy Traynor]\n* [http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=7498 Tribute to Tommy Traynor on Southampton F.C. website]\n* [http://soccerscene.ie/sssenior/player.php?id=481 Republic of Ireland profile]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Traynor, Tommy}}\n[[Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers]]\n[[Category:Republic of Ireland international footballers]]\n[[Category:League of Ireland players]]\n[[Category:Dundalk F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Southampton F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Association footballers from County Louth]]\n[[Category:People from Dundalk]]\n[[Category:1933 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Association football fullbacks]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the Irish footballer|the Scottish footballer|Tommy Traynor (Scottish footballer)}}\n{{no footnotes|date=September 2011}}\n{{Infobox football biography\n| name = Tommy Traynor\n| image = \n| fullname = Thomas Joseph Traynor\n| height = {{height|ft=5|in=8}}\n| birth_date  = {{birth date|df=yes|1933|7|22}}\n| birth_place = [[Dundalk]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n| death_date  = {{death date and age|df=yes|2006|9|20|1933|7|22}}\n| death_place = [[Southampton]], [[England]] \n| position = [[Defender (football)#Full back|Left back]]\n| years1 = 1950\u20131952 \n| years2 = 1952\u20131966\n| clubs1 = [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]]  \n| clubs2 = [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]\n| caps1 =  10\n| caps2 = 434  \n| goals1 = 0\n| goals2 = 7 \n| nationalyears1 = 1954\u20131964\n| nationalteam1 = [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]\n| nationalcaps1 = 8  \n| nationalgoals1 = 0 \n| pcupdate = \n| ntupdate =\n}}\n'''Thomas Joseph''' \"'''Tommy'''\" '''Traynor''' (22 July 1933 \u2013 20 September 2006) was an Irish [[association football|footballer]] who played his entire English professional career for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] between 1952 and 1966.\n\nDuring his 14 years at [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|The Dell]] he became virtually an institution, and by the end of his career he held the record for appearances for Southampton.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Dundalk===\nTraynor was born in [[Dundalk]] and originally was the product of local club St Patricks.

Although he was not the most athletic player, he had a super football brain and a great left foot.\n\nTommy won eight [[Republic of Ireland national football team]] caps between 1954 and 1964 making his debut against Luxembourg in 1954 [http://www.soccerscene.ie/sssenior/matchdetails.php?id=61].\n\nBy the time of Southampton\u2019s promotion season in 1966, age was catching up with him and he only made one appearance in his final season, at home to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston]] on 27 November 1965.\n\nIn his later years, he became an influential figure at the club, and he was granted a prestigious testimonial against [[FC Twente]].\n\nDuring his time at The Dell he amassed 487 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals.\n\n==After football==\nTraynor was a founding member of the Southampton Tyro League in the late 1960s. After retiring at the end of the 1965\u201366 season, he briefly ran an off-licence and worked in Southampton Docks.\n\nHe died in September 2006 at the age of 73 after a short illness.\n\n==Honours==\n'''Dundalk'''\n*[[FAI Cup]] winners: 1952\n*[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] \n*[[Football League Division 3]] champions: 1959\u201360\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |\n   author=Duncan Holley & Gary Chalk |\n   title=In That Number - A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC  |\n   publisher=Hagiology Publishing |\n   year=2003|\n   isbn=0-9534474-3-X}}\n*{{cite book |\n   author=Duncan Holley & Gary Chalk |\n   title=The Alphabet of the Saints|\n   publisher= ACL & Polar Publishing |\n   year=1992|\n   isbn=0-9514862-3-3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.irishsaints.moonfruit.com/tommytraynor Irish  Tribute to Tommy Traynor]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929060055/http://www.tyrosouthampton.co.uk/default.aspx?qShow=TommyTraynor&HPIndex=3 Tribute to Tommy Traynor]\n* [http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=7498 Tribute to Tommy Traynor on Southampton F.C. website]\n* [http://soccerscene.ie/sssenior/player.php?id=481 Republic of Ireland profile]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Traynor, Tommy}}\n[[Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers]]\n[[Category:Republic of Ireland international footballers]]\n[[Category:League of Ireland players]]\n[[Category:Dundalk F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Southampton F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Association footballers from County Louth]]\n[[Category:People from Dundalk]]\n[[Category:1933 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Association football fullbacks]]\n", "name_user": "GiantSnowman", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, remove unref height", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Traynor"}

The character has also appeared in short stories, and two of the novels have been adapted into successful [[action thriller]] [[Jack Reacher (film)|films]], starring [[Tom Cruise]] as Reacher.\n\n==Development and author's commentary==\n===Development===\nAt the time Lee Child sat down to write his first novel ''[[Killing Floor (novel)|Killing Floor]]'', he was unemployed, having been fired from his position as a presentation director for [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]].<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/><ref name= \"ClaireWhite2001\"/><ref name= \"Bob Cornwell\"/> According to Child, authorship was a purely pragmatic decision: \"I wasn't one of these people that felt compelled to write. It had to keep a roof over our heads, so it was totally, totally 110% commercially motivated.\"<ref name= \"Bob Cornwell\"/>\n\nCritics have perceived other influences in Jack Reacher's creation. Bob Cornwell quotes Lee Child's reply in another interview as having created Reacher \"as an antidote, to all the depressed and miserable alcoholics that increasingly peopled the genre\".<ref name= \"ClaireWhite2001\"/><ref name= \"Bob Cornwell\"/> Similarly, editor [[Otto Penzler]] published an essay by Child explaining that Jack Reacher was created deliberately in contrast to the prevailing trends in crime fiction. His name is short and commonplace, as opposed to quirky or unusual; Reacher's  personal ethics and wandering lifestyle are reminiscent of the chivalrous [[knight errant]] of medieval lore as opposed to an [[anti-hero]] tormented by addiction and haunted by past misbehavior.<ref>Otto Penzler (editor) ''The lineup: the world's greatest crime writers tell the inside story of their greatest detectives''. Little, Brown (2009)</ref>\n\nThe character's name first came to Child in a supermarket when an old lady, noting the span of Child's arms, asked for his help in reaching out to a can of pears. On seeing this, Child's wife commented that if his writing career did not work out he could \"always get a job as a reacher in a supermarket\".<ref name= \"EmilySargent2011\"/> Reacher's ex-military background was a specific and tactical choice on his behalf. Child has explained, \"I thought that I would do a book that's not the same as everybody else's. Everybody else had their guy working: a private guy in [[Boston]] or a police lieutenant in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]], or wherever. I thought, 'Well, he won't be working, and he won't live anywhere, and let's just take it from there.'\" Child also felt that this origin would lend itself to the character's personality and nomadic lifestyle: \"This idea of the rootless alienation has got to come from somewhere, and I noticed that the most alienated people are always ex-military, because it's like going from one solar system to the other, it's so different. So that was an easy choice: Make him ex-military. Then make him ex-military police because, broadly speaking, these would be crime novels, and he had to have some investigative experience, and he had to understand procedures and forensics and so on. So that part was all set in stone\".<ref name=\"RobertBidinotto2007\">{{cite web|last=Bidinotto |first= Robert |title=Thriller: Lee Child and the creation of Jack Reacher |url= http://atlassociety.org/commentary/commentary-blog/4508-thriller-lee-child-and-the-creation-of-jack-reacher |magazine= The Atlas Society |date= 17 March 2011 |accessdate= 8 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Similarities between Reacher and Lee Child====\nNumerous critics have pointed out the various similarities between Lee Child and Jack Reacher. Bryan Curtis, writing for ''[[Grantland]]'', and Natasha Harding and Caroline Iggulden, in a separate article for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', have brought out the various similarities between Child and Reacher: Child is {{convert|6|ft|4|in|abbr=on}} tall while his protagonist stands  {{convert|6|ft|5|in|abbr=on}}; both writer and creation constantly consume coffee; Like Reacher, Child \"lives in cheap pairs of jeans and T-shirts and finds the idea of buying expensive clothes to be irrational\"; and that \"Jack Reacher's famous physical qualities are based on Child's playground memories as a child\".<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/> Child tends to agree with such observations: \"I was huge as a kid and Reacher's stature is me translated as a kid. I enjoyed being bigger and fighting shamelessly. I've done a fair amount of [[headbutt]]ing. It's an awesome manoeuvre.\"{{refn|group=note|The headbutt is considered Reacher's \"signature move\".<ref name= \"AndyMartin2015\"/>}} Andy Martin notes that \"just as Reacher is half-[[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], half-[[John Rambo|Rambo]], Child is both art-for-art's-sake [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]] and ruthless businessman.\"<ref name=\"AndyMartin2015\">{{cite web |last=Martin |first= Andy |title= Lee Child on Jack Reacher: How the best-selling author writes his mysteries |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/lee-child-on-jack-reacher-how-the-best-selling-author-writes-his-mysteries-9959227.html |magazine= [[The Independent]] |date= January 2015 |accessdate= 5 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nCurtis, as well as Harding and Iggulden, have also considered the role Child's dismissal from Granada had on Reacher's development. Curtis also notes that \"Child created Reacher from the smoldering embers of his own rage. It might seem like a simplistic theory, but it's true. Like the author, Reacher was workplace surplus: He was a [[military police]]man in an era of Army [[Layoff|downsizing]]. The act of leaving his job turned Reacher into a protective figure, an avenging angel.\" He finds that Reacher's actions are a manifestation of Child's anger at his sacking and that his violent ways of dealing with villains is 'cathartic' to the author.<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/>\n\n===Author's commentary and interpretation===\n[[File:Lee Child, Bouchercon 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lee Child|Jim Grant]], better known by his pen name Lee Child, at [[Bouchercon XLI]], 2010]]\n \nLee Child views Jack Reacher as a \"happy-go-lucky guy.

On the surface, he is an ex-military cop who is suddenly dumped out into the civilian world. He doesn't fit in, and he spends his time wandering America, seeing the things that he's never had time to see before. He's trying to stay out of trouble, but masterfully once a year getting into trouble. He's also the descendant of a very ancient tradition: the noble loner, the knight errant, the mysterious stranger, who has shown up in stories forever\u2026 He is a truly universal character... I'm writing the modern iteration of a character who has existed for thousands of years.\"<ref name=\"AndreaSachs2012\">{{cite web |last=Sachs |first= Andrea |title= Lee Child on His New Thriller, Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher and Wandering Heroes |url= http://entertainment.time.com/2012/09/19/lee-child-on-his-new-thriller-tom-cruise-as-jack-reacher-and-wandering-heroes/ |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 2012 |accessdate= 5 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn another interview for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, Child further analyses the mythology of his character:\n\n<blockquote>The stories that I love are basically about the knight-errant, the mysterious stranger. And the reason why people think that's an essentially American paradigm is the Westerns. The Westerns were absolutely rock solid with that stuff. You know, the mysterious rider comes in off the range, sorts out the problem, and rides off into the sunset. It is just such a total paradigm, but not invented in America. That was imported from the medieval tales of Europe. The knight-errant: literally a knight, somehow banished and forced to wander the land doing good deeds. It's part of storytelling in every culture. Japan has it with the ronin myth; every culture has this Robin Hood idea. So really, that character was forced out of Europe as Europe became more densely populated and more civilized. That character no longer had stories in Europe; it had to migrate to where the frontier was still open and dangerous, which was America, essentially. So the character, I think, is actually universal and historic, most recently, normally represented in America. I think the Westerns saw it firmly adopted by America, so yeah, right now, we think of this as a completely American character, but really, it's more historic than that. But I'm very happy to have that reference made.<ref name=\"AlexBerenson2014\">{{cite web |last=Berenson |first= Alex |title= What Lee Child Has Learned from Writing the Jack Reacher Books |url= http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a30736/jack-reacher-lee-child-interview/ |magazine= [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |accessdate= 5 March 2016 |date=December 2014}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nChild also views Reacher as \"[[Postfeminism|post-feminist]]\" stating that he does not parlay in \"gender distinction...Reacher likes strong, realistic women, and he treats women with respect...he doesn't cut them any slack, but also he has no negative preconceptions.

He has no middle name, and most people simply call him 'Reacher', even his family as a child. Regular references are made to the fact that Reacher's given name is Jack, which is not a nickname for John, and that he has no middle name.  His military record officially refers to him as Jack (none) Reacher.<ref name= DenOfGeek/> From the time he was a boy, his family, even his mother, simply called him \"Reacher\", an appellation that has stayed with him, but was never given to his brother.<ref name= \"LeeChildOfficial\"/>\n\nReacher's mother Josephine Moutier Reacher (n\u00e9e Moutier) was a French national, and Reacher was fluent in French from early childhood,<ref name=\"Enemy\">Child (2004). ''The Enemy''.</ref> but as he admits in ''The Affair'' (2011) he speaks the language ''Un peu, mais lentement'' (\"A little, but slowly\"). Reacher's maternal grandfather was at the Battle of Verdun in the First World War and in the French Resistance in the Second, and lived to a ripe old age, which in Reacher's view means that his grandfather had \"beaten the odds\".\n\n===Military years and profile===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:USAMPC-COA.png|thumb|150px|left|Regimental Coat of Arms of the United States Military Police Corps]]\n\nAfter being shunted around the world, growing up on U.S. military bases where his father Stan was stationed, he gained an education in basic survival as well as an opportunity to enter the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.

When his clothes get dirty he simply goes to the local hardware store and buys a functional pair of chinos and a workman's shirt and stuffs the old ones in the bin. No mortgage, no wife, no ties, he is a perfectly free agent, unlimited and unbound, incapable of ever settling down.<ref name=\"EmilySargent2011\">{{cite web|last= Sargent|first= Emily|title=Killer instinct: Is Tom Cruise the right man to play Lee Child's savage anti-hero on screen?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/killer-instinct-is-tom-cruise-the-right-man-to-play-lee-childs-savage-anti-hero-on-screen-6252359.html |magazine=[[The Independent]] | accessdate=1 March 2016|date=30 October 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLee Child describes Reacher's obsession to wander about:\n\n<blockquote>He's an ex-military policeman, and he was demobilized in his middle thirties after having served all of his adult life in the [U.S.] Army and having grown up on Marine bases, because his father was a Marine. The idea was to have a character that was plausibly rootless. Most people who are wanderers do it for other reasons\u2014they are mentally ill, or something like that. Reacher is completely competent, but he's just habituated to this fragmented life in the military, so he can't settle into civilian society. The idea of staying anywhere for more than a few days is [[anathema]] to him.<ref name= \"RobertBidinotto2007\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Demeanor and personality==\nReacher himself expounds on a hypothesis about this vagrant life-style in ''[[Never Go Back (Lee Child novel)|Never Go Back]]''. He states that he has a genetic disposition towards roaming about, citing the [[British Empire]], the [[Vikings]], and the [[Polynesians]] as groups with a similar wanderlust. While he accepts that [[Human migration|there was an economical necessity]] behind their voyages, he maintains that \"some of them could not stop\". He feels that long ago when [[Prehistory|humans lived in small bands]], there was a risk of [[inbreeding]] as a result of which a [[gene]] developed over the course of [[evolution]] such that \"every generation and every small band had at least one person who had to wander\". This would lead to \"mixing up of [[gene pool]]s\" and would be \"healthier all around\". Reacher concludes:\n\n{{quote|I think ninety-nine of us grow up to love the campfire, and one grows up to hate it. Ninety-nine of us grow up to fear the howling wolf, and one grows up to envy it. And I'm that guy.\n\nCompelled to spread his [[DNA]] worldwide. Purely for the good of the species.<ref>{{cite book| title = Never Go Back|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2013|isbn =9781409030805 |location =London |chapter= Chapter 38}}</ref>}}\n\nReacher's large physique means his character is sometimes mistaken by other people. For example, in ''[[Die Trying (novel)|Die Trying]]'', Reacher is wrongly suspected by the FBI of being involved in a kidnapping, which assesses him (solely on the basis of a few photos) as such: \"The big guy is different. Different clothes, different stance, different physically. He could be foreign, at least partly, or maybe second generation. Fair hair and blue eyes, but there's something in his face. Maybe he's European, perhaps a European mercenary or terrorist.\"<ref>{{cite book| first= Lee| last= Child |title= Die Trying| url= https://archive.org/details/dietrying00chil| url-access= registration|year=|chapter= Chapter 22}}</ref> Reacher is aware of this perception. In ''[[Make Me (novel)|Make Me]]'' Reacher gets off a train in a remote town called Mother's Rest, simply because he likes the name of the town. When he sees a woman approaching him with a look of expectation, he immediately understands that the person she was waiting for must be very tall like him, as it is his standout feature when people first meet him.\n\nIn ''[[Echo Burning]]'', Reacher narrates how he first turned \"his fear into aggression\". He was about four when he watched a television show on space adventures. One episode depicted a [[Extraterrestrial life|space monster]] which then terrified the young Reacher. He was [[Insomnia|unable to sleep]] for days, thinking the monster was under his bed and would get him if he tried to sleep. According to Reacher, he then became angry: \"Not at myself for being afraid, because as far as I was concerned the thing was totally real and I should be afraid. I got mad at the thing for making me afraid. For threatening me\". Reacher then one night \"kind of exploded with fury\". In his words, Reacher \"raced down the monster\" and successfully changed his fear into fury. He also stated he has never been scared since.<ref>{{cite book| title = Echo Burning|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2001|isbn =0-515-13331-0 |location =London | chapter =Chapter 6| quote= One night I just kind of exploded with fury. I yelled O-K-, come out and try it! Just damn well try it! I'll beat the shit right out of you! I raced it down. I turned the fear into aggression.}}</ref>\n\nThis fact is later referenced in ''Never Go Back'', when an Army psychological study of fear in children is cited that shows Reacher to have abnormally fast reflexes and aggression levels at the age of six; Reacher believes that this abnormal level of aggression at that age is not due to genetics, as the Army report suggested, but because he got tired of being frightened, and trained himself \"to turn fear into aggression, automatically\".<ref>{{cite book| title = Never Go Back|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2013|isbn =9781409030805 |location = London | chapter= Chapters 30, 38}}</ref>\n\nReacher seldom shows remorse for the numerous felonies he perpetrates and has a primal sense of justice. In ''[[Personal (novel)|Personal]]'', after killing a thug, he defends his actions to his distraught accomplice, Casey Nice, by stating the man could have spent his life performing good deeds such as \"helping old ladies across the street\", \"raising funds for Africa\" or \"volunteering in the library\". Instead the man extorted money and hurt people and when he \"finally he opened the wrong door, what came out at him was his problem, not mine\".<ref name=\"alpha\">{{cite book| title = Personal|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2014|isbn =9781473508774 |location = London |chapter= Chapter 28}}</ref>\n\nThis primitivity on part of Reacher is commented upon in ''Never Go Back'', in which Reacher is described by Susan Turner as being like \"something feral....It's like you've been sanded down to nothing but yes and no, and you and them, and black and white, and live or die. You're like a predator. Cold and hard.\" (p.&nbsp;176\u2013177) However, when she witnesses Reacher's outrage at the hurt inflicted upon an innocent waitress, she reconsiders and states that he is actually not feral as she had earlier presumed. Furthermore, she notes that Reacher had until then attempted to solve only her problems, neglecting the problems of his own:\n\n<blockquote> And you've done nothing but chip away at my problem. You're ignoring your own, with the Big Dog. Which is just as serious. Therefore, you still care for others. Which means you can't really be feral. I imagine caring for others is the first thing to go. And you still know right from wrong. Which all means you're OK.<ref name=\"bravo\">{{cite book| title = Never Go Back|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2013|isbn =9781409030805 |location =London| chapter= Chapter 35}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis underlying kindness perceived by Turner is visible in many of Reacher's actions: he stands up for the right of women in both ''[[Echo Burning]]'', whose central plot involves him aiding a woman's escape from her abusive husband, and in ''[[Worth Dying For (novel)|Worth Dying For]]'', in which he breaks the nose of an abusive husband for beating up his wife.<ref>{{cite book| title = Worth Dying For|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2010|isbn =9781407083131 |location =London| chapter= Chapter 6| quote= Reacher hit him, a straight right to the nose, a big vicious blow, his knuckles driving through cartilage and bone and crushing it all flat.}}</ref> He is also shown to be sympathetic to those in need, as seen in ''[[The Hard Way (novel)|The Hard Way]]'' where he bequeaths Edward Lane's fees paid to him for the medical treatment and living expenses of a man whom Lane had betrayed many years back.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Hard Way|last = Child|first = Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2006|isbn = 0-385-33669-1|location = London|chapter = Chapter 47|quote = I'm going to send Hobart down to Birmingham or Nashville and get him fixed up right.

At least not in his old trade. And then if there's anything left, then sure, I'll buy myself a new shirt.|url = https://archive.org/details/hardwa00chil}}</ref>\n\nThis point is further elucidated in ''Personal'', when Reacher reminisces while standing at his mother's grave:\n\n<blockquote>She had said, 'You've got the strength of two normal boys. What are you going to do with it?' I hadn't replied. Our silence was part of the ritual. She answered for me. She said, 'You're going to do the right thing.' And I had tried, mostly, which had sometimes caused me trouble, and sometimes won me medals of my own.<ref name=\"foxtrot\">{{cite book| title = Personal|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2014|isbn =9781473508774 |location = London | chapter= Chapter 18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Skills==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n\nReacher is described as proficient in hand-to-hand combat. He is quite fast for his height, and often fights opponents his size or larger. His skill is attributed to the fact that he grew up all over the world, due to being in a Marine Corps family. While he is not a master in any one form of combat, he tends to incorporate moves from various styles. His favorite moves are headbutts, elbow strikes, and kicks to the groin. As Child once put it, \"Reacher's fighting style is like a running chainsaw\". Reacher generally goes with the flow of the fight, caring about winning more than how he wins. However, he plans out how to strike first or react to the first strike, and how he'll make sure the other person never fights him again. As he puts it, \"The other guy cares how he wins, I care about pissing on the other guy's grave.\"\n\nReacher has an internal clock. He sets a time to wake up at and his body automatically awakens. He often sets a timer in fights to try and get a tactical edge. Reacher also has a fascination with numbers. In ''[[Bad Luck and Trouble]]'', Reacher uses this to deduce that the amount of money deposited without his knowledge into his bank account was an attempt by Neagley, his colleague from the Military Police Corps, to contact him.\n\nReacher has extremely acute deduction skills. He generally gains his information simply from talking to people or making minute observations. He will pick up on a simple pause and relate it back to what he is trying figure out. He is known as one of the best investigators the Military Police Corps had to offer, and he led a special unit tasked with difficult cases.\n\nReacher is also described as skilled [[marksman]], principally in ''[[One Shot (novel)|One Shot]]'', being the only non-[[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] to win the US Marine Corps [[Wimbledon Cup|1000 Yard Invitational rifle competition]].\n\n==Habits and beliefs==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2015}}\nReacher has a love for music, especially [[blues]].<ref name=\"Child 1997 p. 522\">Child (1997), ''Killing Floor'', p. 522.</ref> It was this affinity that inspires Reacher to get off the bus at the start of ''[[Killing Floor (novel)|Killing Floor]]'', and in the same novel reveals that he has a music collection in his head, replaying tracks as he travels without needing the technology others seem to be obsessed with and burdened by.

Josephine Moutier was his only child. He died in 1974 at age 90. Jack, as a boy, met him three times and is described as having liked him. In ''Second Son'' Reacher is impressed with his grandfather's stoic acceptance of approaching death and says that \"A man who survived [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] and [[The Somme]] as well as the WWII anti-Nazi Resistance has already beaten the odds\".\n\nReacher's mother, Josephine Moutier Reacher, born in France, was 30 years old when Reacher was born.<ref name=\"charlie\"/> She met Reacher's father in [[Korea]] and married him in the [[Netherlands]].<ref name=\"charlie\"/> When she was only 13, she joined the [[French Resistance]] and under the alias \"Beatrice\" worked with ''Le Chemin de Fer Humain'' (the Human Railroad), saving 80 men.

Too immature to make a sexual commitment, obsessed with death and terror, this archetypal hero of American fiction was first described in [[Leslie Fiedler|Leslie Fiedler's]] classic ''Love and Death in the American Novel'' (1960).\"<ref name=\"RickGekoski2013\">{{cite web| last= Gekoski |first= Rick |title= Why I love Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels |url=  https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/aug/29/lee-child-jack-reacher |magazine= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 1 March 2016 |date= 29 August 2013 }}</ref> In the same article he also questions whether Fiedler would find that Reacher's [[hypermasculinity]] is a sign of the character's \"repressed [[homosexuality]]\".<ref name= \"RickGekoski2013\"/>\n\nMalcolm Gladwell, in an article for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', perceives a difference in the Reacher character and the traditional Western characters in terms of the symbolism they represent to the general public. In his opinion \"The traditional Western was a fantasy about lawfulness: it was based on a longing for order among those who had been living without it for too long. The heroes conduct themselves according to strict rules of chivalry. They act\u2014 insofar as it is possible \u2014with restraint. In the world we live in today, by contrast, we have too much order: we are, as we have been reminded so frequently lately, over-policed. Our contemporary fantasy is about lawlessness: about what would happen if the institutions of civility melted away and all we were left with was a hard-muscled, rangy guy who could do all the necessary calculations in his head to insure that the bad guy got what he had coming. That's why there are rarely any police in Reacher novels\u2014or judges or courts or lawyers or any discussion or consideration of the law. Nor is there any restraint on the part of the hero. He's not pointing toward a more civilized tomorrow. He's leading us back into the wilderness, with the reassurance that our psychopaths are bigger and stronger than the bad guys' psychopaths.\"<ref name=\"Malcolm Gladwell2015\">{{cite web| last= Gladwell |first= Malcolm |title= The Lawless Pleasures of Lee Child's Jack Reacher Novels |url=  http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-lawless-pleasures-of-lee-childs-jack-reacher-novels |magazine= [[The New Yorker]] |accessdate= 7 March 2016 |date= 9 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\nSargent also notes the dichotomy in Reacher's character, stating that he is intellectual and generous despite his exterior appearance of being \"unkempt, unshaven and out of uniform, a loner, avenger, perpetual outsider at odds with the army\". In Sargent's express opinion:\n\n{{quote|The thing about Reacher is that he is not just a thug, even if a well-meaning thug in the manner of, say, [[John Rambo|Rambo]] or [[Bruce Willis]]. He is also a thinker, an intellectual, capable of quoting [[Nietzsche]] or coming up with the etymology of \"vagrant\". And he speaks French....\n\n...He therefore brings a certain amount of liberal-leaning finesse and \u00e9lan to his encounters. He is sympathetic to deserters from the [[Iraq War]] and particularly severe on capitalist profiteers. You feel he would probably turn up at an [[Occupy Wall Street]] demo. There is something of the hippie in his rootless roaming around America, seeking out injustice and righting wrongs.<ref name= \"EmilySargent2011\"/>}}\n\nCurtis concurs, remarking that \"Reacher isn't just a mindless vigilante. He can also be a liberal do-gooder. He has expressed sympathy for gays in the military and undocumented immigrants. In Child's latest book,'' A Wanted Man'', Reacher worries that the [[Patriot Act]] will lead to all sorts of 'national security bullshit.' Child has invented a kind of progressive vigilantism. The scumbag is killed, but usually for the right reasons.\"<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/>\n\nMultiple critics have pointed out that the Jack Reacher character is characterized by his spells of silence,<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/><ref name= \"MichaelCavacini2014\"/> with Curtis claiming \"Reacher's classic line is silence.\"<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/>\n\nOthers have been critical of the various implausibilities and contradictions present in the character and his behavior. Notes ''[[The Washington Post]]'' journalist Kevin Nance: \"The unlikelihoods and outright impossibilities stack up. Ever a frugal sort, Reacher travels mostly by hitchhiking (as he does at the beginning of \"A Wanted Man\" and 2001's \"Echo Burning,\" both set roughly in the time they were written), even though the practice is roughly as current as bellbottoms and even though his appearance is, as previously established, notably simian. (Not that this deters a series of smart, attractive young women, most of them officers of the law, from jumping into bed with him.) And although he's a loner who seems never so happy \u2014 rather like Agent Cooper in \"Twin Peaks\" \u2014 as when sitting quietly in a diner with a cup of black coffee and a piece of pie, he has an uncanny knack for stumbling into the worst kinds of trouble, almost none of it connected to himself.\"<ref name=\"KevinNance2012\">{{cite web| last= Nance |first= Kevin |title= Why is the character of Jack Reacher so popular? |url=  https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/why-is-the-character-of-jack-reacher-so-popular/2012/12/13/dcdfe816-3d7d-11e2-ae43-cf491b837f7b_story.html# |magazine= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate= 7 March 2016 |date= 14 December 2012 }}</ref> Michael Cavacini has concurred with this, stating that unlike traditional [[whodunit]]s, where a detective \"simply solves a problem because it's his job\", Reacher has no formal reason to be involved in anything and consequently \"seems to always wind up in a situation where something goes wrong and he must make right\".<ref name=\"MichaelCavacini2014\">{{cite web| last= Cavacini |first= Michael |title= An Interview With International Best-Selling Author Lee Child|url=  https://michaelcavacini.com/2014/09/04/an-interview-with-international-best-selling-author-lee-child/ |accessdate= 1 March 2016|date=2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Accomplices==\nLee Child has described Reacher's accomplices and their characterization and origin in the following terms: \" The whole cast for each book is new.

She had been investigating the criminal activities of a New York mobster, Croselli but her investigation had been shut down and she had been suspended, pending review as part of a deal cut by Croselli with the FBI. She had since tried to unsuccessfully bring Croselli down by getting him to boast of his crimes on tape.

She suffered from heart-related ailments and she dies near the end of the story due to a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after having accomplished her goal. Reacher commented, \"She died young, but she had a smile on her face.\"<ref>{{cite book| title = High Heat|last = Child |first= Lee |publisher = Delacorte Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-345-54664-7|location = |pages = 125}}</ref>\n\n===Military era===\n* '''Elizabeth Deveraux''', late 30s, is a former Marine serving as a [[county sheriff]] in [[Carter Crossing, Mississippi]] in 1997. She appears in ''The Affair'', where she tacitly condones Reacher's highly illegal ways of getting rid of some unsavory characters. She was a potential lover for Reacher, as they had sex several times, but ended up drifting apart.\n* '''Karla Dixon''', age unknown, possibly late 30s is a [[forensic accountant]]; formerly a Major in the Army and part of Reacher's 'Special Investigators Unit', which he formed and led in the 90s. They are reunited in ''Bad Luck & Trouble'' and secretly rekindle an affair, which they regret not starting back in the Army. She is described as 'dark, very pretty, comparatively small' and slim.  She is extremely good with numbers and shares Reacher's fascination with mathematics.\n* '''General Leon Garber''', retired, was Reacher's former commanding officer, mentor and close friend. His only child is Jodie. He risked his life to help Reacher in ''Die Trying'', and willed him his house, as his daughter is wealthy, didn't want it and already owns her own New York City home. He also appears in ''The Enemy'' and ''The Affair'', and (through his funeral) in ''Tripwire''.\n* '''Jodie Garber-Jacob''', 30, is the daughter of General Leon Garber. She met and fell in love with Reacher when she was 15 and was off-limits to him. In ''Tripwire'', she is divorced, using her married name, working as a corporate attorney and reunites romantically with him after her father's funeral. She and Reacher lived together in New York City and upstate New York in Leon's house which was left in his will to Reacher, his surrogate son. She is mentioned in ''Echo Burning'' as having moved to Europe. She appears in ''Tripwire'', and ''The Visitor'' (\"Running Blind\" in the United States).\n* '''Eileen Ann Hutton''', age unknown, is a Brigadier General in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|Army's Judge Advocate General's Corps]]. She and Reacher had a relationship prior to, and featured in, ''One Shot''.\n* '''Dominique Kohl''', 29, was a Sergeant First Class on the way up and assigned to Reacher's unit when he was a captain in the Army. She appears in ''Persuader'', where Reacher remembers the events that led to her death ten years earlier.  Kohl is mentioned again in ''Personal'', when Reacher partners with a woman who reminds him of Kohl.\n* '''Stan Lowrey''', late 30s, is a member of Reacher's old 110th MP unit. He is handsome, youthful, and full of energy. A kind of man that gets the job done. He appears in ''Bad Luck and Trouble'' and ''The Affair''.\n* '''Duncan Munro''', late 30s, is a member of Reacher's old 110th MP unit. He appears in ''The Affair''.\n* '''Frances Neagley''', late 30s, is a partner with a successful private security firm, and former Army Master Sergeant and Military Policeman. She is of medium height, slim, and has dark hair and eyes. She spends large amounts of time in the gym and has a purely [[platonic relationship]] with Reacher. However, in ''Night School'' (2016), NSA senior Deputy Marian Sinclair notes Neagley's attraction to Reacher, and her refusal to sleep with him.<ref name=\"NightSchool187\">{{cite book| first= Lee| last= Child |title= Night School | year= 2016 |location= London| publisher= Transworld Publishers, 2016 |page= 187}}</ref>  Reacher points out that Neagley has [[Haphephobia|haptephobia]], \"A fear of being touched.\"<ref name=\"NightSchool187\" /> When Sinclair asks if the condition is as a result of assault, Reacher responds, \"She says she was born with it.\"<ref name=\"NightSchool188\">{{cite book| first= Lee| last= Child |title= Night School | year= 2016 |location= London| publisher= Transworld Publishers, 2016 |page= 188}}</ref> Her demeanor suggests that she could be considered a female counterpart to Reacher. Rarely impressed, Reacher describes her as sometimes scary. She appears in ''Without Fail'', ''The Affair'' and ''Bad Luck and Trouble'',  ''Night School'', and ''Small Wars'' and is mentioned in ''Never Go Back''. The first page of ''Bad Luck and Trouble'' includes a dedication \"For the real Frances L. Neagley\", who won a [[Bouchercon]] charity auction for the naming rights to a character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/features/arts/offthepage/blog/2007/09/characters_welcomed_and_you_can_be_one_too.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232851/http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/features/arts/offthepage/blog/2007/09/characters_welcomed_and_you_can_be_one_too.html |archivedate= 3 March 2016 |title=Characters welcomed!

He appears in ''Bad Luck and Trouble''. He is \"tall, fair, handsome, like a stockbroker... carries an army blade in one pocket and a pair of ceramic [[brass-knuckles]] in the other.\" The ceramic knuckles are made from a composite stronger than steel, harder than brass and gets past any metal detector. He is meticulous, doesn't mind paperwork, and is usually underestimated because he looks like a white-collar office worker.\n* '''Lieutenant Summer''', 25, is an African-American Lieutenant in the Army Military Police. She is cute, petite and slender, and appears in ''The Enemy''. She is Reacher's accomplice throughout the novel and they have a brief relationship. She is promoted to Captain at the end of the novel.\n\n===Wandering era===\n* '''Alice Amanda Aaron''', an attorney, appears in ''Echo Burning''.\n* '''Michelle Chang''', an ex-FBI agent turned private investigator.

been published, the most recent being ''Blue Moon''. The character has also appeared in short stories, and two of the novels have been adapted into successful [[action thriller]] [[Jack Reacher (film)|films]], starring [[Tom Cruise]] as Reacher.\n\n==Development and author's commentary==\n===Development===\nAt the time Lee Child sat down to write his first novel ''[[Killing Floor (novel)|Killing Floor]]'', he was unemployed, having been fired from his position as a presentation director for [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]].<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/><ref name= \"ClaireWhite2001\"/><ref name= \"Bob Cornwell\"/> According to Child, authorship was a purely pragmatic decision: \"I wasn't one of these people that felt compelled to write. It had to keep a roof over our heads, so it was totally, totally 110% commercially motivated.\"<ref name= \"Bob Cornwell\"/>\n\nCritics have perceived other influences in Jack Reacher's creation. Bob Cornwell quotes Lee Child's reply in another interview as having created Reacher \"as an antidote, to all the depressed and miserable alcoholics that increasingly peopled the genre\".<ref name= \"ClaireWhite2001\"/><ref name= \"Bob Cornwell\"/> Similarly, editor [[Otto Penzler]] published an essay by Child explaining that Jack Reacher was created deliberately in contrast to the prevailing trends in crime fiction. His name is short and commonplace, as opposed to quirky or unusual; Reacher's  personal ethics and wandering lifestyle are reminiscent of the chivalrous [[knight errant]] of medieval lore as opposed to an [[anti-hero]] tormented by addiction and haunted by past misbehavior.<ref>Otto Penzler (editor) ''The lineup: the world's greatest crime writers tell the inside story of their greatest detectives''. Little, Brown (2009)</ref>\n\nThe character's name first came to Child in a supermarket when an old lady, noting the span of Child's arms, asked for his help in reaching out to a can of pears. On seeing this, Child's wife commented that if his writing career did not work out he could \"always get a job as a reacher in a supermarket\".<ref name= \"EmilySargent2011\"/> Reacher's ex-military background was a specific and tactical choice on his behalf. Child has explained, \"I thought that I would do a book that's not the same as everybody else's. Everybody else had their guy working: a private guy in [[Boston]] or a police lieutenant in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]], or wherever. I thought, 'Well, he won't be working, and he won't live anywhere, and let's just take it from there.'\" Child also felt that this origin would lend itself to the character's personality and nomadic lifestyle: \"This idea of the rootless alienation has got to come from somewhere, and I noticed that the most alienated people are always ex-military, because it's like going from one solar system to the other, it's so different. So that was an easy choice: Make him ex-military. Then make him ex-military police because, broadly speaking, these would be crime novels, and he had to have some investigative experience, and he had to understand procedures and forensics and so on. So that part was all set in stone\".<ref name=\"RobertBidinotto2007\">{{cite web|last=Bidinotto |first= Robert |title=Thriller: Lee Child and the creation of Jack Reacher |url= http://atlassociety.org/commentary/commentary-blog/4508-thriller-lee-child-and-the-creation-of-jack-reacher |magazine= The Atlas Society |date= 17 March 2011 |accessdate= 8 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Similarities between Reacher and Lee Child====\nNumerous critics have pointed out the various similarities between Lee Child and Jack Reacher. Bryan Curtis, writing for ''[[Grantland]]'', and Natasha Harding and Caroline Iggulden, in a separate article for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', have brought out the various similarities between Child and Reacher: Child is {{convert|6|ft|4|in|abbr=on}} tall while his protagonist stands  {{convert|6|ft|5|in|abbr=on}}; both writer and creation constantly consume coffee; Like Reacher, Child \"lives in cheap pairs of jeans and T-shirts and finds the idea of buying expensive clothes to be irrational\"; and that \"Jack Reacher's famous physical qualities are based on Child's playground memories as a child\".<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/> Child tends to agree with such observations: \"I was huge as a kid and Reacher's stature is me translated as a kid. I enjoyed being bigger and fighting shamelessly. I've done a fair amount of [[headbutt]]ing. It's an awesome manoeuvre.\"{{refn|group=note|The headbutt is considered Reacher's \"signature move\".<ref name= \"AndyMartin2015\"/>}} Andy Martin notes that \"just as Reacher is half-[[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], half-[[John Rambo|Rambo]], Child is both art-for-art's-sake [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]] and ruthless businessman.\"<ref name=\"AndyMartin2015\">{{cite web |last=Martin |first= Andy |title= Lee Child on Jack Reacher: How the best-selling author writes his mysteries |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/lee-child-on-jack-reacher-how-the-best-selling-author-writes-his-mysteries-9959227.html |magazine= [[The Independent]] |date= January 2015 |accessdate= 5 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nCurtis, as well as Harding and Iggulden, have also considered the role Child's dismissal from Granada had on Reacher's development. Curtis also notes that \"Child created Reacher from the smoldering embers of his own rage. It might seem like a simplistic theory, but it's true. Like the author, Reacher was workplace surplus: He was a [[military police]]man in an era of Army [[Layoff|downsizing]]. The act of leaving his job turned Reacher into a protective figure, an avenging angel.\" He finds that Reacher's actions are a manifestation of Child's anger at his sacking and that his violent ways of dealing with villains is 'cathartic' to the author.<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/>\n\n===Author's commentary and interpretation===\n[[File:Lee Child, Bouchercon 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lee Child|Jim Grant]], better known by his pen name Lee Child, at [[Bouchercon XLI]], 2010]]\n \nLee Child views Jack Reacher as a \"happy-go-lucky guy. He has quirks and problems, but the thing is, he doesn't know he's got them. Hence, no tedious self-pity. He's smart and strong, an [[introvert]], but any anguish he suffers is caused by others.\"<ref name= \"ClaireWhite2001\"/> When asked about the casting of [[Tom Cruise]] in the role of Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise's casting as Jack Reacher was met with severe criticism from fans of the book series, primarily because the disparity in their heights with Reacher portrayed as a blond, {{convert|6|ft|5|in|abbr=on}} tall, 250-pound man in the novels, while Cruise is a {{convert|5|ft|7|in|abbr=on}} tall brunette<ref name=\"CarolynKellogg2012\">{{cite web |last=Kellogg |first= Carolyn |title= Reader reactions to 'Jack Reacher': The fans are furious |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/21/entertainment/la-et-jc-tom-cruise-jack-reacher-fans-react-20121220 |magazine= [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate= 7 March 2016 |date= 21 December 2012}}</ref><ref name= \"AndreaSachs2012\"/>), Child replied that \"Reacher's size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force\".<ref name= DenOfGeek/> Physically and appearance wise, Child has  compared him to Rugby Player [[Lawrence Dallaglio]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Studio 10|title=Author Lee Child Talks 'Jack Reacher' TV Series {{!}} Studio 10|date=2018-11-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK8rOM1skK4|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>\n\nHe has also referred to Reacher on multiple occasions as a '[[knight-errant]]'<ref name= \"AndreaSachs2012\"/><ref name= \"AlexBerenson2014\"/> and in an interview for the ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine describes the character as: \" (He's) two things in one. On the surface, he is an ex-military cop who is suddenly dumped out into the civilian world. He doesn't fit in, and he spends his time wandering America, seeing the things that he's never had time to see before. He's trying to stay out of trouble, but masterfully once a year getting into trouble. He's also the descendant of a very ancient tradition: the noble loner, the knight errant, the mysterious stranger, who has shown up in stories forever\u2026 He is a truly universal character... I'm writing the modern iteration of a character who has existed for thousands of years.\"<ref name=\"AndreaSachs2012\">{{cite web |last=Sachs |first= Andrea |title= Lee Child on His New Thriller, Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher and Wandering Heroes |url= http://entertainment.time.com/2012/09/19/lee-child-on-his-new-thriller-tom-cruise-as-jack-reacher-and-wandering-heroes/ |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 2012 |accessdate= 5 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn another interview for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, Child further analyses the mythology of his character:\n\n<blockquote>The stories that I love are basically about the knight-errant, the mysterious stranger. And the reason why people think that's an essentially American paradigm is the Westerns. The Westerns were absolutely rock solid with that stuff. You know, the mysterious rider comes in off the range, sorts out the problem, and rides off into the sunset. It is just such a total paradigm, but not invented in America. That was imported from the medieval tales of Europe. The knight-errant: literally a knight, somehow banished and forced to wander the land doing good deeds. It's part of storytelling in every culture. Japan has it with the ronin myth; every culture has this Robin Hood idea. So really, that character was forced out of Europe as Europe became more densely populated and more civilized. That character no longer had stories in Europe; it had to migrate to where the frontier was still open and dangerous, which was America, essentially. So the character, I think, is actually universal and historic, most recently, normally represented in America. I think the Westerns saw it firmly adopted by America, so yeah, right now, we think of this as a completely American character, but really, it's more historic than that. But I'm very happy to have that reference made.<ref name=\"AlexBerenson2014\">{{cite web |last=Berenson |first= Alex |title= What Lee Child Has Learned from Writing the Jack Reacher Books |url= http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a30736/jack-reacher-lee-child-interview/ |magazine= [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |accessdate= 5 March 2016 |date=December 2014}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nChild also views Reacher as \"[[Postfeminism|post-feminist]]\" stating that he does not parlay in \"gender distinction...Reacher likes strong, realistic women, and he treats women with respect...he doesn't cut them any slack, but also he has no negative preconceptions.

He has no middle name, and most people simply call him 'Reacher', even his family as a child. Regular references are made to the fact that Reacher's given name is Jack, which is not a nickname for John, and that he has no middle name.  His military record officially refers to him as Jack (none) Reacher.<ref name= DenOfGeek/> From the time he was a boy, his family, even his mother, simply called him \"Reacher\", an appellation that has stayed with him, but was never given to his brother.<ref name= \"LeeChildOfficial\"/>\n\nReacher's mother Josephine Moutier Reacher (n\u00e9e Moutier) was a French national, and Reacher was fluent in French from early childhood,<ref name=\"Enemy\">Child (2004). ''The Enemy''.</ref> but as he admits in ''The Affair'' (2011) he speaks the language ''Un peu, mais lentement'' (\"A little, but slowly\"). Reacher's maternal grandfather was at the Battle of Verdun in the First World War and in the French Resistance in the Second, and lived to a ripe old age, which in Reacher's view means that his grandfather had \"beaten the odds\".\n\n===Military years and profile===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:USAMPC-COA.png|thumb|150px|left|Regimental Coat of Arms of the United States Military Police Corps]]\n\nAfter being shunted around the world, growing up on U.S. military bases where his father Stan was stationed, he gained an education in basic survival as well as an opportunity to enter the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point. After four years at West Point (1979 to 1983) Reacher achieved the ranks of [[Second lieutenant#United States|2nd lieutenant]], [[First lieutenant#United States|1st lieutenant]], [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]], and [[Major (United States)#Army|major]],<ref>{{Cite book|title = Bad Luck and Trouble|pages = 11}}</ref> including an intervening demotion from major to captain<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Enemy|last = Child|first = Lee|publisher = TransworldDigital|year = 2004|isbn = 0-553-81585-7|chapter= Chapter 25}}</ref> in 1990<ref name=\"LeeChildOfficial\">{{cite web|last= Child|first= Lee|title= Jack Reacher| website= leechild.com| url= http://www.leechild.com/jack-reacher.php |accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref> during his tenure in the military police.

His unit, the fictional 110th Special Investigations Unit,<ref name=DenOfGeek/> was formed to handle exceptionally tough cases. He left the armed forces in 1997, partly due to a reduction in the forces and partly because he verbally offended a lieutenant colonel during an investigation in Mississippi, who then singled him out for discharge.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Make Me|last = Child|first = Lee|publisher = Delacorte Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9780804178785|location = |pages =| chapter= Chapter 23}}</ref>\n\nAmong his formal qualifications, Reacher is described as the only non-Marine to win the [[Wimbledon Cup]],<ref>{{cite book |last= Child |first =Lee |title= [[Die Trying (novel)|Die Trying]]}}</ref> a US Marine Corps 1000 Yard Invitational Rifle Competition; achieving a record score in 1988.<ref>{{cite book |last= Child |first=Lee|title= [[One Shot (novel)|One Shot]]|publisher= Transworld Digital|year=2005|isbn= 0-385-33668-3| chapter= Chapter 12}}</ref> Anecdotally his fitness reports rated him well above average in the classroom, excellent in the field, fluently bilingual in English and French, passable in Spanish, outstanding on all man-portable weaponry, and beyond outstanding at hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=\"61H\">{{cite book | last= Child | first= Lee | title= 61 Hours | publisher= Delacorte Press | location= New York | year= 2010 | isbn= 9780440243694 | url= https://archive.org/details/61hours00dell }}</ref>\n\n===Later years===\nAfter leaving the Army, Reacher became a [[vagabond (person)|drifter]], his only baggage a folding toothbrush,<ref name=CurtisMarch2013/> although after the [[September 11 attacks]], with restrictions on [[wire transfer]]s in the light of [[Wire transfer fraud|fraud]] he is obliged to carry an [[ATM card]]<ref name=\"KevinNance2012\"/> and [[Photo identification|photo ID]] in the form of a (generally expired) American [[passport]].<ref name=\"SteveDrummond2011\">{{cite web|last= Drummond|first= Steve|title=Lee Child's 'The Affair': Sixteen Books In, Has Jack Reacher Still Got It?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2011/10/20/141548652/lee-childs-the-affair-sixteen-books-in-has-jack-reacher-still-got-it | website= NPR.org | publisher= [[National Public Radio]] | date= 20 October 2011 | accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmily Sargent, while conducting an interview with Lee Child, describes Reacher's post-military life as follows:\n\n<blockquote>You will never find Reacher going to the laundry or doing the ironing. When his clothes get dirty he simply goes to the local hardware store and buys a functional pair of chinos and a workman's shirt and stuffs the old ones in the bin. No mortgage, no wife, no ties, he is a perfectly free agent, unlimited and unbound, incapable of ever settling down.<ref name=\"EmilySargent2011\">{{cite web|last= Sargent|first= Emily|title=Killer instinct: Is Tom Cruise the right man to play Lee Child's savage anti-hero on screen?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/killer-instinct-is-tom-cruise-the-right-man-to-play-lee-childs-savage-anti-hero-on-screen-6252359.html |magazine=[[The Independent]] | accessdate=1 March 2016|date=30 October 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLee Child describes Reacher's obsession to wander about:\n\n<blockquote>He's an ex-military policeman, and he was demobilized in his middle thirties after having served all of his adult life in the [U.S.] Army and having grown up on Marine bases, because his father was a Marine. The idea was to have a character that was plausibly rootless. Most people who are wanderers do it for other reasons\u2014they are mentally ill, or something like that. Reacher is completely competent, but he's just habituated to this fragmented life in the military, so he can't settle into civilian society. The idea of staying anywhere for more than a few days is [[anathema]] to him.<ref name= \"RobertBidinotto2007\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Demeanor and personality==\nReacher himself expounds on a hypothesis about this vagrant life-style in ''[[Never Go Back (Lee Child novel)|Never Go Back]]''. He states that he has a genetic disposition towards roaming about, citing the [[British Empire]], the [[Vikings]], and the [[Polynesians]] as groups with a similar wanderlust. While he accepts that [[Human migration|there was an economical necessity]] behind their voyages, he maintains that \"some of them could not stop\". He feels that long ago when [[Prehistory|humans lived in small bands]], there was a risk of [[inbreeding]] as a result of which a [[gene]] developed over the course of [[evolution]] such that \"every generation and every small band had at least one person who had to wander\". This would lead to \"mixing up of [[gene pool]]s\" and would be \"healthier all around\". Reacher concludes:\n\n{{quote|I think ninety-nine of us grow up to love the campfire, and one grows up to hate it. Ninety-nine of us grow up to fear the howling wolf, and one grows up to envy it. And I'm that guy.\n\nCompelled to spread his [[DNA]] worldwide. Purely for the good of the species.<ref>{{cite book| title = Never Go Back|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2013|isbn =9781409030805 |location =London |chapter= Chapter 38}}</ref>}}\n\nReacher's large physique means his character is sometimes mistaken by other people. For example, in ''[[Die Trying (novel)|Die Trying]]'', Reacher is wrongly suspected by the FBI of being involved in a kidnapping, which assesses him (solely on the basis of a few photos) as such: \"The big guy is different. Different clothes, different stance, different physically. He could be foreign, at least partly, or maybe second generation. Fair hair and blue eyes, but there's something in his face. Maybe he's European, perhaps a European mercenary or terrorist.\"<ref>{{cite book| first= Lee| last= Child |title= Die Trying| url= https://archive.org/details/dietrying00chil| url-access= registration|year=|chapter= Chapter 22}}</ref> Reacher is aware of this perception. In ''[[Make Me (novel)|Make Me]]'' Reacher gets off a train in a remote town called Mother's Rest, simply because he likes the name of the town. When he sees a woman approaching him with a look of expectation, he immediately understands that the person she was waiting for must be very tall like him, as it is his standout feature when people first meet him.\n\nIn ''[[Echo Burning]]'', Reacher narrates how he first turned \"his fear into aggression\". He was about four when he watched a television show on space adventures. One episode depicted a [[Extraterrestrial life|space monster]] which then terrified the young Reacher. He was [[Insomnia|unable to sleep]] for days, thinking the monster was under his bed and would get him if he tried to sleep. According to Reacher, he then became angry: \"Not at myself for being afraid, because as far as I was concerned the thing was totally real and I should be afraid. I got mad at the thing for making me afraid. For threatening me\". Reacher then one night \"kind of exploded with fury\". In his words, Reacher \"raced down the monster\" and successfully changed his fear into fury. He also stated he has never been scared since.<ref>{{cite book| title = Echo Burning|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2001|isbn =0-515-13331-0 |location =London | chapter =Chapter 6| quote= One night I just kind of exploded with fury. I yelled O-K-, come out and try it! Just damn well try it! I'll beat the shit right out of you! I raced it down. I turned the fear into aggression.}}</ref>\n\nThis fact is later referenced in ''Never Go Back'', when an Army psychological study of fear in children is cited that shows Reacher to have abnormally fast reflexes and aggression levels at the age of six; Reacher believes that this abnormal level of aggression at that age is not due to genetics, as the Army report suggested, but because he got tired of being frightened, and trained himself \"to turn fear into aggression, automatically\".<ref>{{cite book| title = Never Go Back|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2013|isbn =9781409030805 |location = London | chapter= Chapters 30, 38}}</ref>\n\nReacher seldom shows remorse for the numerous felonies he perpetrates and has a primal sense of justice. In ''[[Personal (novel)|Personal]]'', after killing a thug, he defends his actions to his distraught accomplice, Casey Nice, by stating the man could have spent his life performing good deeds such as \"helping old ladies across the street\", \"raising funds for Africa\" or \"volunteering in the library\". Instead the man extorted money and hurt people and when he \"finally he opened the wrong door, what came out at him was his problem, not mine\".<ref name=\"alpha\">{{cite book| title = Personal|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2014|isbn =9781473508774 |location = London |chapter= Chapter 28}}</ref>\n\nThis primitivity on part of Reacher is commented upon in ''Never Go Back'', in which Reacher is described by Susan Turner as being like \"something feral....It's like you've been sanded down to nothing but yes and no, and you and them, and black and white, and live or die. You're like a predator. Cold and hard.\" (p.&nbsp;176\u2013177) However, when she witnesses Reacher's outrage at the hurt inflicted upon an innocent waitress, she reconsiders and states that he is actually not feral as she had earlier presumed. Furthermore, she notes that Reacher had until then attempted to solve only her problems, neglecting the problems of his own:\n\n<blockquote> And you've done nothing but chip away at my problem. You're ignoring your own, with the Big Dog. Which is just as serious. Therefore, you still care for others. Which means you can't really be feral. I imagine caring for others is the first thing to go. And you still know right from wrong. Which all means you're OK.<ref name=\"bravo\">{{cite book| title = Never Go Back|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2013|isbn =9781409030805 |location =London| chapter= Chapter 35}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis underlying kindness perceived by Turner is visible in many of Reacher's actions: he stands up for the right of women in both ''[[Echo Burning]]'', whose central plot involves him aiding a woman's escape from her abusive husband, and in ''[[Worth Dying For (novel)|Worth Dying For]]'', in which he breaks the nose of an abusive husband for beating up his wife.<ref>{{cite book| title = Worth Dying For|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2010|isbn =9781407083131 |location =London| chapter= Chapter 6| quote= Reacher hit him, a straight right to the nose, a big vicious blow, his knuckles driving through cartilage and bone and crushing it all flat.}}</ref> He is also shown to be sympathetic to those in need, as seen in ''[[The Hard Way (novel)|The Hard Way]]'' where he bequeaths Edward Lane's fees paid to him for the medical treatment and living expenses of a man whom Lane had betrayed many years back.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Hard Way|last = Child|first = Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2006|isbn = 0-385-33669-1|location = London|chapter = Chapter 47|quote = I'm going to send Hobart down to Birmingham or Nashville and get him fixed up right.

At least not in his old trade. And then if there's anything left, then sure, I'll buy myself a new shirt.|url = https://archive.org/details/hardwa00chil}}</ref>\n\nThis point is further elucidated in ''Personal'', when Reacher reminisces while standing at his mother's grave:\n\n<blockquote>She had said, 'You've got the strength of two normal boys. What are you going to do with it?' I hadn't replied. Our silence was part of the ritual. She answered for me. She said, 'You're going to do the right thing.' And I had tried, mostly, which had sometimes caused me trouble, and sometimes won me medals of my own.<ref name=\"foxtrot\">{{cite book| title = Personal|last = Child|first= Lee|publisher = Transworld Publishers|year = 2014|isbn =9781473508774 |location = London | chapter= Chapter 18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Skills==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n\nReacher is described as proficient in hand-to-hand combat. He is quite fast for his height, and often fights opponents his size or larger. His skill is attributed to the fact that he grew up all over the world, due to being in a Marine Corps family. While he is not a master in any one form of combat, he tends to incorporate moves from various styles. His favorite moves are headbutts, elbow strikes, and kicks to the groin. As Child once put it, \"Reacher's fighting style is like a running chainsaw\". Reacher generally goes with the flow of the fight, caring about winning more than how he wins. However, he plans out how to strike first or react to the first strike, and how he'll make sure the other person never fights him again. As he puts it, \"The other guy cares how he wins, I care about pissing on the other guy's grave.\"\n\nReacher has an internal clock. He sets a time to wake up at and his body automatically awakens. He often sets a timer in fights to try and get a tactical edge. Reacher also has a fascination with numbers.

Good at saving damsels in distress and sorting out bad guys.\"<ref name= \"EmilySargent2011\"/>\n\nRick Gekoski, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', takes a similar if darker interpretation of the character: \"Reacher is, of course, in a long line of American outcast heroes who abjure emotional ties, head out into the wilderness and take upon their own broad shoulders the primitive moral conscience of the tribe. Too immature to make a sexual commitment, obsessed with death and terror, this archetypal hero of American fiction was first described in [[Leslie Fiedler|Leslie Fiedler's]] classic ''Love and Death in the American Novel'' (1960).\"<ref name=\"RickGekoski2013\">{{cite web| last= Gekoski |first= Rick |title= Why I love Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels |url=  https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/aug/29/lee-child-jack-reacher |magazine= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 1 March 2016 |date= 29 August 2013 }}</ref> In the same article he also questions whether Fiedler would find that Reacher's [[hypermasculinity]] is a sign of the character's \"repressed [[homosexuality]]\".<ref name= \"RickGekoski2013\"/>\n\nMalcolm Gladwell, in an article for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', perceives a difference in the Reacher character and the traditional Western characters in terms of the symbolism they represent to the general public. In his opinion \"The traditional Western was a fantasy about lawfulness: it was based on a longing for order among those who had been living without it for too long. The heroes conduct themselves according to strict rules of chivalry. They act\u2014 insofar as it is possible \u2014with restraint. In the world we live in today, by contrast, we have too much order: we are, as we have been reminded so frequently lately, over-policed. Our contemporary fantasy is about lawlessness: about what would happen if the institutions of civility melted away and all we were left with was a hard-muscled, rangy guy who could do all the necessary calculations in his head to insure that the bad guy got what he had coming. That's why there are rarely any police in Reacher novels\u2014or judges or courts or lawyers or any discussion or consideration of the law. Nor is there any restraint on the part of the hero. He's not pointing toward a more civilized tomorrow. He's leading us back into the wilderness, with the reassurance that our psychopaths are bigger and stronger than the bad guys' psychopaths.\"<ref name=\"Malcolm Gladwell2015\">{{cite web| last= Gladwell |first= Malcolm |title= The Lawless Pleasures of Lee Child's Jack Reacher Novels |url=  http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-lawless-pleasures-of-lee-childs-jack-reacher-novels |magazine= [[The New Yorker]] |accessdate= 7 March 2016 |date= 9 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\nSargent also notes the dichotomy in Reacher's character, stating that he is intellectual and generous despite his exterior appearance of being \"unkempt, unshaven and out of uniform, a loner, avenger, perpetual outsider at odds with the army\". In Sargent's express opinion:\n\n{{quote|The thing about Reacher is that he is not just a thug, even if a well-meaning thug in the manner of, say, [[John Rambo|Rambo]] or [[Bruce Willis]]. He is also a thinker, an intellectual, capable of quoting [[Nietzsche]] or coming up with the etymology of \"vagrant\". And he speaks French....\n\n...He therefore brings a certain amount of liberal-leaning finesse and \u00e9lan to his encounters. He is sympathetic to deserters from the [[Iraq War]] and particularly severe on capitalist profiteers. You feel he would probably turn up at an [[Occupy Wall Street]] demo. There is something of the hippie in his rootless roaming around America, seeking out injustice and righting wrongs.<ref name= \"EmilySargent2011\"/>}}\n\nCurtis concurs, remarking that \"Reacher isn't just a mindless vigilante. He can also be a liberal do-gooder. He has expressed sympathy for gays in the military and undocumented immigrants. In Child's latest book,'' A Wanted Man'', Reacher worries that the [[Patriot Act]] will lead to all sorts of 'national security bullshit.' Child has invented a kind of progressive vigilantism.

Ever a frugal sort, Reacher travels mostly by hitchhiking (as he does at the beginning of \"A Wanted Man\" and 2001's \"Echo Burning,\" both set roughly in the time they were written), even though the practice is roughly as current as bellbottoms and even though his appearance is, as previously established, notably simian. (Not that this deters a series of smart, attractive young women, most of them officers of the law, from jumping into bed with him.) And although he's a loner who seems never so happy \u2014 rather like Agent Cooper in \"Twin Peaks\" \u2014 as when sitting quietly in a diner with a cup of black coffee and a piece of pie, he has an uncanny knack for stumbling into the worst kinds of trouble, almost none of it connected to himself.\"<ref name=\"KevinNance2012\">{{cite web| last= Nance |first= Kevin |title= Why is the character of Jack Reacher so popular? |url=  https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/why-is-the-character-of-jack-reacher-so-popular/2012/12/13/dcdfe816-3d7d-11e2-ae43-cf491b837f7b_story.html# |magazine= [[The Washington Post]] |accessdate= 7 March 2016 |date= 14 December 2012 }}</ref> Michael Cavacini has concurred with this, stating that unlike traditional [[whodunit]]s, where a detective \"simply solves a problem because it's his job\", Reacher has no formal reason to be involved in anything and consequently \"seems to always wind up in a situation where something goes wrong and he must make right\".<ref name=\"MichaelCavacini2014\">{{cite web| last= Cavacini |first= Michael |title= An Interview With International Best-Selling Author Lee Child|url=  https://michaelcavacini.com/2014/09/04/an-interview-with-international-best-selling-author-lee-child/ |accessdate= 1 March 2016|date=2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Accomplices==\nLee Child has described Reacher's accomplices and their characterization and origin in the following terms: \" The whole cast for each book is new.

In North America, it is found in northeast, central and southeastern Mexico. In South America, it has been recorded from Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador. It is also known from the Caribbean island [[Martinique]], and China. The mushroom grows in clusters or groups on rotting wood. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have conical to bell-shaped reddish- to orangish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, set atop slender [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The mushrooms stain blue when bruised, indicative of the presence of the compound [[psilocybin]]. ''Psilocybe yungensis'' is used by [[Mazatec people|Mazatec Indians]] in the Mexican State of [[Oaxaca]] for [[entheogen]]ic purposes.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe species was described as new to science by American mycologists [[Rolf Singer]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]], based on specimens collected in [[Nor Yungas Province]], [[Bolivia]], on the road to [[La Paz]] to [[Coroico]].<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/> They published a short description in [[Latin]] in a 1958 ''[[Mycologia]]'' publication,<ref name=Singer1958/> followed by a more detailed description in English later that year.<ref name=Singer1958b/> According to ''[[Psilocybe]]'' specialist [[Gast\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n]], the species ''Psilocybe acutissima'' (described by [[Roger Heim]] in 1958<ref name=Heim1958/>), and ''Psilocybe isauri'' (described by Singer in 1959<ref name=Singer1959/>) are [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]], as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the [[type (biology)|type]] material of all three.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Singer considered ''P.&nbsp;isauri'' a species distinct from ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface. Smith named the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' var. ''diconica'' for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) [[umbo (mycology)|papilla]]. Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to ''P.&nbsp;acutissima'' was a [[papillate]] cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/>\n\nGuzm\u00e1n places ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Cordisporae'', a grouping of ''Psilocybe'' species characterized primarily by having [[rhomboid]] spores less than 8&nbsp;[[micrometer]]s long.<ref>Guzm\u00e1n (1983), p. 106.</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''yungensis'' refers to the name of the [[type locality (biology)|type locality]].<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/> The natives of [[Huautla de Jim\u00e9nez]] and [[Mixe]] natives call ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' a ''hongo adivinador'' (\"divinatory mushroom\"), ''hong que adormece'' (\"soporific mushroom\"), or ''hongo genio'' (\"genius mushroom\").<ref name=Stamets1996/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Psilocybe yungensis 163986.jpg|thumb|left|Caps range in shape from conical to bell-shaped, and have a prominent umbo. Stems are densely covered with whitish fibrils pressed flat against the surface.]]\nThe ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are conical to bell-shaped in maturity, and reach a diameter of up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap surface is smooth and sticky, and, in moist specimens, has faint radial striations (grooves) that extend almost to the margin. The color of fresh caps ranges from dark reddish-brown to rusty brown to orangish-brown. Additionally, the cap is [[hygrophanous]], meaning it will change color depending on its state of hydration; a dry cap fades to become dull yellowish-brown or the color of \"dingy straw\". The cap frequently has a prominent [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]].<ref name=Stamets1996/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] attachment ranges from adnate (broadly attached to the stem) to adnexed (narrowly attached). The spacing of the narrow gills is close to crowded, and the gill color is initially dull gray before maturing spores cause the color to change to purplish-brown. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|to|2.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and more or less equal in width throughout its length or slightly larger near the base. The hollow, brittle, stem is pale brown on the upper part, and reddish-brown near the bottom. The stem is densely covered with whitish fibrils that are pressed flat against the surface; the fibrils slough off in maturity to leave a smooth surface.<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/> The mushroom has a cortinate [[partial veil]] (resembling the webby cortina produced by species of ''[[Cortinarius]]'') but it does not last for long; it occasionally leaves behind sparse remnants of tissue hanging on the cap margin and the upper part of the stem. No [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] remains on the stem after the veil disappears. All parts of the mushroom will stain blue when injured; these stains will blacken as the mushroom dries.<ref name=Stamets1996/>\n{{multiple image | align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header =\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Psilocybe yungensis 171324.jpg\n| caption1 = Spores and translucent cheilocystidia\n| image2 = Psilocybe yungensis 171250.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Cap cuticle]], cap tissue, and gill tissue at 100x magnification\n}}\nThe [[spore print]] is dark purplish-brown.

In North America, it is found in northeast, central and southeastern Mexico. In South America, it has been recorded from Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador. It is also known from the Caribbean island [[Martinique]], and China. The mushroom grows in clusters or groups on rotting wood. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have conical to bell-shaped reddish- to orangish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, set atop slender [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The mushrooms stain blue when bruised, indicative of the presence of the compound [[psilocybin]]. ''Psilocybe yungensis'' is used by [[Mazatec people|Mazatec Indians]] in the Mexican State of [[Oaxaca]] for [[entheogen]]ic purposes.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe species was described as new to science by American mycologists [[Rolf Singer]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]], based on specimens collected in [[Nor Yungas Province]], [[Bolivia]], on the road to [[La Paz]] to [[Coroico]].<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/> They published a short description in [[Latin]] in a 1958 ''[[Mycologia]]'' publication,<ref name=Singer1958/> followed by a more detailed description in English later that year.<ref name=Singer1958b/> According to ''[[Psilocybe]]'' specialist [[Gast\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n]], the species ''Psilocybe acutissima'' (described by [[Roger Heim]] in 1958<ref name=Heim1958/>), and ''Psilocybe isauri'' (described by Singer in 1959<ref name=Singer1959/>) are [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]], as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the [[type (biology)|type]] material of all three.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Singer considered ''P.&nbsp;isauri'' a species distinct from ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface. Smith named the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' var. ''diconica'' for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) [[umbo (mycology)|papilla]]. Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to ''P.&nbsp;acutissima'' was a [[papillate]] cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/>\n\nGuzm\u00e1n places ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Cordisporae'', a grouping of ''Psilocybe'' species characterized primarily by having [[rhomboid]] spores less than 8&nbsp;[[micrometer]]s long.<ref>Guzm\u00e1n (1983), p. 106.</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''yungensis'' refers to the name of the [[type locality (biology)|type locality]].<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/> The natives of [[Huautla de Jim\u00e9nez]] and [[Mixe]] natives call ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' a ''hongo adivinador'' (\"divinatory mushroom\"), ''hong que adormece'' (\"soporific mushroom\"), or ''hongo genio'' (\"genius mushroom\").<ref name=Stamets1996/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Psilocybe yungensis 163986.jpg|thumb|left|Caps range in shape from conical to bell-shaped, and have a prominent umbo. Stems are densely covered with whitish fibrils pressed flat against the surface.]]\nThe ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are conical to bell-shaped in maturity, and reach a diameter of up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap surface is smooth and sticky, and, in moist specimens, has faint radial striations (grooves) that extend almost to the margin. The color of fresh caps ranges from dark reddish-brown to rusty brown to orangish-brown. Additionally, the cap is [[hygrophanous]], meaning it will change color depending on its state of hydration; a dry cap fades to become dull yellowish-brown or the color of \"dingy straw\". The cap frequently has a prominent [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]].<ref name=Stamets1996/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] attachment ranges from adnate (broadly attached to the stem) to adnexed (narrowly attached). The spacing of the narrow gills is close to crowded, and the gill color is initially dull gray before maturing spores cause the color to change to purplish-brown. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|to|2.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and more or less equal in width throughout its length or slightly larger near the base. The hollow, brittle, stem is pale brown on the upper part, and reddish-brown near the bottom. The stem is densely covered with whitish fibrils that are pressed flat against the surface; the fibrils slough off in maturity to leave a smooth surface.<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/> The mushroom has a cortinate [[partial veil]] (resembling the webby cortina produced by species of ''[[Cortinarius]]'') but it does not last for long; it occasionally leaves behind sparse remnants of tissue hanging on the cap margin and the upper part of the stem. No [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] remains on the stem after the veil disappears. All parts of the mushroom will stain blue when injured; these stains will blacken as the mushroom dries.<ref name=Stamets1996/>\n{{multiple image | align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header =\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Psilocybe yungensis 171324.jpg\n| caption1 = Spores and translucent cheilocystidia\n| image2 = Psilocybe yungensis 171250.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Cap cuticle]], cap tissue, and gill tissue at 100x magnification\n}}\nThe [[spore print]] is dark purplish-brown.

He made nearly 30 first-team appearances in a little over two years, then spent the last few weeks of the 1912\u201313 season with Fulham before returning to Arsenal, by then a [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] team. In the two seasons before the Football League was suspended for the duration of the First World War, he took his appearance total to 56 matches, then returned to the north-east where he worked in shipbuilding and then served in the [[Royal Engineers]].\n\nAfter the war, he played for [[Hartlepools United]] in the Northern Victory League, then helped Darlington reach runners-up spot in the 1919\u201320 North-Eastern League and win the title the following year. Darlington were elected to the newly formed [[Football League Third Division North|Northern Section of the Third Division]] in 1921, and Winship contributed to their second-place finish in their first season and their Northern Section title in 1924\u201325.

He made nearly 30 first-team appearances in a little over two years, then spent the last few weeks of the 1912\u201313 season with Fulham before returning to Arsenal, by then a [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] team. In the two seasons before the Football League was suspended for the duration of the First World War, he took his appearance total to 56 matches, then returned to the north-east where he worked in shipbuilding and then served in the [[Royal Engineers]].\n\nAfter the war, he played for [[Hartlepools United]] in the Northern Victory League, then helped Darlington reach runners-up spot in the 1919\u201320 North-Eastern League and win the title the following year. Darlington were elected to the newly formed [[Football League Third Division North|Northern Section of the Third Division]] in 1921, and Winship contributed to their second-place finish in their first season and their Northern Section title in 1924\u201325. Before Winship could represent Darlington in Second Division football, they had to pay \u00a3100 to Arsenal to transfer his registration, which that club had retained. He was not a regular at the higher level, but still took his total of league appearances for Darlington to nearly 150 over five seasons.

There were at least 10 tail feathers (''rectrices''), more than in other primitive fan-tailed birds. The overall shape of the tail was rounded and wedge-shaped when viewed from above; due to the symmetrical feathers, the sides of the tail were probably not held fully fanned into the wind but swept back, forming a partially fanned wedge, as in some modern birds like [[accipiter]]s, [[tyrant flycatcher]]s and [[sunbittern]]s.<ref name=hongshan2014/>\n\n==Biology==\n===Diet and ecology===\n[[File:DNHM D2945 6 skull.png|thumb|right|Skull of specimen DNHM D2945, highlighting teeth]]\nDue to the assumption of toothlessness, hongshanornithids were originally interpreted as having a very specialized diet and ecology, perhaps as waders or shorebirds due to their slim snouts and long legs. However, the confirmation that they did in fact have teeth in both jaws has led to a re-interpretation of their ecological niche. Though still considered probably wading birds, they probably had a more generalized diet than previously assumed, with the different snout shapes present in different members of the group indicating niche portioning within a general wading ecology (''Hongshanornis'' lived alongside the closely related ''Longicrusavis'', and both were very similar to each other except for the shape of the snout).<ref name=hongshan2014/> One specimen of ''Hongshanornis'' preserved several gizzard stones ([[gastrolith]]s) of various sizes, which is usually an indication of an herbivorous diet.<ref name=hongshan2014/> Another specimen originally assigned to the genus ''Hongshanornis'' preserved fossilized seeds in the [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]];<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Xiaoting Zheng |author2=Larry D.

The absence of wing slotting would suggest that ''Hongshanornis'' tended to fly mainly at relatively high speeds. Given the overall wing shape and comparison to modern birds, ''Hongshanornis'' probably flapped continuously when flying at lower speeds, and switched to bounding flight (rapid flapping alternating with periods of ballistic forward motion with the wings partly folded) at higher speeds.

The first few primary flight feathers were much shorter than the rest. The total wing area was 0.016 square meters. The wing digits bore small claws, with the claw on the first finger (the alular digit) much larger than that of the second finger (major digit).<ref name=hongshan2014/> ''Hongshanornis'' is characterized by very long legs, with the lower leg (''tibiotarsus'') more than one and a half times longer than the upper leg (''femur''). The toes were long and thin, with small claws. The first toe (''hallux'') was very small, and the second toe was much shorter than the fourth. The third toe was longest.<ref name=hongshan2014/>\n[[File:Hongshanornis.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Restoration]]\nThe bones of the tail have not been preserved in any known specimen, but comparison with related species suggest it was short with a small, [[plowshare]]-shaped [[pygostyle]] bone, to which the tail feathers anchored. A mass of muscles, called the rectorial bulb, probably was present to control the fanning of the trail feathers. The tail feathers were long, with symmetrical vanes. There were at least 10 tail feathers (''rectrices''), more than in other primitive fan-tailed birds. The overall shape of the tail was rounded and wedge-shaped when viewed from above; due to the symmetrical feathers, the sides of the tail were probably not held fully fanned into the wind but swept back, forming a partially fanned wedge, as in some modern birds like [[accipiter]]s, [[tyrant flycatcher]]s and [[sunbittern]]s.<ref name=hongshan2014/>\n\n==Biology==\n===Diet and ecology===\n[[File:DNHM D2945 6 skull.png|thumb|right|Skull of specimen DNHM D2945, highlighting teeth]]\nDue to the assumption of toothlessness, hongshanornithids were originally interpreted as having a very specialized diet and ecology, perhaps as waders or shorebirds due to their slim snouts and long legs. However, the confirmation that they did in fact have teeth in both jaws has led to a re-interpretation of their ecological niche. Though still considered probably wading birds, they probably had a more generalized diet than previously assumed, with the different snout shapes present in different members of the group indicating niche portioning within a general wading ecology (''Hongshanornis'' lived alongside the closely related ''Longicrusavis'', and both were very similar to each other except for the shape of the snout).<ref name=hongshan2014/> One specimen of ''Hongshanornis'' preserved several gizzard stones ([[gastrolith]]s) of various sizes, which is usually an indication of an herbivorous diet.<ref name=hongshan2014/> Another specimen originally assigned to the genus ''Hongshanornis'' preserved fossilized seeds in the [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]];<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Xiaoting Zheng |author2=Larry D.

The absence of wing slotting would suggest that ''Hongshanornis'' tended to fly mainly at relatively high speeds. Given the overall wing shape and comparison to modern birds, ''Hongshanornis'' probably flapped continuously when flying at lower speeds, and switched to bounding flight (rapid flapping alternating with periods of ballistic forward motion with the wings partly folded) at higher speeds. Overall, the wing and tail anatomy, and therefore probably flight style, of ''Hongshanornis'' was similar to many medium-sized [[passerine]] birds.<ref name=hongshan2014/>\n\n{{clearboth}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.palaeocritti.com/by-group/aves/ornithuromorpha/hongshanornis Information and photograph of the type specimen, Palaeocritti]\n\n{{portal|Paleontology}}\n{{Paraves|B.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3029892}}\n\n[[Category:Early Cretaceous birds of Asia]]\n[[Category:Yixian fauna]]\n[[Category:Basal Ornithurae]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 2005]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongshanornis"}
