The film centers on \"two key figures in the [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which dog-sled teams relayed to transport [[diphtheria]] [[antitoxin]] serum through harsh conditions over nearly 834 miles to save the Alaskan town of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] from an epidemic.\"<ref name=\"CoreDafoe\">{{cite web |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |title=Willem Dafoe to Star in Disney Adventure Movie 'Togo' (Exclusive) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/willem-dafoe-star-disney-adventure-movie-togo-1126749 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=July 14, 2018 |language=en |date=July 12, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe film is directed by [[Ericson Core]], produced by Kim Zubick, written by Tom Flynn and stars [[Willem Dafoe]],  [[Julianne Nicholson]], [[Christopher Heyerdahl]], [[Michael Gaston]], [[Michael McElhatton]], [[Jamie McShane]], [[Michael Greyeyes]], [[Thorbj\u00f8rn Harr]], [[Shaun Benson]] and [[Nikolai Nikolaeff]]. It was released on December 20, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film flashes between [[musher]] [[Leonhard Seppala]] raising his dog [[Togo (dog)|Togo]] and the 1925 serum run to [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]].\n\nIn 1913, Seppala and his wife Constance welcome a newborn [[Siberian Husky]] pup. While Seppala insists on immediately retiring him due to his small and weak state, Constance convinces him to raise him with the rest. The puppy Husky turns out to be a handful as he constantly escapes the kennel to usurp Seppala's dog team while he is out training them. After trying to get rid of the Husky twice, Seppala decides to have him run with the others where, to his astonishment, he discovers that he is energetic enough to outrun the other dogs. He decides to call him Togo, after admiral [[T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d]], and fully trains him to the point where he successfully wins the [[All Alaska Sweepstakes]], earning both Togo and himself some local fame.\n\nIn 1925, a [[diphtheria]] outbreak occurs; mostly affecting children. Mayor George Maynard plans to have the serum flown in from [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]], but this proves to be impossible due to the severity of the weather. Eventually, Seppala is convinced to take Togo and the other dogs to collect the serum and race back. Constance becomes concerned due to Togo being 12-years-old (old for [[Aging in dogs|dog age]]), but Seppala insists on going. Seppala and his team tread through stormy weather and take a break at an outpost where a local doctor named Atiqtalik tells him that Togo is tired. Seppala continues on for miles; taking a dangerous shortcut across the now frozen [[Norton Sound]].\n\nEventually, Seppala meets up with a fellow musher, Henry Ivanov, who was bringing the serum back and he is able to leave the next day. Seppala and his team head across the Sound again where he is forced to have Togo pull a piece of ice that they are stuck on as the Sound begins to crack apart. Reuniting with Atiqtalik, she tells him Togo is dying. Nevertheless, Seppala gets his team back to Joe Dexter's outpost as he, Togo and team recuperate. The serum is passed off to fellow musher [[Gunnar Kaasen]] who arrives back in Nome. A reporter, confusing him for being the sole musher, announces his dog [[Balto]] as the hero who saved Nome, disappointing Constance.\n\nSeppala returns to Nome later, where the entire town come to his house to celebrate Togo's success. Seppala later becomes upset when a cured girl named Sally deduces that Togo is dying. Seppala intends to continue training his dogs without Togo (who gained a small injury during the run), but he refuses to stop and chases down Seppala who welcomes him with open arms. Over the next two years, Togo welcomes puppies of his own that prove to be famous in their own right. Togo eventually passes away in 1929 with Seppala continuing to train dogs. A title card at the end reveals that while Balto had received a statue in his honor, Togo is remembered for making the longest run and for being the true hero of Nome.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[Leonhard Seppala]]\n* Diesel as [[Togo (dog)|Togo]]\n* [[Julianne Nicholson]] as Constance Seppala\n* [[Christopher Heyerdahl]] as Mayor George Maynard\n* [[Richard Dormer]] as Dr. Curtis Welch\n* Adrien Dorval as Bill Clark\n* Madeline Wickins as Sally Burdett\n* [[Michael Greyeyes]] as Amituk\n* [[Nive Nielsen]] as Atiqtalik\n* [[Nikolai Nikolaeff]] as Dan Murphy\n* [[Thorbj\u00f8rn Harr]] as Charlie Olsen\n* Catherine McGregor as Sarah Foley\n* [[Michael McElhatton]] as [[Jafet Lindeberg]]\n* Paul Piaskowski as Max Adams\n* [[Michael Gaston]] as Joe Dexter\n* [[Shaun Benson]] as [[Gunnar Kaasen]]\n* [[Jamie McShane]] as Scotty Allan\n* [[Zahn McClarnon]] as Tulimak\n* [[Brandon Oakes]] as Henry Ivanoff\n* Steven McCarthy as Dev Burdett\n\n==Production==\nOn October 28, 2015, it was announced that [[Walt Disney Pictures]] was developing a film about the [[1925 serum run to Nome]] focusing on the sled dog [[Togo (dog)|Togo]] and his owner [[Leonhard Seppala]].

Seppala's reaction to Balto getting the credit is not shown, though Constance is shown to be rather annoyed by the news. In real life, Seppala openly voiced his disapproval of the dog hero mix-up. In addition, the film depicts Seppala's sled team as being composed of 11 dogs, with Togo as the only lead dog. In real life, there were only 6 dogs on Seppala's team, and Togo was assisted in leading by another dog named Scotty. Furthermore, the movie displays Togo as a blue-eyed, [[agouti (coloration)|agouti]]-colored [[Siberian Husky]]. Togo was an agouti husky, but in real life, his eyes were actually brown. Also, Balto strongly resembles the way he looked real life, except that he has blue eyes as opposed to the dark brown eyes that he had in real life. The movie also depicts Togo living out the rest of his days with Seppala while in real life, Togo was given away to a fellow musher named Elizabeth Ricker in Maine. On parting with his best dog, Seppala stated, \"It was sad parting on a cold, gray March morning, when Togo raised a small paw to my knee as if questioning why he was not going along with me. I never had a better dog than Togo. His stamina, loyalty, and intelligence could not be improved upon. Togo was the best dog that ever traveled the Alaska trail.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/togo/|title=Togo (2019)|website=[[History vs. Hollywood]]|accessdate=December 24, 2019}}</ref> Seppala did visit Togo a couple of times and was by his side when he was euthanized.\n\n==Release==\n''Togo'' was originally scheduled to be released on [[Disney+]] on December 13, 2019<ref>{{cite web|title=Check out a first look at Togo, an original film streaming Dec. 13, only on @DisneyPlus.|url=https://twitter.com/DisneyStudios/status/1187430966106570752?s=19|work=Twitter||accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>, but was eventually moved and released a week later on December 20, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=In one week, witness the untold true story of Togo, an Original Movie, streaming Dec. 20 only on #DisneyPlus|url= https://facebook.com/DisneyPlus/videos/818992165180256|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=February 1, 2020|date=December 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2019/12/19/5-things-to-look-forward-to-when-togo-arrives-on-disney/ |title=5 Things to Look Forward to When Togo Arrives on Disney+!|last1=Pollock|first1=Tina|date=December 19, 2019|accessdate=February 1, 2020|work=Oh My Disney}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 90% and an [[average rating]] of 7.28/10, based on 31 reviews.

Seppala's reaction to Balto getting the credit is not shown, though Constance is shown to be rather annoyed by the news. In real life, Seppala openly voiced his disapproval of the dog hero mix-up. In addition, the film depicts Seppala's sled team as being composed of 11 dogs, with Togo as the only lead dog. In real life, there were only 6 dogs on Seppala's team, and Togo was assisted in leading by another dog named Scotty. Furthermore, the movie displays Togo as a blue-eyed, [[agouti (coloration)|agouti]]-colored [[Siberian Husky]]. Togo was an agouti husky, but in real life, his eyes were actually brown. Also, Balto strongly resembles the way he looked real life, except that he has blue eyes as opposed to the dark brown eyes that he had in real life. The movie also depicts Togo living out the rest of his days with Seppala while in real life, Togo was given away to a fellow musher named Elizabeth Ricker in Maine. On parting with his best dog, Seppala stated, \"It was sad parting on a cold, gray March morning, when Togo raised a small paw to my knee as if questioning why he was not going along with me. I never had a better dog than Togo. His stamina, loyalty, and intelligence could not be improved upon. Togo was the best dog that ever traveled the Alaska trail.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/togo/|title=Togo (2019)|website=[[History vs. Hollywood]]|accessdate=December 24, 2019}}</ref> Seppala did visit Togo a couple of times and was by his side when he was euthanized.\n\n==Release==\n''Togo'' was originally scheduled to be released on [[Disney+]] on December 13, 2019<ref>{{cite web|title=Check out a first look at Togo, an original film streaming Dec. 13, only on @DisneyPlus.|url=https://twitter.com/DisneyStudios/status/1187430966106570752?s=19|work=Twitter||accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>, but was eventually moved and released a week later on December 20, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=In one week, witness the untold true story of Togo, an Original Movie, streaming Dec. 20 only on #DisneyPlus|url= https://facebook.com/DisneyPlus/videos/818992165180256|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=February 1, 2020|date=December 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2019/12/19/5-things-to-look-forward-to-when-togo-arrives-on-disney/ |title=5 Things to Look Forward to When Togo Arrives on Disney+!|last1=Pollock|first1=Tina|date=December 19, 2019|accessdate=February 1, 2020|work=Oh My Disney}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 90% and an [[average rating]] of 7.28/10, based on 31 reviews.

In 1917, he was a leader of the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], supporting the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]]. He was the uncle of [[Alexander Berkman]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n\nMark Natanson was born in 1850 in [[\u0160ven\u010dionys]], [[Lithuania]] to a [[Jewish]] family. His parents died while he was still young, so he was brought up by his uncle. He graduated from the Kovno men's grammar school in 1868, studied in St Petersburg at the Medical and Surgical Academy (1868\u201371) and then at the Institute of Agriculture (1871). During this time, he became involved in radical student politics. \n\n===The populist movement===\nTogether with his first wife, he was one of the organizers of the populist [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]]. They opposed the '[[nihilistic]]' tendency of [[Sergei Nechaev]], who believed that any means were acceptable for achieving revolutionary goals. The Circle of Tchaikovsky, on the contrary, preached high morality and self-improvement <ref>{{cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/memoirs/memoirstoc.html|date=1899|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>. In 1869-71 he was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], and in 1872 he was exiled to the [[Arkhangelsk]] province. In the same 1872 he converted to [[Orthodoxy]] in order to formally marry the noblewoman [[:ru:\u0428\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0440, \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430|Olga Alexandrovna Shleisner]] who followed him into exile <ref>{{cite article|title=Nathanson Mark|publisher=[[Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia]]|language=ru}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1876, Natanson returned to [[Petrograd]]. He organized the escape abroad of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a comrade from the Circle of Tchaikovsky. In the same year, he began work on the unification of the [[Narodnik]] circles into a single revolutionary organization, which in 1878 was called \"[[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]].\" In December 1876, together with [[Georgi Plekhanov]], he organized a demonstration in [[Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Kazan square]]. In 1877, he was once again arrested and, after serving his term in the Peter and Paul Fortress, he was exiled to [[Eastern Siberia]].<ref name=MH>Mandred Hildermeier, ''The Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party Before the First World War.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000; pg. 382.</ref> Upon returning from exile in 1889, he settled in [[Saratov]], where he got a job on the local railway.\n\nAfter 'Land and Liberty' split, he once again began work on the unification of disparate revolutionary circles. He set himself the goal of uniting the populist, social democratic and liberal movements in the Russian liberation movement. In September 1893, at the constituent congress in Saratov, a single party, '[[The People's Will]]' (Narodnaya Volya), was created. The organization's headquarters were in [[Orel]] and they ran a printing house in [[Smolensk]], which printed the group's manifesto and revolutionary brochures. Narodnaya Volya favoured agitation among urban workers and intellectuals, rather than spreading propaganda among the peasants (a tactic adopted by the other offshoot of 'Land and Liberty', the '[[Black Repartition]]' group). Narodnaya Volya also endorsed political terrorism as a tactic and in 1881, they assassinated [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]]. Natanson was not directly involved in any terrorist act. In April 1894, Narodnaya Volya was liquidated by the police administrator [[Sergei Zubatov]], and its leaders were arrested. In exile in [[Yakutsk]], he married [[Varvara Alexandrova]].\n\nWhen a shipyard was organized for the construction of a ferry crossing on [[Lake Baikal]], the Corps of Ship Engineers needed an experienced and honest accountant, and Natanson took the job. His merits in organizing the construction are confirmed by the fact that on June 17, 1899, at the gala dinner in honor of the launch of the icebreaker \"Baikal\", there was a toast pronounced in honor of the political exile.\n\n===People's Rights Party===\nAfter his release he returned to [[European Russia]] and became active in [[Saratov]], where in 1893 he founded the party [[People's Rights Party]] ''(Partiia Narodnogo Prava).''<ref name=MH /> Historian Shmuel Galai has argued that \"for the first time in the annals of Russian parties, it declared organized public opinion to be the main weapon in the struggle against autocracy,\" in contradistinction to peasant revolt, general strike, or terror.<ref>Shmuel Galai, The Liberation Movement in Russia, 1900-1905. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1973; pg. 64.</ref> However, the People's Rights Party proved to be a short-lived venture, as in 1894, Natanson was arrested again and banished to eastern Siberia for ten years.<ref name=MH /> Natanson remained an active revolutionary even in Siberian exile, maintaining the party treasury and coordinating various organisational tasks.<ref name=MH />\n\nUpon returning from exile, he lived in [[Baku]], where he worked as an accountant in the city government. In 1904 he emigrated to [[Switzerland]], where he met with [[Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov]]<ref>{{cite book|first=N.K.|last=Krupskaya|title=Memoirs of V.I. Lenin|chapter=Memories of Lenin|date=1979}}</ref>. By this time, the Russian liberation movement had finally divided into [[social-democratic]], [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[populist]] movements. In 1902, the followers of the [[Narodniks]] united into the [[Party of Socialist Revolutionaries]]. After some hesitation, Nathanson joined the Socialist Revolutionaries and became one of their leaders. The successful assassination of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]], Natanson began to support the terrorist tactics of the Socialist Revolutionaries.\n\nThe tactical position adopted by the SRs represented a compromise between the rural agitation favoured by [[Peoples of the Caucasus|South Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] populists, the factory organisation favoured by the People's Rights Party and the terrorist tactics embraced by the remnants of 'The People's Will' and some of the revolutionary groups of Moscow and Petrograd. In September 1904, together with [[Viktor Chernov]] and [[Yevno Azef]], he negotiated with Plekhanov, Ulyanov and other social democrats in order to convince them to take part in the common cause. During the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], Natanson moved in [[Finland]]. At the first congress of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in early 1906, he was elected a member of the Party Central Committee. After the revolution was put down, he returned to exile in Switzerland.\n\nNatanson still held a reserved position in relation to the party\u2019s terrorist tactics. In 1906, he was an opponent of the assassination of [[George Gapon]], the decision on which was made without his consent <ref>{{cite book|last=Khazan|first=V.|title=Pinchas Rutenberg. From terrorist to Zionist.|publisher=Gesharim|date=2008}}</ref>. At his insistence, the party refused to take responsibility for this murder <ref>{{cite article|last=Rutenberg|first=Pinchas|title=The assassination of Gapon|publisher=Leningrad|date=1925}}</ref>. In 1907, he opposed the plan for the murder of [[Nicholas II]], developed by Azef and [[Grigory Gershuni]] <ref>{{cite article|last=Nikolaevsky|first=B.|title=The story of a traitor (Azef).|date=1991|url=https://archive.is/20120713004215/readr.ru/b-nikolaevskiy-istoriya-odnogo-predatelya.html%23page=2|accessdate=April 13, 2020|language=ru}}</ref>. However, in 1908, when [[Vladimir Burtsev]] began a campaign to expose Azef as an [[Agent provocateur|agent provocateur]], Nathanson defended Azef. Until the very end, he refused to believe in Azef\u2019s cooperation with the [[secret police]]. In his memoirs, Burtsev wrote that Natanson was the most evil of his opponents <ref>{{cite book|last=Burtsev|first=Vladimir|title=In pursuit of provocateurs|publisher=Contemporary|date=1989}}</ref>.\n\n===Years of exile===\nWhen the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, the SRs, like most other European socialist parties, split into those who supported a war of 'national defence' ('Defencists') and those who opposed the war ('Internationalists'). Natanson sided with the '[[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|Internationalists]]' and attended the international socialist peace conferences such as the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] and one at [[Kienthal Conference|Kienthal]] in Switzerland, signing the conference's manifestoes on behalf of the SR Internationalists.<ref name=MH />\n\nNatanson returned to Russia in 1917 where he was active in the administration of the SRs.\n\n===Founder of the Left SRs===\nAfter the [[February Revolution]] broke out, Natanson returned to Russia through German territory \u201cin a sealed wagon\u201d <ref name=\"Chernov\">{{cite article|last=Chernov|first=V.M.|title=In the party of socialist revolutionaries: Memories of eight leaders. |date=2007|url=http://ldn-knigi.lib.ru/R/Tshernow.htm|language=ru}}</ref>. He became one of the most prominent leaders of the left wing of the SRs, which became increasingly disenchanted with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] and with [[Alexander Kerensky]] and sharply criticized the defensive position of the of the SR central committee. Natanson advocated the \u201cdeepening\u201d of the revolution - the transfer of all land to peasants, and power to the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]. Natanson and the \"Left SRs\" supported the [[October Revolution]], causing a split in the Socialist Revolutionary Party. In November 1917, he initiated the creation of the party of [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]]. At the first Left SR congress, he was elected to the Presidium, and then to the Central Committee of the new party. \n\nThe Left SRs rejected the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]] (later superseded by the [[Versailles treaty]]), which imposed onerous terms on Russia in exchange for a separate peace with Russia. The Left SRs exited the Soviet government in protest, and some [[Left SR uprising|took up arms]] against the Bolsheviks. Natanson opposed this course, fearing that a defeat of the Soviet government would spell the end of the revolution and usher in a counter-revolution. He founded the [[Party of Revolutionary Communism]], which supported the Bolsheviks and eventually merged with the [[Communist Party of the USSR]]. Natanson was a member of the Presidium of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]]. However, Natanson's opposition to the anti-Bolshevik uprising of the Left SRs did not imply whole-hearted acceptance of the Bolsheviks' policies. In particular, he objected to Lenin's decision to ban all other political parties in the Soviet Union. In 1919, due to fear of arrest, he once again went into exile. \u201cI have complete discord with Lenin ... I no longer believe in Lenin,\u201d he told his relatives <ref name=\"Chernov\"/>.\n\n===Death and legacy===\nIn July 1919, Mark Natanson died in Switzerland from complications (thromboembolism and purulent pneumonia) after a surgical operation for a prostate tumor.

In 1917, he was a leader of the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], supporting the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]]. He was the uncle of [[Alexander Berkman]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n\nMark Natanson was born in 1850 in [[\u0160ven\u010dionys]], [[Lithuania]] to a [[Jewish]] family. His parents died while he was still young, so he was brought up by his uncle. He graduated from the Kovno men's grammar school in 1868, studied in St Petersburg at the Medical and Surgical Academy (1868\u201371) and then at the Institute of Agriculture (1871). During this time, he became involved in radical student politics. \n\n===The populist movement===\nTogether with his first wife, he was one of the organizers of the populist [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]]. They opposed the '[[nihilistic]]' tendency of [[Sergei Nechaev]], who believed that any means were acceptable for achieving revolutionary goals. The Circle of Tchaikovsky, on the contrary, preached high morality and self-improvement <ref>{{cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/memoirs/memoirstoc.html|date=1899|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>. In 1869-71 he was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], and in 1872 he was exiled to the [[Arkhangelsk]] province. In the same 1872 he converted to [[Orthodoxy]] in order to formally marry the noblewoman [[:ru:\u0428\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0440, \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430|Olga Alexandrovna Shleisner]] who followed him into exile <ref>{{cite article|title=Nathanson Mark|publisher=[[Shorter Jewish Encyclopedia]]|language=ru}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1876, Natanson returned to [[Petrograd]]. He organized the escape abroad of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a comrade from the Circle of Tchaikovsky. In the same year, he began work on the unification of the [[Narodnik]] circles into a single revolutionary organization, which in 1878 was called \"[[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]].\" In December 1876, together with [[Georgi Plekhanov]], he organized a demonstration in [[Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg|Kazan square]]. In 1877, he was once again arrested and, after serving his term in the Peter and Paul Fortress, he was exiled to [[Eastern Siberia]].<ref name=MH>Mandred Hildermeier, ''The Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party Before the First World War.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000; pg. 382.</ref> Upon returning from exile in 1889, he settled in [[Saratov]], where he got a job on the local railway.\n\nAfter 'Land and Liberty' split, he once again began work on the unification of disparate revolutionary circles. He set himself the goal of uniting the populist, social democratic and liberal movements in the Russian liberation movement. In September 1893, at the constituent congress in Saratov, a single party, '[[The People's Will]]' (Narodnaya Volya), was created. The organization's headquarters were in [[Orel]] and they ran a printing house in [[Smolensk]], which printed the group's manifesto and revolutionary brochures. Narodnaya Volya favoured agitation among urban workers and intellectuals, rather than spreading propaganda among the peasants (a tactic adopted by the other offshoot of 'Land and Liberty', the '[[Black Repartition]]' group). Narodnaya Volya also endorsed political terrorism as a tactic and in 1881, they assassinated [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]]. Natanson was not directly involved in any terrorist act. In April 1894, Narodnaya Volya was liquidated by the police administrator [[Sergei Zubatov]], and its leaders were arrested. In exile in [[Yakutsk]], he married [[Varvara Alexandrova]].\n\nWhen a shipyard was organized for the construction of a ferry crossing on [[Lake Baikal]], the Corps of Ship Engineers needed an experienced and honest accountant, and Natanson took the job. His merits in organizing the construction are confirmed by the fact that on June 17, 1899, at the gala dinner in honor of the launch of the icebreaker \"Baikal\", there was a toast pronounced in honor of the political exile.\n\n===People's Rights Party===\nAfter his release he returned to [[European Russia]] and became active in [[Saratov]], where in 1893 he founded the party [[People's Rights Party]] ''(Partiia Narodnogo Prava).''<ref name=MH /> Historian Shmuel Galai has argued that \"for the first time in the annals of Russian parties, it declared organized public opinion to be the main weapon in the struggle against autocracy,\" in contradistinction to peasant revolt, general strike, or terror.<ref>Shmuel Galai, The Liberation Movement in Russia, 1900-1905. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1973; pg. 64.</ref> However, the People's Rights Party proved to be a short-lived venture, as in 1894, Natanson was arrested again and banished to eastern Siberia for ten years.<ref name=MH /> Natanson remained an active revolutionary even in Siberian exile, maintaining the party treasury and coordinating various organisational tasks.<ref name=MH />\n\nUpon returning from exile, he lived in [[Baku]], where he worked as an accountant in the city government. In 1904 he emigrated to [[Switzerland]], where he met with [[Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov]]<ref>{{cite book|first=N.K.|last=Krupskaya|title=Memoirs of V.I. Lenin|chapter=Memories of Lenin|date=1979}}</ref>. By this time, the Russian liberation movement had finally divided into [[social-democratic]], [[liberal]] and [[populist]] movements. In 1902, the followers of the [[Narodniks]] united into the [[Party of Socialist Revolutionaries]]. After some hesitation, Nathanson joined the Socialist Revolutionaries and became one of their leaders. The successful assassination of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]], Natanson began to support the terrorist tactics of the Socialist Revolutionaries.\n\nThe tactical position adopted by the SRs represented a compromise between the rural agitation favoured by [[Peoples of the Caucasus|South Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] populists, the factory organisation favoured by the People's Rights Party and the terrorist tactics embraced by the remnants of 'The People's Will' and some of the revolutionary groups of Moscow and Petrograd.
