Due to the fact that the pupillary response is very rapid, it may be the case that the response may have finished by the time the pupil size was measured.\n\n== Reliability ==\nSome external variables such as light and near reflexes may cause variance to the task-evoked pupillary response.<ref name=\"Kramer_1991\" /><ref name=\"Beatty_1982\" /> It is for this reason, that Kramer argues that the use of this pupillary response as a scientific measure of cognitive load should be kept to the laboratory, and not for use in the field.<ref name=\"Kramer_1991\" /> This is shown further by Hess who found that when participants move their view across a non-uniform field, such as a photograph, the task-evoked pupillary response may be affected.<ref name=\"Kramer_1991\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pupil]]\n* [[Pupillometry]]\n* [[Psychophysiology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Task-Invoked Pupillary Response}}\n[[Category:Eye]]\n", "name_user": "Harshjoy46", "label": "safe", "comment": "added wiki link to iris sphincter muscle", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task-invoked_pupillary_response"}

Issues with uterine contractions are the main cause of prolonged labor during the latent phase. Contractions may not occur as of a result of uterine tumors. In addition, if the uterus is stretched, usually due to previous pregnancies or the birth of twins, contractions may be difficult. Irregular or weak contractions can be fixed through stimulation of the uterus or oxytocin infusions. Lack of contractions may be caused by an overwhelming amount of painkillers or anesthesia, by which the medications should be discontinued. In this case, it is appropriate for assisted vaginal delivery to be conducted.\n\n=== Cervical stenosis===\nCervical dystocia, or stenosis, occurs when the cervix fails to dilate after a practical amount of time during positive uterine pains. The main problems in cervical dystocia is the lack of uterine inertia and cervical abnormalities, which prevent the cervix from fully dilating.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arthur|first=Hugh R.|date=1949-12-01|title=Cervical Dystocia|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology|language=en|volume=56|issue=6|pages=983\u2013993|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1949.tb07164.x|pmid=15410101|issn=1471-0528}}</ref> It is very typical of patients that have [[hypopituitarism]].<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Arnot|first=Philip H.|date=January 1952|title=PROLONGED LABOR|journal=California Medicine|volume=76|issue=1|pages=20\u201322|issn=0008-1264|pmc=1521210|pmid=14886755}}</ref> There are many preexisting complications that may result in stenosis. Common conditions that lead to stenosis are tumors, a full bladder, large size of the infant, multiple pregnancies, delay in rupture of membranes, or problems with the cervix.<ref name=\":6\" /> High stress may interfere with the progression of pregnancy in cases such as these, leading to prolonged labor.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Cephalopelvic disproportion===\nCephalopelvic disproportion is the issue that arises when the fetus' body or head is to large to pass through the mother's pelvis.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://americanpregnancy.org/labor-and-birth/cephalopelvic-disproportion/|title=Cephalopelvic Disproportion (CPD): Causes and Diagnosis|date=2012-04-26|website=American Pregnancy Association|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> Common conditions that lead to CPD are [[diabetes]], multiple pregnancies, small or abnormally shaped pelvis, atypical fetal positions, hereditary factors, and first time pregnancies.<ref name=\":7\" /> Medical professionals can usually estimate if fetal size is too large based on [[ultrasounds]], but they are not always entirely accurate.<ref name=\":7\" /> Doctors typically determine CPD when labor begins and the use of oxytocin is not effective. The safest way for delivery to take place when CBD is a factor is through cesarean sections.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Prevention==\nIf the mother is being closely monitored and begins to show signs of prolonged labor, medical professionals can take preventive measures to better the chances of the women delivering her child within 24 hours.<ref name=\":3\" /> A precise initial diagnosis of prolonged labor based on signs and symptoms is extremely important in applying proper precautionary treatment.<ref name=\":3\" /> Oxytocin infusions upon an initial amniotomy is typically used to move normal labor back on track.<ref name=\":3\" /> The application of oxytocin is only effective if administered on the basis of fetal distress.<ref name=\":3\" /> This treatment method only pertains to specific states of the fetus. If the baby is experiencing malpresentation, for example, the only safe and reliable method to proceed with childbirth is medical interference.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n\n== Management==\nIn terms of medical care, preventive treatment or assisted delivery are typically the first options doctors consider. There is usually no quick fix to prolonged labor, especially if preventive measures do not revert the mother back to normal labor. Often, medical professionals resort to intervention methods. If the state of the fetus and mother are not especially serious or threatening to their health, doctors will perform assisted vaginal deliveries.\n\n=== Assisted vaginal delivery===\nThere are two different methods of assisted vaginal delivery that medical professionals typically utilize to aid in delivery in order to avoid surgical methods of fetal extraction. These procedures are only applied if a vaginal delivery has proven to still be safe to the mother and the baby, based on their vital signs. Assisted vaginal delivery is usually only used in the latent phase.<ref name=\":4\" /> Delivery during the active phase is usually associated with more complications for the mother.<ref name=\":4\" /> One approach to assisted vaginal delivery is the use of forceps.<ref name=\":4\" /> The forceps doctors use resemble two large salad spoons and are inserted into the cervix, around the baby's head and help to guide it out of the birth canal.<ref name=\":4\" /> The other option is the use of [[vacuum extraction]]. Vacuums used have a cup on the end and are inserted into the cervix.<ref name=\":4\" /> The cup attaches to the fetus's head by suction and aids in guiding delivery. The choice between forceps and vacuum extraction is usually made by the doctor based on preference. It is important that these methods are used properly, or else they can cause severe birth injuries to the baby that may be permanent.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Cesarian sections ===\nCesarian sections, also referred to as C-sections are usually quick solutions to the issue of failure to progress. Often times, [[C-sections]] are the best options to avoid harming the fetus or the mother, especially if labor proves to be life-threatening. One third of C-sections occur as a result of prolonged labor.<ref name=\":1\" /> C-sections are usually a necessary measure in prolonged labor to avoid serious birth complications. If the mother reaches the active phase of prolonged labor, a C-section is the safest solution. Cesarian sections need to be performed immediately if there are signs of fetal distress, [[uterine rupture]], or cord prolapse. It is important that medical professionals are equipped and prepared in the case of an imperative C-section. There is a window of time by which cesarian sections need to be executed if any warning signs present themselves. If there is a delay in the C-section, permanent damage can result to the baby, such as cerebral palsy or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Due to all the risk factors that are present in the event of prolonged labor, it is extremely important that medical teams are well-suited and prepared to conduct a C-section if needed.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB = \n|  ICD10 = {{ICD10|Xxx.x}}\n|  ICD9 = {{ICD9|xxx}}\n|  ICDO = \n|  OMIM = \n|  MedlinePlus = \n|  MeSH = \n|  GeneReviewsNBK = \n|  GeneReviewsName = \n|  Orphanet = \n}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Childbirth]]\n[[Category:Complications of labour and delivery]]\n[[Category:Midwifery]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Prolonged labor\n| synonyms        = Failure to progress\n| image           = Stages of Childbirth.png\n| alt             = \n| caption         = Normal stages of childbirth\n| pronounce       = \n| synonym         = \n| field           = \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Prolonged labor''' is the inability of a woman to proceed with [[childbirth]] upon going into labor.<ref name=\":1\" /> Prolonged labor typically lasts over 20 hours for first time mothers, and over 14 hours for women that have already had children.<ref name=\":1\" /> Failure to progress can take place during two different phases; the latent phase and active phase of labor.<ref name=\":1\" /> The latent phase of labor can be emotionally tiring and cause fatigue, but it typically does not result in further problems.<ref name=\":1\" /> The active phase of labor, on the other hand, if prolonged, can result in long term complications.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://americanpregnancy.org/labor-and-birth/prolonged-labor-failure-progress/|title=Prolonged Labor: Failure to Progress - Causes and Solutions|date=2014-08-15|website=American Pregnancy Association|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\nIt is important that the vital signs of mother and fetus are being monitored so preventive measures can be taken if prolonged labor begins.

The safest way for delivery to take place when CBD is a factor is through cesarean sections.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Prevention==\nIf the mother is being closely monitored and begins to show signs of prolonged labor, medical professionals can take preventive measures to better the chances of the women delivering her child within 24 hours.<ref name=\":3\" /> A precise initial diagnosis of prolonged labor based on signs and symptoms is extremely important in applying proper precautionary treatment.<ref name=\":3\" /> Oxytocin infusions upon an initial amniotomy is typically used to move normal labor back on track.<ref name=\":3\" /> The application of oxytocin is only effective if administered on the basis of fetal distress.<ref name=\":3\" /> This treatment method only pertains to specific states of the fetus. If the baby is experiencing malpresentation, for example, the only safe and reliable method to proceed with childbirth is medical interference.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n\n== Management==\nIn terms of medical care, preventive treatment or assisted delivery are typically the first options doctors consider. There is usually no quick fix to prolonged labor, especially if preventive measures do not revert the mother back to normal labor. Often, medical professionals resort to intervention methods. If the state of the fetus and mother are not especially serious or threatening to their health, doctors will perform assisted vaginal deliveries.\n\n=== Assisted vaginal delivery===\nThere are two different methods of assisted vaginal delivery that medical professionals typically utilize to aid in delivery in order to avoid surgical methods of fetal extraction. These procedures are only applied if a vaginal delivery has proven to still be safe to the mother and the baby, based on their vital signs. Assisted vaginal delivery is usually only used in the latent phase.<ref name=\":4\" /> Delivery during the active phase is usually associated with more complications for the mother.<ref name=\":4\" /> One approach to assisted vaginal delivery is the use of forceps.<ref name=\":4\" /> The forceps doctors use resemble two large salad spoons and are inserted into the cervix, around the baby's head and help to guide it out of the birth canal.<ref name=\":4\" /> The other option is the use of [[vacuum extraction]]. Vacuums used have a cup on the end and are inserted into the cervix.<ref name=\":4\" /> The cup attaches to the fetus's head by suction and aids in guiding delivery. The choice between forceps and vacuum extraction is usually made by the doctor based on preference. It is important that these methods are used properly, or else they can cause severe birth injuries to the baby that may be permanent.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Cesarian sections ===\nCesarian sections, also referred to as C-sections are usually quick solutions to the issue of failure to progress. Often times, [[C-sections]] are the best options to avoid harming the fetus or the mother, especially if labor proves to be life-threatening. One third of C-sections occur as a result of prolonged labor.<ref name=\":1\" /> C-sections are usually a necessary measure in prolonged labor to avoid serious birth complications. If the mother reaches the active phase of prolonged labor, a C-section is the safest solution. Cesarian sections need to be performed immediately if there are signs of fetal distress, [[uterine rupture]], or cord prolapse. It is important that medical professionals are equipped and prepared in the case of an imperative C-section. There is a window of time by which cesarian sections need to be executed if any warning signs present themselves. If there is a delay in the C-section, permanent damage can result to the baby, such as cerebral palsy or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Due to all the risk factors that are present in the event of prolonged labor, it is extremely important that medical teams are well-suited and prepared to conduct a C-section if needed.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB = \n|  ICD10 = {{ICD10|Xxx.x}}\n|  ICD9 = {{ICD9|xxx}}\n|  ICDO = \n|  OMIM = \n|  MedlinePlus = \n|  MeSH = \n|  GeneReviewsNBK = \n|  GeneReviewsName = \n|  Orphanet = \n}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Childbirth]]\n[[Category:Complications of labour and delivery]]\n[[Category:Midwifery]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolonged_labor"}

Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===14===\n\n===13===\n*[[Baldiri Alavedra]], 76, Spanish footballer ([[CE Sabadell FC]]), COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.fcbarcelona.cat/ca/futbol/primer-equip/noticies/1655433/mor-baldiri-alavedra Mor Baldiri Alavedra] {{in lang|cat}}</ref>\n*[[Juan Cotino]], 69, Spanish businessman and politician, [[Corts Valencianes|President of Valencian Courts]] (2011\u20132014) and [[Directorate-General of the Police|Director General of the National Police]] (1996\u20132002), COVID-19.<ref>[https://elpais.com/espana/2020-04-13/muere-por-coronavirus-juan-cotino-exdirector-de-la-policia-nacional-y-antiguo-dirigente-del-pp.html Muere por coronavirus Juan Cotino, exdirector de la Polic\u00eda Nacional y antiguo dirigente del PP] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n*[[Ashok Desai]], 77, Indian lawyer, [[Attorney General of India|Attorney General]] (1996\u20131998) and [[Solicitor General of India|Solicitor General]] (1989\u20131990).<ref>[https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/senior-advocate-and-former-attorney-general-for-india-ashok-desai-passes-away-155152 Senior Advocate And Former Attorney General For India Ashok Desai Passes Away]</ref>\n*[[Gerald O.

The former produced in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation period. During the Japanese occupation, rock sugar was one of Taiwan's important export commodities. Polycrystalline rock sugar is made by traditional techniques. In a period of Tang Dynasty (766-779A.D.), the Zou monk of Suining in Sichuan has invented this method. The related history can be seen in \"Tangshuangpu\", or \"Bencaogangmu\".  The biggest difference between the two is the way of crystal growth.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sugar-cultivation|title=SUGAR|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2018-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\nRock candy is often dissolved in tea. It is an important part of the [[tea culture]] of [[East Frisia]], where a lump of rock sugar is placed at the bottom of the cup. Rock candy consumed with tea is also the most common and popular way of drinking tea in Iran, where it is called ''nabat''; the most popular nabat is [[saffron]].<ref>{{cite web|website=My Persion Corner|url=http://www.mypersiancorner.com/2013/04/sweet-tea-persian-style.html|title=Sweet Tea Persion Style}}</ref>\n\nIt is a common ingredient in Chinese cooking. In [[China]], it is used to sweeten [[chrysanthemum tea]], as well as [[tong sui|Cantonese dessert soups]] and the liquor ''[[baijiu]]''.  Many households have rock candy available to marinate meats, add to stir fry, and to prepare food such as yao shan. In less modern times, rock sugar was a luxury only for the wealthy. Rock candy is also regarded as having medicinal properties, and in some Chinese provinces, it is used as a part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]].{{citation needed|date = June 2012}} \n\nIn [[Mexico]], it is used during the [[Day of the Dead]] to make sugar skulls, often highly decorated.

In Britain these are sweets, and \"candy\" tends to be restricted to sweets made only from boiled sugar and striped in bright colors.<ref>{{cite web|website=etymonline.com|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/candy|title=Candy}}</ref>\n\nThe modern American term \"rock candy\" (referring to brittle large natural sugar crystals) should not be confused with the British term [[Rock (confectionery)|rock]] (referring to an amorphous and opaque boiled sugar product, initially hard but then chewy at mouth temperature).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author= Richardson, Tim|date= 2002|title= Sweets:  A History of Candy|publisher= Bloomsbury|isbn= 978-1582342290|page= [https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/90 90]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/sweets00timr/page/90}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nIslamic writers in the first half of the 9th century described the production of candy sugar, where crystals were grown through cooling supersaturated sugar solutions.\nAccording to the production process, rock sugar is divided into two types: single crystal rock sugar and polycrystalline rock sugar. The former produced in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation period. During the Japanese occupation, rock sugar was one of Taiwan's important export commodities. Polycrystalline rock sugar is made by traditional techniques. In a period of Tang Dynasty (766-779A.D.), the Zou monk of Suining in Sichuan has invented this method. The related history can be seen in \"Tangshuangpu\", or \"Bencaogangmu\".  The biggest difference between the two is the way of crystal growth.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sugar-cultivation|title=SUGAR|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2018-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\nRock candy is often dissolved in tea. It is an important part of the [[tea culture]] of [[East Frisia]], where a lump of rock sugar is placed at the bottom of the cup. Rock candy consumed with tea is also the most common and popular way of drinking tea in Iran, where it is called ''nabat''; the most popular nabat is [[saffron]].<ref>{{cite web|website=My Persion Corner|url=http://www.mypersiancorner.com/2013/04/sweet-tea-persian-style.html|title=Sweet Tea Persion Style}}</ref>\n\nIt is a common ingredient in Chinese cooking. In [[China]], it is used to sweeten [[chrysanthemum tea]], as well as [[tong sui|Cantonese dessert soups]] and the liquor ''[[baijiu]]''.  Many households have rock candy available to marinate meats, add to stir fry, and to prepare food such as yao shan. In less modern times, rock sugar was a luxury only for the wealthy. Rock candy is also regarded as having medicinal properties, and in some Chinese provinces, it is used as a part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]].{{citation needed|date = June 2012}} \n\nIn [[Mexico]], it is used during the [[Day of the Dead]] to make sugar skulls, often highly decorated. Sugar skulls are given to children so they will not fear death; they are also offered to the dead.\n\nIn the [[Friesland]] province of the [[Netherlands]], bits of rock candy are baked in the luxury white [[bread]] ''[[Fryske S\u00fbkerb\u00f4le]]''.\n\nRock candy is a common ingredient in [[Tamil cuisine]], particularly in the [[Sri Lanka]]n city of [[Jaffna]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n<gallery style=\"packed\">\nCalavera.jpg\nCalavera_de_az\u00facar.JPG\nCalaveritas_inakiherrasti.JPG\nDay_of_the_Dead_Coyoacan_2014_-_1.JPG\nCalavera en ofrenda with Cempasuchil flowers.JPG\n</gallery>\n\nIn the US, rock candy comes in many colors and flavors, and is slightly hard to find, due to it being considered old-fashioned.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Misri==\n{{Infobox prepared food\n| name             = Misri\n| image            = [[File:Misri.JPG|250px]]\n| caption          = Misri crystals\n| alternate_name   = \n| country          = [[India]] and [[Iran]]\n| region           = \n| creator          = \n| course           = \n| type             = Rock candy or [[sweetener]]\n| served           = \n| main_ingredient  = \n| variations       = \n| calories         = \n| other            = \n}}\n\n'''Misri''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|\u0645\u0633\u0631\u06cc}}}}, {{lang-hi|\u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940}}, {{lang-bn|\u09ae\u09bf\u099b\u09b0\u09bf}}) refers to crystallized [[sugar]] lumps, and a type of [[confectionery]] mineral, which has its origins in [[India]] and [[Persia]], also known as rock sugar elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tarladalal.com/glossary-misri-1150i |title=Glossary: Misri|website= [[Tarla Dalal]] }}</ref> It is used in [[India]] as a type of candy, or used to sweeten milk or tea.<ref name=\"Dar1996\">{{cite book|author=Dar, Bashir Ahmad |title=Studies in Muslim philosophy and literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-zjAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 August 2011|date=January 1996|publisher=Iqbal Academy Pakistan|page=168}}</ref><ref name=\"Baden-Powell1868\">{{cite book|author= Baden-Powell, Henry|title=Hand-book of the economic products of the Punjab: with a combined index and glossary of technical vernacular words|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookeconomi00powgoog|accessdate=9 August 2011|year=1868|publisher= Thomason Civil Engineering College Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookeconomi00powgoog/page/n548 307]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Hinduism, mishri may be offered to a deity as ''bhog'' and distributed as ''[[prasad]]''.
