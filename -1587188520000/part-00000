Our ancestors survived on a diet high in fish, nuts, fruits, vegetables, wild game meat and bones. They also received a large amount of exercise from walking, bending, lifting, carrying, swimming, climbing, and other activities that were necessary to their daily routines.<ref>{{YouTube|sBVlXOliI8M|Dr. James O'Keefe on How to Live a Heart Healthy Lifestyle}}</ref> O\u2019Keefe recommends beverages including water, sparkling water, green tea and coffee; also, red wine can be a healthy choice if used in moderation.<ref>{{YouTube|KOc-susXfVY|Dr. James O'Keefe on The Best Diet for Preventing Heart Disease}}</ref>\n\n== Evolutionary basis of homosexuality ==\nO\u2019Keefe gave a TEDx Talk in October 2016, on the natural origin of homosexuality. In this talk, and subsequent scientific paper, he proposes a theory about the evolutionary basis of homosexuality mediated by epigenetics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.glreview.org/article/evolutionary-origins-of-homosexuality/|title=Evolutionary Origins of Homosexuality|last=O\u2019Keefe JH, O\u2019Keefe EL, Hodes J|first=|date=2018|website=The Gay & Lesbian Review|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-22}}</ref>  This theory posits that homosexuality is a naturally intended, normal variant that evolved to improve the interconnectedness and resilience of the family. The suite of psychological traits that tend to co-occur with same-sex orientation include increased IQ, and higher emotional intelligence, with less physical aggression. Through a complex interplay of epigenetics and genetics, homosexuality occurs more often in larger families, especially in a baby boy with multiple older brothers, or at times of increased stress during the pregnancy. In these settings, homosexuality is prescribed by nature largely via epigenetic changes in the developing fetus in response to the mother's environment.

Our ancestors survived on a diet high in fish, nuts, fruits, vegetables, wild game meat and bones. They also received a large amount of exercise from walking, bending, lifting, carrying, swimming, climbing, and other activities that were necessary to their daily routines.<ref>{{YouTube|sBVlXOliI8M|Dr. James O'Keefe on How to Live a Heart Healthy Lifestyle}}</ref> O\u2019Keefe recommends beverages including water, sparkling water, green tea and coffee; also, red wine can be a healthy choice if used in moderation.<ref>{{YouTube|KOc-susXfVY|Dr. James O'Keefe on The Best Diet for Preventing Heart Disease}}</ref>\n\n== Evolutionary basis of homosexuality ==\nO\u2019Keefe gave a TEDx Talk in October 2016, on the natural origin of homosexuality. In this talk, and subsequent scientific paper, he proposes a theory about the evolutionary basis of homosexuality mediated by epigenetics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.glreview.org/article/evolutionary-origins-of-homosexuality/|title=Evolutionary Origins of Homosexuality|last=O\u2019Keefe JH, O\u2019Keefe EL, Hodes J|first=|date=2018|website=The Gay & Lesbian Review|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-22}}</ref>  This theory posits that homosexuality is a naturally intended, normal variant that evolved to improve the interconnectedness and resilience of the family. The suite of psychological traits that tend to co-occur with same-sex orientation include increased IQ, and higher emotional intelligence, with less physical aggression. Through a complex interplay of epigenetics and genetics, homosexuality occurs more often in larger families, especially in a baby boy with multiple older brothers, or at times of increased stress during the pregnancy. In these settings, homosexuality is prescribed by nature largely via epigenetic changes in the developing fetus in response to the mother's environment. This can help to reduce overpopulation pressures at the family level; the gay individual also tends to improve the emotional bonding of their family and friends, thereby improving the strength survivability of the group.\n\n== Research ==\nO'Keefe's research and publications have focused mostly on exercise, diet and evolution.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2008.08.050 |pmid=19055985 |title=Vitamin D Deficiency |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |volume=52 |issue=24 |pages=1949\u201356 |year=2008 |last1=Lee |first1=John H |last2=O'Keefe |first2=James H |last3=Bell |first3=David |last4=Hensrud |first4=Donald D |last5=Holick |first5=Michael F }}</ref> Daily exercise is one of the key components of lifestyle for promoting health and longevity, and will reduce risks for heart disease, Alzheimer's, hypertension, osteoporosis, depression and diabetes dramatically.

This gives us that constant amortized time access to the ends of a sequence.\n\nTo transform, start with the balanced 2-3 tree.\n\nTake the leftmost and rightmost internal nodes of the tree and pull them up so the rest of the tree dangles between them as shown in the image to the right. \n[[File:Finger tree one spine.jpg|alt=2-3 finger tree with one spine|thumb|300x300px|Same 2-3 finger tree as above but with one spine.]]\nCombines the spines to make a standard 2-3 finger tree.\n\nThis can be described as: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ndata FingerTree a = Empty \n                    | Single a \n                    | Deep (Digit a) (FingerTree (Node a)) (Digit a)\ndata Node a = Node2 a a | Node3 a a a\n</syntaxhighlight><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe digits in the examples shown are the nodes with letters.

In a transformed 2-3 tree it seems that the digit lists at the top level can have a length of two or three with the lower levels only having length of one or two.

This means a sequence of ''n'' elements is represented by a tree of depth \u0398(log ''n'').

Whether the structure is persistent or not, all operations take \u0398(1) amortized time. The analysis can be compared to Okasaki's implicit deques, the only difference being that the FingerTree type stores Nodes instead of pairs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Application ==\nFinger trees can be used to build other trees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abhiroop.github.io/Finger-Trees/|title=Finger Tree - The ultimate data structure?|last=Sarkar|first=Abhiroop|website=abhiroop.github.io|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> For example, a [[priority queue]] can be implemented by labeling the internal nodes by the minimum priority of its children in the tree, or an indexed list/array can be implemented with a labeling of nodes by the count of the leaves in their children. Other applications are random-access sequences, described below, [[ordered sequence]]s, and [[interval tree]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinger trees can provide amortized O(1) pushing, reversing, popping, O(log n) append and split; and can be adapted to be indexed or ordered sequences. And like all functional data structures, it is inherently [[persistent data structure|persistent]]; that is, older versions of the tree are always preserved.\n\n=== Random-access sequences ===\nFinger trees can efficiently implement random-access sequences. This should support fast positional operations including accessing the ''n''th element and splitting a sequence at a certain position. To do this, we annotate the finger tree with sizes.<ref name=\":0\" /><syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Size = Size{ getSize :: N }\n  deriving (Eq, Ord)\n\ninstance Monoid Size where\n  \u2205 = Size 0\n  Size m \u2295 Size n = Size (m + n)\n</syntaxhighlight>The ''N'' is for natural numbers. The new type is needed because the type is the carrier of different monoids. Another new type is still needed for the elements in the sequence, shown below. \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Elem a = Elem{ getElem :: a }\nnewtype Seq a = Seq (FingerTree Size (Elem a))\n\ninstance Measured (Elem a) Size where\n  ||Elem|| = Size 1\n</syntaxhighlight>These lines of code show that instance works a base case for measuring the sizes and the elements are of size one. The use of '''newtype'''s doesn't cause a run-time penalty in Haskell because in a library, the ''Size'' and ''Elem'' types would be hidden from the user with wrapper functions.\n\nWith these changes, the length of a sequence can now be computed in constant time.\n\n== First publication ==\nFinger trees were first published in 1977 by [[Leonidas J.

The analysis can be compared to Okasaki's implicit deques, the only difference being that the FingerTree type stores Nodes instead of pairs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Application ==\nFinger trees can be used to build other trees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abhiroop.github.io/Finger-Trees/|title=Finger Tree - The ultimate data structure?|last=Sarkar|first=Abhiroop|website=abhiroop.github.io|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> For example, a [[priority queue]] can be implemented by labeling the internal nodes by the minimum priority of its children in the tree, or an indexed list/array can be implemented with a labeling of nodes by the count of the leaves in their children. Other applications are random-access sequences, described below, [[ordered sequence]]s, and [[interval tree]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinger trees can provide amortized O(1) pushing, reversing, popping, O(log n) append and split; and can be adapted to be indexed or ordered sequences. And like all functional data structures, it is inherently [[persistent data structure|persistent]]; that is, older versions of the tree are always preserved.\n\n=== Random-access sequences ===\nFinger trees can efficiently implement random-access sequences. This should support fast positional operations including accessing the ''n''th element and splitting a sequence at a certain position. To do this, we annotate the finger tree with sizes.<ref name=\":0\" /><syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Size = Size{ getSize :: N }\n  deriving (Eq, Ord)\n\ninstance Monoid Size where\n  \u2205 = Size 0\n  Size m \u2295 Size n = Size (m + n)\n</syntaxhighlight>The ''N'' is for natural numbers. The new type is needed because the type is the carrier of different monoids. Another new type is still needed for the elements in the sequence, shown below. \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Elem a = Elem{ getElem :: a }\nnewtype Seq a = Seq (FingerTree Size (Elem a))\n\ninstance Measured (Elem a) Size where\n  ||Elem|| = Size 1\n</syntaxhighlight>These lines of code show that instance works a base case for measuring the sizes and the elements are of size one. The use of '''newtype'''s doesn't cause a run-time penalty in Haskell because in a library, the ''Size'' and ''Elem'' types would be hidden from the user with wrapper functions.\n\nWith these changes, the length of a sequence can now be computed in constant time.\n\n== First publication ==\nFinger trees were first published in 1977 by [[Leonidas J.

It was named after the [[World War I]] aviator  [[Max Immelmann]]. It served until its disolution in October 1943. The wing operated the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', exclusively, in the combat role.\n\nFormed on 1 May 1939 StG 2 fought in the German [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 which started World War II. It formed part of [[Luftflotte 2]] in May and June 1940 and flew in support of [[Army Group A]] in the [[Battle of Belgium]] and [[Battle of France]]. StG 2 remained with Luftflotte 2 during the [[Battle of Britain]] before transfering to southern Europe to participate in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]].\n\nIn the south it mainly served in the [[Maritime interdiction]] role as it [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|bombarded Malta]] from January to March 1941. The wing then fought in the [[German invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Crete]] in April 1941 in the Martime, [[Air interdiction]], [[Offensive counter air|counter-air]] and [[close air support]] role alongside [[StG 1]], [[StG 3]] and [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 77|StG 77]]. The Ju 87 groups were successful in the [[Battle of Crete]], the final phase of the Greek campaign.\n\nElements of the wing fought in the [[North African Campaign]] until January 1942. The bulk of StG 2 fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] from 22 June 1941, after [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] began. It fought in support of all three Army Groups, and served in major battles such as the [[Siege of Leningrad]], [[Battle of Moscow]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1941 and 1942.\n\nStG 2 supported German forces in the [[Battle of Kursk]], one of the last major offensives on the Eastern Front in July 1943. The vulnerability of the Ju 87 and the loss of [[air superiority]] to the [[Red Air Force]], precluded any further large-scale use of the aircraft in the traditional dive-bombing role. In October 1943, the Ju 87 units were renamed ''Schlachtgeschwader'', battle wings, with a mixed number of Ju 87s and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s operating in the anti-tank role.\n\nStab., I., and III./StG 2 was renamed [[Schlachtgeschwader 2]] on the 18 October 1943, and ceased to exist. II./StG 2 continued, without redesignation to operate until January 1944, when its ''staffeln'' (squadrons) were renamed and equipped.\n\n==Background==\nThe dive-bomber is often associated with German aerial development in the [[Inter-war period|pre-war era]], but the type remained a low-priority for air planners who shaped the embryonic ''Luftwaffe''.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}} This apparent regression from the practices and experiences of [[World War I]] stemmed from the belief among the [[General Staff]] (''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'') that army support aviation in 1917\u20131918 was purely a reaction to [[trench warfare]].{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nGerman air doctrine remained rooted in the fundamentals of ''Operativer Luftkrieg'' (Operational Air War) which stressed [[interdiction]], [[strategic bombing]] (when and if possible) but primarily the [[air supremacy]] mission. The [[Spanish Civil War]] experience encouraged the General Staff to embrace the dive-bomber concept later in the 1930s, though the war's influence on German operational preferences remain ambiguous.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nOn the eve of World War II, some German air planners regarded the dive-bomber as a strategic weapon to strike with precision at enemy industry. Even factored into the army support groups, only fifteen percent of ''Luftwaffe'' front-line strength contained specialist ground-attack aircraft in September 1939. The lack of specialist close support aircraft left the general-purpose dive-bomber, the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', most suited to the close support role.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\n===Formation===\n''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' 2 was formed on 1 May 1939 upon the establishment of all three ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppen]]''.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pp=81, 87, 91}} The [[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|''Stabsstaffel'']] (command unit) was formed at [[K\u00f6ln]]\u2013[[Ostheim]] on 15 October 1939.

Over the next 12 days, the workers at the shipyard in the Grand Harbour repaired the carrier under determined air attack so that she might make Alexandria. On 13 January, the Ju 87s, now equipped with SC&nbsp;1000 bombs failed to achieve a hit. On 14 January, 44 Ju 87s scored a hit on the ill-fated after lift. On 18 January, the Germans switched to attacking the airfields at [[Hal Far]] and [[RAF Luqa]] in an attempt to win air superiority before returning to ''Illustrious''. On 20 January, two near misses breached the hull below the water line and hurled her hull against the wharf. Nevertheless, the engineers won the battle.

We could not risk making a dive-bombing attack from 4,000 metres because of the wide area of bomb dispersion. We had to fly a slant range attack, releasing bombs directly over the roofs. We had to push bombs directly into the target like loaves of bread into an oven, with one aircraft succeeding the other.{{sfn|Jones|2007|p=202}}</blockquote>\n\nThe heavy bombs employed by the ''Stukas'' were fitted with delayed-action fuses, and anti-tank warheads to penetrate roofs, buildings and bunkers.

The 1st Tanks Corps had only 33 tanks remaining at the end of the action on 20 July.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007c|p=109}} The following day StG 2 lost another of its irreplaceable Knight's Cross winners.

Five of the ''Geschwader's'' Knight's Cross recipients were killed.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2007c|p=118}}\n\n===Retreat and disbandment===\n\nThe Soviet summer offensives drove the Wehrmacht and its allies back into [[Central Ukraine]], from August through to October 1943. I./StG 2 retreated to [[Karachev]] by 19 July. From 14 August it operated at [[Poltava]], and then along the Mius front, in the vicinity of Stalino and over Dmitriyevka, 84&nbsp;km east of [[Dnepropetrovsk]] by 29 August. The goup ended operations at Pervomaisk on 18 October 1943. Of the losses recorded, there were seven Ju 87s destroyed and two damaged from 20 August to 18 October 1943. Among the victims was commanding officer, Alwin B\u00f6rst, wounded in action on 27 September 1943.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=81}}\n\nII./StG 2 remained active over [[Donets]], [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]], [[Zaporozhye]] and the [[Kherson]] bridgehead. From August to October 1943 it recorded eight losses and one damaged. 5./StG  commanding officer, Peter Keller was killed on 28 October. The group was uniquely exempted for redesignation in October 1943 and continued to exist as an independent group attached first to [[Luftflotte 6]], then [[luftflotte 4]]. In January 1944, 4 and 6./StG 2 departed the front for Neisse in [[Upper Silesia]] where they were renamed 10.(Pz[[SG 3]] and 10.(Pz)/[[SG 7]] on 7 March 1944. They were re-equipped with the Ju 87G.

It was named after the [[World War I]] aviator  [[Max Immelmann]]. It served until its disolution in Octobr 1943. The wing operated the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', exclusively, in the combat role.\n\nFormed on 1 May 1939 StG 2 fought in the German [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 which started World War II. It formed part of [[Luftflotte 2]] in May and June 1940 and flew in support of [[Army Group A]] in the [[Battle of Belgium]] and [[Battle of France]]. StG 2 remained with Luftflotte 2 during the [[Battle of Britain]] before transfering to southern Europe to participate in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]].\n\nIn the south it mainly served in the [[Maritime interdiction]] role as it [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|bombarded Malta]] from January to March 1941. The wing then fought in the [[German invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Crete]] in April 1941 in the Martime, [[Air interdiction]], [[Offensive counter air|counter-air]] and [[close air support]] role alongside [[StG 1]], [[StG 3]] and [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 77|StG 77]]. The Ju 87 groups were successful in the [[Battle of Crete]], the final phase of the Greek campaign.\n\nElements of the wing fought in the [[North African Campaign]] until January 1942. The bulk of StG 2 fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] from 22 June 1941, after [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] began. It fought in support of all three Army Groups, and served in major battles such as the [[Siege of Leningrad]], [[Battle of Moscow]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1941 and 1942.\n\nStG 2 supported German forces in the [[Battle of Kursk]], one of the last major offensives on the Eastern Front in July 1943. The vulnerability of the Ju 87 and the loss of [[air superiority]] to the [[Red Air Force]], precluded any further large-scale use of the aircraft in the traditional dive-bombing role. In October 1943, the Ju 87 units were renamed ''Schlachtgeschwader'', battle wings, with a mixed number of Ju 87s and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s operating in the anti-tank role.\n\nStab., I., and III./StG 2 was renamed [[Schlachtgeschwader 2]] on the 18 October 1943, and ceased to exist. II./StG 2 continued, without redesignation to operate until January 1944, when its ''staffeln'' (squadrons) were renamed and equipped.\n\n==Background==\nThe dive-bomber is often associated with German aerial development in the [[Inter-war period|pre-war era]], but the type remained a low-priority for air planners who shaped the embryonic ''Luftwaffe''.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}} This apparent regression from the practices and experiences of [[World War I]] stemmed from the belief among the [[General Staff]] (''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'') that army support aviation in 1917\u20131918 was purely a reaction to [[trench warfare]].{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nGerman air doctrine remained rooted in the fundamentals of ''Operativer Luftkrieg'' (Operational Air War) which stressed [[interdiction]], [[strategic bombing]] (when and if possible) but primarily the [[air supremacy]] mission. The [[Spanish Civil War]] experience encouraged the General Staff to embrace the dive-bomber concept later in the 1930s, though the war's influence on German operational preferences remain ambiguous.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nOn the eve of World War II, some German air planners regarded the dive-bomber as a strategic weapon to strike with precision at enemy industry. Even factored into the army support groups, only fifteen percent of ''Luftwaffe'' front-line strength contained specialist ground-attack aircraft in September 1939. The lack of specialist close support aircraft left the general-purpose dive-bomber, the [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', most suited to the close support role.{{sfn|Muller|1992|pp=17\u201319}}\n\n===Formation===\n''Sturzkampfgeschwader'' 2 was formed on 1 May 1939 upon the establishment of all three ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppen]]''.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pp=81, 87, 91}} The [[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|''Stabsstaffel'']] (command unit) was formed at [[K\u00f6ln]]\u2013[[Ostheim]] on 15 October 1939. The stab unit was predominantly equipped with [[Dornier Do 17]] aircraft and a handful of Ju 87s for reconnaissance and personnel transport purposes. The ''Gruppen'' were equipped with the Ju 87 dive bomber.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=72}}\n\nThe wing's first commanding officer was [[Oskar Dinort]]. I./StG 2 was established in [[Breslau]] from I./StG 163.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=75}} II./StG 2 in [[S\u0142upsk|Stolp-Reitt]] from I./StG 162, and III./StG 2 from III./StG 163 in [[Bad Langensalza|Langensalza]].{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pP=82, 91}} Dinort led the wing and first ''Gruppe'' upon StG 2's creation. Dinort then relinquished command of I./StG 2 for control of Stab./StG 2. ''[[Hauptmann]]'' Ulrich Schmidt and Ernst Ott commanded the first and second ''Gruppen''. ''Hauptmann'' [[Hubertus Hitschhold]] succeeded Dinort mid-way through StG's first major campaign.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|pp=75, 82, 91}}\n\nIn August 1939 Dinort moved I./StG 2 to Nieder-Ellguth under the ''Fliegerdivision'' 2 (Flying Division 2) subordinated to [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' 4]] (Air Fleet 4). 38 Ju 87s were available to Dinort, only one was non-operational. An additional three [[Dornier Do 17]]P reconnaissance aircraft were operational.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=75}} Ulrich Schmidt commanded 38 Ju 87s, all but two operational with three Do 17P aircraft. Based at Stolp-Reitz, Schmidt was subordinated to [[1st Air Division (Germany)|''Fliegerdivision'' 1]] (Flying Division) and [[Luftflotte 1|''Luftflotte'' 1]] (Air Fleet 1).{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=82}} III./StG 2 was assigned the same division and air fleet with second ''Gruppe''. 34 of 36 Ju 87s and the three Do 17Ps were available at Stolp-West, near Annafeld and [[Danzig]] by 1 September 1939.{{sfn|de Zeng|Stankey|Creek|2009|p=91}}\n\n==World War II==\n===Poland===\nOn 1 September 1939 the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' began the [[invasion of Poland]] followed sixteen days later by the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]].

Hozzel remarked that StG 2 had to abandon traditional dive-bombing in favour of improvised tactics;<blockquote>We had to do precision bombing to avoid danger to our troops entrenched too close to the target area. We could not risk making a dive-bombing attack from 4,000 metres because of the wide area of bomb dispersion. We had to fly a slant range attack, releasing bombs directly over the roofs. We had to push bombs directly into the target like loaves of bread into an oven, with one aircraft succeeding the other.{{sfn|Jones|2007|p=202}}</blockquote>\n\nThe heavy bombs employed by the ''Stukas'' were fitted with delayed-action fuses, and anti-tank warheads to penetrate roofs, buildings and bunkers.
