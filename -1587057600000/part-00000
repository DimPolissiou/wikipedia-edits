The prisoner beaten up gets saved by another prisoner named Sachidanandan. Later he is called to the station and he comes to know that he will be released from prison very soon. He also receives a letter from his brother saying that a suprise awaits him as he gets released. As he goes through the letter, old memories flash back in his mind.\n\nPoochi's father was about to remarry. Sachi was very excited for getting a new mother. He also saw that the mother had a son which was going to be his step-brother named Vishnu. He tries to befriend and love Vishnu but he rejects him but later on starts accepting him. His step-mother is also going to have a new baby. Once after returning from a function Sachi, witnesses his step mother harassed by her ex-husband and tries to take away Vishnu. Sachi kills the man while saving his brother and mother.Sed Bgm. He goes to a juvenile home for his crime and over there he befriends Khan, Ghani and Pareekkar. Once he witnesses Khan and Ghani getting beaten up by a sadistic police officer. Sachi kills the officer while trying to save his friends and hence goes to a central jail because he was an adult aged 16. He is sentenced for two life term sentences. In the prison, he discovers his ability to see in the dark.\n\nAs he exits the prison he is well-received by his younger brother who was born after he went to jail who was Manu. He was also received by his prison friends Pareekkar, Khan and Ghani. They invite Sachi to join them to work with Edwin Moses who is a drug mafia leader. Sachi warns them and decides to lead a peaceful life with his family. The surprise awaiting him was that his brother Dr.Vishnu was soon to marry Vandhana who was a doctor and the marriage was postponed so that Sachi can witness the marriage as Vishnu was adamant. The marriage takes place and as Vandhana seeks Sachi's blessings, she realizes that he was the one who saved her from a gang and in the process of saving her, Sachi's back was scratched by a sickle. The next day Vandhana forces Sachi to tell the truth about him.\n\nWhen the police found out that Sachi could see in the dark, he and many other prisoners was sent for commando operations. They were often sent unarmed to face armed opponents. Sachi's jail term was extended as every time he went for the operation, the report written was that he jumped or escaped from the jail. Many prisoners never returned. Their bodies were found in random places. A police officer named Vedantham IPS approaches Sachi. He explains to him that the drug mafia has returned stronger as ever, and it is controlled by a person whom no one has seen named Edwin Moses. He tells Sachi that innocent people are used for drug business without their knowledge. Sachi rejects it saying that he wants to live peacefully with his family.\n\nSachi and his family faces many troubles from Edwin Moses  and Shetty. Later Shetty explains to Sachi that Edwin is doing all this for a drug container worth crores which is in Shetty's control. Sachi finds his friends with alliance with Edwin Moses but reveals to him that they had nothing to do with it unless a gangster named Muthan died. Edwin had been pestering them for the container. It was revealed that Sachi had the container. He had stolen it from Muthan earlier. Edwin's men attack Sachi and his friends.

The prisoner beaten up gets saved by another prisoner named Sachidanandan. Later he is called to the station and he comes to know that he will be released from prison very soon. He also receives a letter from his brother saying that a suprise awaits him as he gets released. As he goes through the letter, old memories flash back in his mind.\n\nSachi's father was about to remarry. Sachi was very excited for getting a new mother. He also saw that the mother had a son which was going to be his step-brother named Vishnu. He tries to befriend and love Vishnu but he rejects him but later on starts accepting him. His step-mother is also going to have a new baby. Once after returning from a function Sachi, witnesses his step mother harassed by her ex-husband and tries to take away Vishnu. Sachi kills the man while saving his brother and mother. He goes to a juvenile home for his crime and over there he befriends Khan, Ghani and Pareekkar. Once he witnesses Khan and Ghani getting beaten up by a sadistic police officer. Sachi kills the officer while trying to save his friends and hence goes to a central jail because he was an adult aged 16. He is sentenced for two life term sentences. In the prison, he discovers his ability to see in the dark.\n\nAs he exits the prison he is well-received by his younger brother who was born after he went to jail who was Manu. He was also received by his prison friends Pareekkar, Khan and Ghani. They invite Sachi to join them to work with Edwin Moses who is a drug mafia leader. Sachi warns them and decides to lead a peaceful life with his family. The surprise awaiting him was that his brother Dr.Vishnu was soon to marry Vandhana who was a doctor and the marriage was postponed so that Sachi can witness the marriage as Vishnu was adamant. The marriage takes place and as Vandhana seeks Sachi's blessings, she realizes that he was the one who saved her from a gang and in the process of saving her, Sachi's back was scratched by a sickle. The next day Vandhana forces Sachi to tell the truth about him.\n\nWhen the police found out that Sachi could see in the dark, he and many other prisoners was sent for commando operations. They were often sent unarmed to face armed opponents. Sachi's jail term was extended as every time he went for the operation, the report written was that he jumped or escaped from the jail. Many prisoners never returned. Their bodies were found in random places. A police officer named Vedantham IPS approaches Sachi. He explains to him that the drug mafia has returned stronger as ever, and it is controlled by a person whom no one has seen named Edwin Moses. He tells Sachi that innocent people are used for drug business without their knowledge. Sachi rejects it saying that he wants to live peacefully with his family.\n\nSachi and his family faces many troubles from Edwin Moses  and Shetty. Later Shetty explains to Sachi that Edwin is doing all this for a drug container worth crores which is in Shetty's control. Sachi finds his friends with alliance with Edwin Moses but reveals to him that they had nothing to do with it unless a gangster named Muthan died. Edwin had been pestering them for the container.

Unlike [[DNA]] synthesis in living cells, artificial gene synthesis does not require template DNA, allowing virtually any DNA sequence to be synthesized in the laboratory. It comprises two main steps, the first of which is [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|solid-phase DNA synthesis]],  sometimes known as 'DNA printing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/05/07/404460240/dna-printing-a-big-boon-to-research-but-some-raise-concerns|title=DNA 'Printing' A Big Boon To Research, But Some Raise Concerns|publisher=}}</ref> This produces oligonucleotide fragments that are generally under 200 base pairs. The second step then involves connecting these oligonucleotide fragments using various DNA assembly methods. Because artificial gene synthesis does not require template DNA, it is theoretically possible to make a completely synthetic DNA molecules with no limits on the nucleotide sequence or size.\n\nSynthesis of the first complete gene, a yeast [[tRNA]], was demonstrated by [[Har Gobind Khorana]] and coworkers in 1972.<ref name=\"Khorana722\">{{cite journal|author=Khorana HG|author2=Agarwal KL|author3=B\u00fcchi H|last4=Caruthers|first4=M.H.|last5=Gupta|first5=N.K.|last6=Klbppe|first6=K.|last7=Kumar|first7=A.|last8=Ohtsuka|first8=E.|last9=Rajbhandary|first9=U.L.|display-authors=3|date=December 1972|title=Studies on polynucleotides. 103.

Early in the genome sequencing era, gene synthesis was used as an (expensive) source of [[cDNA]]s that were predicted by genomic or partial cDNA information but were difficult to clone. As higher quality sources of sequence verified cloned cDNA have become available, this practice has become less urgent.\n\nProducing large amounts of [[protein]] from gene sequences (or at least the protein coding regions of genes, the [[open reading frame]]) found in nature can sometimes prove difficult and is a problem of sufficient impact that scientific conferences have been devoted to the topic. Many of the most interesting proteins sought by molecular biologists are normally regulated to be expressed in very low amounts in [[wild type]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pegsummit.com/dpx | title=Difficult to Express Proteins | year=2010 | work=Sixth Annual PEGS Summit | publisher=Cambridge Healthtech Institute | accessdate=11 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511195224/http://www.pegsummit.com/dpx| archivedate= 11 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Liszewski  |first=Kathy  |date=1 May 2010 |accessdate=11 May 2010 |title=New Tools Facilitate Protein Expression  |periodical=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News  |series=Bioprocessing  |publisher=Mary Ann Liebert  |volume=30  |issue=9  |pages=1, 40&ndash;41  |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/new-tools-facilitate-protein-expression/3273/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509041650/http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/new-tools-facilitate-protein-expression/3273/ |archivedate=9 May 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Redesigning these genes offers a means to improve gene expression in many cases. Rewriting the open reading frame is possible because of the [[degeneracy of the genetic code]]. Thus it is possible to change up to about a third of the nucleotides in an open reading frame and still produce the same protein. The available number of alternate designs possible for a given protein is astronomical. For a typical [[protein sequence]] of 300 [[amino acids]] there are over 10<sup>150</sup> [[codon]] combinations that will encode an identical protein. [[Codon optimization]], or replacing rarely used [[codon]]s with more common codons sometimes have dramatic effects. Further optimizations such as removing [[RNA]] [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|secondary structures]] can also be included. At least in the case of ''E. coli'', protein expression is maximized by predominantly using codons corresponding to [[tRNA]] that retain amino acid charging during starvation.<ref name=Welch2009>{{cite journal |vauthors=Welch M, Govindarajan M, Ness JE, Villalobos A, Gurney A, Minshull J, Gustafsson C |title=Design Parameters to Control Synthetic Gene Expression in ''Escherichia coli'' |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=e7002 |year= 2009|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007002 |pmid=19759823 |pmc=2736378 |editor1-last=Kudla |editor1-first=Grzegorz|bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.7002W }}</ref> Computer programs written to perform these, and other simultaneous optimizations are used to handle the enormous complexity of the task.<ref name=DNA20>{{cite web | url=https://www.dna20.com/services/genegps | title=Protein Expression | publisher=DNA2.0 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> A well optimized gene can improve protein expression 2 to 10 fold, and in some cases more than 100 fold improvements have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Z |last2=Dang |first2=Y |last3=Zhou |first3=M |last4=Li |first4=L |last5=Yu |first5=CH |last6=Fu |first6=J |last7=Chen |first7=S |last8=Liu |first8=Y |title=Codon usage is an important determinant of gene expression levels largely through its effects on transcription. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=11 October 2016 |volume=113 |issue=41 |pages=E6117\u2013E6125 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1606724113 |pmid=27671647 |pmc=5068308 |quote=For the two heterologous genes, luciferase and I-SceI proteins were barely detectable when encoded by wild-type codons; levels were 70- to more than 100-fold higher for the codonoptimized versions}}</ref> Because of the large numbers of [[nucleotide]] changes made to the original DNA sequence, the only practical way to create the newly designed genes is to use gene synthesis.\n\n==Standard methods==\n\n===Oligonucleotide synthesis===\n{{Main|Oligonucleotide synthesis}}\n[[Oligonucleotide]]s are chemically synthesized using building blocks called nucleoside [[phosphoramidite]]s. These can be normal or modified nucleosides which have protecting groups to prevent their amines, hydroxyl groups and phosphate groups from interacting incorrectly. One phosphoramidite is added at a time, the 5' hydroxyl group is deprotected and a new base is added and so on. The chain grows in the 3' to 5' direction, which is backwards relative to biosynthesis. At the end, all the protecting groups are removed. Nevertheless, being a chemical process, several incorrect interactions occur leading to some defective products. The longer the oligonucleotide sequence that is being synthesized, the more defects there are, thus this process is only practical for producing short sequences of [[nucleotides]]. The current practical limit is about 200 bp ([[base pair]]s) for an oligonucleotide with sufficient quality to be used directly for a biological application. [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] can be used to isolate products with the proper sequence. Meanwhile, a large number of oligos can be synthesized in parallel on [[DNA microarrays|gene chips]]. For optimal performance in subsequent gene synthesis procedures they should be prepared individually and in larger scales.\n\n===Annealing based connection of oligonucleotides===\n\nUsually, a set of individually designed oligonucleotides is made on automated solid-phase synthesizers, purified and then connected by specific [[Self annealing|annealing]] and standard [[Ligation (molecular biology)|ligation]] or [[polymerase]] reactions. To improve specificity of oligonucleotide annealing, the synthesis step relies on a set of thermostable DNA [[ligase]] and [[polymerase]] [[enzyme]]s. To date, several methods for gene synthesis have been described, such as the ligation of phosphorylated overlapping oligonucleotides,<ref name=\"Khorana722\"/><ref name=\"Itakura772\"/> the Fok I method<ref name=Edge81>{{cite journal |author=Edge MD |title=Total synthesis of a human leukocyte interferon gene |journal=Nature |volume=292 |issue=5825 |pages=756\u201362 |date=August 1981 |pmid=6167861 |doi=10.1038/292756a0 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Green AR |author3=Heathcliffe GR |display-authors=3 |last4=Meacock |first4=Peter A. |last5=Schuch |first5=Wolfgang |last6=Scanlon |first6=Denis B. |last7=Atkinson |first7=Thomas C. |last8=Newton |first8=Clive R. |last9=Markham |first9=Alexander F. |bibcode = 1981Natur.292..756E }}</ref> and a modified form of [[ligase chain reaction]] for gene synthesis.

In this size range it is necessary to test several candidate clones confirming the sequence of the cloned synthetic gene by automated sequencing methods.\n\n===Limitations===\n\nMoreover, because the assembly of the full-length gene product relies on the efficient and specific alignment of long single stranded oligonucleotides, critical parameters for synthesis success include extended sequence regions comprising secondary structures caused by inverted repeats, extraordinary high or low GC-content, or repetitive structures. Usually these segments of a particular gene can only be synthesized by splitting the procedure into several consecutive steps and a final assembly of shorter sub-sequences, which in turn leads to a significant increase in time and labor needed for its production.\nThe result of a gene synthesis experiment depends strongly on the quality of the oligonucleotides used. For these annealing based gene synthesis protocols, the quality of the product is directly and exponentially dependent on the correctness of the employed oligonucleotides. Alternatively, after performing gene synthesis with oligos of lower quality, more effort must be made in downstream quality assurance during clone analysis, which is usually done by time-consuming standard cloning and sequencing procedures.\nAnother problem associated with all current gene synthesis methods is the high frequency of sequence errors because of the usage of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. The error frequency increases with longer oligonucleotides, and as a consequence the percentage of correct product decreases dramatically as more oligonucleotides are used.\nThe mutation problem could be solved by shorter oligonucleotides used to assemble the gene. However, all annealing based assembly methods require the primers to be mixed together in one tube. In this case, shorter overlaps do not always allow precise and specific annealing of complementary primers, resulting in the inhibition of full length product formation.\nManual design of oligonucleotides is a laborious procedure and does not guarantee the successful synthesis of the desired gene.

These processes can be scaled up to enable the assembly of entire chromosomes or genomes. In recent years, there has been proliferation in the number of different DNA assembly standards with 14 different assembly standards developed as of 2015, each with their pros and cons.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Casini|first=Arturo|last2=Storch|first2=Marko|last3=Baldwin|first3=Geoffrey S.|last4=Ellis|first4=Tom|date=2015-09|title=Bricks and blueprints: methods and standards for DNA assembly|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm4014|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|language=en|volume=16|issue=9|pages=568\u2013576|doi=10.1038/nrm4014|issn=1471-0080}}</ref>  Overall, the development of DNA assembly standards has greatly facilitated the workflow of synthetic biology, aided the exchange of material between research groups and also allowed for the creation of modular and reusable DNA parts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe various DNA assembly methods can be classified into three main categories \u2013 endonuclease-mediated assembly, site-specific recombination, and long-overlap-based assembly. Each group of methods has its distinct characteristics and their own advantages and limitations.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Endonuclease-mediated assembly ===\n[[Endonuclease|Endonucleases]] are enzymes that recognise and cleave nucleic acid segments and they can be used to direct DNA assembly. Of the different types of restriction enzymes, the type II restriction enzymes are the most commonly available and used because their cleavage sites are located near or in their recognition sites. Hence, endonuclease-mediated assembly methods make use of this property to define DNA parts and assembly protocols.\n\n==== BioBricks ====\n{{Main|BioBrick}}\n[[File:BioBricks_assembly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BioBricks_assembly.png|alt=|thumb|320x320px|BBF <nowiki>RFC 10</nowiki> assembly of two BioBricks compatible part. Treating the upstream fragment with EcoRI and SpeI, and the downstream fragment with EcoRI and XbaI allows for the assembly in the desired sequence. Because SpeI and XbaI produce complementary overhangs, they help link the two DNA fragments together, producing a scar sequence. All the original restriction sites are maintained in the final construct, which can then be used for further BioBricks reactions.]]\nThe BioBricks assembly standard was described and introduced by Tom Knight in 2003<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=Thomas|date=2003|title=Idempotent Vector Design for Standard Assembly of Biobricks|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/21168|language=en-US}}</ref> and it has been constantly updated since then. Currently, the most commonly used BioBricks standard is the assembly standard 10, or BBF <nowiki>RFC 10</nowiki>. BioBricks defines the prefix and suffix sequences required for a DNA part to be compatible with the BioBricks assembly method, allowing the joining together of all DNA parts which are in the BioBricks format.\n\nThe prefix contains the restriction sites for EcoRI, NotI and XBaI, while the suffix contains the SpeI, NotI and PstI restriction sites. Outside of the prefix and suffix regions, the DNA part must not contain these restriction sites. To join two BioBrick parts together, one of the plasmids is digested with EcoRI and SpeI while the second plasmid is digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The two EcoRI overhangs are complementary and will thus anneal together, while SpeI and XbaI also produce complementary overhangs which can also be ligated together. As the resulting plasmid contains the original prefix and suffix sequences, it can be used to join with more BioBricks parts.<ref>{{Citation|last=R\u00f8kke|first=Gunvor|title=BioBrick Assembly Standards and Techniques and Associated Software Tools|date=2014|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-764-8_1|work=DNA Cloning and Assembly Methods|pages=1\u201324|editor-last=Valla|editor-first=Svein|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|publisher=Humana Press|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-764-8_1|isbn=978-1-62703-764-8|access-date=2020-04-12|last2=Korvald|first2=Eirin|last3=Pahr|first3=Jarle|last4=\u00d8y\u00e5s|first4=Ove|last5=Lale|first5=Rahmi|editor2-last=Lale|editor2-first=Rahmi}}</ref> Because of this property, the BioBricks assembly standard is said to be [[Idempotence|idempotent]] in nature. However, there will also be a \"scar\" sequence (either TACTAG or TACTAGAG) formed between the two fused BioBricks. This prevents BioBricks from being used to create fusion proteins, as the 6bp scar sequence codes for a tyrosine and a stop codon, causing translation to be terminated after the first domain is expressed, while the 8bp scar sequence causes a [[Ribosomal frameshift|frameshift]], preventing continuous readthrough of the codons. To overcome this problem, other assembly standards such as the BB-2 Assembly, BglBricks Assembly, Silver Assembly and the Freiburg Assembly were designed to enable BioBricks to be used for fusion proteins.\n\nWhile the easiest method to assemble BioBrick parts is described above, there also exist several other commonly used assembly methods that offer several advantages over the standard assembly. The [[BioBrick#3 Antibiotic (3A) Assembly|3 antibiotic (3A) assembly]]  allows for the correct assembly to be selected via antibiotic selection, while the [[BioBrick#Amplified Insert Assembly|amplified insert assembly]] seeks to overcome the low transformation efficiency seen in 3A assembly.\n\nThe BioBrick assembly standard has also served as inspiration for using other types of endonucleases for DNA assembly. For example, both the iBrick standard and the HomeRun vector assembly standards employ homing endonucleases instead of type II restriction enzymes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Ming V.|last2=Shukla|first2=Dip|last3=Rhodes|first3=Brian H.|last4=Lall|first4=Anjali|last5=Shu|first5=Jingmin|last6=Moriarity|first6=Branden S.|last7=Largaespada|first7=David A.|date=2014-06-24|title=HomeRun Vector Assembly System: A Flexible and Standardized Cloning System for Assembly of Multi-Modular DNA Constructs|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0100948|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=e100948|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0100948|issn=1932-6203|pmc=PMC4069157|pmid=24959875}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jia-Kun|last2=Chen|first2=Wei-Hua|last3=Ren|first3=Shuang-Xi|last4=Zhao|first4=Guo-Ping|last5=Wang|first5=Jin|date=2014-10-20|title=iBrick: A New Standard for Iterative Assembly of Biological Parts with Homing Endonucleases|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110852|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=10|pages=e110852|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0110852|issn=1932-6203|pmc=PMC4203835|pmid=25329380}}</ref>\n\n==== Type IIs Restriction Endonuclease Assembly ====\nSome assembly methods also make use of type IIs restriction endonucleases. These differ from other type II endonucleases as they cut several base pairs away from the recognition site. As a result, the overhang sequence can be modified to contain the desired sequence. This provides Type IIs assembly methods two advantages \u2013 it enables \"scar-less\" assembly, and allows for one-pot, multi-part assembly. Assembly methods that use type IIs endonucleases include [[Golden Gate Cloning|Golden Gate]] and its associated variants.\n\n===== Golden Gate Cloning =====\n{{Main|Golden Gate Cloning}}\n[[File:Golden_Gate_Assembly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Golden_Gate_Assembly.png|alt=|thumb|600x600px|The sequence of DNA parts for the Golden Gate assembly can be directed by defining unique complementary overhangs for each part. Thus, to assemble gene 1 in order of fragment A, B and C, the 3' overhang for fragment A is complementary to the 5' overhang for fragment B, and similarly for fragment B and fragment C. For the destination plasmid, the selectable marker is flanked by outward-cutting BsaI restriction sites. This excises the selectable marker, allowing the insertion of the final construct. T4 ligase is used to ligate the fragments together and to the destination plasmid.]]\nThe Golden Gate assembly protocol was defined by Engler et al. 2008 to define a DNA assembly method that would give a final construct without a scar sequence, while also lacking the original restriction sites. This allows the protein to be expressed without containing unwanted protein sequences which could negatively affect protein folding or expression.

For each DNA fragment, the 3' overhang sequence is complementary to the 5' overhang of the next downstream DNA fragment. For the first fragment, the 5' overhang is complementary to the 5' overhang of the destination plasmid, while the 3' overhang of the final fragment is complementary to the 3' overhang of the destination plasmid. Such a design allows for all DNA fragments to be assembled in a one-pot reaction (where all reactants are mixed together), with all fragments arranged in the correct sequence. Successfully assembled constructs are selected by detecting the loss of function of a screening cassette that was originally in the destination plasmid.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n'''MoClo and Golden Braid'''\n\nThe original Golden Gate Assembly only allows for a single construct to be made in the destination vector .

Flanking the insertion site of the tier 1 destination vectors are a pair of inward cutting BpiI restriction sites. This allows these plasmids to be used as entry vectors for tier two destination vectors.\n* Tier 2: Tier 2 assembly involves further assembling the genes assembled in tier 1 assembly into multi-gene constructs. If there is a need for further, higher tier assembly, inward cutting BsaI restriction sites can be added to flank the insertion sites. These vectors can then be used as entry vectors for higher tier constructs.\n\nEach assembly tier alternates the use of BsaI and BpiI restriction sites to minimise the number of forbidden sites, and sequential assembly for each tier is achieved by following the Golden Gate plasmid design. Overall, the MoClo standard allows for the assembly of a construct that contains multiple transcription units, all assembled from different DNA parts, by a series of one-pot Golden Gate reactions. However, one drawback of the MoClo standard is that it requires the use of 'dummy parts' with no biological function, if the final construct requires less than four component parts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Carlo A.|last2=Emde|first2=Leonie|last3=Kuijpers|first3=Aaron|last4=Sobetzko|first4=Patrick|date=2019-10-17|title=MoCloFlex: A Modular Yet Flexible Cloning System|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6843054/|journal=Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology|volume=7|doi=10.3389/fbioe.2019.00271|issn=2296-4185|pmc=6843054|pmid=31750294}}</ref> The Golden Braid standard on the other hand introduced a pairwise Golden Gate assembly standard.\n\nThe Golden Braid standard uses the same tiered assembly as MoClo, but each tier only involves the assembly of two DNA fragments, i.e. a pairwise approach. Hence in each tier, pairs of genes are cloned into a destination fragment in the desired sequence, and these are subsequently assembled two at a time in successive tiers. Like MoClo, the Golden Braid standard alternates the BsaI and BpiI restriction enzymes between each tier.\n\nThe development of the Golden Gate assembly methods and its variants has allowed researchers to design tool-kits to speed up the synthetic biology workflow. For example EcoFlex was developed as a toolkit for ''E. Coli'' that uses the MoClo standard for its DNA parts, while a similar toolkit has also been developed for engineering the ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' mircoalgae.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Simon J.|last2=Lai|first2=Hung-En|last3=Kelwick|first3=Richard J.

Instead, integrases make use of unique attachment (att) sites, and catalyse DNA rearrangement between the target fragment and the destination vector. This Invitrogen Gateway cloning system was invented in the late 1990s and uses two proprietary enzyme mixtures, BP clonase and LR clonase. The BP clonase mix catalyses the recombination between attB and attP sites, generating hybrid attL and attR sites, while the LR clonase mix catalyse the recombination of attL and attR sites to give attB and attP sites. As each enzyme mix recognises only specific att sites, recombination is highly specific and the fragments can be assembled in the desired sequence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reece-Hoyes|first=John S.|last2=Walhout|first2=Albertha J.M.|date=2018-01-02|title=Gateway Recombinational Cloning|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5935001/|journal=Cold Spring Harbor protocols|volume=2018|issue=1|pages=pdb.top094912|doi=10.1101/pdb.top094912|issn=1940-3402|pmc=5935001|pmid=29295908}}</ref>\n\n'''Vector Design and Assembly'''\n\nBecause Gateway cloning is a proprietary technology, all Gateway reactions must be carried out with the Gateway kit that is provided by the manufacturer. The reaction can be summarised into two steps. The first step involves assembling the entry clones containing the DNA fragment of interest, while the second step involves inserting this fragment of interest into the destination clone.\n\n# Entry clones must be made using the supplied \"Donor\" vectors containing a Gateway cassette flanked by attP sites. The Gateway cassette contains a bacterial suicide gene (e.g. ccdB) that will allow for survival and selection of successfully recombined entry clones. A pair of attB sites are added to flank the DNA fragment of interest, and this will allow recombination with the attP sites when the BP clonase mix is added. Entry clones are produced, and the fragment of interest is flanked by attL and attR sites on the 5' and 3' ends respectively.\n# The destination vector also comes with a Gateway cassette, but it is flanked by an attR site on the 5' end of the cassette and an attL site on the 3' end. Mixing this destination plasmid with the entry clones and the LR clonase mix will allow for recombination to occur between the attR and attL sites. A destination clone is produced, with the fragment of interest successfully inserted.\n\nThe earliest iterations of the Gateway cloning method only allowed for only one entry clone to be used for each destination clone produced. However, further research revealed that four more orthogonal att sequences could be generated, allowing for the assembly of up to four different DNA fragments, and this process is now known as the Multisite Gateway technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sasaki|first=Yukari|last2=Sone|first2=Takefumi|last3=Yoshida|first3=Shouhei|last4=Yahata|first4=Kazuhide|last5=Hotta|first5=Junko|last6=Chesnut|first6=Jonathan D|last7=Honda|first7=Takeshi|last8=Imamoto|first8=Fumio|date=2004-02-05|title=Evidence for high specificity and efficiency of multiple recombination signals in mixed DNA cloning by the Multisite Gateway system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165603002657|journal=Journal of Biotechnology|language=en|volume=107|issue=3|pages=233\u2013243|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2003.10.001|issn=0168-1656}}</ref>\n\nBesides Gateway cloning, non-commercial methods using other integrases have also been developed.

The DNA fragments to be assembled are synthesised to have overlapping 5' and 3' ends in the order that they are to be assembled in. These reagents are mixed together with the DNA fragments to be assembled at 50\u00b0C and the following reactions occur:\n\n# The T5 exonuclease chews back DNA from the 5' end of each fragment, exposing 3' overhangs on each DNA fragment.\n# The complementary overhangs on adjacent DNA fragments anneal via complementary base pairing.\n# The Phusion DNA polymerase fills in any gaps where the fragments anneal.\n# Taq DNA ligase repairs the nicks on both DNA strands.\n\nBecause the T5 exonuclease is heat labile, it is inactivated at 50\u00b0C after the initial chew back step. The product is thus stable, and the fragments assembled in the desired order. This one-pot protocol can assemble up to 5 different fragments accurately, while several commercial providers have kits to accurately assemble up to 15 different fragments in a two-step reaction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.addgene.org/protocols/gibson-assembly/|title=Addgene: Gibson Assembly Protocol|website=www.addgene.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, while the Gibson assembly protocol is fast and uses relatively few reagents, it requires bespoke DNA synthesis as each fragment has to be designed to contain overlapping sequences with the adjacent fragments and amplified via PCR. This reliance on PCR may also affect the fidelity of the reaction when long fragments, fragments with high GC content or repeat sequences are used.<ref name=\":22\" />\n[[File:Overlap assembly using the MODAL format.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Overlap%20assembly%20using%20the%20MODAL%20format.png|thumb|500x500px|The MODAL standard provides a common format to allow any DNA part to be made compatible with Gibson assembly or other overlap assembly methods. The DNA fragment of interest undergoes two rounds of PCR, first to attach the adaptor prefix and suffixes, and next to attach the predefined linker sequences. Once the parts are in the required format, assembly methods like Gibson assembly can carried out. The order of the parts is directed by the linkers, i.e the same linker sequence is attached to the 3' end of the upstream part and the 5' end of the downstream part.]]\n\n==== MODAL ====\nThe MODAL strategy defines overlap sequences known as \"linkers\" to reduce the amount of customisation that needs to be done with each DNA fragment. The linkers were designed using the [https://omictools.com/r2odna-designer-tool R2oDNA Designer] software and the overlap regions were designed to be 45 bp long to be compatible with Gibson assembly and other overlap assembly methods. To attach these linkers to the parts to be assembled, PCR is carried using part-specific primers containing 15 bp prefix and suffix adaptor sequences. The linkers are then attached to the adaptor sequences via a second PCR reaction. To position the DNA fragments, the same linker will be attached to the suffix of the desired upstream fragment and the prefix of the desired downstream fragments. Once the linkers are attached, Gibson assembly, CPEC, or the other overlap assembly methods can all be used to assemble the DNA fragments in the desired order.\n\n==== BASIC ====\nThe BASIC assembly strategy was developed in 2015 and sought to address the limitations of previous assembly techniques, incorporating six key concepts from them: standard reusable parts; single-tier format (all parts are in the same format and are assembled using the same process); idempotent cloning; parallel (multipart) DNA assembly; size independence; automatability.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n'''DNA Parts and Linker Design'''\n\nThe DNA parts are designed and cloned into storage plasmids, with the part flanked by an integrated prefix (''i''P) and an integrated suffix (''i''S) sequence. The ''i''P and ''i''S sequences contain inward facing BsaI restriction sites, which contain overhangs complementary to the BASIC linkers.<ref name=\":22\" /> Like in MODAL, the 7 standard linkers used in BASIC were designed with the R2oDNA Designer software, and screened to ensure that they do not contain sequences with homology to chassis genomes, and that they do not contain unwanted sequences like secondary structure sequences, restriction sites or ribosomal binding sites. Each linker sequence is split into two halves, each with a 4 bp overhang complementary to the BsaI restriction site, a 12 bp double stranded sequence and sharing a 21 bp overlap sequence with the other half. The half that is will bind to the upstream DNA part is known as the suffix linker part (e.g. L1S) and the half that binds to the downstream part is known as the prefix linker part (e.g. L1P). These linkers form the basis of assembling the DNA parts together.\n\nBesides directing the order of assembly, the standard BASIC linkers can also be modified to carry out other functions. To allow for idempotent assembly, linkers were also designed with additional methylated ''i''P and ''i''S sequences inserted to protect them from being recognised by BsaI. This methylation is lost following transformation and in vivo plasmid replication, and the plasmids can be extracted, purified, and used for further reactions.\n\nBecause the linker sequence are relatively long (45bp for a standard linker), there is an opportunity to incorporate functional DNA sequences to reduce the number of DNA parts needed during assembly. The BASIC assembly standard provides several linkers embedded with RBS of different strengths. Similarly to facilitate the construction of fusion proteins containing multiple protein domains,several fusion linkers were also designed to allow for full read-through of the DNA construct. These fusion linkers code for a 15 amino acid glycine and serine polypeptide, which is an ideal linker peptide for fusion proteins with multiple domains.\n\n'''Assembly'''\n\nThere are three main steps in the assembly of the final construct.\n\n# First, the DNA parts are excised from the storage plasmid, giving a DNA fragment with BsaI overhangs on the 3' and 5' end.\n# Next, each linker part is attached to its respective DNA part by incubating with T4 DNA ligase. Each DNA part will have a suffix and prefix linker part from two different linkers to direct the order of assembly. For example, the first part in the sequence will have L1P and L2S, while the second part will have L2P and L3S attached. The linker parts can be changed to change the sequence of assembly.\n# Finally, the parts with the attached linkers are assembled into a plasmid by incubating at 50\u00b0C. The 21 bp overhangs of the P and S linkers anneal and the final construct can be transformed into bacteria cells for cloning. The single stranded nicks are repaired ''in vivo'' following transformation, producing a stable final construct cloned into plasmids.\n\n== Entire bacterial genomes ==\n\n===Synthia and ''Mycoplasma laboratorium''===\n{{main|Mycoplasma laboratorium}}\nOn June 28, 2007, a team at the [[J.

The next day the Canadian [[bioethics]] group, [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] issued a statement through their representative, [[Pat Roy Mooney|Pat Mooney]], saying Venter's \"creation\" was \"a chassis on which you could build almost anything\".

As higher quality sources of sequence verified cloned cDNA have become available, this practice has become less urgent.\n\nProducing large amounts of [[protein]] from gene sequences (or at least the protein coding regions of genes, the [[open reading frame]]) found in nature can sometimes prove difficult and is a problem of sufficient impact that scientific conferences have been devoted to the topic.

The available number of alternate designs possible for a given protein is astronomical.

These can be normal or modified nucleosides which have protecting groups to prevent their amines, hydroxyl groups and phosphate groups from interacting incorrectly. One phosphoramidite is added at a time, the 5' hydroxyl group is deprotected and a new base is added and so on. The chain grows in the 3' to 5' direction, which is backwards relative to biosynthesis. At the end, all the protecting groups are removed. Nevertheless, being a chemical process, several incorrect interactions occur leading to some defective products. The longer the oligonucleotide sequence that is being synthesized, the more defects there are, thus this process is only practical for producing short sequences of [[nucleotides]]. The current practical limit is about 200 bp ([[base pair]]s) for an oligonucleotide with sufficient quality to be used directly for a biological application. [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] can be used to isolate products with the proper sequence. Meanwhile, a large number of oligos can be synthesized in parallel on [[DNA microarrays|gene chips]]. For optimal performance in subsequent gene synthesis procedures they should be prepared individually and in larger scales.\n\n===Annealing based connection of oligonucleotides===\n\nUsually, a set of individually designed oligonucleotides is made on automated solid-phase synthesizers, purified and then connected by specific [[Self annealing|annealing]] and standard [[Ligation (molecular biology)|ligation]] or [[polymerase]] reactions. To improve specificity of oligonucleotide annealing, the synthesis step relies on a set of thermostable DNA [[ligase]] and [[polymerase]] [[enzyme]]s. To date, several methods for gene synthesis have been described, such as the ligation of phosphorylated overlapping oligonucleotides,<ref name=\"Khorana722\"/><ref name=\"Itakura772\"/> the Fok I method<ref name=Edge81>{{cite journal |author=Edge MD |title=Total synthesis of a human leukocyte interferon gene |journal=Nature |volume=292 |issue=5825 |pages=756\u201362 |date=August 1981 |pmid=6167861 |doi=10.1038/292756a0 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Green AR |author3=Heathcliffe GR |display-authors=3 |last4=Meacock |first4=Peter A. |last5=Schuch |first5=Wolfgang |last6=Scanlon |first6=Denis B. |last7=Atkinson |first7=Thomas C. |last8=Newton |first8=Clive R. |last9=Markham |first9=Alexander F. |bibcode = 1981Natur.292..756E }}</ref> and a modified form of [[ligase chain reaction]] for gene synthesis.

In this size range it is necessary to test several candidate clones confirming the sequence of the cloned synthetic gene by automated sequencing methods.\n\n===Limitations===\n\nMoreover, because the assembly of the full-length gene product relies on the efficient and specific alignment of long single stranded oligonucleotides, critical parameters for synthesis success include extended sequence regions comprising secondary structures caused by inverted repeats, extraordinary high or low GC-content, or repetitive structures. Usually these segments of a particular gene can only be synthesized by splitting the procedure into several consecutive steps and a final assembly of shorter sub-sequences, which in turn leads to a significant increase in time and labor needed for its production.\nThe result of a gene synthesis experiment depends strongly on the quality of the oligonucleotides used. For these annealing based gene synthesis protocols, the quality of the product is directly and exponentially dependent on the correctness of the employed oligonucleotides. Alternatively, after performing gene synthesis with oligos of lower quality, more effort must be made in downstream quality assurance during clone analysis, which is usually done by time-consuming standard cloning and sequencing procedures.\nAnother problem associated with all current gene synthesis methods is the high frequency of sequence errors because of the usage of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. The error frequency increases with longer oligonucleotides, and as a consequence the percentage of correct product decreases dramatically as more oligonucleotides are used.\nThe mutation problem could be solved by shorter oligonucleotides used to assemble the gene. However, all annealing based assembly methods require the primers to be mixed together in one tube. In this case, shorter overlaps do not always allow precise and specific annealing of complementary primers, resulting in the inhibition of full length product formation.\nManual design of oligonucleotides is a laborious procedure and does not guarantee the successful synthesis of the desired gene. For optimal performance of almost all annealing based methods, the melting temperatures of the overlapping regions are supposed to be similar for all oligonucleotides. The necessary primer optimization should be performed using specialized oligonucleotide design programs. Several solutions for automated primer design for gene synthesis have been presented so far.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gao X, Yo P, Keith A, Ragan TJ, Harris TK |title=Thermodynamically balanced inside-out (TBIO) PCR-based gene synthesis: a novel method of primer design for high-fidelity assembly of longer gene sequences |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=31 |issue=22 |pages=143e\u2013143 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14602936 |pmc=275580 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14602936 |doi=10.1093/nar/gng143}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Young L, Dong Q |title=Two-step total gene synthesis method |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=e59 |year=2004 |pmid=15087491 |pmc=407838 |doi=10.1093/nar/gnh058 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15087491}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hillson NH, Rosengarten RD, Keasling JD | title=j5 DNA Assembly Design Automation Software | journal=ACS Synthetic Biology | volume=1 |issue=1 | pages=14\u201321 | year = 2012 |doi=10.1021/sb2000116| pmid=23651006 | url=https://figshare.com/articles/j5_DNA_Assembly_Design_Automation_Software/2557906 }}</ref>\n\n===Error correction procedures===\n\nTo overcome problems associated with oligonucleotide quality several elaborate strategies have been developed, employing either separately prepared fishing oligonucleotides,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoover DM, Lubkowski J |title=DNAWorks: an automated method for designing oligonucleotides for PCR-based gene synthesis |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=43e\u201343 |date=May 2002 |pmid=12000848 |pmc=115297 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12000848 |doi=10.1093/nar/30.10.e43}}</ref> mismatch binding enzymes of the [[MutS-1|mutS family]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Villalobos A, Ness JE, Gustafsson C, Minshull J, Govindarajan S |title=Gene Designer: a synthetic biology tool for constructing artificial DNA segments |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=7|page=285 |year=2006 |pmid=16756672 |pmc=1523223 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-7-285 }}</ref> or specific endonucleases from bacteria or phages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tian J |title=Accurate multiplex gene synthesis from programmable DNA microchips |journal=Nature |volume=432 |issue=7020 |pages=1050\u20134 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15616567 |doi=10.1038/nature03151 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Gong H |author3=Sheng N |display-authors=3 |last4=Zhou |first4=Xiaochuan |last5=Gulari |first5=Erdogan |last6=Gao |first6=Xiaolian |last7=Church |first7=George|bibcode = 2004Natur.432.1050T |url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62677/1/nature03151.pdf |hdl=2027.42/62677 }}</ref> Nevertheless, all these strategies increase time and costs for gene synthesis based on the annealing of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides.\n\nMassively parallel sequencing has also been used as a tool to screen complex oligonucleotide libraries and enable the retrieval of accurate molecules.

These processes can be scaled up to enable the assembly of entire chromosomes or genomes.

Each group of methods has its distinct characteristics and their own advantages and limitations.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Endonuclease-mediated assembly ===\n[[Endonuclease|Endonucleases]] are enzymes that recognise and cleave nucleic acid segments and they can be used to direct DNA assembly. Of the different types of restriction enzymes, the type II restriction enzymes are the most commonly available and used because their cleavage sites are located near or in their recognition sites. Hence, endonuclease-mediated assembly methods make use of this property to define DNA parts and assembly protocols.\n\n==== BioBricks ====\n{{Main|BioBrick}}\n[[File:BioBricks_assembly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BioBricks_assembly.png|alt=|thumb|320x320px|BBF <nowiki>RFC 10</nowiki> assembly of two BioBricks compatible part. Treating the upstream fragment with EcoRI and SpeI, and the downstream fragment with EcoRI and XbaI allows for the assembly in the desired sequence. Because SpeI and XbaI produce complementary overhangs, they help link the two DNA fragments together, producing a scar sequence. All the original restriction sites are maintained in the final construct, which can then be used for further BioBricks reactions.]]\nThe BioBricks assembly standard was described and introduced by Tom Knight in 2003<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knight|first=Thomas|date=2003|title=Idempotent Vector Design for Standard Assembly of Biobricks|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/21168|language=en-US}}</ref> and it has been constantly updated since then. Currently, the most commonly used BioBricks standard is the assembly standard 10, or BBF <nowiki>RFC 10</nowiki>. BioBricks defines the prefix and suffix sequences required for a DNA part to be compatible with the BioBricks assembly method, allowing the joining together of all DNA parts which are in the BioBricks format.\n\nThe prefix contains the restriction sites for EcoRI, NotI and XBaI, while the suffix contains the SpeI, NotI and PstI restriction sites. Outside of the prefix and suffix regions, the DNA part must not contain these restriction sites. To join two BioBrick parts together, one of the plasmids is digested with EcoRI and SpeI while the second plasmid is digested with EcoRI and XbaI. The two EcoRI overhangs are complementary and will thus anneal together, while SpeI and XbaI also produce complementary overhangs which can also be ligated together. As the resulting plasmid contains the original prefix and suffix sequences, it can be used to join with more BioBricks parts.<ref>{{Citation|last=R\u00f8kke|first=Gunvor|title=BioBrick Assembly Standards and Techniques and Associated Software Tools|date=2014|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-62703-764-8_1|work=DNA Cloning and Assembly Methods|pages=1\u201324|editor-last=Valla|editor-first=Svein|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|publisher=Humana Press|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-764-8_1|isbn=978-1-62703-764-8|access-date=2020-04-12|last2=Korvald|first2=Eirin|last3=Pahr|first3=Jarle|last4=\u00d8y\u00e5s|first4=Ove|last5=Lale|first5=Rahmi|editor2-last=Lale|editor2-first=Rahmi}}</ref> Because of this property, the BioBricks assembly standard is said to be [[Idempotence|idempotent]] in nature. However, there will also be a \"scar\" sequence (either TACTAG or TACTAGAG) formed between the two fused BioBricks. This prevents BioBricks from being used to create fusion proteins, as the 6bp scar sequence codes for a tyrosine and a stop codon, causing translation to be terminated after the first domain is expressed, while the 8bp scar sequence causes a [[Ribosomal frameshift|frameshift]], preventing continuous readthrough of the codons. To overcome this problem, other assembly standards such as the BB-2 Assembly, BglBricks Assembly, Silver Assembly and the Freiburg Assembly were designed to enable BioBricks to be used for fusion proteins. '''(Add links for each standard)'''\n\nWhile the easiest method to assemble BioBrick parts is described above, there also exist several other commonly used assembly methods that offer several advantages over the standard assembly.

These differ from other type II endonucleases as they cut several base pairs away from the recognition site. As a result, the overhang sequence can be modified to contain the desired sequence. This provides Type IIs assembly methods two advantages \u2013 it enables \"scar-less\" assembly, and allows for one-pot, multi-part assembly. Assembly methods that use type IIs endonucleases include [[Golden Gate Cloning|Golden Gate]] and its associated variants.\n\n===== Golden Gate Cloning =====\n{{Main|Golden Gate Cloning}}\n[[File:Golden_Gate_Assembly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Golden_Gate_Assembly.png|alt=|thumb|600x600px|The sequence of DNA parts for the Golden Gate assembly can be directed by defining unique complementary overhangs for each part. Thus, to assemble gene 1 in order of fragment A, B and C, the 3' overhang for fragment A is complementary to the 5' overhang for fragment B, and similarly for fragment B and fragment C. For the destination plasmid, the selectable marker is flanked by outward-cutting BsaI restriction sites. This excises the selectable marker, allowing the insertion of the final construct. T4 ligase is used to ligate the fragments together and to the destination plasmid.]]\nThe Golden Gate assembly protocol was defined by Engler et al. 2008 to define a DNA assembly method that would give a final construct without a scar sequence, while also lacking the original restriction sites. This allows the protein to be expressed without containing unwanted protein sequences which could negatively affect protein folding or expression.

For each DNA fragment, the 3' overhang sequence is complementary to the 5' overhang of the next downstream DNA fragment. For the first fragment, the 5' overhang is complementary to the 5' overhang of the destination plasmid, while the 3' overhang of the final fragment is complementary to the 3' overhang of the destination plasmid. Such a design allows for all DNA fragments to be assembled in a one-pot reaction (where all reactants are mixed together), with all fragments arranged in the correct sequence. Successfully assembled constructs are selected by detecting the loss of function of a screening cassette that was originally in the destination plasmid.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n'''MoClo and Golden Braid'''\n\nThe original Golden Gate Assembly only allows for a single construct to be made in the destination vector .

Flanking the insertion site of the tier 1 destination vectors are a pair of inward cutting BpiI restriction sites. This allows these plasmids to be used as entry vectors for tier two destination vectors.\n* Tier 2: Tier 2 assembly involves further assembling the genes assembled in tier 1 assembly into multi-gene constructs. If there is a need for further, higher tier assembly, inward cutting BsaI restriction sites can be added to flank the insertion sites. These vectors can then be used as entry vectors for higher tier constructs.\n\nEach assembly tier alternates the use of BsaI and BpiI restriction sites to minimise the number of forbidden sites, and sequential assembly for each tier is achieved by following the Golden Gate plasmid design. Overall, the MoClo standard allows for the assembly of a construct that contains multiple transcription units, all assembled from different DNA parts, by a series of one-pot Golden Gate reactions. However, one drawback of the MoClo standard is that it requires the use of 'dummy parts' with no biological function, if the final construct requires less than four component parts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Carlo A.|last2=Emde|first2=Leonie|last3=Kuijpers|first3=Aaron|last4=Sobetzko|first4=Patrick|date=2019-10-17|title=MoCloFlex: A Modular Yet Flexible Cloning System|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6843054/|journal=Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology|volume=7|doi=10.3389/fbioe.2019.00271|issn=2296-4185|pmc=6843054|pmid=31750294}}</ref> The Golden Braid standard on the other hand introduced a pairwise Golden Gate assembly standard.\n\nThe Golden Braid standard uses the same tiered assembly as MoClo, but each tier only involves the assembly of two DNA fragments, i.e. a pairwise approach. Hence in each tier, pairs of genes are cloned into a destination fragment in the desired sequence, and these are subsequently assembled two at a time in successive tiers. Like MoClo, the Golden Braid standard alternates the BsaI and BpiI restriction enzymes between each tier.\n\nThe development of the Golden Gate assembly methods and its variants has allowed researchers to design tool-kits to speed up the synthetic biology workflow. For example EcoFlex was developed as a toolkit for ''E. Coli'' that uses the MoClo standard for its DNA parts, while a similar toolkit has also been developed for engineering the ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' mircoalgae.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Simon J.|last2=Lai|first2=Hung-En|last3=Kelwick|first3=Richard J.

Instead, integrases make use of unique attachment (att) sites, and catalyse DNA rearrangement between the target fragment and the destination vector. This Invitrogen Gateway cloning system was invented in the late 1990s and uses two proprietary enzyme mixtures, BP clonase and LR clonase. The BP clonase mix catalyses the recombination between attB and attP sites, generating hybrid attL and attR sites, while the LR clonase mix catalyse the recombination of attL and attR sites to give attB and attP sites. As each enzyme mix recognises only specific att sites, recombination is highly specific and the fragments can be assembled in the desired sequence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reece-Hoyes|first=John S.|last2=Walhout|first2=Albertha J.M.|date=2018-01-02|title=Gateway Recombinational Cloning|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5935001/|journal=Cold Spring Harbor protocols|volume=2018|issue=1|pages=pdb.top094912|doi=10.1101/pdb.top094912|issn=1940-3402|pmc=5935001|pmid=29295908}}</ref>\n\n'''Vector Design and Assembly'''\n\nBecause Gateway cloning is a proprietary technology, all Gateway reactions must be carried out with the Gateway kit that is provided by the manufacturer. The reaction can be summarised into two steps. The first step involves assembling the entry clones containing the DNA fragment of interest, while the second step involves inserting this fragment of interest into the destination clone.\n\n# Entry clones must be made using the supplied \"Donor\" vectors containing a Gateway cassette flanked by attP sites. The Gateway cassette contains a bacterial suicide gene (e.g. ccdB) that will allow for survival and selection of successfully recombined entry clones. A pair of attB sites are added to flank the DNA fragment of interest, and this will allow recombination with the attP sites when the BP clonase mix is added. Entry clones are produced, and the fragment of interest is flanked by attL and attR sites on the 5' and 3' ends respectively.\n# The destination vector also comes with a Gateway cassette, but it is flanked by an attR site on the 5' end of the cassette and an attL site on the 3' end. Mixing this destination plasmid with the entry clones and the LR clonase mix will allow for recombination to occur between the attR and attL sites. A destination clone is produced, with the fragment of interest successfully inserted.\n\nThe earliest iterations of the Gateway cloning method only allowed for only one entry clone to be used for each destination clone produced. However, further research revealed that four more orthogonal att sequences could be generated, allowing for the assembly of up to four different DNA fragments, and this process is now known as the Multisite Gateway technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sasaki|first=Yukari|last2=Sone|first2=Takefumi|last3=Yoshida|first3=Shouhei|last4=Yahata|first4=Kazuhide|last5=Hotta|first5=Junko|last6=Chesnut|first6=Jonathan D|last7=Honda|first7=Takeshi|last8=Imamoto|first8=Fumio|date=2004-02-05|title=Evidence for high specificity and efficiency of multiple recombination signals in mixed DNA cloning by the Multisite Gateway system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165603002657|journal=Journal of Biotechnology|language=en|volume=107|issue=3|pages=233\u2013243|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2003.10.001|issn=0168-1656}}</ref>\n\nBesides Gateway cloning, non-commercial methods using other integrases have also been developed.

The DNA fragments to be assembled are synthesised to have overlapping 5' and 3' ends in the order that they are to be assembled in. These reagents are mixed together with the DNA fragments to be assembled at 50\u00b0C and the following reactions occur:\n\n# The T5 exonuclease chews back DNA from the 5' end of each fragment, exposing 3' overhangs on each DNA fragment.\n# The complementary overhangs on adjacent DNA fragments anneal via complementary base pairing.\n# The Phusion DNA polymerase fills in any gaps where the fragments anneal.\n# Taq DNA ligase repairs the nicks on both DNA strands.\n\nBecause the T5 exonuclease is heat labile, it is inactivated at 50\u00b0C after the initial chew back step. The product is thus stable, and the fragments assembled in the desired order. This one-pot protocol can assemble up to 5 different fragments accurately, while several commercial providers have kits to accurately assemble up to 15 different fragments in a two-step reaction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.addgene.org/protocols/gibson-assembly/|title=Addgene: Gibson Assembly Protocol|website=www.addgene.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, while the Gibson assembly protocol is fast and uses relatively few reagents, it requires bespoke DNA synthesis as each fragment has to be designed to contain overlapping sequences with the adjacent fragments and amplified via PCR. This reliance on PCR may also affect the fidelity of the reaction when long fragments, fragments with high GC content or repeat sequences are used.<ref name=\":22\" />\n[[File:Overlap assembly using the MODAL format.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Overlap%20assembly%20using%20the%20MODAL%20format.png|thumb|500x500px|The MODAL standard provides a common format to allow any DNA part to be made compatible with Gibson assembly or other overlap assembly methods. The DNA fragment of interest undergoes two rounds of PCR, first to attach the adaptor prefix and suffixes, and next to attach the predefined linker sequences. Once the parts are in the required format, assembly methods like Gibson assembly can carried out. The order of the parts is directed by the linkers, i.e the same linker sequence is attached to the 3' end of the upstream part and the 5' end of the downstream part.]]\n\n==== MODAL ====\nThe MODAL strategy defines overlap sequences known as \"linkers\" to reduce the amount of customisation that needs to be done with each DNA fragment. The linkers were designed using the [https://omictools.com/r2odna-designer-tool R2oDNA Designer] software and the overlap regions were designed to be 45 bp long to be compatible with Gibson assembly and other overlap assembly methods. To attach these linkers to the parts to be assembled, PCR is carried using part-specific primers containing 15 bp prefix and suffix adaptor sequences. The linkers are then attached to the adaptor sequences via a second PCR reaction. To position the DNA fragments, the same linker will be attached to the suffix of the desired upstream fragment and the prefix of the desired downstream fragments. Once the linkers are attached, Gibson assembly, CPEC, or the other overlap assembly methods can all be used to assemble the DNA fragments in the desired order.\n\n==== BASIC ====\nThe BASIC assembly strategy was developed in 2015 and sought to address the limitations of previous assembly techniques, incorporating six key concepts from them: standard reusable parts; single-tier format (all parts are in the same format and are assembled using the same process); idempotent cloning; parallel (multipart) DNA assembly; size independence; automatability.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n'''DNA Parts and Linker Design'''\n\nThe DNA parts are designed and cloned into storage plasmids, with the part flanked by an integrated prefix (''i''P) and an integrated suffix (''i''S) sequence. The ''i''P and ''i''S sequences contain inward facing BsaI restriction sites, which contain overhangs complementary to the BASIC linkers.<ref name=\":22\" /> Like in MODAL, the 7 standard linkers used in BASIC were designed with the R2oDNA Designer software, and screened to ensure that they do not contain sequences with homology to chassis genomes, and that they do not contain unwanted sequences like secondary structure sequences, restriction sites or ribosomal binding sites. Each linker sequence is split into two halves, each with a 4 bp overhang complementary to the BsaI restriction site, a 12 bp double stranded sequence and sharing a 21 bp overlap sequence with the other half. The half that is will bind to the upstream DNA part is known as the suffix linker part (e.g. L1S) and the half that binds to the downstream part is known as the prefix linker part (e.g. L1P). These linkers form the basis of assembling the DNA parts together.\n\nBesides directing the order of assembly, the standard BASIC linkers can also be modified to carry out other functions. To allow for idempotent assembly, linkers were also designed with additional methylated ''i''P and ''i''S sequences inserted to protect them from being recognised by BsaI. This methylation is lost following transformation and in vivo plasmid replication, and the plasmids can be extracted, purified, and used for further reactions.\n\nBecause the linker sequence are relatively long (45bp for a standard linker), there is an opportunity to incorporate functional DNA sequences to reduce the number of DNA parts needed during assembly. The BASIC assembly standard provides several linkers embedded with RBS of different strengths. Similarly to facilitate the construction of fusion proteins containing multiple protein domains,several fusion linkers were also designed to allow for full read-through of the DNA construct. These fusion linkers code for a 15 amino acid glycine and serine polypeptide, which is an ideal linker peptide for fusion proteins with multiple domains.\n\n'''Assembly'''\n\nThere are three main steps in the assembly of the final construct.\n\n# First, the DNA parts are excised from the storage plasmid, giving a DNA fragment with BsaI overhangs on the 3' and 5' end.\n# Next, each linker part is attached to its respective DNA part by incubating with T4 DNA ligase. Each DNA part will have a suffix and prefix linker part from two different linkers to direct the order of assembly. For example, the first part in the sequence will have L1P and L2S, while the second part will have L2P and L3S attached. The linker parts can be changed to change the sequence of assembly.\n# Finally, the parts with the attached linkers are assembled into a plasmid by incubating at 50\u00b0C. The 21 bp overhangs of the P and S linkers anneal and the final construct can be transformed into bacteria cells for cloning. The single stranded nicks are repaired ''in vivo'' following transformation, producing a stable final construct cloned into plasmids.\n\n== Entire bacterial genomes ==\n\n===Synthia and ''Mycoplasma laboratorium''===\n{{main|Mycoplasma laboratorium}}\nOn June 28, 2007, a team at the [[J.

For many years, the show is taped at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Although not exclusively country \u2014 styles would range from [[western swing]], [[Texas blues]], [[Tejano music]], [[progressive country]], [[rock n' roll]], [[jazz]], [[alternative country]], [[alternative rock]], [[folk music]] and [[jam band]] \u2014 the show is widely hailed as a showcase of music of diverse styles and would be heavily influential in many country music artists' styles.\n\n===No dates===\n*The CB radio craze was sweeping country music, as no less than three No. 1 songs are about citizens-band radios. [[C. W. McCall]]'s \"[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]\" \u2014 about a band of truck drivers who fight back against redneck police officers \u2014 spends four of its six weeks at No. 1 in January, and goes on to be [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s No. 1 country song of 1976. Other top songs where CB radios were central to the plot were:\n** \"[[The White Knight (Cledus Maggard song)|The White Knight]]\" by [[Cledus Maggard|Cledus Maggard & The Citizen's Band]], about a lead-footed truck driver who is led into a speed trap by a corrupt state trooper.\n** \"[[Teddy Bear (Red Sovine song)|Teddy Bear]]\" by [[Red Sovine]], a sentimental recitation about a fatherless, [[physical disability|physically handicapped]] boy who keeps in touch with truck drivers. He states his lone wish is to ride around with his father, but since that can't happen, other truck drivers make good on the wish by showing up at the young lad's [[home]] and giving him rides.\n*Production began on [[Dolly Parton]]'s syndicated variety show ''[[Dolly!]]'' Though Parton was said to have been less than pleased with the end result, and the show only lasted for one season, it expanded her audience at a time when she was in the midst of refocusing her career from that of a specifically country performer to an entertainer with broader pop and mainstream appeal.\n\n==Top hits of the year==\n\n===Number one hits===\n\n====United States====\n''(as certified by [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]])''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- style=\"background:#009900\"\n!Date\n!Single Name\n!Artist\n!width=\"40\"|Wks.
