Monnet in 1909.<ref name=\"evansyears\" /> From its humble beginnings of Dean Monnet, two faculty members, and 47 students, the College of Law has grown to become the pre-eminent legal institution in the state. The College of Law initially shared space in the Science Building before moving to the basement of the Carnegie Building.  \n\nIn 1914, after student's extensive lobbying, the college moved into its first permanent home, Monnet Hall. The \"47,000-square-foot Law Barn,\" as it was affectionately known, was home to the college for 62 years. As the home of the College of Law, it was witness to many events in Oklahoma (and American) history, including the admission of then-future OU Regent [[Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher]], the first black woman admitted to the College of Law, in 1948. \n\nDespite the additional square footage built onto the rear of Monnet Hall, the Law Center, which the College of Law and its associated entities came to be called in 1971, outgrew the building, forcing a relocation to its current home on Timberdell Road in 1976. Adding the ''[[American Indian Law Review]]'' to complement the established ''[http://www.law.ou.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/journals/oklahoma-law-review Oklahoma Law Review]'', expanding clinical legal education, and generally striving to meet the increasing demands of legal education in the late 20th century caused OU Law to once again outgrow its facilities.  \n\nIn 1992, a feminist group began a nationwide fundraising campaign and then obtained matching state funds to endow a professorship at the University of Oklahoma College of Law in honor of Hill.[10][37]Conservative Oklahoma state legislators reacted by demanding Hill's resignation from the university, then introducing a bill to prohibit the university from accepting donations from out-of-state residents, and finally attempting to pass legislation to close down the law school.[10] Elmer Zinn Million, a local activist, compared Hill to Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President Kennedy.[10][37] Certain officials at the university attempted to revoke Hill's tenure.[38]After five years of pressure, Hill resigned.[10]The University of Oklahoma Law School defunded the Anita F. Hill professorship in May 1999, without the position having ever been filled.[39] (All citations refer to those on the Anita Hill page.)\n\n===Andrew M. Coats Hall ===\nIn October 1999, ground was broken on a $19 million construction and renovation project which ultimately added 80,000 square feet to the facility. Named in honor of then-Dean Andrew M. Coats, the facility features the 58,000-square-foot [http://www.law.ou.edu/law-library Donald E. Pray Law Library] and the 250-seat Dick Bell Courtroom. The new library features the Chapman Reading room, modeled after the reading room in Monnet Hall, with a parquet floor reminiscent of the floors in the Louvre. The Donald E. Pray Law Library, which is open to the public, boasts the largest law collection, public or private, in the state.  \n\nThe Dick Bell Courtroom is one of the largest courtrooms in the region, if not the nation, and hosts live trials from the various courts in central Oklahoma.

Monnet in 1909.<ref name=\"evansyears\" /> From its humble beginnings of Dean Monnet, two faculty members, and 47 students, the College of Law has grown to become the pre-eminent legal institution in the state. The College of Law initially shared space in the Science Building before moving to the basement of the Carnegie Building.  \n\nIn 1914, after student's extensive lobbying, the college moved into its first permanent home, Monnet Hall. The \"47,000-square-foot Law Barn,\" as it was affectionately known, was home to the college for 62 years. As the home of the College of Law, it was witness to many events in Oklahoma (and American) history, including the admission of then-future OU Regent [[Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher]], the first black woman admitted to the College of Law, in 1948. \n\nDespite the additional square footage built onto the rear of Monnet Hall, the Law Center, which the College of Law and its associated entities came to be called in 1971, outgrew the building, forcing a relocation to its current home on Timberdell Road in 1976. Adding the ''[[American Indian Law Review]]'' to complement the established ''[http://www.law.ou.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/journals/oklahoma-law-review Oklahoma Law Review]'', expanding clinical legal education, and generally striving to meet the increasing demands of legal education in the late 20th century caused OU Law to once again outgrow its facilities.  \n\nIn 1992, a feminist group began a nationwide fundraising campaign and then obtained matching state funds to endow a professorship at the University of Oklahoma College of Law in honor of Hill.[10][37]Conservative Oklahoma state legislators reacted by demanding Hill's resignation from the university, then introducing a bill to prohibit the university from accepting donations from out-of-state residents, and finally attempting to pass legislation to close down the law school.[10] Elmer Zinn Million, a local activist, compared Hill to Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President Kennedy.[10][37] Certain officials at the university attempted to revoke Hill's tenure.[38]After five years of pressure, Hill resigned.[10]The University of Oklahoma Law School defunded the Anita F. Hill professorship in May 1999, without the position having ever been filled.[39] (All citations refer to those on the Anita Hill page.)\n\n===Andrew M. Coats Hall ===\nIn October 1999, ground was broken on a $19 million construction and renovation project which ultimately added 80,000 square feet to the facility. Named in honor of then-Dean Andrew M. Coats, the facility features the 58,000-square-foot [http://www.law.ou.edu/law-library Donald E. Pray Law Library] and the 250-seat Dick Bell Courtroom. The new library features the Chapman Reading room, modeled after the reading room in Monnet Hall, with a parquet floor reminiscent of the floors in the Louvre. The Donald E. Pray Law Library, which is open to the public, boasts the largest law collection, public or private, in the state.  \n\nThe Dick Bell Courtroom is one of the largest courtrooms in the region, if not the nation, and hosts live trials from the various courts in central Oklahoma. The Bell Courtroom has hosted appellate cases from both the [[Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals]] (including a death penalty appeal) and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.ou.edu/news-and-media/ou-law-host-10th-us-circuit-court-appeals|title=OU Law to Host 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals {{!}} OU Law|website=www.law.ou.edu|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-08}}</ref> as well as civil trials from the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma|U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma]]. \n\nOn July 1, 2010, [http://www.law.ou.edu/directory/dean-joseph-harroz-jr Joseph Harroz Jr.] became the 12th Dean of the University of Oklahoma College of Law and 7th Director of the OU Law Center.

[[Single-subject research]] with a [[longitudinal study]] follow-up is a commonly-used approach. Current research is focused on integrating [[single-subject design]]s through meta-analysis to determine the effect sizes of behavioral factors in development. Lag sequential analysis has become popular for tracking the stream of behavior during observations. Group designs are increasingly being used. Model construction research involves [[latent growth modeling]] to determine developmental trajectories and [[structural equation modeling]].

This holds that crawling, climbing, and walking displayed by infants represents conditioning of biologically innate [[reflexes]]. In this case, the reflex of stepping is the respondent behavior and these reflexes are environmentally conditioned through experience and practice. This position was criticized by maturation theorists. They believed that the stepping reflex for infants actually disappeared over time and was not \"continuous\". By working with a slightly different theoretical model, while still using operant conditioning, [[Esther Thelen]] was  able to show that children's stepping reflex disappears as a function of increased physical weight. However, when infants were placed in water, that same stepping reflex returned.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Savelsbergh |first=G.J.P. |year=2005 |title=Discovery Of Motor Development: A Tribute To Esther Thelen |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=243\u2013249|doi=10.1037/h0100074 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Thelen |first=E. |last2=Fisher |first2=D.M. |year= 1982 |title=Newborn stepping: An explanation for a 'disappearing reflex{{'-}} |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=760\u2013775 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.18.5.760}}</ref> This offered a model for the continuity of the stepping reflex and the progressive stimulation model for behavior analysts.\n\nInfants [[relative deprivation|deprived]] of physical [[stimulation]] or the opportunity to respond were found to have delayed motor development.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |year=1960 |title=Causes of retardation among institutional children: Iran |journal=Journal of Genetic Psychology |volume=96 |pages=47\u201359 |pmid=13815945 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1960.10534274}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |last2=Najarian |first2=P. |year=1957 |title=Infant development under environmental handicap |journal= Psychological Monographs: General and Applied|volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=1\u201313 |doi=10.1037/h0093705}}</ref> Under conditions of extra stimulation, the motor behavior of these children rapidly improved.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sayegh |first=Y. |last2=Dennis |first2=W. |year=1965 |title=The effects of supplementary experience upon behavioral development of infants in institutions |journal=Child Development |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=81\u201390 |pmid=14296799 |doi=10.2307/1126782 |jstor=1126782}}</ref> Some research has shown that the use of a treadmill can be beneficial to children with motor delays including [[Down syndrome]] and cerebral palsy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Masiello |first=T. |last2=Tucker |year=2006 |title=Influences of treadmill training on the motor development of infants with and without disabilities |url=http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol4_no5.pdf |journal=Bridges |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1\u201317 |access-date=2008-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915022805/http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol4_no5.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Research on opportunity to respond and the building of motor development continues today.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2005 |title=A Brief Report: Can Contingent Imitation Reinforce Truck Lifting In A Three-Month-Old Infant? |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=229\u2013234|doi=10.1037/h0100076 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dziewolska |first=H. |last2= Cautilli |first2=J.D. |year= 2006 |title=The Effects of a Motor Training Package on Minimally Assisted Standing Behavior in a Three-Month-Old Infant |url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/843eed55ea7a3eab109d03b8758199cd18783a87|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=111\u2013124|doi=10.1037/h0100149 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2006 |title=Brief Report: The Use of Opportunity to Respond and Practice to increase efficiency of the stepping reflex in a five-month-old infant |url= |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=538\u2013547|doi=10.1037/h0100088 }}</ref>\n\nThe behavioral development model of motor activity has produced a number of techniques, including [[operant]]-based [[biofeedback]] to facilitate development with success.

It can be generated by five basic processes, including: lack or loss of [[positive reinforcement]],<ref>In addition to loss of reinforcement, the loss of contingency between behavior and reinforcement can also lead to depression</ref> direct positive or negative reinforcement for depressive behavior, lack of rule-governed behavior or too much rule-governed behavior, and/or too much environmental [[punishment]]. For children, some of these variables could set the pattern for lifelong problems. For example, a child whose depressive behavior functions for [[negative reinforcement]] by stopping fighting between parents could develop a lifelong pattern of depressive behavior in the case of conflicts. Two paths that are particularly important are (1) lack or loss of reinforcement because of missing necessary skills at a developmental cusp point or (2) the failure to develop adequate rule-governed behavior. For the latter, the child could develop a pattern of always choosing the short-term small immediate reward (i.e., escaping studying for a test) at the expense of the long-term larger reward (passing courses in middle school). The treatment approach that emerged from this research is called [[behavioral activation]].\n\nIn addition, use of positive reinforcement has been shown to improve symptoms of depression in children.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Tabb |first2=L.C. |year=1993 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on childhood depression |journal=Child and Adolesent Social Work Journal |volume=10 |pages=39\u201353}}</ref> Reinforcement has also been shown to improve the self-concept in children with depression comorbid with learning difficulties.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Cassady |first2=J.C. |year=1995 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on self-concepts of children with learning disabilities |journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=19\u201331 |doi=10.1007/BF01876137}}</ref> Rawson and Tabb (1993) used reinforcement with 99 students (90 males and 9 females) aged from 8 to 12 with behavior disorders in a residential treatment program and showed significant reduction in depression symptoms compared to the control group.\n\n===Cognitive behavior===\nAs children get older, direct control of contingencies is modified by the presence of rule-governed behavior.<ref>Kendler, H. & Kendler, T.

Contingency adduction offers a process by which such skills can be synthesized and which shows why it deserves further attention, particularly by early childhood interventionists.\n\n===Autism===\nFerster (1961) was the first researcher to posit a behavior analytic theory for [[autism]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ferster |first=C.B. |year=1961 |title=Positive reinforcement and the behavioral deficits of autistic children |journal=Child Development |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=437\u2013456 |pmid=13699189 |doi=10.2307/1126210|jstor=1126210 }}</ref> Ferster's model saw autism as a by-product of social interactions between parent and child. Ferster presented an analysis of how a variety of contingencies of reinforcement between parent and child during early childhood might establish and strengthen a repertoire of behaviors typically seen in children diagnosed with autism. A similar model was proposed by Drash and Tutor (1993), who developed the contingency-shaped or behavioral incompatibility theory of autism.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Drash |first=P.W. |last2=Tudor |first2=R.M. |year=1993 |title=A functional analysis of verbal delay in preschool children: Implications for prevention and total recovery |journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior |volume=11 |pages=19\u201329|pmid=22477077 |pmc=2748560 |doi=10.1007/BF03392884 }}</ref> They identified at least six [[reinforcement]] paradigms that may contribute to significant deficiencies in verbal behavior typically characteristic of children diagnosed as austistic. They proposed that each of these paradigms may also create a repertoire of avoidance responses that could contribute to the establishment of a repertoire of behavior that would be incompatible with the acquisition of age-appropriate verbal behavior.\nMore recent models attribute [[autism]] to neurological and sensory models that are overly worked and subsequently produce the autistic repertoire. Lovaas and Smith (1989) proposed that children with autism have a mismatch between their nervous systems and the environment,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lovaas |first=O.I. |last2=Smith |first2=T. |year=1989 |title=A comprehensive behavior theory of autistic children: Paradigm for research and treatment |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201329 |pmid=2671048 |doi=10.1016/0005-7916(89)90004-9}}</ref> while Bijou and Ghezzi (1999) proposed a behavioral interference theory.<ref>Bijou, S.W. & Ghezzi, P.M.

However, most behavioral models of autism remain largely speculative due to limited research efforts.\n\n==Role in education==\nOne of the largest impacts of behavior analysis of child development is its role in the field of education. In 1968, Siegfried Englemann used [[operant conditioning]] techniques in a combination with rule learning to produce the [[direct instruction]] curriculum.<ref>Engelmann, S. & Carnine, D. (1991). ''Theory of instruction: Principles and applications''.

Keller]] used similar techniques to develop [[programmed instruction]]. [[B.F. Skinner]] developed a programmed instruction curriculum for teaching handwriting. One of Skinner's students, [[Ogden Lindsley]], developed a standardized semilogrithmic chart, the \"Standard Behavior Chart,\" now \"Standard Celeration Chart,\" used to record frequencies of behavior, and to allow direct visual comparisons of both frequencies and changes in those frequencies (termed \"celeration\"). The use of this charting tool for analysis of instructional effects or other environmental variables through the direct measurement of learner performance has become known as [[precision teaching]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Calkin, A.B. |year=2005 |title=Precision teaching: the standard celeration charts |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=207\u201316 |url= |type = PDF|doi=10.1037/h0100073 |citeseerx=10.1.1.565.8320 }}</ref>\n\nBehavior analysts with a focus on behavioral development form the basis of a movement called [[positive behavior support]] (PBS).

[[Rasch model|Rasch analysis]] is now widely used to show sequentiality within a developmental trajectory.\n\nA recent methodological change in the behavioral analytic theory is the use of observational methods combined with lag sequential analysis can determine [[reinforcement]] in the natural setting.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J.J. |last2=Patterson |first2=G.R. |year=1986 |title=The effects of consequences on patterns of social interaction: A quasi-experimental approach to reinforcement in the natural environment |journal=Child Development |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1257\u20131268 |pmid=3769609 |doi=10.2307/1130448 |jstor=1130448|title-link=reinforcement }}</ref>\n\n===Quantitative behavioral development===\n\nThe [[model of hierarchical complexity]] is a quantitative analytic theory of development.

This holds that crawling, climbing, and walking displayed by infants represents conditioning of biologically innate [[reflexes]]. In this case, the reflex of stepping is the respondent behavior and these reflexes are environmentally conditioned through experience and practice. This position was criticized by maturation theorists. They believed that the stepping reflex for infants actually disappeared over time and was not \"continuous\". By working with a slightly different theoretical model, while still using operant conditioning, [[Esther Thelen]] was  able to show that children's stepping reflex disappears as a function of increased physical weight. However, when infants were placed in water, that same stepping reflex returned.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Savelsbergh |first=G.J.P. |year=2005 |title=Discovery Of Motor Development: A Tribute To Esther Thelen |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=243\u2013249|doi=10.1037/h0100074 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Thelen |first=E. |last2=Fisher |first2=D.M. |year= 1982 |title=Newborn stepping: An explanation for a 'disappearing reflex{{'-}} |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=760\u2013775 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.18.5.760}}</ref> This offered a model for the continuity of the stepping reflex and the progressive stimulation model for behavior analysts.\n\nInfants [[relative deprivation|deprived]] of physical [[stimulation]] or the opportunity to respond were found to have delayed motor development.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |year=1960 |title=Causes of retardation among institutional children: Iran |journal=Journal of Genetic Psychology |volume=96 |pages=47\u201359 |pmid=13815945 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1960.10534274}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |last2=Najarian |first2=P. |year=1957 |title=Infant development under environmental handicap |journal= Psychological Monographs: General and Applied|volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=1\u201313 |doi=10.1037/h0093705}}</ref> Under conditions of extra stimulation, the motor behavior of these children rapidly improved.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sayegh |first=Y. |last2=Dennis |first2=W. |year=1965 |title=The effects of supplementary experience upon behavioral development of infants in institutions |journal=Child Development |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=81\u201390 |pmid=14296799 |doi=10.2307/1126782 |jstor=1126782}}</ref> Some research has shown that the use of a treadmill can be beneficial to children with motor delays including [[Down syndrome]] and cerebral palsy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Masiello |first=T. |last2=Tucker |year=2006 |title=Influences of treadmill training on the motor development of infants with and without disabilities |url=http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol4_no5.pdf |journal=Bridges |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1\u201317 |access-date=2008-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915022805/http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol4_no5.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Research on opportunity to respond and the building of motor development continues today.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2005 |title=A Brief Report: Can Contingent Imitation Reinforce Truck Lifting In A Three-Month-Old Infant? |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=229\u2013234|doi=10.1037/h0100076 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dziewolska |first=H. |last2= Cautilli |first2=J.D. |year= 2006 |title=The Effects of a Motor Training Package on Minimally Assisted Standing Behavior in a Three-Month-Old Infant |url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/843eed55ea7a3eab109d03b8758199cd18783a87|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=111\u2013124|doi=10.1037/h0100149 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2006 |title=Brief Report: The Use of Opportunity to Respond and Practice to increase efficiency of the stepping reflex in a five-month-old infant |url= |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=538\u2013547|doi=10.1037/h0100088 }}</ref>\n\nThe behavioral development model of motor activity has produced a number of techniques, including [[operant]]-based [[biofeedback]] to facilitate development with success.

It can be generated by five basic processes, including: lack or loss of [[positive reinforcement]],<ref>In addition to loss of reinforcement, the loss of contingency between behavior and reinforcement can also lead to depression</ref> direct positive or negative reinforcement for depressive behavior, lack of rule-governed behavior or too much rule-governed behavior, and/or too much environmental [[punishment]]. For children, some of these variables could set the pattern for lifelong problems. For example, a child whose depressive behavior functions for [[negative reinforcement]] by stopping fighting between parents could develop a lifelong pattern of depressive behavior in the case of conflicts. Two paths that are particularly important are (1) lack or loss of reinforcement because of missing necessary skills at a developmental cusp point or (2) the failure to develop adequate rule-governed behavior. For the latter, the child could develop a pattern of always choosing the short-term small immediate reward (i.e., escaping studying for a test) at the expense of the long-term larger reward (passing courses in middle school). The treatment approach that emerged from this research is called [[behavioral activation]].\n\nIn addition, use of positive reinforcement has been shown to improve symptoms of depression in children.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Tabb |first2=L.C. |year=1993 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on childhood depression |journal=Child and Adolesent Social Work Journal |volume=10 |pages=39\u201353}}</ref> Reinforcement has also been shown to improve the self-concept in children with depression comorbid with learning difficulties.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Cassady |first2=J.C. |year=1995 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on self-concepts of children with learning disabilities |journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=19\u201331 |doi=10.1007/BF01876137}}</ref> Rawson and Tabb (1993) used reinforcement with 99 students (90 males and 9 females) aged from 8 to 12 with behavior disorders in a residential treatment program and showed significant reduction in depression symptoms compared to the control group.\n\n===Cognitive behavior===\nAs children get older, direct control of contingencies is modified by the presence of rule-governed behavior.<ref>Kendler, H. & Kendler, T.

For example, as [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] observed, individuals have a tendency at the pre-operational stage to have limits in their ability to preserve information(Piaget & Szeminska, 1952). While children's training in the development of conservation skills has been generally successful,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bucher |first=B. |last2=Schneider |first2=R.E. |year=1973 |title=Acquisition and generalization of conservation by pre-schoolers, using operant training |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=187\u2013204 |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(73)90160-4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Waghorn |first=L. |last2= Sullivan |first2=E.V. |year=1970 |title=The exploration of transition rules in conservation of quantity (substance) using film mediated modeling |journal=Acta Psychologica |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 65\u201380 |pmid=5497127 |doi=10.1016/0001-6918(70)90091-0}}</ref> complications have been noted.<ref name=Field1987>{{Cite journal |last=Field |first=D. |year=1987 |title=A review of preschool conservation training: An analysis of analyses |journal=Developmental Review |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=210\u2013251 |doi=10.1016/0273-2297(87)90013-X}}</ref> Behavior analysts argue that this is largely due to the number of tool skills that need to be developed and integrated. Contingency adduction offers a process by which such skills can be synthesized and which shows why it deserves further attention, particularly by early childhood interventionists.\n\n===Autism===\nFerster (1961) was the first researcher to posit a behavior analytic theory for [[autism]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ferster |first=C.B. |year=1961 |title=Positive reinforcement and the behavioral deficits of autistic children |journal=Child Development |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=437\u2013456 |pmid=13699189 |doi=10.2307/1126210|jstor=1126210 }}</ref> Ferster's model saw autism as a by-product of social interactions between parent and child. Ferster presented an analysis of how a variety of contingencies of reinforcement between parent and child during early childhood might establish and strengthen a repertoire of behaviors typically seen in children diagnosed with autism. A similar model was proposed by Drash and Tutor (1993), who developed the contingency-shaped or behavioral incompatibility theory of autism.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Drash |first=P.W. |last2=Tudor |first2=R.M. |year=1993 |title=A functional analysis of verbal delay in preschool children: Implications for prevention and total recovery |journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior |volume=11 |pages=19\u201329|pmid=22477077 |pmc=2748560 |doi=10.1007/BF03392884 }}</ref> They identified at least six [[reinforcement]] paradigms that may contribute to significant deficiencies in verbal behavior typically characteristic of children diagnosed as austistic. They proposed that each of these paradigms may also create a repertoire of avoidance responses that could contribute to the establishment of a repertoire of behavior that would be incompatible with the acquisition of age-appropriate verbal behavior.\nMore recent models attribute [[autism]] to neurological and sensory models that are overly worked and subsequently produce the autistic repertoire. Lovaas and Smith (1989) proposed that children with autism have a mismatch between their nervous systems and the environment,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lovaas |first=O.I. |last2=Smith |first2=T. |year=1989 |title=A comprehensive behavior theory of autistic children: Paradigm for research and treatment |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201329 |pmid=2671048 |doi=10.1016/0005-7916(89)90004-9}}</ref> while Bijou and Ghezzi (1999) proposed a behavioral interference theory.<ref>Bijou, S.W. & Ghezzi, P.M. (1999). The behavior interference theory of autistic behavior in young children. In P.M. Ghezzi, W.L. Williams & J.E. Carr (Eds.), ''Autism: Behavior analytic perspectives''. (pp. 33\u201343). Reno, NV: Context Press.</ref> However, both the environmental mismatch model and the inference model were recently reviewed,<ref>Hixson, M.D.; Wilson, J.L.; Doty, S.J. & Vladescu, J.C. (2008). A Review of the Behavioral Theories of Autism and Evidence for an Environmental Etiology. ''Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis''. Special Compiled Issue 2.4 - 3.1, 46\u201359.</ref> and new evidence shows support for the notion that the development of autistic behaviors are due to escape and avoidance of certain types of sensory stimuli. However, most behavioral models of autism remain largely speculative due to limited research efforts.\n\n==Role in education==\nOne of the largest impacts of behavior analysis of child development is its role in the field of education. In 1968, Siegfried Englemann used [[operant conditioning]] techniques in a combination with rule learning to produce the [[direct instruction]] curriculum.<ref>Engelmann, S. & Carnine, D. (1991). ''Theory of instruction: Principles and applications''. Eugene, OR: ADI Press</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Englemann |first=S.E. |year=1968 |title=Relating operant techniques to programming and teaching |journal=Journal of School Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=89\u201396 |doi=10.1016/0022-4405(68)90002-2}}</ref> In addition, [[Fred S. Keller]] used similar techniques to develop [[programmed instruction]]. [[B.F. Skinner]] developed a programmed instruction curriculum for teaching handwriting. One of Skinner's students, [[Ogden Lindsley]], developed a standardized semilogrithmic chart, the \"Standard Behavior Chart,\" now \"Standard Celeration Chart,\" used to record frequencies of behavior, and to allow direct visual comparisons of both frequencies and changes in those frequencies (termed \"celeration\"). The use of this charting tool for analysis of instructional effects or other environmental variables through the direct measurement of learner performance has become known as [[precision teaching]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Calkin, A.B. |year=2005 |title=Precision teaching: the standard celeration charts |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=207\u201316 |url= |type = PDF|doi=10.1037/h0100073 |citeseerx=10.1.1.565.8320 }}</ref>\n\nBehavior analysts with a focus on behavioral development form the basis of a movement called [[positive behavior support]] (PBS). PBS has focused on building safe schools.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=T.M.

Examples of this differential learning include social and language skills.<ref>\"Child Development\" Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. 2001. 5 February 2008. http://www.nwrel.org/request/june01/child.html</ref> According to the NWREL (Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory), too much interaction with technology will hinder a child's social interactions with others due to its potential to become an addiction and subsequently lead to anti-social behavior.<ref>{{cite news|last =Meltz|first= Barbara F.|title = Zora and the explorer|work =The Boston Globe |date = October 22, 2007 |url= http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/10/22/zora_and_the_explorer|url-access=subscription}}</ref> In terms of language development, children will start to learn and know about 5\u201320 different words by 18 months old.<ref>{{cite web|title =Language Development In Children|website=  Child Development Institute|url= http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/language_development.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==Critiques of behavioral approach and new developments==\nBehavior analytic theories have been criticized for their focus on the explanation of the acquisition of relatively simple behavior (i.e., the behavior of nonhuman species, of infants, and of individuals who are intellectually disabled or autistic) rather than of complex behavior (see Commons & Miller).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Miller |first2=P.M. |year=2001 |title=A Quantitative Behavioral Model of Developmental Stage Based upon the Model of Hierarchical Complexity |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=222\u2013252|doi=10.1037/h0099940 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1dc92e392b73c2aa6bfd9b75a37e2a89c275aedb }}</ref> [[Michael Commons]] continued [[behavior analysis]]'s rejection of [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]] and the substitution of a [[task analysis]] of the particular skills to be learned.

Formed in 1892 in the then-working class [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], the club played in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) before joining seven other teams in 1896 to found the breakaway Victorian Football League (now the national AFL). Originally based at [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]], Collingwood now plays its home games at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] with its training and administrative headquarters located at [[Olympic Park Oval]] and the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre|Holden Centre]].\n\nCollingwood has played in a record 44 [[AFL Grand Final|VFL/AFL Grand Finals]] (including rematches), winning 15, drawing two and losing 27 (also a record). Regarded as one of Australia's most popular sports clubs, Collingwood attracts the highest attendance figures and television ratings of any professional team in the nation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Collingwood, Brisbane Broncos top rankings as Australia's most popular football clubs|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/collingwood-brisbane-broncos-top-rankings-as-australias-most-popular-football-club/story-fni5f6hd-1226643288139|newspaper=Herald Sun|accessdate=13 June 2014|date=15 May 2014|author=Matt Windley}}</ref>\n \nThe club's song, \"[[Collingwood Football Club#Song|Good Old Collingwood Forever]]\", dates back to 1906, making it the oldest song currently used in the AFL. Its iconic home [[guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]] consists of black and white stripes, matching the colours of the [[Australian magpie]]. Historically the club's main rivals have been cross-town clubs [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]. Since the turn of the millennium, the club developed rivalries with the [[West Coast Eagles]]\nand the [[Brisbane Lions]].\n\nCollingwood fields a [[Collingwood Football Club#Reserves team|reserves team]] in the [[Victorian Football League]] (formerly the VFA) and [[Collingwood Football Club#Women's teams|women's teams]] in the [[AFL Women's]] and [[VFL Women's]] competitions.

Collingwood won its first [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] in [[1902 VFL Grand Final|1902]], defeating {{AFL Ess}} by 33 points.\n\n===1920s and 1930s: Four consecutive premierships===\n[[File:Jock Mchale.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jock McHale coached the club to four consecutive Grand Final victories.]]\nCollingwood was the most successful club of the 1920s and 1930s, appearing in 13 out of a possible 20 Grand Finals during the period. Collingwood were premiers six times during this time, including four consecutive premierships between [[1927 VFL season|1927]] and [[1930 VFL season|1930]], a VFL/AFL record, and two consecutive premierships in [[1935 VFL season|1935]] and [[1936 VFL season|1936]]. The club's coach during this period was [[Jock McHale]], who served as coach from 1912 to 1949. Collingwood also had three [[Brownlow Medal]]lists during the period, with [[Syd Coventry]] winning in [[1927 VFL season|1927]], [[Albert Collier]] in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and [[Harry Collier]] in [[1930 VFL season|1930]]. The club's ruthlessly successful period later earned the club the nickname \"The Machine\". American journalist and author Sam Walker included the Machine team in his book ''The Captain Class'', which listed some the author's greatest teams in the history of world sport.<ref name=Hello12>{{cite web|url=https://forever.collingwoodfc.com.au/machine-named-among-worlds-best-ever-sporting-teams/|title=Machine named among world's best ever sporting teams|work=forever.collingwoodfc.com.au}}</ref> The Collingwood team of 1927\u201330 not only won four straight premierships, but did so with a winning percentage of around 86% across the four seasons, and an average winning margin of about five goals. In 1929 they also became the only team in history to go through a home-and-away season undefeated.<ref name=Hello12/> Collingwood remains the only club in the history of the VFL/AFL to have [[List of VFL/AFL premiers|won the premiership]] on four successive occasions.\n\n===1950s: Melbourne rivalry===\n\nIn the 1950s, rival club [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] enjoyed an era of unprecedented success, winning five premierships in six years (the last coming in 1960, and having been runner up in 1954). Collingwood lost two Grand Finals to Melbourne in this decade, but bounced back to win premierships in 1953 and 1958. Collingwood's 1958 premiership is much cherished by the club as it prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record four premierships in a row.\n\nThe 1958 premiership was however to be Collingwood's last for 32 years, as the club was to suffer a string of Grand Final defeats in coming decades.\n\n===1959\u201389: \"Colliwobbles\"===\n{{main|Colliwobbles}}\nA string of eight Grand Final losses, often by narrow margins, between 1960 and 1981 gave rise to a perception that the club was prone to \"choking\", a phenomenon wittily dubbed \"Colliwobbles\".<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/lets-banish-memories-of-colliwobbles-forever/story-e6frfhqf-1225929137935 Let's banish memories of Colliwobbles forever] The Herald Sun, 24 September 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/putting-a-price-on-colliwobbles-20100811-11zpj.html Putting a price on Colliwobbles] The Melbourne Age, 12 August 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/its-still-neck-and-neck-after-44-years-20100925-15rpk.html?rand=1285423503336?autostart=1 It's still neck and neck after 44 years] The Melbourne Age, 25 September 2010</ref> Whether this perception is accurate remains a subject of debate;<ref name=footyalmanac>[http://footyalmanac.com.au/?p=14663 Colliwobbles: fact or fantasy?] ''Footy Almanac''</ref> having only won one and drawn one of its last six Grand Finals.

The sight of club great [[Darren Millane]], who died in a car-crash one year later, holding the ball aloft in triumph at the final siren is one of the indelible images of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2015-07-29/1990-premiership-exhibition|title=Re-live the triumph \u2013 1990 Premiership exhibition|work=Collingwood Football Club|date=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the drought-breaking premiership, the club lapsed into a state of decline for the remainder of the decade, culminating with the club's second [[wooden spoon]] in 1999. The Magpies returned to finals, though were quickly eliminated, in the [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]] against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and in [[1994 AFL season|1994]] against [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. Matthews left as head coach at the end of the [[1995 AFL season|1995 season]] and was replaced at the start of the following year by 1990 premiership captain [[Tony Shaw]], who had only retired from football 18 months earlier. Mid-table finishes under Shaw were achieved for the next two seasons, before poor results in 1998 and 1999 saw Shaw announce his resignation.\n\n===2000\u201311: The Malthouse era===\nMedia personality, sports journalist and administrator [[Eddie McGuire]] was elected [[List of Collingwood Football Club presidents|President]] in October 1998. He oversaw the installation of new head coach [[Michael Malthouse]] in October 1999, whose appointment proved to be a masterstroke in reviving the club on-field. Under Malthouse, the acquisition and emergence of players such as [[Paul Licuria]], [[Alan Didak]], [[Anthony Rocca]] and [[Nathan Buckley]] resulted in Collingwood quickly moving up the ladder in [[2000 AFL season|2000]] and [[2001 AFL season|2001]], only narrowly missing the finals in the latter year. Collingwood met reigning premiers the [[Brisbane Lions]] in the [[2002 AFL Grand Final|2002 Grand Final]] and were regarded as massive underdogs, eventually falling just 9 points short of an improbable premiership. Buckley, the captain, became just the third player to win the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best afield in the Grand Final despite being a member of the losing side. Despite a very successful home-and-away next season, they were again defeated by the Lions in the [[2003 AFL Grand Final|2003 Grand Final]], this time in thoroughly convincingly fashion.\n\nFollowing those Grand Final losses, Collingwood struggled for the next two years, finishing 13th in 2004 and second-last in 2005; the latter meant Collingwood was eligible for a priority pick which the club used to recruit [[Dale Thomas (footballer)|Dale Thomas]]. Collingwood made a return to the finals in 2006, finishing fifth, but were defeated by the [[Western Bulldogs]] by 41 points in its elimination final. A loss to {{AFL Ess}} late in the season was to cost them the double chance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2012-08-30/beyond-2000-essendon|title=Beyond 2000 \u2013 Essendon|publisher=Collingwood FC|first=Luke|last=Mason|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=10 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524151821/http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2012-08-30/beyond-2000-essendon|archive-date=24 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-08-11/bombers-shock-magpies/1237690|title=Bombers shock Magpies|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=11 August 2006|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> The 2007 season saw them finish sixth on the ladder at season's conclusion, and in the finals they knocked out the grand finalists of the past two years, [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], in the elimination final and then [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] in overtime at [[Subiaco Oval]] in the semi-final. Having earned a preliminary final against {{AFL Gee}}, Collingwood lost to the eventual premiers, by five points in one of the most memorable preliminary finals in over a decade. Nathan Buckley would announce his retirement at season's end after playing just five games in 2007 due to injury.\n\nCollingwood finished eighth in [[2008 AFL season|2008]] and were assigned an away final against {{AFL Ade}} at [[AAMI Stadium]]. After at one point trailing in the match, Collingwood went on to end Adelaide's season and earn a semi-final meeting against {{AFL StK}}. Having defeated the Saints in both their regular season meetings, Collingwood lost convincingly, ending their 2008 season. The [[2009 AFL season|2009 season]] saw Collingwood finish inside the top-four for the first time since 2003, but in the qualifying final were beaten by minor premiers St Kilda convincingly. Having won a second chance, Collingwood struggled against Adelaide for the second year in a row before John Anthony kicked the match-winning goal with a minute left to send them into another preliminary final meeting with Geelong. But the season ended abruptly for the Magpies, with a 73-point loss to Geelong.\n\nIn 2010, Collingwood finished as minor premiers, and after wins in the qualifying and preliminary finals, reached the first [[2010 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] against {{AFL StK}}. The match finished as a draw, forcing the first [[grand final replay]] in 33 years. Collingwood won the replay by 56 points. Key defensive player [[Nick Maxwell]] captained the club to victory and midfielder [[Scott Pendlebury]] (who had already won his first of eventually three [[Anzac Day match|Anzac medals]] earlier in the year) was awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]]. The club won a second consecutive minor premiership in 2011, and qualified for the [[2011 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] after a three-point victory against Hawthorn in the preliminary final. However, Collingwood was then beaten by Geelong by 38 points in the decider, after trailing by seven points at three-quarter time. Following the Grand Final loss, which also marked the end of the club's 2011 AFL season, Malthouse left Collingwood after deciding not to stay on as \"director of coaching\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-01/malthouse-to-part-ways-with-pies/3205206 |title=Malthouse parts ways with Pies |access-date=22 September 2018 |website=ABC News |agency=Australian Associated Press}}</ref> Star midfielder [[Dane Swan]] won the [[2011 Brownlow Medal]] with a then-record 34 votes.

The club qualified for finals once more in 2013, though were surprisingly eliminated in the first week by underdogs [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] at home. The result prompted the Magpies coaching staff to begin making radical changes to the club's playing list, which saw premiership players [[Heath Shaw]], [[Sharrod Wellingham]], [[Heritier Lumumba]] among others leave for other clubs or retire. Over the next four years, younger talent was drafted but the club's win-loss recorded continued to deteriorate. Collingwood failed to make finals from 2014 through to the end of the [[2017 AFL season|2017 season]], progressively sliding down the ladder each year. Buckley came under intense media pressure to resign or be sacked from his position, though club administrators elected to grant him a two-year extension to his contract in October 2017 after a broad-ranging internal review.<ref name=Buckleyarticle1>{{cite web|url=https://themongrelpunt.com/afl/2018/10/17/an-imperfect-perfection-the-transformation-of-nathan-buckley|title=An Imperfect Perfection \u2013 The Transformation of Nathan Buckley|work=The Mongrel Punt|date=1 June 2019}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of new-generation players such as [[Taylor Adams]], [[Adam Treloar]] and [[Jordan De Goey]], alongside key talls [[Brodie Grundy]] and [[Mason Cox]] mixed well with veterans Pendlebury and [[Steele Sidebottom]].

The all white jumper, with the three black vertical stripes is the iconic strip that the club is most associated with.  The current incarnation of the guernsey is mostly black, with white stripes on the front and lower half of the back, and white numbers. The main clash guernsey is the reverse of this: mostly white, with black stripes and black numbers, worn in away matches against clubs with a predominantly dark guernsey such as [[Fremantle|Fremantle Football Club]] and [[Port Adelaide|Port Adelaide Football Club]]. A secondary clash guernsey was introduced in 2011 and is used only in matches against {{AFL Nor}} due to similarity between the two uniforms. The alternate uniform is black with only two white stripes on each side instead of three.\n\nTraditionally, Collingwood has worn a white guernsey with black stripes. The club switched to the black guernsey with white stripes in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footyjumpers.net|title=Collingwood Home Jumpers|accessdate=12 November 2011|first=David|last=Eastman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716095630/http://www.footyjumpers.net/|archive-date=16 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Song===\n[[File:Tom Nelson 1906.jpg|thumb|upright|Collingwood player [[Tom Nelson (Australian footballer)|Tom Nelson]] wrote the lyrics to \"Good Old Collingwood Forever\"  in 1906.]]\n\"Good Old Collingwood Forever\" is the [[List of AFL Team Songs|team song]] of the Collingwood Football Club.

In Round 8 2002 Collingwood beat Brisbane by three points in a tense match in front of 46,279 people at [[Colonial Stadium]]. This victory over the reigning premier took the Magpies to equal top of the league table (2nd on percentage) with Brisbane. The rivalry grew with the 2002 Grand Final when Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points. The rivalry grew again in 2003 when the two clubs clashed on four occasions. The Lions defeated the Magpies at [[The Gabba]] in Round 4 before thrashing them in Heritage Round \u2013 Round 19 at the MCG. Collingwood then defeated Brisbane in the Qualifying Final with [[Alan Didak]] ensuring victory late in the final quarter, with two goals from the boundary line. The rivalry peaked in the 2003 Grand Final with Brisbane easily defeating Collingwood to win the premiership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/as-hawthorn-and-geelong-write-another-chapter-we-look-at-five-of-the-afls-most-intense-rivalries/story-e6frf3e3-1226442147289#.UUcHOBxkP74 |title=As Hawthorn and Geelong write another chapter, we look at five of the AFL's most intense rivalries |first=John |last=Clark |date=3 August 2012}}</ref> The rivalry cooled off to a degree in the period following Brisbane's loss in the 2004 Grand Final due to a sustained period of success at Collingwood and a string of poor seasons at Brisbane, however [[Dayne Beams]] recent defection to the Lions has seemingly reignited the rivalry.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/afl/dayne-beams-traded-to-brisbane-lions-as-part-of-fiveway-deal/story-fnahrzm3-1227090511947|title= Dayne Beams traded to Brisbane Lions as part of five-way deal|first=Greg |last=Davis|date=14 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-10-21/round-one-2015-revealed |title=Blockbusters and a grudge match set for round one, 2015 |first=Ashley |last=Browne |date=21 October 2014 |access-date=18 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416141032/http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-10-21/round-one-2015-revealed |archive-date=16 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Despite Brisbane's string of poor seasons, the rivalry remains ignited due to many Collingwood supporters remaining bitter about the two grand final losses and the fact that the [[Brisbane Lions]] will forever be the last team to win a VFL/AFL match at [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pe_zzRuHPo|title=Collingwood Magpies vs Brisbane Lions \u2013 Round 22 \u2013 1999 \u2013 Last AFL Game At Victoria Park|last=Mighty Roar|date=30 March 2015|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==== [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] ====\nThe rivalry between Collingwood and Melbourne was at its peak between 1955 and 1964, when the two played off in the grand final on five occasions. This included the 1958 Grand Final where Collingwood's victory prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record of four premierships in succession (1927\u20131930). The old rivalry with [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] has faded in recent decades due to Melbourne not enjoying the same level of on-field success, however, it remains strong and is an annual scheduled fixture on the Queens Birthday public holiday.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Essendon]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Collingwood's rivalry with Essendon]] has become more significant since 1995, when the first [[Anzac Day clash|ANZAC Day clash]] took place. After the 2019 match, Collingwood have won this contest 15 times and Essendon 9 times, with the first match being drawn.\n\n==== [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] ====\nThe rivalry with [[Port Adelaide FC|Port Adelaide]] stems from them being known as the Magpies in their local [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] competition before switching to the Power when entering the League in 1997. Feelings were heightened when Port midfielder [[Kane Cornes]] 'flipped the bird' at [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] following the Power's five-point victory over the Magpies at [[AAMI Stadium]] in Round 9, 2002, only moments after [[Anthony Rocca]] had missed the opportunity to tie the scores. [[Jarrod Molloy]] and [[Brodie Holland]] remonstrated with Cornes after the match, with a feeling of hostility lingering after the two sides had left the field. Collingwood unexpectedly beat the Power in the Qualifying Final that season, also at AAMI stadium. Collingwood again defeated Port Adelaide in the 2003 Preliminary Final at the MCG. This added to the 'choking' phenomenon directed at the Power. The off-field battle over Port's desire to wear its black and white \"prison bar\" guernsey has been a major talking point, especially between 2002 and 2007, which added to the rivalry. A resolution was reached in favour of Collingwood.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Geelong]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Games between Collingwood and Geelong]] have become highly anticipated since 2007. In Round 15 Geelong beat Collingwood by 16 points in a high-quality match. In the Preliminary final Collingwood surprised many when they came within 5 points of the eventual premiers. In 2008 Collingwood thrashed Geelong by 86 points\u201420.14 (134)- 7.6 (48) causing Geelong's only loss of the year. In 2009, the sides again met in the preliminary final, but despite high hopes the Cats, who would again win the premiership, won by 73 points in front of another massive crowd of 87,258.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lovett|2010|p=92}}</ref> In 2010, the two sides emerged as the favourites for the flag and twice met in front of blockbuster crowds at the MCG when they were placed 1st and 2nd on the ladder\u2014with the results evenly split. They again met in a Preliminary final, this time a resounding win to Collingwood by 41 points. In 2011, both teams were undefeated going into their round eight 'blockbuster' at the 'G. Geelong won by three points, after a controversial advantage was not paid to Magpie Scott Pendlebury in the dying minutes. Pendlebury kicked a goal and would have put the Pies in front, but the free kick was contentiously called back and Geelong managed to whisk the ball away. In the round 24 match, Geelong thumped the Magpies by a record margin of 96 points, which was also Collingwood's biggest ever loss at the MCG. The 2011 Grand Final against the Cats concluded with a 38-point loss for the Pies.\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Magpie mascot.jpg|thumb|200px|Collingwood Magpies mascot]]\nCollingwood is a working-class suburb and the Collingwood Football Club supporter base traditionally came from the working class (though its supporter base today goes far beyond). Many of the club's supporters who regularly attend games still come from the working class or from lower socio-economic groups, leading to jokes from supporters of other clubs which typically stereotype their Collingwood counterparts as poor, crude and ignorant.<ref>{{cite web|last=Humphrys|first=Elizabeth|title=Beyond a joke: Bogan loathing bring us all to shame|url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|work=The Drum|publisher=ABC|accessdate=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003204636/http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|archive-date=3 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCollingwood is traditionally reviled by non-Collingwood supporters (\"You either love 'em or you hate 'em\"). The dislike of the club by outsiders is said to have originated during the 1920s and 1930s, a period of great success for the club which drew the envy and resentment of other clubs. In this period, Collingwood was also perceived as a Catholic and Irish club, at a time when these groups were looked down upon by the rest of Australian society and subjected to a considerable degree of social exclusion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cordy|first=Neil|title=AFL AFL DEPARTMENT OF TRADE NAB CUP SHOWS VIDEO GWS Giants supporters are about to learn why footy fans love to hate Collingwood, writes Neil Cordy|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/gws-giants-supporters-are-about-to-learn-why-footy-fans-love-to-hate-collingwood-writes-neil-cordy/story-e6frf3e3-1226436342075}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sapienza|first=Joseph|title=Everybody hates Collingwood ... but why?|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/everybody-hates-collingwood--but-why-20100921-15l4l.html|work=The Age|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nUntil recent years, racial vilification of opposition players in VFL/AFL games was not uncommon.

Collingwood.\n\n===Off field===\nCollingwood was one of the last clubs to abandon its traditional stadium, the famous inner-city [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]]. Collingwood now plays home games at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. It now also has its headquarters situated in the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Center|former Glasshouse Entertainment Centre]]. Due to a sponsorship deal, this facility is known as 'The Holden Centre'.\n\nCollingwood continues to be financially viable through the loyal support of its huge following and numerous sponsors. After finishing 2nd in 2002 and 2003 the team fell to 13th and 15th (out of 16) in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This trend has plagued the club since the glory days of pre-World War II VFL football. Since 1958, the club has won only two VFL/AFL Premiership (the inaugural AFL Premiership in 1990, and in 2010). Despite this, the club still has won more individual games, more finals and made more grand final appearances than any other club.\n\nOn 9 March 2007, former Collingwood and Fitzroy defender [[Gary Pert]] was appointed the Magpies' CEO, seven weeks after Greg Swann departed for Carlton. In accepting the key Magpie post, Pert quit as a club director and as managing director of Channel 9 in Melbourne. In a press conference, it was stated that Collingwood has budgeted to turn over about $50&nbsp;million this year. McGuire hopes the new administration will soon double that figure. \"A finance administration review has come up with how we are going to turn Collingwood in to its next phase of its life\", McGuire said. \"What do we do to make ourselves go from a $45&nbsp;million a year turnover business to a $100&nbsp;million turnover business? \"They sound like big figures but in 1999 we turned over $13&nbsp;million, so that is where we are heading as a football club.\"\n\nThe club made an operating profit of $5.23 million for the 2013 season, revenue increased from $2.6 million to more than $75 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|title=Collingwood AFL&nbsp;club builds build TV studio for digital marketing expansion|date=8 January 2014|access-date=17 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223834/http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July 2017, Pert resigned from his position as CEO of the club, with Peter Murphy replacing him as an interim CEO.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/collingwood-chief-executive-gary-pert-resigns-20170724-gxhbu4.html|title=Collingwood chief executive Gary Pert resigns|first=Jon|last=Pierik|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe Collingwood guernsey is the most valuable sports sponsorship in Australia.<ref name=\"Magpies guernsey most valuable\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/afls-success-in-black-and-white-20110308-1bmk6.html |title=Magpies guernsey most valuable |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> Collingwood has different guernsey sponsors for home and away matches, generating an estimated $6.3&nbsp;million worth of media exposure for the primary sponsor and $5.7&nbsp;million for the secondary sponsor.

Formed in 1892 in the then-working class [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], the club played in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) before joining seven other teams in 1896 to found the breakaway Victorian Football League (now the national AFL). Originally based at [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]], Collingwood now plays its home games at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] with its training and administrative headquarters located at [[Olympic Park Oval]] and the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre|Holden Centre]].\n\nCollingwood has played in a record 44 [[AFL Grand Final|VFL/AFL Grand Finals]] (including rematches), winning 15, drawing two and losing 27 (also a record).

Historically the club's main rivals have been cross-town clubs [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] and [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]].

Collingwood won its first [[List of Australian Football League premiers|premiership]] in [[1902 VFL Grand Final|1902]], defeating {{AFL Ess}} by 33 points.\n\n===1920s and 1930s: Four consecutive premierships===\n[[File:Jock Mchale.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jock McHale coached the club to four consecutive Grand Final victories.]]\nCollingwood was the most successful club of the 1920s and 1930s, appearing in 13 out of a possible 20 Grand Finals during the period. Collingwood were premiers six times during this time, including four consecutive premierships between [[1927 VFL season|1927]] and [[1930 VFL season|1930]], a VFL/AFL record, and two consecutive premierships in [[1935 VFL season|1935]] and [[1936 VFL season|1936]]. The club's coach during this period was [[Jock McHale]], who served as coach from 1912 to 1949. Collingwood also had three [[Brownlow Medal]]lists during the period, with [[Syd Coventry]] winning in [[1927 VFL season|1927]], [[Albert Collier]] in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and [[Harry Collier]] in [[1930 VFL season|1930]]. The club's ruthlessly successful period later earned the club the nickname \"The Machine\". American journalist and author Sam Walker included the Machine team in his book ''The Captain Class'', which listed some the author's greatest teams in the history of world sport.<ref name=Hello12>{{cite web|url=https://forever.collingwoodfc.com.au/machine-named-among-worlds-best-ever-sporting-teams/|title=Machine named among world's best ever sporting teams|work=forever.collingwoodfc.com.au}}</ref> The Collingwood team of 1927\u201330 not only won four straight premierships, but did so with a winning percentage of around 86% across the four seasons, and an average winning margin of about five goals. In 1929 they also became the only team in history to go through a home-and-away season undefeated.<ref name=Hello12/> Collingwood remains the only club in the history of the VFL/AFL to have [[List of VFL/AFL premiers|won the premiership]] on four successive occasions.\n\n===1950s: Melbourne rivalry===\n\nIn the 1950s, rival club [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] enjoyed an era of unprecedented success, winning five premierships in six years (the last coming in 1960, and having been runner up in 1954). Collingwood lost two Grand Finals to Melbourne in this decade, but bounced back to win premierships in 1953 and 1958. Collingwood's 1958 premiership is much cherished by the club as it prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record four premierships in a row.\n\nThe 1958 premiership was however to be Collingwood's last for 32 years, as the club was to suffer a string of Grand Final defeats in coming decades.\n\n===1959\u201389: \"Colliwobbles\"===\n{{main|Colliwobbles}}\nA string of eight Grand Final losses, often by narrow margins, between 1960 and 1981 gave rise to a perception that the club was prone to \"choking\", a phenomenon wittily dubbed \"Colliwobbles\".<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/lets-banish-memories-of-colliwobbles-forever/story-e6frfhqf-1225929137935 Let's banish memories of Colliwobbles forever] The Herald Sun, 24 September 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/putting-a-price-on-colliwobbles-20100811-11zpj.html Putting a price on Colliwobbles] The Melbourne Age, 12 August 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/its-still-neck-and-neck-after-44-years-20100925-15rpk.html?rand=1285423503336?autostart=1 It's still neck and neck after 44 years] The Melbourne Age, 25 September 2010</ref> Whether this perception is accurate remains a subject of debate;<ref name=footyalmanac>[http://footyalmanac.com.au/?p=14663 Colliwobbles: fact or fantasy?] ''Footy Almanac''</ref> having only won one and drawn one of its last six Grand Finals.

The sight of club great [[Darren Millane]], who died in a car-crash one year later, holding the ball aloft in triumph at the final siren is one of the indelible images of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2015-07-29/1990-premiership-exhibition|title=Re-live the triumph \u2013 1990 Premiership exhibition|work=Collingwood Football Club|date=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the drought-breaking premiership, the club lapsed into a state of decline for the remainder of the decade, culminating with the club's second [[wooden spoon]] in 1999. The Magpies returned to finals, though were quickly eliminated, in the [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]] against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and in [[1994 AFL season|1994]] against [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]]. Matthews left as head coach at the end of the [[1995 AFL season|1995 season]] and was replaced at the start of the following year by 1990 premiership captain [[Tony Shaw]], who had only retired from football 18 months earlier. Mid-table finishes under Shaw were achieved for the next two seasons, before poor results in 1998 and 1999 saw Shaw announce his resignation.\n\n===2000\u201311: The Malthouse era===\nMedia personality, sports journalist and administrator [[Eddie McGuire]] was elected [[List of Collingwood Football Club presidents|President]] in October 1998. He oversaw the installation of new head coach [[Michael Malthouse]] in October 1999, whose appointment proved to be a masterstroke in reviving the club on-field. Under Malthouse, the acquisition and emergence of players such as [[Paul Licuria]], [[Alan Didak]], [[Anthony Rocca]] and [[Nathan Buckley]] resulted in Collingwood quickly moving up the ladder in [[2000 AFL season|2000]] and [[2001 AFL season|2001]], only narrowly missing the finals in the latter year. Collingwood met reigning premiers the [[Brisbane Lions]] in the [[2002 AFL Grand Final|2002 Grand Final]] and were regarded as massive underdogs, eventually falling just 9 points short of an improbable premiership. Buckley, the captain, became just the third player to win the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best afield in the Grand Final despite being a member of the losing side. Despite a very successful home-and-away next season, they were again defeated by the Lions in the [[2003 AFL Grand Final|2003 Grand Final]], this time in thoroughly convincingly fashion.\n\nFollowing those Grand Final losses, Collingwood struggled for the next two years, finishing 13th in 2004 and second-last in 2005; the latter meant Collingwood was eligible for a priority pick which the club used to recruit [[Dale Thomas (footballer)|Dale Thomas]]. Collingwood made a return to the finals in 2006, finishing fifth, but were defeated by the [[Western Bulldogs]] by 41 points in its elimination final. A loss to {{AFL Ess}} late in the season was to cost them the double chance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2012-08-30/beyond-2000-essendon|title=Beyond 2000 \u2013 Essendon|publisher=Collingwood FC|first=Luke|last=Mason|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=10 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524151821/http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2012-08-30/beyond-2000-essendon|archive-date=24 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-08-11/bombers-shock-magpies/1237690|title=Bombers shock Magpies|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=11 August 2006|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> The 2007 season saw them finish sixth on the ladder at season's conclusion, and in the finals they knocked out the grand finalists of the past two years, [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], in the elimination final and then [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] in overtime at [[Subiaco Oval]] in the semi-final. Having earned a preliminary final against {{AFL Gee}}, Collingwood lost to the eventual premiers, by five points in one of the most memorable preliminary finals in over a decade. Nathan Buckley would announce his retirement at season's end after playing just five games in 2007 due to injury.\n\nCollingwood finished eighth in [[2008 AFL season|2008]] and were assigned an away final against {{AFL Ade}} at [[AAMI Stadium]]. After at one point trailing in the match, Collingwood went on to end Adelaide's season and earn a semi-final meeting against {{AFL StK}}. Having defeated the Saints in both their regular season meetings, Collingwood lost convincingly, ending their 2008 season. The [[2009 AFL season|2009 season]] saw Collingwood finish inside the top-four for the first time since 2003, but in the qualifying final were beaten by minor premiers St Kilda convincingly. Having won a second chance, Collingwood struggled against Adelaide for the second year in a row before John Anthony kicked the match-winning goal with a minute left to send them into another preliminary final meeting with Geelong. But the season ended abruptly for the Magpies, with a 73-point loss to Geelong.\n\nIn 2010, Collingwood finished as minor premiers, and after wins in the qualifying and preliminary finals, reached the first [[2010 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] against {{AFL StK}}. The match finished as a draw, forcing the first [[grand final replay]] in 33 years. Collingwood won the replay by 56 points. Key defensive player [[Nick Maxwell]] captained the club to victory and midfielder [[Scott Pendlebury]] (who had already won his first of eventually three [[Anzac Day match|Anzac medals]] earlier in the year) was awarded the [[Norm Smith Medal]]. The club won a second consecutive minor premiership in 2011, and qualified for the [[2011 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] after a three-point victory against Hawthorn in the preliminary final. However, Collingwood was then beaten by Geelong by 38 points in the decider, after trailing by seven points at three-quarter time.

The club qualified for finals once more in 2013, though were surprisingly eliminated in the first week by underdogs [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] at home. The result prompted the Magpies coaching staff to begin making radical changes to the club's playing list, which saw premiership players [[Heath Shaw]], [[Sharrod Wellingham]], [[Heritier Lumumba]] among others leave for other clubs or retire. Over the next four years, younger talent was drafted but the club's win-loss recorded continued to deteriorate. Collingwood failed to make finals from 2014 through to the end of the [[2017 AFL season|2017 season]], progressively sliding down the ladder each year. Buckley came under intense media pressure to resign or be sacked from his position, though club administrators elected to grant him a two-year extension to his contract in October 2017 after a broad-ranging internal review.<ref name=Buckleyarticle1>{{cite web|url=https://themongrelpunt.com/afl/2018/10/17/an-imperfect-perfection-the-transformation-of-nathan-buckley|title=An Imperfect Perfection \u2013 The Transformation of Nathan Buckley|work=The Mongrel Punt|date=1 June 2019}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of new-generation players such as [[Taylor Adams]], [[Adam Treloar]] and [[Jordan De Goey]], alongside key talls [[Brodie Grundy]] and [[Mason Cox]] mixed well with veterans Pendlebury and [[Steele Sidebottom]].

The all white jumper, with the three black vertical stripes is the iconic strip that the club is most associated with.  The current incarnation of the guernsey is mostly black, with white stripes on the front and lower half of the back, and white numbers. The main clash guernsey is the reverse of this: mostly white, with black stripes and black numbers, worn in away matches against clubs with a predominantly dark guernsey such as [[Fremantle|Fremantle Football Club]] and [[Port Adelaide|Port Adelaide Football Club]]. A secondary clash guernsey was introduced in 2011 and is used only in matches against {{AFL Nor}} due to similarity between the two uniforms. The alternate uniform is black with only two white stripes on each side instead of three.\n\nTraditionally, Collingwood has worn a white guernsey with black stripes.

In Round 8 2002 Collingwood beat Brisbane by three points in a tense match in front of 46,279 people at [[Colonial Stadium]]. This victory over the reigning premier took the Magpies to equal top of the league table (2nd on percentage) with Brisbane. The rivalry grew with the 2002 Grand Final when Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points. The rivalry grew again in 2003 when the two clubs clashed on four occasions. The Lions defeated the Magpies at [[The Gabba]] in Round 4 before thrashing them in Heritage Round \u2013 Round 19 at the MCG. Collingwood then defeated Brisbane in the Qualifying Final with [[Alan Didak]] ensuring victory late in the final quarter, with two goals from the boundary line.

This included the 1958 Grand Final where Collingwood's victory prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record of four premierships in succession (1927\u20131930). The old rivalry with [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] has faded in recent decades due to Melbourne not enjoying the same level of on-field success, however, it remains strong and is an annual scheduled fixture on the Queens Birthday public holiday.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Essendon]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Essendon v Collingwood|Collingwood's rivalry with Essendon]] has become more significant since 1995, when the first [[Anzac Day clash|ANZAC Day clash]] took place. After the 2019 match, Collingwood have won this contest 15 times and Essendon 9 times, with the first match being drawn.\n\n==== [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] ====\nThe rivalry with [[Port Adelaide FC|Port Adelaide]] stems from them being known as the Magpies in their local [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] competition before switching to the Power when entering the League in 1997. Feelings were heightened when Port midfielder [[Kane Cornes]] 'flipped the bird' at [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] following the Power's five-point victory over the Magpies at [[AAMI Stadium]] in Round 9, 2002, only moments after [[Anthony Rocca]] had missed the opportunity to tie the scores. [[Jarrod Molloy]] and [[Brodie Holland]] remonstrated with Cornes after the match, with a feeling of hostility lingering after the two sides had left the field. Collingwood unexpectedly beat the Power in the Qualifying Final that season, also at AAMI stadium. Collingwood again defeated Port Adelaide in the 2003 Preliminary Final at the MCG. This added to the 'choking' phenomenon directed at the Power. The off-field battle over Port's desire to wear its black and white \"prison bar\" guernsey has been a major talking point, especially between 2002 and 2007, which added to the rivalry. A resolution was reached in favour of Collingwood.\n\n==== [[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Geelong]] ====\n[[AFL team rivalries#Collingwood v Geelong|Games between Collingwood and Geelong]] have become highly anticipated since 2007. In Round 15 Geelong beat Collingwood by 16 points in a high-quality match. In the Preliminary final Collingwood surprised many when they came within 5 points of the eventual premiers. In 2008 Collingwood thrashed Geelong by 86 points\u201420.14 (134)- 7.6 (48) causing Geelong's only loss of the year. In 2009, the sides again met in the preliminary final, but despite high hopes the Cats, who would again win the premiership, won by 73 points in front of another massive crowd of 87,258.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lovett|2010|p=92}}</ref> In 2010, the two sides emerged as the favourites for the flag and twice met in front of blockbuster crowds at the MCG when they were placed 1st and 2nd on the ladder\u2014with the results evenly split. They again met in a Preliminary final, this time a resounding win to Collingwood by 41 points. In 2011, both teams were undefeated going into their round eight 'blockbuster' at the 'G. Geelong won by three points, after a controversial advantage was not paid to Magpie Scott Pendlebury in the dying minutes. Pendlebury kicked a goal and would have put the Pies in front, but the free kick was contentiously called back and Geelong managed to whisk the ball away. In the round 24 match, Geelong thumped the Magpies by a record margin of 96 points, which was also Collingwood's biggest ever loss at the MCG. The 2011 Grand Final against the Cats concluded with a 38-point loss for the Pies.\n\n===Supporters===\n[[File:Magpie mascot.jpg|thumb|200px|Collingwood Magpies mascot]]\nCollingwood is a working-class suburb and the Collingwood Football Club supporter base traditionally came from the working class (though its supporter base today goes far beyond). Many of the club's supporters who regularly attend games still come from the working class or from lower socio-economic groups, leading to jokes from supporters of other clubs which typically stereotype their Collingwood counterparts as poor, crude and ignorant.<ref>{{cite web|last=Humphrys|first=Elizabeth|title=Beyond a joke: Bogan loathing bring us all to shame|url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|work=The Drum|publisher=ABC|accessdate=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003204636/http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/3571876.html|archive-date=3 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCollingwood is traditionally reviled by non-Collingwood supporters (\"You either love 'em or you hate 'em\"). The dislike of the club by outsiders is said to have originated during the 1920s and 1930s, a period of great success for the club which drew the envy and resentment of other clubs. In this period, Collingwood was also perceived as a Catholic and Irish club, at a time when these groups were looked down upon by the rest of Australian society and subjected to a considerable degree of social exclusion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cordy|first=Neil|title=AFL AFL DEPARTMENT OF TRADE NAB CUP SHOWS VIDEO GWS Giants supporters are about to learn why footy fans love to hate Collingwood, writes Neil Cordy|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/gws-giants-supporters-are-about-to-learn-why-footy-fans-love-to-hate-collingwood-writes-neil-cordy/story-e6frf3e3-1226436342075}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sapienza|first=Joseph|title=Everybody hates Collingwood ... but why?|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/everybody-hates-collingwood--but-why-20100921-15l4l.html|work=The Age|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nUntil recent years, racial vilification of opposition players in VFL/AFL games was not uncommon.

Collingwood.\n\n===Off field===\nCollingwood was one of the last clubs to abandon its traditional stadium, the famous inner-city [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]]. Collingwood now plays home games at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. It now also has its headquarters situated in the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Center|former Glasshouse Entertainment Centre]]. Due to a sponsorship deal, this facility is known as 'The Holden Centre'.\n\nCollingwood continues to be financially viable through the loyal support of its huge following and numerous sponsors. After finishing 2nd in 2002 and 2003 the team fell to 13th and 15th (out of 16) in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This trend has plagued the club since the glory days of pre-World War II VFL football. Since 1958, the club has won only two VFL/AFL Premiership (the inaugural AFL Premiership in 1990, and in 2010). Despite this, the club still has won more individual games, more finals and made more grand final appearances than any other club.\n\nOn 9 March 2007, former Collingwood and Fitzroy defender [[Gary Pert]] was appointed the Magpies' CEO, seven weeks after Greg Swann departed for Carlton. In accepting the key Magpie post, Pert quit as a club director and as managing director of Channel 9 in Melbourne. In a press conference, it was stated that Collingwood has budgeted to turn over about $50&nbsp;million this year. McGuire hopes the new administration will soon double that figure. \"A finance administration review has come up with how we are going to turn Collingwood in to its next phase of its life\", McGuire said. \"What do we do to make ourselves go from a $45&nbsp;million a year turnover business to a $100&nbsp;million turnover business? \"They sound like big figures but in 1999 we turned over $13&nbsp;million, so that is where we are heading as a football club.\"\n\nThe club made an operating profit of $5.23 million for the 2013 season, revenue increased from $2.6 million to more than $75 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|title=Collingwood AFL&nbsp;club builds build TV studio for digital marketing expansion|date=8 January 2014|access-date=17 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223834/http://www.brw.com.au/p/marketing/collingwood_afl_club_builds_build_wIkGxHPlYSn6K0EX6MJTgK|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July 2017, Pert resigned from his position as CEO of the club, with Peter Murphy replacing him as an interim CEO.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/collingwood-chief-executive-gary-pert-resigns-20170724-gxhbu4.html|title=Collingwood chief executive Gary Pert resigns|first=Jon|last=Pierik|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=24 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe Collingwood guernsey is the most valuable sports sponsorship in Australia.<ref name=\"Magpies guernsey most valuable\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/afls-success-in-black-and-white-20110308-1bmk6.html |title=Magpies guernsey most valuable |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> Collingwood has different guernsey sponsors for home and away matches, generating an estimated $6.3&nbsp;million worth of media exposure for the primary sponsor and $5.7&nbsp;million for the secondary sponsor.

When he was five years old, he was raped by an older boy.<ref name=\"Intelligencer\"/> He and his family moved to Texas where he joined the [[Eastvale, Texas]], police department, rapidly being promoted to chief.
