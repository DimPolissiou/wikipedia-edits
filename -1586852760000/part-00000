Among 37 variables, growth is mentioned as one of the most important variables for success: market share, market growth, marketing expense to sales ratio<ref name=\"Lancaster2001\" /> or a strong market position.<ref name=\"Dibb2005\" /> \n\nThe question how much growth is sustainable is answered by two concepts with different perspectives:\n\n* The '''sustainable growth rate''' ('''SGR''') concept by Robert C. Higgins, describes optimal growth from a financial perspective assuming a given strategy with clear defined financial frame conditions/ limitations. Sustainable growth is defined as the annual percentage of increase in sales that is consistent with a defined financial policy (target debt to equity ratio, target [[dividend payout ratio]], target [[profit margin]], target ratio of [[total assets]] to [[net sales]]). This concept provides a comprehensive financial framework and formula for case/ company specific SGR calculations.<ref name=\"Higgins1977\" />\n* The '''optimal growth''' concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes L\u00f6sch, Bj\u00f6rn Heyden et al. assesses sustainable growth from a total shareholder return creation and profitability perspective\u2014independent of a given strategy, business model and/ or financial frame condition. This concept is based on statistical long-term assessments and is enriched by case examples. It provides an orientation frame for case/ company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting.<ref name=\"Boernsen2011\" />\n\n==From a financial perspective==\n{{seealso|Stock valuation#Growth rate|Earnings growth|Growth stock|PEG ratio}}\n\nThe sustainable growth rate is the growth rate in profits that a company can reasonably achieve, consistent with its established [[financial policy]]. \nAn assumption re the company's sustainable growth rate is a required input to several valuation models\u2014for instance the [[Gordon model]] and other [[discounted cash flow]] models\u2014where this is used in the calculation of continuing or [[terminal value (finance)|terminal value]]; see [[Valuation using discounted cash flows]].  \n\nSeveral formulae are available here.<ref>See for example, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=256987 Valuing Companies by Cash Flow Discounting: Ten Methods and Nine Theories], Pablo Fernandez: University of Navarra - IESE Business School</ref> \nIn general, these link long term profitability targets, [[dividend policy]], and [[capital structure]] assumptions, returning the sustainable, long-run business growth-rate attainable as a function of these. These formulae reflect the general requirement that all assumptions are internally consistent; see {{sectionlink|Financial modeling#Accounting}}.\n\nA check on the formula inputs, and on the resultant growth number, is provided by a respective twofold economic argument. \nThe [[microeconomic]] argument: Where the ([[Risk-adjusted return on capital|risk adjusted]]) [[Return on capital]] is significantly higher than achievable in other industries, then this success will attract [[Competition (economics)|competition]]; in the long-run then, the company's returns will tend to those of its industry, in turn tending to the economy; see [[Profit (economics)]]. Formulae inputs - i.e. assumed profit as compared to targeted capital structure -  must be limited correspondingly.\nThe [[macroeconomic]] check: The long-run growth of the company (industry) cannot exceed overall [[economic growth]] by any significant amount - otherwise the company in question would eventually constitute the bulk of the economy; see {{sectionlink|Earnings growth#Relationship with GDP growth}}.  A calculated growth rate, where the given assumptions are input to a growth formula, can then also act a check as to whether [[budget]]s or [[business plan]]s are reasonable.\n\nThe sustainable growth rate may be returned via the following formula: <ref>Chapter 4 in {{cite book | author= Robert C.

Due to this long time period, the authors consider their findings as to a large extent independent of specific economic cycles.<ref name=\"Boernsen2011\" />\n\n===Relationship between revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability===\nIn the long-term and across industries, total shareholder value creation (stock price development plus dividend payments) rises steadily with increasing revenue growth rates. The more long-term revenue growth companies realize, the more investors appreciate this and the more they get rewarded.\n\n[[File:Graf1 revenue.JPG]]\n\n[[Return on assets]] (ROA), [[return on sales]] (ROS) and [[return on equity]] (ROE) do rise with increasing revenue growth up to 10 to 25% and then fall with further increasing revenue growth rates.\n\n[[File:Graf2 profitability.JPG]]\n\nAlso the combined ROX-index (average of ROA, ROS and ROE) shows rises with increasing growth rates to a broad maximum in the range of 10 to 25% revenue growth per year and falls towards higher growth rates. \n\n[[File:Graf3 rox.JPG]]\n\nThe authors attribute the continuous profitability increase towards the maximum of two effects:\n\n# '''Profitability drives growth: ''' Companies with substantial profitability have the opportunity to invest more in additional growth.\n# '''Growth drives profitability: ''' Substantial growth may be a driver for additional profitability, e.g. by higher attractiveness for high performing young professionals, higher employee motivation, higher attractiveness for business partners as well as higher self-confidence.\n\nBeyond the profitability maximum extra efforts to handle additional growth \u2013 e.g. based on integrating new staff in large dimensions and handling culture and quality - do rise sharply and reduce overall profitability. \n\nThe combination of the patterns of revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability indicates three growth zones:\n\n[[File:Graf4 zones of growth.JPG]]\n\n* '''Low Return: ''' Low profitability and low value generation below 10% per year\n* '''Long-term Sweet-Spot: ''' Solid value generation and highest on average profitability in the revenue growth interval from 10% to 25% per year\n* '''High Speed: ''' Even higher total shareholder value generation however in combination with lower profitability beyond 25% per year\n\nGrowth rates of the assessed companies are widely independent of initial company size/ market share which is in alignment with [[Gibrat's law]].  Gibrat's law, sometimes called Gibrat's rule of proportionate growth is a rule defined by [[Robert Gibrat]] (1904\u20131980) stating that the size of a firm and its growth rate are independent.\nIndependent of industry consolidation and industry growth rate, companies in many industries with growth rates in the range of 10 to 25% revenue growth p.a. have both, higher total shareholder value generation as well as profitability than their slower growing peers.\n\n===Base strategies and growth moves===\nThese findings do suggest two base strategies for companies:\n\n* For companies (e.g. in established markets like central Europe and USA) with low single digit growth rates: Consider acceleration of growth given the fact that TSR and profitability are higher in the sweet-spot\n* For companies (e.g. in fast growing regional markets like China with India and/ or rapidly growing industry segments) with growth rates beyond 25%: Consider best ways to \u201cdigest\u201d/ and to stabilize  rapid growth and ensure a \u201csoft landing\u201d should market growth come to a sudden stop.\n\n===How to achieve long-term growth in the sweet-spot and beyond===\nThe authors have identified a set of preconditions and levers to achieve long-term growth in their defined sweet-spot and beyond:\n\n====Preconditions====\n* Generating a common understanding regarding growth and profit ambitions among the management team as a prerequisite for aligned and coordinated strategy development and implementation\n* Understanding relevant markets (current or future promising markets). Generating market foresight when identifying and assessing growth initiatives, e.g.  [[megatrends]] and [[scenario analyses]], segment specific [[benchmarking]] and in depth assessments, market demand projections\n\n====Levers and strategy====\n* Applying formulas for rapid growth, e.g. maxing out the number of relevant customers, maxing out the share of wallet and lifecycle potentials, continuous innovation, killer offerings, network based growth, M&A/buy-and-build driven growth, franchising proven business concepts, pyramid-like network expansion and managing value networks\n* Defining the growth strategy as a portfolio of best suited growth initiatives considering a multidimensional set of criteria, e.g. ease of implementation, growth and profit impact, expected risk vs. return, [[cash flow]] stability\n* Making growth happen: Strategy and corresponding culture must be addressed in a consistent way, e.g. [[change management|creating the case for growth]], clearly defining and communicating vision and strategy as well as actively developing and energizing the organization.<ref name=\"Boernsen2011\" />\n\n==Criticism==\nAs described the sustainable growth rate (SGR) concept by Robert C. Higgins is based on several assumptions such as constant [[profit margin]], constant [[debt to equity ratio]] or constant asset to sales ratio. Therefore, general applicability of SGR concept in cases where these parameters are not stable is limited.\n\nThe Optimal Growth concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes L\u00f6sch, Bj\u00f6rn Heyden et al.  has no restrictions to certain strategies or business model and is therefore more flexible in its applicability. However, as a broad framework, it only provides an orientation for case/company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting.  Additional company and market specific considerations, e.g. market growth, growth culture, appetite for change, are required to come up with the optimal growth rate of a specific company. \n\nAdditionally, considering the increasing criticism of excessive growth and shareholder value orientation by philosophers, economists and also managers, e.g. [[St\u00e9phane Hessel]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Jack Welch]] (nowadays), one might expect that investors' investment criteria might also change in the future. This may lead to changes in the relationship of revenue growth rates and total shareholder value creation. Regular reviews of the optimal growth assessments may be used as an indicator for the development of stock markets` appetite for rapid growth.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Dibb2005\">Dibb, Sally; Simkin, Lyndon; Pride, William (2005): Marketing.Concepts and Strategies, 5th edition, Houghton Mifflin, p. 676</ref>\n<ref name=\"Higgins1977\">Higgins, Robert (1977): How much growth can a firm afford, Financial Management 6 (3) p. 7-16</ref>\n<ref name=\"Lancaster2001\">Lancaster, Geoff; Massingham, Lester; Ashford, Ruth (2001): Essentials of Marketing: Text and Cases, Mcgraw-Hill Higher Education, p. 535</ref>\n<ref name=\"Boernsen2011\">B\u00f6rnsen, Arne; K\u00f6rner, Florian (2011):  Optimal Growth, Conceptualization of a strategy to benefit from Optimal Growth, Mannheim Business School</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fonseka, Mohan; Tian, Gaoloang (2011): The most appropriate Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Model for Managers and Researchers, American Accounting Association\n* Graeme, Deans; Kroeger, Fritz (2004): ''Stretch!: How Great Companies Grow in Good Times and Bad'', John Wiley & Sons\n* Handschuh, Martin (2011): What we can learn from self-made billionaires?, WHU Otto Beisheim School of Management lecture\n* Handschuh, Martin; L\u00f6sch, Hannes (2011): Optimal Growth \u2013 Does it exist and if so how to realize it?, Mannheim Business School lecture\n* Handschuh, Martin; Reinartz, Sebastian; Heyden, Bj\u00f6rn (2011): Megafusionen als Lehrbuch, M&A Review 05/2011\n* Higgins, Robert (1981): Sustainable growth under inflation, Financial Management 10 (4) p.&nbsp;36-40\n* Jonk, Gillis (2006): Resources for Growth, published in: executive agenda, ideas and insights for business leaders, volume IX, Number 1, 2006, A.T.

In a wider sense, the term is used to refer to a variety of Spanish musical styles. The oldest record of flamenco music dates to 1774 in the book ''Las Cartas Marruecas'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] {{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=240\u2013241}}. Flamenco has been influenced by and associated with the [[Romani people in Spain]]; however, its origin and style are uniquely Andalusian {{harv|Hayes|2009|loc=31\u201337}}.\n\nManuel R\u00edos Ruiz notes that the development of flamenco is well documented: \"the theatre movement of [[sainete]]s (one-act plays) and [[tonadilla]]s, popular song books and song sheets, customs, studies of dances, and ''toques'', perfection, newspapers, graphic documents in paintings and engravings....in continuous evolution together with rhythm, the poetic stanzas, and the ambiance\" {{harv|R\u00edos Ruiz|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2019}}}}.\n\nNevertheless, the exact origin of flamenco is unknown and the subject of many hypotheses. The most widespread is that flamenco was developed through the cross-cultural interchange between moriscos and gitanos (Romani people of Spain) during the sixteenth century specifically in East Andalusia {{harv|Machin-Autenrieth|2015|loc=29}}; the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola]]'' (Dictionary of the Spanish Language) primarily attributes the creation of the style directly to the [[Spanish Romani]] {{harv|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|2019|loc=sense 4}}.\n\nFlamenco has become popular all over the world, especially the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. In Japan, there are more flamenco academies than there are in Spain {{harv|Mendoza|2011|loc=52}}. \"In El Salvador the group Alma Flamenca is considered the maximum representative and pioneer of this musical movement\" {{harv|Mendoza|2011|loc=52}}.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, [[UNESCO]] declared flamenco one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] {{harv|Anon.|2010}}.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are many suggestions for the origin of the word ''flamenco'' as a musical term, but no solid evidence for any of them. The word is Spanish for \"Flemish\" (meaning \"native of [[Flanders]]\", a one-time Spanish possession) {{harv|Harper|n.d.}}. The Spanish verb ''flamear'' means ''to flamb\u00e9''. The word was not recorded as a musical and dance term until the late 18th century, in the book ''Las Cartas Marruecas'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] (1774) {{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=240\u2013241}}.\n\nOne theory, proposed by Andalusian historian [[Blas Infante]], is that the word is derived from the Hispano-[[Arabic language|Arabic]] term ''[[Fellah|fellah mengu]]'', meaning \"expelled peasant\", referring to the Andalusians of [[Islamic]] faith and the remaining [[Moriscos]] who fled with the [[Romani people|Roma]] newcomers ({{harvnb|Infante|2010|loc=166}}; {{harvnb|Herrera|2006}}).\n\nAnother theory is that the Spanish word ''[[wikt:flamenco#Spanish|flamenco]]'' is a derivative of the Spanish word, meaning \"[[fire]]\" or \"flame\".  The word ''flamenco'' may have been used for fiery behaviour, which could have come to be applied to the [[Romani people in Spain|Gitano]] players and performers {{harv|Ruiz|2007|loc=165ff}}.\n\n== ''Palos'' ==\n{{Main|Palo (flamenco)}}\n[[File:Palos flamencos.jpg|thumb|The ''Palos'' of Flamenco]]\n''[[Palo (flamenco)|Palos]]'' (formerly known as ''cantes'') are flamenco styles, classified by criteria such as rhythmic pattern, [[Musical mode|mode]], [[chord progression]], [[stanza]]ic form and geographic origin. There are over 50 different ''palos'', some are sung unaccompanied while others have guitar or other accompaniment. Some forms are danced while others are not. Some are reserved for men and others for women while some may be performed by either, though these traditional distinctions are breaking down: the ''Farruca'', for example, once a male dance, is now commonly performed by women too.\n\nThere are many ways to categorize ''Palos'' but they traditionally fall into three classes: the most serious is known as ''[[cante jondo]]'' (or ''[[Cante flamenco#Cante Grande (also known as cante jondo)|cante grande]]''), while lighter, frivolous forms are called ''[[Cante Chico|cante chico]]''. Forms that do not fit either category are classed as ''[[Cante Intermedio|cante intermedio]]'' {{harv|Pohren|2005|loc=68}}. These are the best known ''palos'' ({{harvnb|Anon.|2019}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2012}}):\n\n* [[Alegr\u00edas]]\n* [[Buler\u00edas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1 por Buler\u00edas|Buler\u00edas por sole\u00e1 (sole\u00e1 por buler\u00edas)]]\n* Caracoles\n* [[Cartageneras]]\n* [[Fandango]]\n* Fandango de Huelva\n* Fandango Malague\u00f1o\n* [[Farruca]]\n* [[Grana\u00edna]]s\n* [[Guajiras (Flamenco)|Guajiras]]\n* [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|Malague\u00f1as]]\n* Martinete\n* Mineras\n* Nanas\n* [[Peteneras]]\n* Ronde\u00f1as\n* [[Saeta (flamenco)|Saeta]]\n* [[Siguiriyas|Seguiriyas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1]]\n* [[Tango (flamenco)|Tangos]]\n* Tanguillos\n* Tarantos\n* [[Tientos (Flamenco)|Tientos]]\n* Villancicos\n\n== Music ==\n{{Quote|There are three fundamental elements which can help define whether or not something really is flameco: A flamenco mode -or musical tonality-; the ''comp\u00e1s'' -rhythm- and the performer...who should be a Flamenco! All three of these elements: tonality, ''comp\u00e1s'', a flamenco performer and then something less easily identifiable- ''Flamencura''- must be present together if we are to wend up with a piece of music which can be labelled 'flamenco'. By themselves, these elements won't turn a piece of music into flamenco.|{{harv|Martinez|2011|loc=6}}}}\n{{Quote|Three fundamental elements that help define whether or not a dance belongs to the Flamenco genre are the presence of a Flamenco mode (musical tonality), ''compas'', and a Flamenco performer (Martinez, 2003). These three elements contribute to the authenticity of a Flamenco performance also known as ''flamencura'' (Martinez, 2003). There is also no such thing as a passive audience during Flamenco performances {{bracket|[[participatory art|participatory music]]}}. The audience joins in the performance by clapping their hands and even sometimes singing along (Totton, 2003).|{{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=243}}}}\n\n=== Structure ===\nA typical flamenco recital with voice and guitar accompaniment comprises a series of pieces (not exactly \"songs\") in different palos. Each song is a set of verses (called ''copla'', ''tercio'', or ''letras''), punctuated by guitar interludes (''[[falseta]]s''). The guitarist also provides a short introduction setting the tonality, ''comp\u00e1s'' (see below) and tempo of the cante {{harv|Manuel|2006|loc=98}}. In some palos, these falsetas are played with a specific structure too; for example, the typical [[sevillanas]] is played in an AAB pattern, where A and B are the same falseta with only a slight difference in the ending {{harv|Martin|2002|loc=48}}.\n\n=== Harmony ===\nFlamenco uses the [[Flamenco mode]] (which can also be described as the [[Phrygian mode#Modern Phrygian mode|modern Phrygian mode]] (''modo frigio''), or a harmonic version of that scale with a major 3rd [[degree (music)|degree]]), in addition to the [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] scales commonly used in modern Western music. The Phrygian mode occurs in ''palos'' such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], most [[buler\u00edas]], [[siguiriya]]s, [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]] and [[tientos]].\n[[File:E Phrygian Scale.PNG|frame|left|Descending E Phrygian scale in flamenco music, with common alterations in parentheses]]\n\nA typical [[chord sequence]], usually called the \"[[Andalusian cadence]]\" may be viewed as in a modified Phrygian: in E the sequence is '''Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013E''' {{harv|Manuel|2006|loc=96}}. According to [[Manolo Sanl\u00facar]] '''E''' is here the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], '''F''' has the [[diatonic function|harmonic function]] of [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] while '''Am''' and '''G''' assume the functions of [[subdominant]] and [[mediant]] respectively {{harv|Torres Cort\u00e9s|2001}}.\n\nGuitarists tend to use only two basic inversions or \"chord shapes\" for the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] [[chord (music)]], the open 1st inversion '''E''' and the open 3rd inversion '''A''', though they often [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] these by using a [[capo]]. Modern guitarists such as [[Ram\u00f3n Montoya]], have introduced other positions: Montoya himself started to use other chords for the tonic in the [[Dorian mode|modern Dorian]] sections of several ''palos''; '''F{{music|sharp}}''' for ''[[Tarantella|tarantas]]'', '''B''' for ''[[grana\u00edna]]s'' and '''A{{music|flat}}''' for the ''minera''. Montoya also created a new ''palo'' as a solo for guitar, the ''[[ronde\u00f1a]]'' in '''C{{music|sharp}}''' with ''[[scordatura]]''. Later guitarists have further extended the repertoire of [[tonality|tonalities]], chord positions and ''scordatura''.\n\nThere are also ''palos'' in major mode; most [[canti\u00f1as]] and [[alegr\u00edas]], [[guajiras]], some ''[[buler\u00edas]]'' and ''[[ton\u00e1s]]'', and the ''cabales'' (a major type of ''[[siguiriyas]]''). The minor mode is restricted to the ''[[Farruca]]'', the ''milongas'' (among ''[[cantes de ida y vuelta]]''), and some styles of ''tangos, buler\u00edas'', etc. In general traditional palos in major and minor mode are limited harmonically to two-chord (tonic\u2013dominant) or three-chord (tonic\u2013subdominant\u2013dominant) progressions {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=92}}. However modern guitarists have introduced [[chord substitution]], transition chords, and even [[modulation (music)|modulation]].\n\n''[[Fandangos]]'' and derivative ''palos'' such as ''[[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]]'', ''tarantas'' and ''[[cartageneras]] are bimodal'': guitar introductions are in Phrygian mode while the singing develops in major mode, modulating to Phrygian at the end of the stanza {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=92}}.\n\n=== Melody ===\nDionisio Preciado, quoted by Sabas de {{harvtxt|Hoces|1982|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2019}}}}, established the following characteristics for the melodies of flamenco singing:\n\n#[[Microtonality]]: presence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] smaller than the [[semitone]].\n#[[Portamento]]: frequently, the change from one note to another is done in a smooth transition, rather than using discrete intervals.\n#Short [[tessitura]] or [[range (music)|range]]: Most traditional flamenco songs are limited to a range of a sixth (four tones and a half). The impression of vocal effort is the result of using different [[timbre]]s, and variety is accomplished by the use of microtones.\n#Use of [[enharmonic scale]]. While in [[equal temperament]] scales, [[enharmonic]]s are notes with identical pitch but different spellings (e.g. A\u266d and G\u266f); in flamenco, as in [[Equal temperament|unequal temperament]] scales, there is a microtonal intervalic difference between enharmonic notes.\n#Insistence on a note and its contiguous chromatic notes (also frequent in the guitar), producing a sense of urgency.\n#Baroque [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], with an expressive, rather than merely aesthetic function.\n#Apparent lack of regular rhythm, especially in the [[siguiriyas]]: the melodic rhythm of the sung line is different from the metric rhythm of the accompaniment.\n#Most styles express sad and bitter feelings.\n#Melodic [[improvisation]]: flamenco singing is not, strictly speaking, improvised, but based on a relatively small number of traditional songs, singers add variations on the spur of the moment.\n\nMusicologist Hip\u00f3lito Rossy adds the following characteristics {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=97}}:\n\n*Flamenco melodies are characterized by a descending tendency, as opposed to, for example, a typical opera [[aria]], they usually go from the higher pitches to the lower ones, and from [[Dynamics (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|piano]], as was usual in ancient Greek scales.\n*In many styles, such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]] or [[siguiriya]], the melody tends to proceed in contiguous [[degree (music)|degrees]] of the scale. [[Steps and skips|Skips]] of a third or a fourth are rarer. However, in [[fandangos]] and fandango-derived styles, fourths and sixths can often be found, especially at the beginning of each line of verse. According to Rossy, this is proof of the more recent creation of this type of songs, influenced by Castilian [[jota (music)|jota]].\n\n=== Comp\u00e1s ===\n'''Comp\u00e1s''' is the Spanish word for [[metre (music)|metre]] or [[time signature]] (in classical [[music theory]]). It also refers to the rhythmic cycle, or layout, of a ''palo''.\n\nThe comp\u00e1s is fundamental to flamenco. Comp\u00e1s is most often translated as [[rhythm]] but it demands far more precise interpretation than any other Western style of music. If there is no guitarist available, the comp\u00e1s is rendered through hand clapping (''palmas'') or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (''rasgueado'') or tapping the [[sound board (music)|soundboard]] (''golpe''). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.\n\nFlamenco uses three basic counts or measures: Binary, Ternary and a form of a twelve-beat cycle that is unique to flamenco. There are also free-form styles including, among others, the [[ton\u00e1s]], [[Saeta (flamenco)|saetas]], [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]], tarantos, and some types of [[fandangos]].\n\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}. These metres are used in forms like [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]], [[tientos]], [[Flamenco Rumba|gypsy rumba]], [[zambra]] and tanguillos.\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|3|4}}. These are typical of [[fandangos]] and [[sevillanas]], suggesting their origin as non-Roma styles, since the {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|4|4}} measures are not common in ethnic Roma music.\n*12-beat rhythms usually rendered in amalgams of {{music|time|6|8}} + {{music|time|3|4}} and sometimes {{music|time|12|8}}. The 12-beat cycle is the most common in flamenco, differentiated by the accentuation of the beats in different palos. The accents do not correspond to the classic concept of the downbeat. The alternating of groups of 2 and 3 beats is also common in Spanish folk dances of the 16th Century such as the ''zarabanda'', ''j\u00e1cara'' and ''canarios''.\n\nThere are three types of 12-beat rhythms, which vary in their layouts, or use of accentuations: sole\u00e1, seguiriya and buler\u00eda.\n\n#[[peteneras]] and [[guajiras]]: 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. Both palos start with the strong accent on 12. Hence the meter is  '''12''' 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11...\n#The [[seguiriya]], liviana<!-- liviana links to a page about a genus of moths-->, [[Palo (flamenco)|serrana]], ton\u00e1 liviana, cabales: '''12'''1 '''2''' 3 '''4''' 5 6 '''7''' 8 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''.\n#[[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], within the [[canti\u00f1as]] group of palos which includes the [[alegr\u00edas]], canti\u00f1as, mirabras, romera, caracoles and sole\u00e1 por buler\u00eda (also \"[[Buler\u00edas|buler\u00eda por sole\u00e1]]\"): 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. For practical reasons, when transferring flamenco guitar music to sheet music, this rhythm is written as a regular {{music|time|3|4}}.\n\nThe [[Buler\u00edas]] is the emblematic palo of flamenco: today its 12-beat cycle is most often played with accents on the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th beats. The accompanying ''palmas'' are played in groups of 6 beats, giving rise to a multitude of counter-rhythms and percussive voices within the 12 beat comp\u00e1s.  In certain regions like, Xerez, Spain, the rhythm stays in a simpler six-count rhythm, only including the twelve count in a musical resolve.{{Clarify|date=October 2019|reason=What is a \"musical resolve\"?}}\n\n[[File:Flamenco Compas.theora.ogv|thumb|400 px|none|Flamenco [[Buler\u00edas]] with emphasis as '''[12]''' 1 2 '''[3]''' 4 5 '''[6]''' 7 '''[8]''' 9 '''[10]''' 11 \u2013 also the rhythm for the song [[America (West Side Story song)|''America'' from the ''West Side Story'']]]]\n\n== Forms of flamenco expression ==\n\n=== Toque (guitar) ===\n\n{{Main|Flamenco guitar}}\n\n[[File:Paco de lucia 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Paco de Luc\u00eda]], one of the most commercially successful exponents of flamenco {{harv|Koster|2002|loc=5}}]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the flamenco guitar is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[Flamenco guitar]].\n\n=== Cante (song) ===\n{{Main|Cante flamenco}}\n\n[[File:Flamenco 001.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Flamenco performance by the La Primavera group]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the cante is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[cante flamenco]].\n\n=== Baile (dance) ===\n\n''El baile flamenco'' is known for its emotional intensity, proud carriage, expressive use of the arms and rhythmic stamping of the feet, unlike [[tap dance]] or [[Irish dance]] which use different techniques. As with any dance form, many different styles of flamenco have developed.\n\nIn the twentieth century, flamenco danced informally at gitano (Roma) celebrations in Spain was considered the most \"authentic\" form of flamenco. There was less virtuoso technique in gitano flamenco, but the music and steps are fundamentally the same. The arms are noticeably different from classical flamenco, curving around the head and body rather than extending, often with a bent elbow.\n[[File:Tablao Cordob\u00e9s 06.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Flamenco, C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\"Flamenco puro\" otherwise known as \u201cflamenco por derecho\u201d is considered the form of performance flamenco closest to its gitano influences. In this style, the dance is often performed solo, and is based on signals and calls of structural improvisation rather than choreographed. In the improvisational style, castanets are not often used.\n\n\"Classical flamenco\" is the style most frequently performed by Spanish flamenco dance companies. It is danced largely in a proud and upright style. For women, the back is often held in a marked back bend. Unlike the more gitano influenced styles, there is little movement of the hips, the body is tightly held and the arms are long, like a [[ballet]] dancer. In fact many of the dancers in these companies are trained in Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol more than in the improvisational language of flamenco. Flamenco has both influenced and been influenced by Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol, as evidenced by the fusion of the two ballets created by 'La Argentinita' in the early part of the twentieth century and later, by [[Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]], eventually by the entire Ballet Nacional de Espa\u00f1a et al.\n\nIn the 1950s [[Jose Greco]] was one of the most famous male Flamenco dancers, performing on stage worldwide and on television including the [[Ed Sullivan Show]], and reviving the art almost singlehandedly.  Greco's company left a handful of prominent pioneers, most notably: Maria Benitez and Vicente Romero of New Mexico.  Today, there are many centers of Flamenco art.  Albuquerque, New Mexico is considered the \u201cCenter of the Nation\u201d for Flamenco Art. Much of this is due to Maria Benitez's 37 years of sold-out summer seasons. Albuquerque boasts three distinct prominent centers: National Institute of Flamenco, Casa Flamenca and Flamenco Works. Each center dedicates time to daily training, cultural diffusion and world-class performance equaled only to world-class performances one would find in the heart of Southern Spain, Andaluc\u00eda.\n\nModern flamenco is a highly technical dance style requiring years of study. The emphasis for both male and female performers is on lightning-fast footwork performed with absolute precision. In addition, the dancer may have to dance while using props such as castanets, canes, shawls and fans.\n\n\"[[New Flamenco|Flamenco nuevo]]\" is a recent marketing phenomenon in Flamenco. Marketed as a \u201cnewer version\u201d of Flamenco, its roots came from world-music promoters trying to sell albums of artists who created music that \u201csounded like\u201d or had Spanish-style influences.  Though some of this music was played in similar pitches, scales and was well-received, it has little to nothing to do with the Art of Flamenco guitar, dance, cante Jondo or the improvisational language.  \u201cNuevo Flamenco\u201d consists largely of compositions and repertoire, while Traditional Flamenco music and dance is a language composed of stanzas, actuated by oral formulaic calls and signals.\n\n[[File:Deborah Greenfield.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Los Angeles, United States]]\nThe flamenco most foreigners are familiar with is a style that was developed as a spectacle for tourists. To add variety, group dances are included and even solos are more likely to be choreographed. The frilly, voluminous spotted dresses are derived from a style of dress worn for the [[Sevillanas]] at the annual [[Seville Fair|Feria]] in [[Seville]].\n\nIn traditional flamenco, only the very young or older dancers are considered to have the emotional innocence or maturity to adequately convey the ''[[Duende (art)|duende]]'' (soul) of the genre {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional through techniques early on to take advantage of youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond.  One artist that is considered a young master is Juan Manuel Fernandez Montoya, otherwise known as \u201cFarruquito.\u201d  At age 12, Farruquito was considered a pioneer and for \u201cFlamenco Puro,\u201d or \u201cFlamenco por Derecho,\u201d because of his emotional depth.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Castelucho.jpg|[[Claudio Castelucho]], Flamenco\nFile:Theatre Flamenco Work Sample.webm|Theatre Flamenco Work Sample\nFile:Baile andaluz 1893 Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero]], Baile Andaluz\nFile:Sargent John Singer Spanish Dancer.jpg|[[John Singer Sargent]], Spanish Dancer\n</gallery>\n\n;Scenes of flamenco performance in Seville.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 07.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 11.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 20.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 23.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Latin music|Music}}\n{{columns-list|\n*[[Andalusian Centre of Flamenco]] \u2013 an institution in Spain founded in 1993 to safeguard and promote the values and standards of flamenco\n*[[Concurso de Cante Jondo]] \u2013 (Contest of the Deep Song) was a fiesta of flamenco arts, music, song, and dance, held in [[Granada]] in 1922\n*[[Festival Bienal Flamenco]] \u2013 in theatres [[Seville]], this festival features flamenco puro to innovative new works by dancers, vocalists and guitarists\n*[[Flamenco rumba]] \u2013 a style of flamenco music\n*[[Flamenco rock]] \u2013 a rock music subgenre that emerged from Andalusia\n*[[Flamenco shoes]] \u2013 commonly leather shoes constructed with small nails embedded in the toe and heel to enhance the sound of the dancer's percussive footwork\n*[[Latin Grammy Award for Best Flamenco Album]]\n*''[[Kumpan\u00eda: Flamenco Los Angeles]]'' \u2013 a 2011 independent documentary film exploring the origins and contemporary Spanish culture of flamenco\n*[[New Flamenco]] \u2013 a derivative of traditional flamenco [[Fusion (music)|fusing]] flamenco guitar virtuosity with other musical styles\n*[[Camar\u00f3n de la Isla]] \u2013 considered one of the all-time greatest flamenco singers\n*[[Paco de Lucia]] \u2013 a Spanish virtuoso flamenco guitarist, composer, and record producer\n*[[David Pe\u00f1a Dorantes]] \u2013 a Romani flamenco pianist and composer from Andalusia\n*[[Ni\u00f1o Josele]] \u2013 a Spanish guitarist, and exponent of the New flamenco style\n*[[Paco Pe\u00f1a]] \u2013 regarded as one of the world's foremost traditional flamenco guitar players\n*[[Sevillanas]] \u2013 a type of folk music and dance of Seville and its region, influenced by flamenco\n*[[Silverio Franconetti]] \u2013 a singer and the leading figure of the period in flamenco history known as \"The Golden Age\"\n*[[Tablao]] \u2013 a place where flamenco shows are performed and the term used for the flamenco dance floor\n*[[Tomatito]] \u2013 a Spanish roma flamenco guitarist\n*[[Traje de flamenca]] \u2013 the dress traditionally worn by women at festivals in Andalusia; one form worn by dancers\n*[[Mar\u00eda Pag\u00e9s]] \u2013 a modern Spanish dancer and choreographer, considered the paramount representative of flamenco vanguard\n*[[Cristina Hoyos]] \u2013 a Spanish flamenco dancer, choreographer and actress who played an important role during the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]]\n*[[Vicente Amigo]] \u2013 a Spanish flamenco composer and guitarist\n*[[Anto\u00f1ita Singla]] \u2013 a Catalonian flamenco dancer and actress known as \"La Singla\" who took Spain and Europe by storm in the period 1960-1988.}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|title=The Unity of Music and Dance in World Cultures|last=Akombo|first=David|place=North Carolina|publisher=McFarland Books|year=2016|isbn=978-0786497157}}\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''El cante flamenco'', Alianza Editorial, Madrid, Second edition, 1998. {{ISBN|84-206-9682-X}} (First edition: 1994)\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''La Discograf\u00eda ideal del cante flamenco'', Planeta, Barcelona, 1995. {{ISBN|84-08-01602-4}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2010}}|reference=Anon. 2010. \"[http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/5/20101116/tlc-el-flamenco-es-declarado-patrimonio-d712def.html El flamenco es declarado Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad por la Unesco]\"{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, Yahoo Noticias, 16 November 2010 (accessed 16 November 2010).}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2012}}|reference=Anon. \"[http://www.flamenco-events.com/palosetcompas.html Palos & compas] \".

In a wider sense, the term is used to refer to a variety of Spanish musical styles. The oldest record of flamenco music dates to 1774 in the book ''Las Cartas Marruecas'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] {{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=240\u2013241}}. Flamenco has been influenced by and associated with the [[Romani people in Spain]]; however, its origin and style are uniquely Andalusian {{harv|Hayes|2009|loc=31\u201337}}.\n\nManuel R\u00edos Ruiz notes that the development of flamenco is well documented: \"the theatre movement of [[sainete]]s (one-act plays) and [[tonadilla]]s, popular song books and song sheets, customs, studies of dances, and ''toques'', perfection, newspapers, graphic documents in paintings and engravings....in continuous evolution together with rhythm, the poetic stanzas, and the ambiance\" {{harv|R\u00edos Ruiz|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2019}}}}.\n\nNevertheless, the exact origin of flamenco is unknown and the subject of many hypotheses. The most widespread is that flamenco was developed through the cross-cultural interchange between moriscos and gitanos (Romani people of Spain) during the sixteenth century specifically in East Andalusia {{harv|Machin-Autenrieth|2015|loc=29}}; the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola]]'' (Dictionary of the Spanish Language) primarily attributes the creation of the style directly to the [[Spanish Romani]] {{harv|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|2019|loc=sense 4}}.\n\nFlamenco has become popular all over the world, especially the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. In Japan, there are more flamenco academies than there are in Spain {{harv|Mendoza|2011|loc=52}}. \"In El Salvador the group Alma Flamenca is considered the maximum representative and pioneer of this musical movement\" {{harv|Mendoza|2011|loc=52}}.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, [[UNESCO]] declared flamenco one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] {{harv|Anon.|2010}}.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are many suggestions for the origin of the word ''flamenco'' as a musical term, but no solid evidence for any of them. The word is Spanish for \"Flemish\" (meaning \"native of [[Flanders]]\", a one-time Spanish possession) {{harv|Harper|n.d.}}. The Spanish verb ''flamear'' means ''to flamb\u00e9''. The word was not recorded as a musical and dance term until the late 18th century, in the book ''Las Cartas Marruecas'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] (1774) {{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=240\u2013241}}.\n\nOne theory, proposed by Andalusian historian [[Blas Infante]], is that the word is derived from the Hispano-[[Arabic language|Arabic]] term ''[[Fellah|fellah mengu]]'', meaning \"expelled peasant\", referring to the Andalusians of [[Islamic]] faith and the remaining [[Moriscos]] who fled with the [[Romani people|Roma]] newcomers ({{harvnb|Infante|2010|loc=166}}; {{harvnb|Herrera|2006}}).\n\nAnother theory is that the Spanish word ''[[wikt:flamenco#Spanish|flamenco]]'' is a derivative of the Spanish word, meaning \"[[fire]]\" or \"flame\".  The word ''flamenco'' may have been used for fiery behaviour, which could have come to be applied to the [[Romani people in Spain|Gitano]] players and performers {{harv|Ruiz|2007|loc=165ff}}.\n\n== ''Palos'' ==\n{{Main|Palo (flamenco)}}\n[[File:Palos flamencos.jpg|thumb|The ''Palos'' of Flamenco]]\n''[[Palo (flamenco)|Palos]]'' (formerly known as ''cantes'') are flamenco styles, classified by criteria such as rhythmic pattern, [[Musical mode|mode]], [[chord progression]], [[stanza]]ic form and geographic origin. There are over 50 different ''palos'', some are sung unaccompanied while others have guitar or other accompaniment. Some forms are danced while others are not. Some are reserved for men and others for women while some may be performed by either, though these traditional distinctions are breaking down: the ''Farruca'', for example, once a male dance, is now commonly performed by women too.\n\nThere are many ways to categorize ''Palos'' but they traditionally fall into three classes: the most serious is known as ''[[cante jondo]]'' (or ''[[Cante flamenco#Cante Grande (also known as cante jondo)|cante grande]]''), while lighter, frivolous forms are called ''[[Cante Chico|cante chico]]''. Forms that do not fit either category are classed as ''[[Cante Intermedio|cante intermedio]]'' {{harv|Pohren|2005|loc=68}}. These are the best known ''palos'' ({{harvnb|Anon.|2019}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2012}}):\n\n* [[Alegr\u00edas]]\n* [[Buler\u00edas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1 por Buler\u00edas|Buler\u00edas por sole\u00e1 (sole\u00e1 por buler\u00edas)]]\n* Caracoles\n* [[Cartageneras]]\n* [[Fandango]]\n* Fandango de Huelva\n* Fandango Malague\u00f1o\n* [[Farruca]]\n* [[Grana\u00edna]]s\n* [[Guajiras (Flamenco)|Guajiras]]\n* [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|Malague\u00f1as]]\n* Martinete\n* Mineras\n* Nanas\n* [[Peteneras]]\n* Ronde\u00f1as\n* [[Saeta (flamenco)|Saeta]]\n* [[Siguiriyas|Seguiriyas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1]]\n* [[Tango (flamenco)|Tangos]]\n* Tanguillos\n* Tarantos\n* [[Tientos (Flamenco)|Tientos]]\n* Villancicos\n\n== Music ==\n{{Quote|There are three fundamental elements which can help define whether or not something really is flameco: A flamenco mode -or musical tonality-; the ''comp\u00e1s'' -rhythm- and the performer...who should be a Flamenco! All three of these elements: tonality, ''comp\u00e1s'', a flamenco performer and then something less easily identifiable- ''Flamencura''- must be present together if we are to wend up with a piece of music which can be labelled 'flamenco'. By themselves, these elements won't turn a piece of music into flamenco.|{{harv|Martinez|2011|loc=6}}}}\n{{Quote|Three fundamental elements that help define whether or not a dance belongs to the Flamenco genre are the presence of a Flamenco mode (musical tonality), ''compas'', and a Flamenco performer (Martinez, 2003). These three elements contribute to the authenticity of a Flamenco performance also known as ''flamencura'' (Martinez, 2003). There is also no such thing as a passive audience during Flamenco performances {{bracket|[[participatory art|participatory music]]}}. The audience joins in the performance by clapping their hands and even sometimes singing along (Totton, 2003).|{{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=243}}}}\n\n=== Structure ===\nA typical flamenco recital with voice and guitar accompaniment comprises a series of pieces (not exactly \"songs\") in different palos. Each song is a set of verses (called ''copla'', ''tercio'', or ''letras''), punctuated by guitar interludes (''[[falseta]]s''). The guitarist also provides a short introduction setting the tonality, ''comp\u00e1s'' (see below) and tempo of the cante {{harv|Manuel|2006|loc=98}}. In some palos, these falsetas are played with a specific structure too; for example, the typical [[sevillanas]] is played in an AAB pattern, where A and B are the same falseta with only a slight difference in the ending {{harv|Martin|2002|loc=48}}.\n\n=== Harmony ===\nFlamenco uses the [[Flamenco mode]] (which can also be described as the [[Phrygian mode#Modern Phrygian mode|modern Phrygian mode]] (''modo frigio''), or a harmonic version of that scale with a major 3rd [[degree (music)|degree]]), in addition to the [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] scales commonly used in modern Western music. The Phrygian mode occurs in ''palos'' such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], most [[buler\u00edas]], [[siguiriya]]s, [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]] and [[tientos]].\n[[File:E Phrygian Scale.PNG|frame|left|Descending E Phrygian scale in flamenco music, with common alterations in parentheses]]\n\nA typical [[chord sequence]], usually called the \"[[Andalusian cadence]]\" may be viewed as in a modified Phrygian: in E the sequence is '''Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013E''' {{harv|Manuel|2006|loc=96}}. According to [[Manolo Sanl\u00facar]] '''E''' is here the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], '''F''' has the [[diatonic function|harmonic function]] of [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] while '''Am''' and '''G''' assume the functions of [[subdominant]] and [[mediant]] respectively {{harv|Torres Cort\u00e9s|2001}}.\n\nGuitarists tend to use only two basic inversions or \"chord shapes\" for the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] [[chord (music)]], the open 1st inversion '''E''' and the open 3rd inversion '''A''', though they often [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] these by using a [[capo]]. Modern guitarists such as [[Ram\u00f3n Montoya]], have introduced other positions: Montoya himself started to use other chords for the tonic in the [[Dorian mode|modern Dorian]] sections of several ''palos''; '''F{{music|sharp}}''' for ''[[Tarantella|tarantas]]'', '''B''' for ''[[grana\u00edna]]s'' and '''A{{music|flat}}''' for the ''minera''. Montoya also created a new ''palo'' as a solo for guitar, the ''[[ronde\u00f1a]]'' in '''C{{music|sharp}}''' with ''[[scordatura]]''. Later guitarists have further extended the repertoire of [[tonality|tonalities]], chord positions and ''scordatura''.\n\nThere are also ''palos'' in major mode; most [[canti\u00f1as]] and [[alegr\u00edas]], [[guajiras]], some ''[[buler\u00edas]]'' and ''[[ton\u00e1s]]'', and the ''cabales'' (a major type of ''[[siguiriyas]]''). The minor mode is restricted to the ''[[Farruca]]'', the ''milongas'' (among ''[[cantes de ida y vuelta]]''), and some styles of ''tangos, buler\u00edas'', etc. In general traditional palos in major and minor mode are limited harmonically to two-chord (tonic\u2013dominant) or three-chord (tonic\u2013subdominant\u2013dominant) progressions {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=92}}. However modern guitarists have introduced [[chord substitution]], transition chords, and even [[modulation (music)|modulation]].\n\n''[[Fandangos]]'' and derivative ''palos'' such as ''[[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]]'', ''tarantas'' and ''[[cartageneras]] are bimodal'': guitar introductions are in Phrygian mode while the singing develops in major mode, modulating to Phrygian at the end of the stanza {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=92}}.\n\n=== Melody ===\nDionisio Preciado, quoted by Sabas de {{harvtxt|Hoces|1982|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2019}}}}, established the following characteristics for the melodies of flamenco singing:\n\n#[[Microtonality]]: presence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] smaller than the [[semitone]].\n#[[Portamento]]: frequently, the change from one note to another is done in a smooth transition, rather than using discrete intervals.\n#Short [[tessitura]] or [[range (music)|range]]: Most traditional flamenco songs are limited to a range of a sixth (four tones and a half). The impression of vocal effort is the result of using different [[timbre]]s, and variety is accomplished by the use of microtones.\n#Use of [[enharmonic scale]]. While in [[equal temperament]] scales, [[enharmonic]]s are notes with identical pitch but different spellings (e.g. A\u266d and G\u266f); in flamenco, as in [[Equal temperament|unequal temperament]] scales, there is a microtonal intervalic difference between enharmonic notes.\n#Insistence on a note and its contiguous chromatic notes (also frequent in the guitar), producing a sense of urgency.\n#Baroque [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], with an expressive, rather than merely aesthetic function.\n#Apparent lack of regular rhythm, especially in the [[siguiriyas]]: the melodic rhythm of the sung line is different from the metric rhythm of the accompaniment.\n#Most styles express sad and bitter feelings.\n#Melodic [[improvisation]]: flamenco singing is not, strictly speaking, improvised, but based on a relatively small number of traditional songs, singers add variations on the spur of the moment.\n\nMusicologist Hip\u00f3lito Rossy adds the following characteristics {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=97}}:\n\n*Flamenco melodies are characterized by a descending tendency, as opposed to, for example, a typical opera [[aria]], they usually go from the higher pitches to the lower ones, and from [[Dynamics (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|piano]], as was usual in ancient Greek scales.\n*In many styles, such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]] or [[siguiriya]], the melody tends to proceed in contiguous [[degree (music)|degrees]] of the scale. [[Steps and skips|Skips]] of a third or a fourth are rarer. However, in [[fandangos]] and fandango-derived styles, fourths and sixths can often be found, especially at the beginning of each line of verse. According to Rossy, this is proof of the more recent creation of this type of songs, influenced by Castilian [[jota (music)|jota]].\n\n=== Comp\u00e1s ===\n'''Comp\u00e1s''' is the Spanish word for [[metre (music)|metre]] or [[time signature]] (in classical [[music theory]]). It also refers to the rhythmic cycle, or layout, of a ''palo''.\n\nThe comp\u00e1s is fundamental to flamenco. Comp\u00e1s is most often translated as [[rhythm]] but it demands far more precise interpretation than any other Western style of music. If there is no guitarist available, the comp\u00e1s is rendered through hand clapping (''palmas'') or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (''rasgueado'') or tapping the [[sound board (music)|soundboard]] (''golpe''). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.\n\nFlamenco uses three basic counts or measures: Binary, Ternary and a form of a twelve-beat cycle that is unique to flamenco. There are also free-form styles including, among others, the [[ton\u00e1s]], [[Saeta (flamenco)|saetas]], [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]], tarantos, and some types of [[fandangos]].\n\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}. These metres are used in forms like [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]], [[tientos]], [[Flamenco Rumba|gypsy rumba]], [[zambra]] and tanguillos.\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|3|4}}. These are typical of [[fandangos]] and [[sevillanas]], suggesting their origin as non-Roma styles, since the {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|4|4}} measures are not common in ethnic Roma music.\n*12-beat rhythms usually rendered in amalgams of {{music|time|6|8}} + {{music|time|3|4}} and sometimes {{music|time|12|8}}. The 12-beat cycle is the most common in flamenco, differentiated by the accentuation of the beats in different palos. The accents do not correspond to the classic concept of the downbeat. The alternating of groups of 2 and 3 beats is also common in Spanish folk dances of the 16th Century such as the ''zarabanda'', ''j\u00e1cara'' and ''canarios''.\n\nThere are three types of 12-beat rhythms, which vary in their layouts, or use of accentuations: sole\u00e1, seguiriya and buler\u00eda.\n\n#[[peteneras]] and [[guajiras]]: 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. Both palos start with the strong accent on 12. Hence the meter is  '''12''' 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11...\n#The [[seguiriya]], liviana<!-- liviana links to a page about a genus of moths-->, [[Palo (flamenco)|serrana]], ton\u00e1 liviana, cabales: '''12'''1 '''2''' 3 '''4''' 5 6 '''7''' 8 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''.\n#[[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], within the [[canti\u00f1as]] group of palos which includes the [[alegr\u00edas]], canti\u00f1as, mirabras, romera, caracoles and sole\u00e1 por buler\u00eda (also \"[[Buler\u00edas|buler\u00eda por sole\u00e1]]\"): 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. For practical reasons, when transferring flamenco guitar music to sheet music, this rhythm is written as a regular {{music|time|3|4}}.\n\nThe [[Buler\u00edas]] is the emblematic palo of flamenco: today its 12-beat cycle is most often played with accents on the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th beats. The accompanying ''palmas'' are played in groups of 6 beats, giving rise to a multitude of counter-rhythms and percussive voices within the 12 beat comp\u00e1s.  In certain regions like, Xerez, Spain, the rhythm stays in a simpler six-count rhythm, only including the twelve count in a musical resolve.{{Clarify|date=October 2019|reason=What is a \"musical resolve\"?}}\n\n[[File:Flamenco Compas.theora.ogv|thumb|400 px|none|Flamenco [[Buler\u00edas]] with emphasis as '''[12]''' 1 2 '''[3]''' 4 5 '''[6]''' 7 '''[8]''' 9 '''[10]''' 11 \u2013 also the rhythm for the song [[America (West Side Story song)|''America'' from the ''West Side Story'']]]]\n\n== Forms of flamenco expression ==\n\n=== Toque (guitar) ===\n\n{{Main|Flamenco guitar}}\n\n[[File:Paco de lucia 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Paco de Luc\u00eda]], one of the most commercially successful exponents of flamenco {{harv|Koster|2002|loc=5}}]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the flamenco guitar is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[Flamenco guitar]].\n\n=== Cante (song) ===\n{{Main|Cante flamenco}}\n\n[[File:Flamenco 001.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Flamenco performance by the La Primavera group]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the cante is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[cante flamenco]].\n\n=== Baile (dance) ===\n\n''El baile flamenco'' is known for its emotional intensity, proud carriage, expressive use of the arms and rhythmic stamping of the feet, unlike [[tap dance]] or [[Irish dance]] which use different techniques. As with any dance form, many different styles of flamenco have developed.\n\nIn the twentieth century, flamenco danced informally at gitano (Roma) celebrations in Spain was considered the most \"authentic\" form of flamenco. There was less virtuoso technique in gitano flamenco, but the music and steps are fundamentally the same. The arms are noticeably different from classical flamenco, curving around the head and body rather than extending, often with a bent elbow.\n[[File:Tablao Cordob\u00e9s 06.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Flamenco, C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\"Flamenco puro\" otherwise known as \u201cflamenco por derecho\u201d is considered the form of performance flamenco closest to its gitano influences. In this style, the dance is often performed solo, and is based on signals and calls of structural improvisation rather than choreographed. In the improvisational style, castanets are not often used.\n\n\"Classical flamenco\" is the style most frequently performed by Spanish flamenco dance companies. It is danced largely in a proud and upright style. For women, the back is often held in a marked back bend. Unlike the more gitano influenced styles, there is little movement of the hips, the body is tightly held and the arms are long, like a [[ballet]] dancer. In fact many of the dancers in these companies are trained in Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol more than in the improvisational language of flamenco. Flamenco has both influenced and been influenced by Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol, as evidenced by the fusion of the two ballets created by 'La Argentinita' in the early part of the twentieth century and later, by [[Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]], eventually by the entire Ballet Nacional de Espa\u00f1a et al.\n\nIn the 1950s [[Jose Greco]] was one of the most famous male Flamenco dancers, performing on stage worldwide and on television including the [[Ed Sullivan Show]], and reviving the art almost singlehandedly.  Greco's company left a handful of prominent pioneers, most notably: Maria Benitez and Vicente Romero of New Mexico.  Today, there are many centers of Flamenco art.  Albuquerque, New Mexico is considered the \u201cCenter of the Nation\u201d for Flamenco Art. Much of this is due to Maria Benitez's 37 years of sold-out summer seasons. Albuquerque boasts three distinct prominent centers: National Institute of Flamenco, Casa Flamenca and Flamenco Works. Each center dedicates time to daily training, cultural diffusion and world-class performance equaled only to world-class performances one would find in the heart of Southern Spain, Andaluc\u00eda.\n\nModern flamenco is a highly technical dance style requiring years of study. The emphasis for both male and female performers is on lightning-fast footwork performed with absolute precision. In addition, the dancer may have to dance while using props such as castanets, canes, shawls and fans.\n\n\"[[New Flamenco|Flamenco nuevo]]\" is a recent marketing phenomenon in Flamenco. Marketed as a \u201cnewer version\u201d of Flamenco, its roots came from world-music promoters trying to sell albums of artists who created music that \u201csounded like\u201d or had Spanish-style influences.  Though some of this music was played in similar pitches, scales and was well-received, it has little to nothing to do with the Art of Flamenco guitar, dance, cante Jondo or the improvisational language.  \u201cNuevo Flamenco\u201d consists largely of compositions and repertoire, while Traditional Flamenco music and dance is a language composed of stanzas, actuated by oral formulaic calls and signals.\n\n[[File:Deborah Greenfield.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Los Angeles, United States]]\nThe flamenco most foreigners are familiar with is a style that was developed as a spectacle for tourists. To add variety, group dances are included and even solos are more likely to be choreographed. The frilly, voluminous spotted dresses are derived from a style of dress worn for the [[Sevillanas]] at the annual [[Seville Fair|Feria]] in [[Seville]].\n\nIn traditional flamenco, only the very young or older dancers are considered to have the emotional innocence or maturity to adequately convey the ''[[Duende (art)|duende]]'' (soul) of the genre {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional through techniques early on to take advantage of youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond.  One artist that is considered a young master is Juan Manuel Fernandez Montoya, otherwise known as \u201cFarruquito.\u201d  At age 12, Farruquito was considered a pioneer and for \u201cFlamenco Puro,\u201d or \u201cFlamenco por Derecho,\u201d because of his emotional depth.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Castelucho.jpg|[[Claudio Castelucho]], Flamenco\nFile:Theatre Flamenco Work Sample.webm|Theatre Flamenco Work Sample\nFile:Baile andaluz 1893 Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero]], Baile Andaluz\nFile:Sargent John Singer Spanish Dancer.jpg|[[John Singer Sargent]], Spanish Dancer\n</gallery>\n\n;Scenes of flamenco performance in Seville.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 07.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 11.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 20.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 23.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Latin music|Music}}\n{{columns-list|\n*[[Andalusian Centre of Flamenco]] \u2013 an institution in Spain founded in 1993 to safeguard and promote the values and standards of flamenco\n*[[Concurso de Cante Jondo]] \u2013 (Contest of the Deep Song) was a fiesta of flamenco arts, music, song, and dance, held in [[Granada]] in 1922\n*[[Festival Bienal Flamenco]] \u2013 in theatres [[Seville]], this festival features flamenco puro to innovative new works by dancers, vocalists and guitarists\n*[[Flamenco rumba]] \u2013 a style of flamenco music\n*[[Flamenco rock]] \u2013 a rock music subgenre that emerged from Andalusia\n*[[Flamenco shoes]] \u2013 commonly leather shoes constructed with small nails embedded in the toe and heel to enhance the sound of the dancer's percussive footwork\n*[[Latin Grammy Award for Best Flamenco Album]]\n*''[[Kumpan\u00eda: Flamenco Los Angeles]]'' \u2013 a 2011 independent documentary film exploring the origins and contemporary Spanish culture of flamenco\n*[[New Flamenco]] \u2013 a derivative of traditional flamenco [[Fusion (music)|fusing]] flamenco guitar virtuosity with other musical styles\n*[[Camar\u00f3n de la Isla]] \u2013 considered one of the all-time greatest flamenco singers\n*[[Paco de Lucia]] \u2013 a Spanish virtuoso flamenco guitarist, composer, and record producer\n*[[David Pe\u00f1a Dorantes]] \u2013 a Romani flamenco pianist and composer from Andalusia\n*[[Ni\u00f1o Josele]] \u2013 a Spanish guitarist, and exponent of the New flamenco style\n*[[Paco Pe\u00f1a]] \u2013 regarded as one of the world's foremost traditional flamenco guitar players\n*[[Sevillanas]] \u2013 a type of folk music and dance of Seville and its region, influenced by flamenco\n*[[Silverio Franconetti]] \u2013 a singer and the leading figure of the period in flamenco history known as \"The Golden Age\"\n*[[Tablao]] \u2013 a place where flamenco shows are performed and the term used for the flamenco dance floor\n*[[Tomatito]] \u2013 a Spanish roma flamenco guitarist\n*[[Traje de flamenca]] \u2013 the dress traditionally worn by women at festivals in Andalusia; one form worn by dancers\n*[[Mar\u00eda Pag\u00e9s]] \u2013 a modern Spanish dancer and choreographer, considered the paramount representative of flamenco vanguard\n*[[Cristina Hoyos]] \u2013 a Spanish flamenco dancer, choreographer and actress who played an important role during the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]]\n*[[Vicente Amigo]] \u2013 a Spanish flamenco composer and guitarist\n*[[Anto\u00f1ita Singla]] \u2013 a Catalonian flamenco dancer and actress known as \"La Singla\" who took Spain and Europe by storm in the period 1960-1988.}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|title=The Unity of Music and Dance in World Cultures|last=Akombo|first=David|place=North Carolina|publisher=McFarland Books|year=2016|isbn=978-0786497157}}\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''El cante flamenco'', Alianza Editorial, Madrid, Second edition, 1998. {{ISBN|84-206-9682-X}} (First edition: 1994)\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''La Discograf\u00eda ideal del cante flamenco'', Planeta, Barcelona, 1995. {{ISBN|84-08-01602-4}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2010}}|reference=Anon. 2010. \"[http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/5/20101116/tlc-el-flamenco-es-declarado-patrimonio-d712def.html El flamenco es declarado Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad por la Unesco]\"{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, Yahoo Noticias, 16 November 2010 (accessed 16 November 2010).}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2012}}|reference=Anon. \"[http://www.flamenco-events.com/palosetcompas.html Palos & compas] \".

Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[Digital data|digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comit\u00e9 Consultatif International T\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et T\u00e9l\u00e9graphique]] (CCITT) [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2) standard of 1924,<ref name=\"Bruxy_2005\">{{cite web |title=BruXy: Radio Teletype communication |date=2005-10-10 |access-date=2016-05-09 |url=http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |quote=The transmitted code use International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA-2) which was introduced by CCITT in 1924. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412130035/http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |archive-date=April 12, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"bdcode\">{{cite web |author-last=Smith |author-first=Gil |title=Teletype Communication Codes |publisher=Baudot.net |date=2001 |url=http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |access-date=2008-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820043949/http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[FIELDATA]] (1956{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=My sources state 1957 rather than 1956, but Wikipedia states 1956 in various places.

In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]], as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.<ref name=\"Mackenzie_1980\"/>{{rp|215, 236&thinsp;\u00a7&thinsp;4}}\n\nThe committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary-coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.<ref name=\"Mackenzie_1980\"/>{{rp|217, 236&thinsp;\u00a7&thinsp;5}} [[Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.<ref name=\"Sawyer_1995\">{{cite book |author-first1=Stanley A. |author-last1=Sawyer |author-first2=Steven George |author-last2=Krantz |title=A TeX Primer for Scientists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&pg=PA13 |date=1995 |publisher=[[CRC Press, LLC]] |isbn=978-0-8493-7159-2 |page=13 |bibcode=1995tps..book.....S |access-date=October 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222151907/https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&pg=PA13 |archive-date=December 22, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In some printers, the high bit was used to enable [[Italics]] printing{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\n===Internal organization===\nThe code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification.

This discrepancy from typewriters led to [[bit-paired keyboard]]s, notably the [[Teletype Model 33]], which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the [[IBM Selectric]] (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers{{snd}} following the [[IBM PC]] (1981), especially [[Model M]] (1984){{snd}} and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The <code>/?</code> pair also dates to the No. 2, and the <code>,&lt; .&gt;</code> pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift <code>,</code> (comma) or <code>.</code> (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the <code>;:</code> pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly <code>-* =+</code>) to <code>:* ;+ -=</code>.\n\nSome common characters were not included, notably <code>\u00bd\u00bc\u00a2</code>, while <code>^`~</code> were included as diacritics for international use, and <code>&lt;&gt;</code> for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters <code>\\|</code> (in addition to common <code>/</code>). The ''@'' symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented ''\u00c0'' in the French variation, so the ''@'' was placed in position 40<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>, right before the letter A.<ref name=\"Mackenzie_1980\"/>{{rp|243}}\n\nThe control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[End of Message|end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), \"who are you?\" (WRU), \"are you?\" (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK).

NO-WS-CTL.)</ref> Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.\n\nThe original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of \"delete\".\n\nProbably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|Delete]]) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (code 7, BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character.  Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as \"delete previous character\" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.\n\nWhen a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, \"transmit on\") caused the tape reader to resume.  This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a \"handshaking\" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.  The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and <s>TAPE</s> respectively.<ref name=\"McConnell\">{{cite web |title=Understanding ASCII Codes |author-last1=McConnell |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Haynes |author-first2=James |author-last3=Warren |author-first3=Richard |url=http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |access-date=2014-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227190425/http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==== Delete & Backspace ====\n\nThe Teletype could not move the head backwards, so it did not put a key on the keyboard to send a BS (backspace). Instead there was a key marked {{keypress|RUB OUT}} that sent code 127 (DEL). The purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a hand-typed paper tape: the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up, then type the rubout, which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |title=Re: editor and word processor history (was: Re: RTF for emacs) |author=Barry Margolin |mailing-list=help-gnu-emacs |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133149/http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], so these systems had to use the available key and thus the DEL code to erase the previous character.<ref name=\"pdp-6-monitor-manual\">{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |title=PDP-6 Multiprogramming System Manual |page=43 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1965 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140253/http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"pdp-10-monitor-manual\">{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |title=PDP-10 Reference Handbook, Book 3, Communicating with the Monitor |at=p. 5-5 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1969 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115083418/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Because of this, DEC video terminals (by default) sent the DEL code for the key marked \"Backspace\" while the key marked \"Delete\" sent an escape sequence, while many other terminals sent BS for the Backspace key.

The assumption that no key sent a BS caused Control+H to be used for other purposes, such as the \"help\" prefix command in [[GNU Emacs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html|title=Help - GNU Emacs Manual|access-date=July 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711223750/https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html|archive-date=July 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Escape ====\nMany more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The \"escape\" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of \"escape\" encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called \"[[ANSI escape code]]\" (or, more properly, a \"[[Control Sequence Introducer]]\") from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors, beginning with ESC followed by a \"<nowiki>[</nowiki>\" (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (system call)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.\n\n==== End of Line ====\n\nThe inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring \"plain text\" files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both \"Carriage Return\" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and \"Line Feed\" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name \"Carriage Return\" comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.\n\n[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]]) would work. By the time so-called \"glass TTYs\" (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When [[Gary Kildall]] created [[CP/M]] he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[RT-11]]. Until the introduction of [[PC DOS]] in 1981, [[IBM]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. IBM's [[PC DOS]] (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on CP/M,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|title=Is DOS a Rip-Off of CP/M?|author=Tim Paterson|date=August 8, 2007|website=DosMan Drivel|author-link=Tim Paterson|access-date=April 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420075137/http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|archive-date=April 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Windows]] inherited it from MS-DOS.\n\nUnfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone.

[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original [[Macintosh OS]], [[Apple DOS]], and [[ProDOS]], on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced these operating systems with the Unix-based [[macOS]] operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well. The Radio Shack [[TRS-80]] also used a lone CR to terminate lines.\n\nComputers attached to the [[ARPANET]] included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and [[TENEX (operating system)|TENEX]] using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as [[OS/360]] that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used [[EBCDIC]] rather than ASCII.  The [[Telnet]] protocol defined an ASCII \"[[Network Virtual Terminal]]\" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network.

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the \"rubout\" code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo \"<code>^H</code>\" for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{key press|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.}}\n|}\n\nOther representations might be used by specialist equipment, for example [[ISO 2047]] graphics or [[hexadecimal]] numbers.\n\n==={{anchor|ASCII-printable-characters}}Printable characters===\n<!-- Anchor linked to from redirects -->\nCodes 20<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub> to 7E<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[punctuation mark]]s, and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Some computer languages used characters in 1961 ASCII such as up arrow and left arrow. These characters disappeared from 1968 ASCII. We worked with Fred Mocking, who by now was in Sales at [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]], on a type cylinder that would compromise the changing characters so that the meanings of 1961 ASCII were not totally lost. The underscore character was made rather wedge-shaped so it could also serve as a left arrow.}}</ref>\n\n<!-- To be more useful this list should be expanded to include the character names and reflect

One could class some of these variations as \"[[ASCII extension]]s\", although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore, the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.\n\n==={{anchor|7-bit}}7-bit codes===\n{{Main|ECMA-6|ISO/IEC 646|ITU T.50}}{{See also|UTF-7}}\nFrom early in its development,<ref>\"Specific Criteria\", attachment to memo from R. W. Reach, \"X3-2 Meeting \u2013 September 14 and 15\", September 18, 1961</ref> ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard.\n\n<!-- ITU-T ITU T.50\nInternational Reference Alphabet (IRA)\nInternational Alphabet No. 5 (IA5) -->\nOther international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO 646]] (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English [[alphabet]] and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's [[pound sterling]] (\u00a3). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the US and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters.\n\nMany other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. [[\u00e9]], [[\u00f1]], [[\u00df]], [[\u0141]]), currency symbols (e.g. [[\u00a3]], [[\u00a5]]), etc. See also [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia).\n\nIt would share most characters in common, but assign other locally useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for \"national use\". However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967<ref name=\"Mar\u00e9chal_1967\">{{citation |author-last=Mar\u00e9chal |author-first=R. |title=ISO/TC 97 \u2013 Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052 |date=1967-12-22}}</ref> caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.\n\nISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.\n\nBecause the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to \"national use\" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as\n\n:<code>\u00e4 a\u00c4i\u00dc = '\u00d6n'; \u00fc</code>\n\ninstead of\n\n:<code>{ a[i] = '\\n'; }</code>\n\n[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or [[Usenet]]) contained \"{, }\" and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get \"N{ jag har sm|rg}sar\" as the answer, which should be \"N\u00e4 jag har sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sar\" meaning \"No I've got sandwiches\".\n\n==={{anchor|8-bit}}8-bit codes===\n{{Main|Extended ASCII|ISO/IEC 8859}}{{See also|UTF-8}}\n<!-- to be mentioned [[USASCII-8]] -->\nEventually, as 8-, [[16-bit|16-]] and [[32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[12-bit|12-]], [[18-bit|18-]] and [[36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.\n\nEncodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.\n\nMost early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics. [[Kaypro]] [[CP/M]] computers used the \"upper\" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet.\n\nThe [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their [[8-bit]] systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] 8-bit computers and [[Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants.\n\nThe IBM PC defined [[code page 437]], which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]] as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined [[Mac OS Roman]] and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as [[ISO-8859-1]]), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.  ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when [[UTF-8]] became more common.<ref name=\"UTF-8_2008\"/>\n\n[[ISO/IEC 4873]] introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80\u20139F [[hexadecimal]] range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.<ref name=\"Unicode-5.0_2006\">{{cite book |author=The Unicode Consortium |editor-first=Julie D. |editor-last=Allen |title=The Unicode standard, Version 5.0 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Professional]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, US |isbn=978-0-321-48091-0 |chapter-url=http://unicode.org/book/ch13.pdf |access-date=2015-03-13 |chapter=Chapter 13: Special Areas and Format Characters |page=314}}</ref>\n\n===Unicode===\n{{Main|Unicode|ISO/IEC 10646}}{{See also|Basic Latin (Unicode block)}}\n[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]).\n\nASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly, [[forward compatibility]] is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.<ref>{{cite web |title=utf-8(7)&nbsp;\u2013 Linux manual page |publisher=Man7.org |date=2014-02-26 |url=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |access-date=2014-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232059/http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |archive-date=April 22, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[3568 ASCII]], an asteroid named after the character encoding\n* [[Ascii85]]\n* [[ASCII art]]\n* [[ASCII Ribbon Campaign]]\n* [[Basic Latin (Unicode block)]] (ASCII as a subset of Unicode)\n* [[Extended ASCII]]\n* [[HTML decimal character rendering]]\n* [[List of Unicode characters]]\n* [[Jargon File]], a glossary of computer programmer slang which includes a list of common slang names for ASCII characters\n* [[List of computer character sets]]\n* [[Alt codes]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|40em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em|refs=\n<ref name=\"INCITS_4-1986_R2012\">{{cite web |title=INCITS 4-1986[R2012]: Information Systems - Coded Character Sets - 7-Bit American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII) |date=2012-06-15 |url=https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=796 |access-date=2020-02-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228222040/https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=796 |archive-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"INCITS_4-1986_R2017\">{{cite web |title=INCITS 4-1986[R2017]: Information Systems - Coded Character Sets - 7-Bit American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII) |date=2017-11-02 |orig-year=2017-06-09 |url=https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=1829 |access-date=2020-02-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228221645/https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=1829 |archive-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bemer_1980_Inside\">{{cite book |title=General Purpose Software |chapter=Chapter 1: Inside ASCII |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |date=1980 |series=Best of Interface Age |volume=2 |location=Portland, OR, USA |publisher=dilithium Press |isbn=978-0-918398-37-6 |lccn=79-67462 |chapter-url=http://bookzz.org/dl/1210234/1105c6 |access-date=2016-08-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827000956/http://dlx.bookzz.org/genesis/772000/c80a62495acf1e1a5b966de23c1f989a/_as/%5BInterface_Age_Staff%5D_Best_of_Interface_Age%2C_Volum%28BookZZ.org%29.pdf |archive-date=August 27, 2016 |pages=1\u201350 |postscript=,}} from:\n* {{cite journal |title=Inside ASCII \u2013 Part I |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Interface Age |volume=3 |issue=5 |date=May 1978 |pages=96\u2013102}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Inside ASCII \u2013 Part II |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Interface Age |volume=3 |issue=6 |date=June 1978 |pages=64\u201374}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Inside ASCII \u2013 Part III |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Interface Age |volume=3 |issue=7 |date=July 1978 |pages=80\u201387}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |title=A Proposal for Character Code Compatibility |author-first=Robert William |author-last=Bemer |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=3 |issue=2 |date=1960 |doi=10.1145/366959.366961 |pages=71\u201372}}\n* {{cite web |title=The Babel of Codes Prior to ASCII: The 1960 Survey of Coded Character Sets: The Reasons for ASCII |author-first=Robert William |author-last=Bemer |author-link=Robert William Bemer |date=2003-05-23 |url=http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/SURVEY.HTM |access-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017062654/http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/SURVEY.HTM |archive-date=2013-10-17 |postscript=,}} from:\n** {{cite journal |title=Survey of coded character representation |author-first=Robert William |author-last=Bemer |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=639\u2013641 |date=December 1960 |doi=10.1145/367487.367493}}\n** {{cite journal |title=Survey of punched card codes |author-first1=H.

Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[Digital data|digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comit\u00e9 Consultatif International T\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et T\u00e9l\u00e9graphique]] (CCITT) [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2) standard of 1924,<ref name=\"Bruxy_2005\">{{cite web |title=BruXy: Radio Teletype communication |date=2005-10-10 |access-date=2016-05-09 |url=http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |quote=The transmitted code use International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA-2) which was introduced by CCITT in 1924. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412130035/http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |archive-date=April 12, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"bdcode\">{{cite web |author-last=Smith |author-first=Gil |title=Teletype Communication Codes |publisher=Baudot.net |date=2001 |url=http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |access-date=2008-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820043949/http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[FIELDATA]] (1956{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=My sources state 1957 rather than 1956, but Wikipedia states 1956 in various places.

In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]], as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.<ref name=\"Mackenzie_1980\"/>{{rp|215, 236&thinsp;\u00a7&thinsp;4}}\n\nThe committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary-coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.<ref name=\"Mackenzie_1980\"/>{{rp|217, 236&thinsp;\u00a7&thinsp;5}} [[Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.<ref name=\"Sawyer_1995\">{{cite book |author-first1=Stanley A. |author-last1=Sawyer |author-first2=Steven George |author-last2=Krantz |title=A TeX Primer for Scientists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&pg=PA13 |date=1995 |publisher=[[CRC Press, LLC]] |isbn=978-0-8493-7159-2 |page=13 |bibcode=1995tps..book.....S |access-date=October 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222151907/https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC&pg=PA13 |archive-date=December 22, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In some printers, the high bit was used to enable [[Italics]] printing{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\n===Internal organization===\nThe code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification.

The committee decided it was important to support [[upper case|uppercase]] [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes,<ref name=\"Mackenzie_1980\"/>{{rp|228, 237&thinsp;\u00a7&thinsp;14}} as was done in the [[DEC SIXBIT]] code (1963). [[Lower case|Lowercase]] letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase. To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter ''A'' was placed in position 41<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub> to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.<ref name=\"Mackenzie_1980\"/>{{rp|238&thinsp;\u00a7&thinsp;18}} The digits 0\u20139 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining [[Nibble|4 bits]] correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward.\n\nMany of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on ''mechanical'' typewriters, not ''electric'' typewriters.<ref name=\"Savard\">{{cite web |title=Computer Keyboards |url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/kybint.htm |author-first=John J.

Thus, in ASCII <code>!\"#$%</code> were placed in the second stick,{{Efn|name=\"NB_Stick\"}}<ref name=\"Bemer_1980_Inside\"/> positions 1\u20135, corresponding to the digits 1\u20135 in the adjacent stick.{{Efn|name=\"NB_Stick\"}}<ref name=\"Bemer_1980_Inside\"/> The parentheses could not correspond to ''9'' and ''0'', however, because the place corresponding to ''0'' was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing <code>_</code> (underscore) from ''6'' and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with ''8'' and ''9''. This discrepancy from typewriters led to [[bit-paired keyboard]]s, notably the [[Teletype Model 33]], which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the [[IBM Selectric]] (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers{{snd}} following the [[IBM PC]] (1981), especially [[Model M]] (1984){{snd}} and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The <code>/?</code> pair also dates to the No. 2, and the <code>,&lt; .&gt;</code> pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift <code>,</code> (comma) or <code>.</code> (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the <code>;:</code> pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly <code>-* =+</code>) to <code>:* ;+ -=</code>.\n\nSome common characters were not included, notably <code>\u00bd\u00bc\u00a2</code>, while <code>^`~</code> were included as diacritics for international use, and <code>&lt;&gt;</code> for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters <code>\\|</code> (in addition to common <code>/</code>). The ''@'' symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented ''\u00c0'' in the French variation, so the ''@'' was placed in position 40<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>, right before the letter A.<ref name=\"Mackenzie_1980\"/>{{rp|243}}\n\nThe control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[End of Message|end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), \"who are you?\" (WRU), \"are you?\" (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK).

NO-WS-CTL.)</ref> Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.\n\nThe original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of \"delete\".\n\nProbably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|Delete]]) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (code 7, BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character.  Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as \"delete previous character\" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.\n\nWhen a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, \"transmit on\") caused the tape reader to resume.  This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a \"handshaking\" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.  The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and <s>TAPE</s> respectively.<ref name=\"McConnell\">{{cite web |title=Understanding ASCII Codes |author-last1=McConnell |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Haynes |author-first2=James |author-last3=Warren |author-first3=Richard |url=http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |access-date=2014-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227190425/http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==== Delete & Backspace ===\n\nThe Teletype could not move the head backwards, so it did not put a key on the keyboard to send a BS (backspace). Instead there was a key marked {{keypress|RUB OUT}} that sent code 127 (DEL). The purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a hand-typed paper tape: the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up, then type the rubout, which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |title=Re: editor and word processor history (was: Re: RTF for emacs) |author=Barry Margolin |mailing-list=help-gnu-emacs |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133149/http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], so these systems had to use the available key and thus the DEL code to erase the previous character.<ref name=\"pdp-6-monitor-manual\">{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |title=PDP-6 Multiprogramming System Manual |page=43 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1965 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140253/http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"pdp-10-monitor-manual\">{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |title=PDP-10 Reference Handbook, Book 3, Communicating with the Monitor |at=p. 5-5 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1969 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115083418/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Because of this, DEC video terminals (by default) sent the DEL code for the key marked \"Backspace\" while the key marked \"Delete\" sent an escape sequence, while many other terminals sent BS for the Backspace key. The Unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character, this could be set to BS ''or'' DEL, but not both, resulting in a long period of annoyance where users had to correct it depending on what terminal they were using (shells that allow line editing, such as [[KornShell|ksh]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], and [[Z shell|zsh]], understand both). The assumption that no key sent a BS caused Control+H to be used for other purposes, such as the \"help\" prefix command in [[GNU Emacs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html|title=Help - GNU Emacs Manual|access-date=July 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711223750/https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html|archive-date=July 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Escape ====\nMany more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The \"escape\" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of \"escape\" encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called \"[[ANSI escape code]]\" (or, more properly, a \"[[Control Sequence Introducer]]\") from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors, beginning with ESC followed by a \"<nowiki>[</nowiki>\" (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (system call)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.\n\n==== End of Line ===\n\nThe inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring \"plain text\" files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both \"Carriage Return\" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and \"Line Feed\" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name \"Carriage Return\" comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.\n\n[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]]) would work. By the time so-called \"glass TTYs\" (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When [[Gary Kildall]] created [[CP/M]] he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[RT-11]]. Until the introduction of [[PC DOS]] in 1981, [[IBM]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. IBM's [[PC DOS]] (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on CP/M,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|title=Is DOS a Rip-Off of CP/M?|author=Tim Paterson|date=August 8, 2007|website=DosMan Drivel|author-link=Tim Paterson|access-date=April 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420075137/http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|archive-date=April 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Windows]] inherited it from MS-DOS.\n\nUnfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone.

[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original [[Macintosh OS]], [[Apple DOS]], and [[ProDOS]], on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced these operating systems with the Unix-based [[macOS]] operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well. The Radio Shack [[TRS-80]] also used a lone CR to terminate lines.\n\nComputers attached to the [[ARPANET]] included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and [[TENEX (operating system)|TENEX]] using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as [[OS/360]] that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used [[EBCDIC]] rather than ASCII.  The [[Telnet]] protocol defined an ASCII \"[[Network Virtual Terminal]]\" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. Telnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.<ref name=\"RFC-158\">{{citation |title=TELNET Protocol |rfc=158 |pages=4\u20135 |author-first=T. |author-last=O'Sullivan |date=1971-05-19 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc158 |access-date=2013-01-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613202223/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc158 |archive-date=2016-06-13}}</ref> The [[File Transfer Protocol]] adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode.<ref name=\"RFC-542\">{{citation |title=File Transfer Protocol |rfc=542 |author-first=Nancy J. |author-last=Neigus |date=1973-08-12 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc542 |access-date=2013-01-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613202314/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc542 |archive-date=2016-06-13}}</ref><ref name=\"RFC-765\">{{citation |title=File Transfer Protocol |rfc=765 |author-first=Jon |author-last=Postel |author-link=Jon Postel |date=June 1980 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc765 |access-date=2013-01-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613202356/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc765 |archive-date=2016-06-13}}</ref> This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for E-mail and the World Wide Web, on systems not using the NVT's CR-LF line-ending convention.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EOLTranslationPlan |title=EOL translation plan for Mercurial |publisher=Mercurial |access-date=2017-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616235536/https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EOLTranslationPlan |archive-date=June 16, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bare LFs in SMTP |url=http://cr.yp.to/docs/smtplf.html |author-first=Daniel J. |author-last=Bernstein |author-link=Daniel J.

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the \"rubout\" code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo \"<code>^H</code>\" for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{key press|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.}}\n|}\n\nOther representations might be used by specialist equipment, for example [[ISO 2047]] graphics or [[hexadecimal]] numbers.\n\n==={{anchor|ASCII-printable-characters}}Printable characters===\n<!-- Anchor linked to from redirects -->\nCodes 20<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub> to 7E<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[punctuation mark]]s, and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Some computer languages used characters in 1961 ASCII such as up arrow and left arrow. These characters disappeared from 1968 ASCII. We worked with Fred Mocking, who by now was in Sales at [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]], on a type cylinder that would compromise the changing characters so that the meanings of 1961 ASCII were not totally lost. The underscore character was made rather wedge-shaped so it could also serve as a left arrow.}}</ref>\n\n<!-- To be more useful this list should be expanded to include the character names and reflect

For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters.\n\nMany other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. [[\u00e9]], [[\u00f1]], [[\u00df]], [[\u0141]]), currency symbols (e.g. [[\u00a3]], [[\u00a5]]), etc. See also [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia).\n\nIt would share most characters in common, but assign other locally useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for \"national use\". However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967<ref name=\"Mar\u00e9chal_1967\">{{citation |author-last=Mar\u00e9chal |author-first=R. |title=ISO/TC 97 \u2013 Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052 |date=1967-12-22}}</ref> caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.\n\nISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.\n\nBecause the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to \"national use\" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as\n\n:<code>\u00e4 a\u00c4i\u00dc = '\u00d6n'; \u00fc</code>\n\ninstead of\n\n:<code>{ a[i] = '\\n'; }</code>\n\n[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or [[Usenet]]) contained \"{, }\" and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get \"N{ jag har sm|rg}sar\" as the answer, which should be \"N\u00e4 jag har sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sar\" meaning \"No I've got sandwiches\".\n\n==={{anchor|8-bit}}8-bit codes===\n{{Main|Extended ASCII|ISO/IEC 8859}}{{See also|UTF-8}}\n<!-- to be mentioned [[USASCII-8]] -->\nEventually, as 8-, [[16-bit|16-]] and [[32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[12-bit|12-]], [[18-bit|18-]] and [[36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.\n\nEncodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.\n\nMost early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics. [[Kaypro]] [[CP/M]] computers used the \"upper\" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet.\n\nThe [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their [[8-bit]] systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] 8-bit computers and [[Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants.\n\nThe IBM PC defined [[code page 437]], which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]] as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined [[Mac OS Roman]] and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as [[ISO-8859-1]]), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.  ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when [[UTF-8]] became more common.<ref name=\"UTF-8_2008\"/>\n\n[[ISO/IEC 4873]] introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80\u20139F [[hexadecimal]] range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.<ref name=\"Unicode-5.0_2006\">{{cite book |author=The Unicode Consortium |editor-first=Julie D. |editor-last=Allen |title=The Unicode standard, Version 5.0 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Professional]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, US |isbn=978-0-321-48091-0 |chapter-url=http://unicode.org/book/ch13.pdf |access-date=2015-03-13 |chapter=Chapter 13: Special Areas and Format Characters |page=314}}</ref>\n\n===Unicode===\n{{Main|Unicode|ISO/IEC 10646}}{{See also|Basic Latin (Unicode block)}}\n[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]).\n\nASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly, [[forward compatibility]] is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.<ref>{{cite web |title=utf-8(7)&nbsp;\u2013 Linux manual page |publisher=Man7.org |date=2014-02-26 |url=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |access-date=2014-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232059/http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |archive-date=April 22, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[3568 ASCII]], an asteroid named after the character encoding\n* [[Ascii85]]\n* [[ASCII art]]\n* [[ASCII Ribbon Campaign]]\n* [[Basic Latin (Unicode block)]] (ASCII as a subset of Unicode)\n* [[Extended ASCII]]\n* [[HTML decimal character rendering]]\n* [[List of Unicode characters]]\n* [[Jargon File]], a glossary of computer programmer slang which includes a list of common slang names for ASCII characters\n* [[List of computer character sets]]\n* [[Alt codes]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|40em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em|refs=\n<ref name=\"INCITS_4-1986_R2012\">{{cite web |title=INCITS 4-1986[R2012]: Information Systems - Coded Character Sets - 7-Bit American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII) |date=2012-06-15 |url=https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=796 |access-date=2020-02-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228222040/https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=796 |archive-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"INCITS_4-1986_R2017\">{{cite web |title=INCITS 4-1986[R2017]: Information Systems - Coded Character Sets - 7-Bit American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII) |date=2017-11-02 |orig-year=2017-06-09 |url=https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=1829 |access-date=2020-02-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228221645/https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=1829 |archive-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bemer_1980_Inside\">{{cite book |title=General Purpose Software |chapter=Chapter 1: Inside ASCII |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |date=1980 |series=Best of Interface Age |volume=2 |location=Portland, OR, USA |publisher=dilithium Press |isbn=978-0-918398-37-6 |lccn=79-67462 |chapter-url=http://bookzz.org/dl/1210234/1105c6 |access-date=2016-08-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827000956/http://dlx.bookzz.org/genesis/772000/c80a62495acf1e1a5b966de23c1f989a/_as/%5BInterface_Age_Staff%5D_Best_of_Interface_Age%2C_Volum%28BookZZ.org%29.pdf |archive-date=August 27, 2016 |pages=1\u201350 |postscript=,}} from:\n* {{cite journal |title=Inside ASCII \u2013 Part I |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Interface Age |volume=3 |issue=5 |date=May 1978 |pages=96\u2013102}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Inside ASCII \u2013 Part II |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Interface Age |volume=3 |issue=6 |date=June 1978 |pages=64\u201374}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Inside ASCII \u2013 Part III |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Interface Age |volume=3 |issue=7 |date=July 1978 |pages=80\u201387}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |title=A Proposal for Character Code Compatibility |author-first=Robert William |author-last=Bemer |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=3 |issue=2 |date=1960 |doi=10.1145/366959.366961 |pages=71\u201372}}\n* {{cite web |title=The Babel of Codes Prior to ASCII: The 1960 Survey of Coded Character Sets: The Reasons for ASCII |author-first=Robert William |author-last=Bemer |author-link=Robert William Bemer |date=2003-05-23 |url=http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/SURVEY.HTM |access-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017062654/http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/SURVEY.HTM |archive-date=2013-10-17 |postscript=,}} from:\n** {{cite journal |title=Survey of coded character representation |author-first=Robert William |author-last=Bemer |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=639\u2013641 |date=December 1960 |doi=10.1145/367487.367493}}\n** {{cite journal |title=Survey of punched card codes |author-first1=H.

The winter coat is greyer and less patterned than the summer coat. There are clear black rings on the tail and dark spots on the forehead. The cheeks are white with narrow black stripes running from the corners of the eyes. The chin and throat are also white, merging into the greyish, silky fur of the underparts. Concentric white and black rims around the eyes accentuate their rounded shape. The legs are proportionately shorter than those of other cats, the ears are set very low and wide apart, and the claws are unusually short. The face is shortened compared with other cats, giving it a flattened look. The [[pupil]]s are circular rather than vertical slits.

Both males and females [[scent mark]] their territory. They spend the day in caves, rock crevices, or [[marmot]] burrows, and emerge in the late afternoon to begin hunting. They are not fast runners, and hunt primarily by ambush or stalking, using low vegetation and rocky terrain for cover. They feed largely on [[diurnality|diurnally]] active prey species such as [[gerbil]]s, [[pika]]s, [[vole]]s and [[chukar partridge]]s, and sometimes catch young [[marmot]]s.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe breeding season is relatively short due to the extreme climate in the cat's native range. [[Estrus]] lasts between 26 and 42 hours, which is also shorter than in many other felids. Pallas's cats give birth to a litter of around two to six kittens after a [[gestation]] period of 66 to 75 days, typically in April or May. Such large litters may compensate for a high rate of infant mortality in the harsh environment. The young are born in sheltered dens lined with dried vegetation, feathers, and fur. The kittens weigh around {{convert|90|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth, and have a thick coat of fuzzy fur, which is replaced by the adult coat after around two months. They are able to begin hunting at four months, and reach adult size at six months. Pallas's cats have been reported to live up to 11 years in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n==Threats==\n[[File:WhfPallasCat.JPG|thumb|Female manul: Note the \"pinhole\" shape of its contracted [[pupil]]]]\nThe Pallas's cat has been hunted for its fur in relatively large numbers in [[China]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Russia]]; international trade in manul pelts largely ceased since the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nowell |first=K. |last2=Jackson |first2=P. |chapter=Manul Octobulus manul (Pallas, 1776) |chapterurl=http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/catsgportal/cat-website/catfolk/manul-1.htm |title=Wild Cats: status survey and conservation action plan |publisher=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, Gland, Switzerland |year=1996 }}</ref> About 1,000 hunters of Pallas's cats remain in Mongolia, with a mean estimated take of 2,000 cats per year. Cats are also shot when mistaken for the commonly hunted [[marmot]], and trapped incidentally in both legholds set for wolves and foxes and snares set for marmots and [[hare]]s. They are also killed by Farm Dogs. While Mongolia has not recorded any trophy exports, pelt exports have grown since 2000, with 143 reported exported in 2007.<ref name = iucn/>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe Pallas's cat is listed in [[CITES Appendix II]].

The winter coat is greyer and less patterned than the summer coat. There are clear black rings on the tail and dark spots on the forehead. The cheeks are white with narrow black stripes running from the corners of the eyes. The chin and throat are also white, merging into the greyish, silky fur of the underparts. Concentric white and black rims around the eyes accentuate their rounded shape. The legs are proportionately shorter than those of other cats, the ears are set very low and wide apart, and the claws are unusually short. The face is shortened compared with other cats, giving it a flattened look. The [[pupil]]s are circular rather than vertical slits.

Both males and females [[scent mark]] their territory. They spend the day in caves, rock crevices, or [[marmot]] burrows, and emerge in the late afternoon to begin hunting. They are not fast runners, and hunt primarily by ambush or stalking, using low vegetation and rocky terrain for cover. They feed largely on [[diurnality|diurnally]] active prey species such as [[gerbil]]s, [[pika]]s, [[vole]]s and [[chukar partridge]]s, and sometimes catch young [[marmot]]s.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe breeding season is relatively short due to the extreme climate in the cat's native range. [[Estrus]] lasts between 26 and 42 hours, which is also shorter than in many other felids. Pallas's cats give birth to a litter of around two to six kittens after a [[gestation]] period of 66 to 75 days, typically in April or May. Such large litters may compensate for a high rate of infant mortality in the harsh environment. The young are born in sheltered dens lined with dried vegetation, feathers, and fur. The kittens weigh around {{convert|90|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth, and have a thick coat of fuzzy fur, which is replaced by the adult coat after around two months. They are able to begin hunting at four months, and reach adult size at six months. Pallas's cats have been reported to live up to 11 years in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/>\n\n==Threats==\n[[File:WhfPallasCat.JPG|thumb|Female manul: Note the \"pinhole\" shape of its contracted [[pupil]]]]\nThe Pallas's cat has been hunted for its fur in relatively large numbers in [[China]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Russia]]; international trade in manul pelts largely ceased since the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nowell |first=K. |last2=Jackson |first2=P. |chapter=Manul Octobulus manul (Pallas, 1776) |chapterurl=http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/catsgportal/cat-website/catfolk/manul-1.htm |title=Wild Cats: status survey and conservation action plan |publisher=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, Gland, Switzerland |year=1996 }}</ref> About 1,000 hunters of Pallas's cats remain in Mongolia, with a mean estimated take of 2,000 cats per year.

{"title_page": "Sustainable growth rate", "text_new": "According to [[Profit impact of marketing strategy|PIMS]] (profit impact of marketing strategy), an important lever of business success is growth. Among 37 variables, growth is mentioned as one of the most important variables for success: market share, market growth, marketing expense to sales ratio<ref name=\"Lancaster2001\" /> or a strong market position.<ref name=\"Dibb2005\" /> \n\nThe question how much growth is sustainable is answered by two concepts with different perspectives:\n\n* The '''sustainable growth rate''' ('''SGR''') concept by Robert C. Higgins, describes optimal growth from a financial perspective assuming a given strategy with clear defined financial frame conditions/ limitations. Sustainable growth is defined as the annual percentage of increase in sales that is consistent with a defined financial policy (target debt to equity ratio, target [[dividend payout ratio]], target [[profit margin]], target ratio of [[total assets]] to [[net sales]]). This concept provides a comprehensive financial framework and formula for case/ company specific SGR calculations.<ref name=\"Higgins1977\" />\n* The '''optimal growth''' concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes L\u00f6sch, Bj\u00f6rn Heyden et al. assesses sustainable growth from a total shareholder return creation and profitability perspective\u2014independent of a given strategy, business model and/ or financial frame condition. This concept is based on statistical long-term assessments and is enriched by case examples. It provides an orientation frame for case/ company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting.<ref name=\"Boernsen2011\" />\n\n==From a financial perspective==\n{{seealso|Stock valuation#Growth rate|Earnings growth|Growth stock|PEG ratio}}\n\nThe sustainable growth rate is the growth rate in profits that a company can reasonably achieve, consistent with its established [[financial policy]]. \nAn assumption re the company's sustainable growth rate is a required input to several valuation models\u2014for instance the [[Gordon model]] and other [[discounted cash flow]] models\u2014where this is used in the calculation of continuing or [[terminal value (finance)|terminal value]]; see [[Valuation using discounted cash flows]].  \n\nSeveral formulae are available here.<ref>See for example, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=256987 Valuing Companies by Cash Flow Discounting: Ten Methods and Nine Theories], Pablo Fernandez: University of Navarra - IESE Business School</ref> \nIn general, these link long term profitability targets, [[dividend policy]], and [[capital structure]] assumptions, returning the sustainable, long-run business growth-rate attainable as a function of these. These formulae reflect the general requirement that all assumptions are internally consistent; see {{sectionlink|Financial modeling#Accounting}}.\n\nA check on the formula inputs, and on the resultant growth number, is provided by a respective twofold economic argument. \n(i) The [[microeconomic]] argument: Where the ([[Risk-adjusted return on capital|risk adjusted]]) [[Return on capital]] is significantly higher than achievable in other industries, then this success will attract [[Competition (economics)|competition]]; in the long-run then, the company's returns will tend to those of its industry, in turn tending to the economy; see [[Profit (economics)]]. Formulae inputs - i.e. assumed profit as compared to targeted capital structure -  must be limited correspondingly.\n(ii) The [[macroeconomic]] check: The long-run growth of the company (industry) cannot exceed overall [[economic growth]] by any significant amount - otherwise the company in question would eventually constitute the bulk of the economy; see {{sectionlink|Earnings growth#Relationship with GDP growth}}.  A calculated growth rate, where the given assumptions are input to a growth formula, can then also act a check as to whether [[budget]]s or [[business plan]]s are reasonable.\n\nThe sustainable growth rate may be returned via the following formula: <ref>Chapter 4 in {{cite book | author= Robert C. Higgins | title=Analysis for Financial Management (12th Edition) | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location= | year=2018| isbn=978-1259918964}}</ref>  \n\n:'''SGR = (pm*(1-d)*(1+L)) / (T-(pm*(1-d)*(1+L)))''' \n:* pm is  the existing and target profit margin\n:* d is the target dividend payout ratio\n:* L is the target total debt to equity ratio\n:* T is the ratio of total assets to sales\n\nNote that the model presented here, assumes several simplifications: \nthe [[profit margin]] remains stable; \nthe proportion of assets and sales remains stable; \nrelated, the value of existing assets is maintained after [[depreciation]]; \nthe company maintains its current capital structure and dividend payout policy.\n\n==Optimal growth rates from a total shareholder value creation and profitability perspective==\n'''Optimal growth''' according to Martin Handschuh, Hannes L\u00f6sch and Bj\u00f6rn Heyden is the growth rate which assures sustainable company development \u2013 considering the long-term relationship between revenue growth, total [[shareholder value]] creation and profitability. \nAssessment basis: The work is based on assessments on the performance of more than 3500 stock-listed companies with an initial revenue of greater 250 million Euro globally and across industries over a period of 12 years from 1997 till 2009. Due to this long time period, the authors consider their findings as to a large extent independent of specific economic cycles.<ref name=\"Boernsen2011\" />\n\n===Relationship between revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability===\nIn the long-term and across industries, total shareholder value creation (stock price development plus dividend payments) rises steadily with increasing revenue growth rates.

Among 37 variables, growth is mentioned as one of the most important variables for success: market share, market growth, marketing expense to sales ratio<ref name=\"Lancaster2001\" /> or a strong market position.<ref name=\"Dibb2005\" /> \n\nThe question how much growth is sustainable is answered by two concepts with different perspectives:\n\n* The '''sustainable growth rate''' ('''SGR''') concept by Robert C. Higgins, describes optimal growth from a financial perspective assuming a given strategy with clear defined financial frame conditions/ limitations. Sustainable growth is defined as the annual percentage of increase in sales that is consistent with a defined financial policy (target debt to equity ratio, target [[dividend payout ratio]], target [[profit margin]], target ratio of [[total assets]] to [[net sales]]). This concept provides a comprehensive financial framework and formula for case/ company specific SGR calculations.<ref name=\"Higgins1977\" />\n* The '''optimal growth''' concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes L\u00f6sch, Bj\u00f6rn Heyden et al. assesses sustainable growth from a total shareholder return creation and profitability perspective\u2014independent of a given strategy, business model and/ or financial frame condition. This concept is based on statistical long-term assessments and is enriched by case examples. It provides an orientation frame for case/ company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting.<ref name=\"Boernsen2011\" />\n\n==From a financial perspective==\n{{seealso|Stock valuation#Growth rate|Earnings growth|Growth stock|PEG ratio}}\n\nThe sustainable growth rate is the growth rate in profits that a company can reasonably achieve, consistent with its established [[financial policy]]. \nAn assumption re the company's sustainable growth rate is a required input to several valuation models\u2014for instance the [[Gordon model]] and other [[discounted cash flow]] models\u2014where this is used in the calculation of continuing or [[terminal value (finance)|terminal value]]; see [[Valuation using discounted cash flows]].  \n\nSeveral formulae are available here.<ref>See for example, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=256987 Valuing Companies by Cash Flow Discounting: Ten Methods and Nine Theories], Pablo Fernandez: University of Navarra - IESE Business School</ref> \nIn general, these link long term profitability targets, [[dividend policy]], and [[capital structure]] assumptions, returning the sustainable, long-run business growth-rate attainable as a function of these. These formulae reflect the general requirement that all assumptions are internally consistent; see {{sectionlink|Financial modeling#Accounting}}.\n\nA check on the formula inputs, and on the resultant growth number, is provided by a respective twofold economic argument. \nThe [[microeconomic]] argument: Where the ([[Risk-adjusted return on capital|risk adjusted]]) [[Return on capital]] is significantly higher than achievable in other industries, then this success will attract [[Competition (economics)|competition]]; in the long-run then, the company's returns will tend to those of its industry, in turn tending to the economy; see [[Profit (economics)]]. Formulae inputs - i.e. assumed profit as compared to targeted capital structure -  must be limited correspondingly.\nThe [[macroeconomic]] check: The long-run growth of the company (industry) cannot exceed overall [[economic growth]] by any significant amount - otherwise the company in question would eventually constitute the bulk of the economy; see {{sectionlink|Earnings growth#Relationship with GDP growth}}.  A calculated growth rate, where the given assumptions are input to a growth formula, can then also act a check as to whether [[budget]]s or [[business plan]]s are reasonable.\n\nThe sustainable growth rate may be returned via the following formula: <ref>Chapter 4 in {{cite book | author= Robert C. Higgins | title=Analysis for Financial Management (12th Edition) | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location= | year=2018| isbn=978-1259918964}}</ref>  \n\n:'''SGR = (pm*(1-d)*(1+L)) / (T-(pm*(1-d)*(1+L)))''' \n:* pm is  the existing and target profit margin\n:* d is the target dividend payout ratio\n:* L is the target total debt to equity ratio\n:* T is the ratio of total assets to sales\n\nNote that the model presented here, assumes several simplifications: \nthe [[profit margin]] remains stable; \nthe proportion of assets and sales remains stable; \nrelated, the value of existing assets is maintained after [[depreciation]]; \nthe company maintains its current capital structure and dividend payout policy.\n\n==Optimal growth rates from a total shareholder value creation and profitability perspective==\n'''Optimal growth''' according to Martin Handschuh, Hannes L\u00f6sch and Bj\u00f6rn Heyden is the growth rate which assures sustainable company development \u2013 considering the long-term relationship between revenue growth, total [[shareholder value]] creation and profitability. \nAssessment basis: The work is based on assessments on the performance of more than 3500 stock-listed companies with an initial revenue of greater 250 million Euro globally and across industries over a period of 12 years from 1997 till 2009. Due to this long time period, the authors consider their findings as to a large extent independent of specific economic cycles.<ref name=\"Boernsen2011\" />\n\n===Relationship between revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability===\nIn the long-term and across industries, total shareholder value creation (stock price development plus dividend payments) rises steadily with increasing revenue growth rates.
