The victory checked the spread of Umayyad control westward from [[Narbonne]] into Aquitaine.\n\n==The battle==\nAl-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, the ''wali'' (governor) of [[Al-Andalus]], built up a strong army from Umayyad territories to conquer [[Aquitaine]], a large duchy in the southwest of modern-day [[France]], formally under [[Franks|Frankish]] sovereignty, but in practice almost independent in the hands of the dukes of Aquitaine. Ian Meadows states that Al-Samh's aim was to take the Garonne River valley, capture Toulouse and open up a vast territory stretching all the way to the Atlantic and back south through Andalusia to the Mediterranean and the Maghrib.<ref name=Meadows>[https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/199302/the.arabs.in.occitania.htm Ian Meadows, \"The Arabs in Occitania\", Arab and Islamic Cultures and Connections, Archive: Saudi Aramco World]</ref>\n\nAl-Samh's army included siege engines, infantry, a few horsemen and a number of mercenaries, as well as Basque slingers. He besieged the city of [[Toulouse]], then Aquitaine's most important city. Duke Odo of Aquitaine, also known as Eudes, was not in the city when it was besieged, having left to find help. He asked the assistance of [[Charles Martel]], who in turn preferred to wait and see rather than help his southern rival.<ref name=Meadows/> \n\nOdo returned three months later with Aquitanian, Gascon, and Frankish troops, and just as the city was about to surrender, attacked the Umayyad invasion force on June 9. The exact origin of the Frankish troops is not certain, but they may have hailed from southern Aquitanian areas, e.g., in the Lower Rhone, where naturalized Franks had settled down decades or centuries before. After Odo originally fled, the Umayyads became overconfident, and instead of maintaining strong outer defenses around their siege camp, and continuously scouting, did neither. Thus, when Odo returned, he was able to launch an assault on the siege force, both from behind and from forces within the walls. The surprised Umayyads scattered with the first attack. Odo's forces cut down units that were resting or fled without weapons or armour.\n\nAl-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani managed to get away with a fraction of his forces, but died shortly thereafter, leaving [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi]] (721-725) as governor. The number of soldiers who engaged in the battle has been grossly inflated to about 300,000 on Odo's side (Al-Maqqari), and a death-toll of 375,000 on the assaulting Umayyad troops.<ref name=Meadows/> The figures give a rough idea of the scale of the confrontation.\n\nA miracle is associated with the battle according to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'': [[Pope Gregory II]] had sent Odo \"three blessed sponges/baskets of bread\" in 720, which the Duke kept until just before the engagement. He distributed small portions of these to be eaten by his troops at Toulouse, and after the battle, it was reported that no one who had eaten the bread had been killed or wounded.<ref>Mann, pgs. 165\u2013166</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nArab historians agree that the Battle of Toulouse was a total disaster for the Arabs. After the defeat, some Umayyad officials and soldiers managed to escape, among them [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]]. However, the clash halted indefinitely the Umayyad expansion northwards. Al-Andalus was at the time re-organising into a new post-Gothic order. The Umayyads kept the military initiative raiding several times the south of Gaul (up to [[Autun]] in 725), but avoided new serious campaigns into the north-west.\n\nOdo's victory earned him widespread renown in Aquitaine and recognition abroad, he came up reinforced. He was hailed as champion of Christianity by the Pope in Rome, and was even presented with gifts. Charles steered clear of the political and military developments in the south of Gaul for another 10 years, until 732.\n\nSome authors have called the fateful engagement the ''Balat Al Shuhada'' of Toulouse;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Copp\u00e9e |first1=Henry |authorlink1=Copp\u00e9e |title=History of the Conquest of Spain by the Arab Moors, With a Sketch of the Civilization Which They Achieved, and Imparted to Europe|volume=Vol II|year=2002 |origyear=1881 |publisher=Gorgias Press  |page= 13 | isbn=1-931956-94-4|ref=harv}}</ref> others attach that name exclusively to the Battle of Poitiers (Tours).

However, nearly all historians agree that the [[Christians|Christian]] victory at Toulouse was important in a [[macrohistorical]] sense in that it gave Charles Martel badly needed time to strengthen his grip on power and build the veteran army which stood him in such good stead eleven years later at Tours. The eleven years between Toulouse and Tours without question gave him time to fully secure power, inspire the loyalty of his troops, and, most importantly, drill the core of veterans who stood so stoutly in 732.\n\nWhile Odo faded into history after his horrific defeat at [[Battle of the River Garonne|Bordeaux]], the Battle of Toulouse is important as it bought time for Martel to prepare for the invasion mounted by Abd al Rahman in 732. However, others (e.g. Archibald Lewis, Roger Collins, etc.) hold that Umayyad attacks were raids or razzias, like the one reaching as far north as Autun in 725, and not real attempts to conquer Francia. While Odo is forgotten, Martel was hailed in later times as the \"savior of [[Europe]]\" by many Western and European authors and academic figures.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gibbon, Edward.

Gen. [[George M. Parker (general)|George M. Parker Jr.]], controlled a zone east and south of [[Manila]]. Parker had the PA [[41st Division (Philippines)|41st]] and [[51st Infantry Division (United States)|51st Infantry Division]]s and the 2nd Provisional Artillery Group of two batteries of the US 86th [[Field Artillery]] [[Regiment]] (PS).\n\nThe ''[[Visayan\u2013Mindanao Force]]'' under Brig. Gen. [[William F. Sharp]] comprised the PA [[61st Division (Philippines)|61st]], [[81st Division (Philippines)|81st]], and [[101st Division (Philippines)|101st Infantry Divisions]], reinforced after the start of the war by the newly inducted 73rd and 93rd Infantry Regiments. The 61st Division was located on [[Panay]], the 81st on [[Cebu]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]], and the 101st on [[Mindanao]]. In January a fourth division, the [[102nd Division (Philippines)|102nd]], was created on Mindanao from the field artillery regiments of the 61st and 81st Divisions acting as infantry (they had no artillery pieces), and the 103rd Infantry of the 101st Division. The 2nd Infantry of the Philippine Army's 1st Regular Division and the 2nd Battalion of the [[43d Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 43rd Infantry (Philippine Scouts)]] were also made a part of the Mindanao Force.\n\nUSAFFE's ''Reserve Force'', under MacArthur's direct control, was composed of the Philippine Division, the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Division]] (PA), and headquarters units from the PA and Philippine Department, positioned just north of Manila. The 192nd and 194th Tank Battalions formed the separate Provisional Tank Group, also under MacArthur's direct command, at [[Clark Field]]/[[Fort Stotsenburg]], where they were positioned as a mobile defense against any attempt by airborne units to seize the field.\n\nFour U.S. [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]] regiments guarded the entrance to [[Manila Bay]], including [[Corregidor Island]]. Across a narrow 3&nbsp;kilometre (2&nbsp;mi) strait of water from Bataan on Corregidor was [[Fort Mills]], defended by batteries of the 59th and 60th Coast Artillery Regiments (the latter an anti-aircraft unit), and the 91st and 92nd Coast Artillery Regiments (Philippine Scouts) of the [[Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays]]. The 59th CA acted as a supervisory unit for the batteries of all units positioned on [[Fort Hughes|Forts Hughes]], [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|Drum]], [[Fort Frank|Frank]], and [[Fort Wint|Wint]]. The majority of the forts had been built circa 1910-1915 and, except for Fort Drum and Battery Monja on Corregidor, were unprotected against air and high-angle artillery attack except by camouflage.<ref>Shelby Stanton (1984).

Gen. [[Lewis H. Brereton]]. Previously the Philippine Department Air Force and Air Force USAFFE, the air force was activated on 16 November 1941 and was the largest USAAF combat air organization outside the United States. Its primary combat power in December 1941 consisted of 91 serviceable [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Warhawk]] fighters and 34 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, with further modern aircraft en route. Tactically the FEAF was part of the Reserve Force, so that it fell under MacArthur's direct command.\n\nAs of 30 November 1941, the strength of US Army Troops in the Philippines, including Philippine units, was 31,095, consisting of 2,504 officers and\n28,591 enlisted (16,643 Americans and 11,957 Philippine Scouts).<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_3.htm#p49 STRENGTH AND COMPOSITION OF U.S. ARMY TROOPS IN PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, 30 NOVEMBER 1941]</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nMacArthur's mobilization plans called for induction of the ten reserve divisions between 1 September and 15 December 1941. The timetable was met on 1 September with the induction of one regiment per division, but slowed as a lack of facilities and equipment hampered training. The second regiments of the divisions were not called up until 1 November, and the third regiments were not organized until after hostilities began. Training was also seriously inhibited by language difficulties between the American cadres and the Filipino troops, and by the many differing dialects (estimated at 70) of the numerous ethnic groups comprising the army. By the outbreak of war, only two-thirds of the army had been mobilized, but additions to the force continued with the induction of the Constabulary and a portion of the regular army, until a force of approximately 130,000 men was reached.\n\nThe most crucial equipment shortfalls were in rifles and divisional light artillery. MacArthur requested 84,500 [[M1 Garand]] rifles to replace the World War I [[M1917 Enfield]]s equipping the PA, of which there were adequate numbers, but the War Department denied the request because of production difficulties. The divisions had only 20% of their artillery requirements, and while plans had been approved to significantly reduce this gap, the arrangements came too late to be implemented before war isolated the Philippines.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_3.htm#p32 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 35-36.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the Philippine Division was adequately manned, equipped, and trained. MacArthur received immediate approval to modernize it by reorganizing it as a mobile \"triangular\" division. Increasing the authorized size of the Philippine Scouts was not politically viable (because of resentments within the less-well-paid Philippine Army), so MacArthur's plan also provided for freeing up Philippine Scouts to round out other units. The transfer of the American [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|34th Infantry]] from the [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]] in the United States to the Philippine Division, accompanied by two field artillery battalions to create a pair of complete [[regimental combat team]]s, was actually underway when war broke out. The deployment ended with the troops still in the United States, where they were sent to defend Hawaii instead.\n\n====Other defense forces====\nThe [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] and [[United States Naval Districts|16th Naval District]], based at Manila, provided the naval defenses for the Philippines. Commanded by Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]], the surface combatants of the Asiatic Fleet were the heavy cruiser {{USS|Houston|CA-30|6}}, the light cruiser {{USS|Marblehead|CL-12|6}}, and 13 [[Clemson-class destroyer|World War I-era destroyers]].<ref>[http://www.asiaticfleet.com/orbat.htm United States Asiatic Fleet], complete Order of Battle including patrol craft of 16th Naval District.</ref> Its primary striking power lay in the 23 modern submarines assigned to the Asiatic Fleet. Submarine Squadron (SUBRON) Two consisted of 6 [[Salmon class submarine]]s, and SUBRON Five of 11 [[United States Porpoise class submarine|Porpoise]] and [[Sargo class submarine]]s. In September 1941, naval patrol forces in the Philippines were augmented by the arrival of the six [[PT boat]]s of [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three]]. Likewise, the China [[Yangtze Patrol]] gunboats also became part of the Philippine naval defenses: {{USS|Asheville|PG-21|6}} (sunk south of Java 3 March 1942), {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} (lost 2 May 1942), {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} (scuttled 6 May 1942 but salvaged by the Japanese), {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} (sunk 5 May 1942), and {{USS|Quail|AM-15|6}} (scuttled 5 May 1942). In December 1941, the naval forces were augmented by the schooner {{USS|Lanikai|1914|6}}.\n\nThe U.S. [[4th Marine Regiment]], stationed in Shanghai, China, since the late 1920s, had anticipated a withdrawal from China during the summer of 1941. As personnel were routinely transferred back to the United States or separated from the service, the regimental commander, Col. [[Samuel L. Howard]], arranged unofficially for all replacements to be placed in the 1st Special Defense Battalion, based at [[Cavite]]. When the 4th Marines arrived in the Philippines on 30 November 1941, it incorporated the Marines at Cavite and [[Olongapo Naval Station]]s into its understrength ranks.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_29.htm#p527 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 528-529. The [[Beijing|Peking]] and [[Chinwangtao]] detachments of the 4th were stranded in China by the onset of war. The 4th Marines had only two battalions, each organized into a machine gun company and two rifle companies of only two platoons each. The amalgamation of the 1st Special Defense Battalion, Cavite, enabled the 4th to organize a third battalion, and Marines of the Marine Barracks Olangapo enabled the 1st and 2nd Battalions to field three rifle companies of three platoons each.</ref> An initial plan to divide the 4th into two regiments, mixing each with a battalion of Philippine Constabulary, was discarded after Howard showed reluctance, and the 4th was stationed on [[Corregidor]] to augment the defenses there, with details detached to Bataan to protect USAFFE headquarters.\n\nAdditionally the U.S. [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]], a paramilitary survey force, operated in [[Manila]] with the ship [[USC&GSS Pathfinder (1899\u20131941)|USC&GSS ''Research'']].<ref Name=Pt5>{{cite web |url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/web/about_ngs/history/WWII-HISTORY-DOC-5-CGS.pdf |title=World War II History of the Department Of Commerce-Part 5 U.S. Coast And Geodetic Survey |author=Coast And Geodetic Survey |year=1951 |website= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Far East Air Force controversy==\nNews reached the Philippines that an [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was in progress at 2:20&nbsp;am local time on 8 December 1941.<ref name=Couttie2009p101>{{cite book |title=\"Chew the Bones: Maddog Essays on Philippine History |chapter=17.

In the meantime, Japanese plans to attack Clark and Iba Fields using land-based naval bombers and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighters were delayed six hours by fog at its Formosa bases, so that only a small scale Japanese Army mission attacked targets in the northern tip of Luzon. At 08:00&nbsp;am, Brereton received a phone call from Gen. [[Henry H. Arnold]] warning him not to allow his aircraft to be attacked while still on the ground.

All three pursuit squadrons began to run short on fuel and broke off their patrols at the same time.\n\nThe 20th Pursuit Squadron's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40B]] interceptors patrolled the area while the bombers landed at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]] between 10:30 and 10:45, then dispersed to their revetments for servicing.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> The 17th Pursuit Squadron, based at [[Nichols Field]], also landed at Clark and had its aircraft refueled while its pilots ate lunch, then put its pilots on alert shortly after 11:00.<ref>Edmunds, p. 83.</ref> All but two of the Clark Field B-17s were on the ground.<ref>Edmunds, p. 84.

It alerted FEAF headquarters and the command post at Clark Field, a warning that reached only the pursuit group commander, Major Orrin L. Grover, who apparently became confused by multiple and conflicting reports.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/><ref name=\"Correll, Caught on the Ground\" /> The 3rd Pursuit Squadron took off from Iba at 11:45 with instructions to intercept the western force, which was thought to have Manila as its target, but dust problems during its takeoff resulted in the fragmentation of its flights. Two flights of the 21st Pursuit Squadron (PS) at Nichols Field, six P-40Es, took off at 11:45, led by 1st Lt. [[William Dyess]]. They started for Clark but were diverted to Manila Bay as a second line of defense if the 3rd PS failed to intercept its force. The 21st's third flight, taking off five minutes later, headed toward Clark, although engine problems with its brand-new P-40Es reduced its numbers by two. The 17th Pursuit Squadron took off at 12:15&nbsp;pm from Clark, ordered to patrol Bataan and Manila Bay, while the 34th PS at Del Carmen never received its orders to protect Clark Field and did not launch.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> The 20th PS, dispersed at Clark, was ready to take off but did not receive orders from group headquarters.

Edmunds interviewed numerous officers present when the attack began.</ref> they achieved tactical surprise. Two squadrons of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]] were dispersed on the ground. Most of the P-40s of the 20th PS were preparing to taxi and were struck by the first wave of 27 Japanese twin-engine [[Mitsubishi G3M]] \"Nell\" bombers; only four of the 20th PS P-40Bs managed to take off as the bombs were falling.\n\nA second bomber attack (26 [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" bombers) followed closely, then escorting Zero fighters strafed the field for 30 minutes, destroying 12 of the 17 American heavy bombers present and seriously damaging three others. Two damaged B-17s were made flyable and taken to Mindanao, where one was destroyed in a ground collision.<ref>Correll, ''Caught on the Ground''.</ref>\n\nA near-simultaneous attack on the auxiliary field at Iba to the northwest by 54 \"Betty\" bombers was also successful: all but four of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron's P-40s, short on fuel and caught in their landing pattern, were destroyed in combat or by lack of fuel.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 95\u201397. Four of the 18 airborne P-40s made Rosario airfield, while a fifth took off from Iba and found refuge there also.</ref> Twelve P-40s from the 20th (four), 21st (two), and 3rd (six) Squadrons attacked the strafers but with little success, losing at least four of their own.\n\nThe Far East Air Force lost half its planes in the 45-minute attack, and was all but destroyed over the next few days, including a number of the surviving B-17s lost to takeoff crashes of other planes.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> The 24th Pursuit Group flew its last interception on 10 December, losing 11 of the 40 or so P-40s it sent up, and the surviving P-35s of the 34th PS were destroyed on the ground at Del Carmen.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 133\u2013136.</ref> That night FEAF combat strength had been reduced to 12 operable B-17s, 22 P-40s, and 8 P-35s.<ref>Edmunds, p. 138.</ref> Fighter strength fluctuated daily until 24 December, when USAFFE ordered all its forces into Bataan. Until then P-40s and P-35s were cobbled together from spare parts taken from wrecked airplanes, and still crated P-40Es were assembled at the Philippine Air Depot. Clark Field was abandoned as a bomber field on 11 December after being used as a staging base for a handful of B-17 missions.<ref>Edmunds, p. 133.</ref> Between 17 and 20 December, the 14 surviving B-17s were withdrawn to Australia. Every other aircraft of the FEAF was destroyed or captured.<ref>Edmunds, p. 178.</ref>\n\nNo formal investigation took place regarding this failure as occurred in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. After the war, Brereton and Sutherland in effect blamed each other for FEAF being surprised on the ground, and MacArthur released a statement that he had no knowledge of any recommendation to attack Formosa with B-17s.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> Walter D. Edmunds summarized the disaster: \"in the Philippines the personnel of our armed forces almost without exception failed to assess accurately the weight, speed, and efficiency of the Japanese Air Force.\" He quoted Maj. Gen. [[Emmett O'Donnell Jr.]], then a major in charge of the B-17s sent to Mindanao, as concluding that the first day was a \"disorganized business\" and that no one was \"really at fault\" because no one was \"geared for war.\"<ref>Edmunds, p. 93.</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\n\n===Initial landings===\n[[File:Invasion of the Philippines, 1941.jpg|thumb|300px|A map of Luzon Island showing Japanese landings and advances from 8 December 1941 to 8 January 1942]]\nThe 14th Army began its invasion with a landing on [[Japanese Invasion of Batan Island|Batan Island]] (not to be confused with Bataan Peninsula), {{convert|120|mi|km}} off the north coast of Luzon, on 8 December 1941, by selected naval infantry units. Landings on [[Camiguin de Babuyanes|Camiguin Island]] and at [[Japanese Invasion of Vigan|Vigan]], [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]], and [[Gonzaga, Cagayan|Gonzaga]] in northern Luzon followed two days later.\n\nTwo B-17s attacked the Japanese ships offloading at Gonzaga. Other B-17s with fighter escort attacked the landings at Vigan. In this last coordinated action of the Far East Air Force, U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports (''[[Japanese transport Oigawa Maru|Oigawa Maru]]'' and ''[[SS Takao Maru (1927)|Takao Maru]]''), the [[cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Naka||2}}, and the [[destroyer]] {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Murasame|1935|2}}, and sank [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] ''[[Japanese minesweeper No. 10 (1938)|W-10]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/naka_t.htm |title=HIJMS NAKA: Tabular Record of Movement |author=Bob Hackett and Sander Kingsepp |year=2007 |accessdate=26 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nEarly on the morning of 12 December, the Japanese landed 2,500 men of the 16th Division at [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] on southern Luzon, {{convert|150|mi|km}} from the nearest American and Philippine forces. The attack on Mindanao followed on 19 December, using elements of the 16th Army temporarily attached to the invasion force to permit the 14th Army to use all its troops on Luzon.\n\nMeanwhile, Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]] withdrew most of his [[U.S. Asiatic Fleet]] from Philippine waters following Japanese air strikes that inflicted heavy damage on U.S. naval facilities at [[Cavite Navy Yard|Cavite]] on 10 December. Only submarines were left to contest Japanese naval superiority, and the commanders of these, conditioned by prewar doctrine that held the fleet submarine to be a scouting vessel more vulnerable to air and anti-submarine attack than it actually was, proved unequal to the task.\n\nIn a book ''A Different Kind of Victory: A Biography of Admiral Thomas C. Hart'' ([[Naval Institute Press]], 1981), James Leutze wrote:\n\n\"He had 27 subs submerged in [[Manila Bay]],...<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 235</ref> it was Washington, not the Asiatic Fleet Commander that directed the fleet to withdraw from Manila.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 230</ref>... Hart was directed by Washington to send US Navy surface forces and submarines southeast toward Australia.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 237</ref>... Douglas MacArthur and [[Henry Stimson]] ([[United States Secretary of War]]) feuding with Admiral Hart over lack of US Navy submarine action. MacArthur asked Admiral Hart: \"What in the world is the matter with your submarines?\".<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 242</ref>.. MacArthur complained that Hart's inactivity allowed Japan's navy freedom of action.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 234</ref>... According to Stimson, MacArthur felt that Hart's ships and submarines were ineffectual, but because Admiral Hart had lost his courage. Admiral Hart's reaction to MacArthur's brickbats: \"He (MacArthur) is inclined to cut my throat and perhaps the Navy in general.\"<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 240</ref>\"\n\n===Main attack===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Withdrawal South Dec 1941.jpg|thumb|300 px|Withdrawal in the South, 25\u201331 December 1941]]\nThe main attack began early on the morning of 22 December as 43,110 men of the 48th Division and one regiment of the 16th Division, supported by artillery and approximately 90 tanks, landed at three points along the east coast of [[Lingayen Gulf]]. A few B-17s flying from Australia attacked the invasion fleet, and U.S. submarines harassed it from the adjacent waters, but to little effect.\n\nGeneral Wainwright's poorly trained and equipped 11th and 71st Divisions (PA) could neither repel the landings nor pin the enemy on the beaches. The remaining Japanese units of the divisions landed farther south along the gulf. The 26th Cavalry (PS), advancing to meet them, put up a strong fight at [[Rosario, La Union|Rosario]], but was forced to withdraw after taking heavy casualties with no hope of sufficient reinforcements. By nightfall, 23 December, the Japanese had moved ten miles (16&nbsp;km) into the interior.\n\nThe next day, 7,000 men of the 16th Division hit the beaches at three locations along the shore of [[Lamon Bay]] in southern Luzon, where they found General Parker's forces dispersed, and without artillery protecting the eastern coast, unable to offer serious resistance. They immediately consolidated their positions and began the drive north toward Manila where they would link up with the forces advancing south toward the capital for the final victory.\n\n===Withdrawal into Bataan===\nThe U.S. Philippine Division moved into the field in reaction to reports of airborne drops near Clark Field, and when this proved false, were deployed to cover the withdrawal of troops into Bataan and to resist Japanese advances in the [[Subic Bay]] area.\n\nOn 24 December, MacArthur invoked the prewar plan WPO-3 (War Plan Orange 3), which called for use of five delaying positions in central Luzon while forces withdrew into Bataan. This was carried out in part by the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Merriam |first=Ray |year=1999 |title=War in the Philippines |publisher=Merriam Press |pages=70\u201382 |isbn=1-57638-164-1 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=utbD8wwF91kC |page=70}}\n| accessdate =31 January 2008\n}}</ref> He relieved General Parker of his command of South Luzon Force and had him begin preparing defensive positions on Bataan, using units as they arrived; both the military headquarters and the Philippines government were moved there. Nine days of feverish movement of supplies into Bataan, primarily by barge from Manila, began in an attempt to feed an anticipated force of 43,000 troops for six months. (Ultimately 80,000 troops and 26,000 refugees flooded Bataan.) Nevertheless, substantial forces remained in other areas for several months.\n\n[[File:Macarthur&wainwright.jpg|thumb|200px|Generals Wainwright (left) and MacArthur]]\nUnits of both defense forces were maneuvered to hold open the escape routes into Bataan, in particular [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], the steel bridges at [[Calumpit, Bulacan|Calumpit]] over the deep [[Pampanga River]] at the north end of Manila Bay, and [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]] north of Manila. The South Luzon Force, despite its inexperience and equivocating orders to withdraw and hold, successfully executed \"leapfrogging\" retrograde techniques and crossed the bridges by 1 January. Japanese air commanders rejected appeals by the 48th Division to bomb the bridges to trap the retreating forces,<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_12.htm#p205 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 208.</ref> which were subsequently demolished by Philippine Scout engineers on 1 January.\n\nThe Japanese realized the full extent of MacArthur's plan on 30 December and ordered the 48th Division to press forward and seal off Bataan. In a series of actions between 2 and 4 January, the 11th and 21st Divisions of the Philippine Army, the 26th Cavalry (PS) and the American [[M3 Stuart]] tanks of the Provisional Tank Group held open the road from San Fernando to [[Dinalupihan]] at the neck of the peninsula for the retreating forces of the South Luzon Force, then made good their own escape. Despite 50% losses in the 194th Tank Battalion during the retreat, the Stuarts and a supporting battery of [[M3 GMC|75mm SPM halftracks]] repeatedly stopped Japanese thrusts and were the final units to enter Bataan.\n\nOn 30 December, the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|American 31st Infantry]] moved to the vicinity of [[Dalton Pass]] to cover the flanks of troops withdrawing from central and southern Luzon, while other units of the Philippine Division organized positions at Bataan. The 31st Infantry then moved to a defensive position on the west side of the [[Olongapo City|Olongapo]]-Manila road, near [[Layac Junction]]\u2014at the neck of Bataan Peninsula\u2014on 5 January 1942. The junction was given up on 6 January, but the withdrawal to Bataan was successful.\n\n==Battle of Bataan==\n{{Main|Battle of Bataan}}\n[[File:Situation on Bataan 8 Jan 1942.jpg|thumb|300 px|Situation on Bataan, 8 January 1942]]\nFrom 7 to 14 January 1942, the Japanese concentrated on reconnaissance and preparations for an attack on the Main Battle Line from [[Abucay, Bataan|Abucay]] to [[Mount Natib]] to Mauban. At the same time, in a critical mistake, they also relieved the 48th Division, responsible for much of the success of Japanese operations, with the much less-capable 65th Brigade, intended as a garrison force. The Japanese 5th Air group was withdrawn from operations on 5 January in preparation for movement with the 48th Division to the [[Netherlands East Indies]].<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V2%20P1/ch6.htm#p103 Japanese Operations in the Southwest Pacific Area], p.104.</ref> U.S. and Filipino forces repelled night attacks near Abucay, and elements of the U.S. Philippine Division counterattacked on 16 January. This failed, and the division withdrew to the Reserve Battle Line from [[Pilar, Bataan|Casa Pilar]] to [[Bagac, Bataan|Bagac]] in the center of the peninsula on 26 January.\n\nThe 14th Army renewed its attacks on 23 January with an attempted amphibious landing behind the lines by a battalion of the 16th Division, then with general attacks beginning 27 January along the battle line. The amphibious landing was disrupted by a [[PT boat]] and contained in brutally dense jungle by ad hoc units made up of U.S. Army Air Corps troops, naval personnel, and Philippine Constabulary. The pocket was then slowly forced back to the cliffs, with high casualties on both sides. Landings to reinforce the surviving pocket on 26 January and 2 February were severely disrupted by air attacks from the few remaining FEAF P-40s, then trapped and eventually annihilated on 13 February.\n\nA penetration in the I Corps line was stopped and broken up into several pockets. General Homma on 8 February ordered the suspension of offensive operations in order to reorganize his forces. This could not be carried out immediately, because the 16th Division remained engaged trying to extricate a pocketed battalion of its 20th Infantry. With further losses, the remnants of the battalion, 378 officers and men, were extricated on 15 February. On 22 February, the 14th Army line withdrew a few miles to the north and USAFFE forces re-occupied the abandoned positions. The result of the \"Battle of the Points\" and \"Battle of the Pockets\" was total destruction of all three battalions of the Japanese 20th Infantry and a clear USAFFE victory.\n\n[[File:Hayward, California. As Bataan fell, as recorded in these newspapers of April 9, 1942, evacuation o . . . - NARA - 536016.jpg|thumb|California newspapers, 9 April 1942]]\nFor several weeks, the Japanese, deterred by heavy losses and reduced to a single brigade, conducted siege operations while waiting refitting and reinforcement. Both armies engaged in patrols and limited local attacks. Because of the worsening Allied position in the Asia-Pacific region, U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered MacArthur to [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|relocate to Australia]], as Supreme Allied Commander [[South West Pacific Area]]. (MacArthur's famous speech regarding the Philippines, in which he said \"I came out of Bataan and I shall return\" was made at [[Terowie, South Australia|Terowie]]\n, [[South Australia]] on 20 March.) Wainwright officially assumed control of what was now termed United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP) on 23 March. During this period, elements of the U.S. Philippine Division were shifted to assist in the defense of other sectors.\n\nBeginning 28 March, a new wave of Japanese air and artillery attacks hit Allied forces who were severely weakened by malnutrition, sickness and prolonged fighting. On 3 April, the Japanese began to break through along [[Mount Samat]], estimating that the offensive would require a month to end the campaign. The U.S. Philippine Division, no longer operating as a coordinated unit and exhausted by five days of nearly continuous combat, was unable to counterattack effectively against heavy Japanese assaults. On 8 April, the U.S. 57th Infantry Regiment (PS) and the 31st Division PA were overrun near the [[Alangan River]]. The U.S. 45th Infantry Regiment (PS), under orders to reach Mariveles and evacuate to Corregidor, finally surrendered on 10 April 1942. Only 300 men of the U.S. 31st Infantry successfully reached Corregidor.\n\n==Battle of Corregidor==\n{{Main|Battle of Corregidor}}\n[[File:Japanese bombers over Corregidor.jpg|thumb|[[Mitsubishi Ki-21|Japanese bombers]] over Corregidor]]\n[[File:Map of Corregidor 1941.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|Map of Corregidor island in 1941]]\nCorregidor was a U.S. Army Coast Artillery position defending the entrance to Manila Bay. It was armed by both older seacoast [[disappearing gun]] batteries of the [[59th Coast Artillery (United States)|59th]] and [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st Coast Artillery]] Regiments (the latter a Philippine Scouts unit), an offshore mine field of approximately 35 groups of [[controlled mines]],<ref name=CAJHarris1>{{cite journal |last1=Bocksel |first1=Arnold A. |year=1946 |title=The USAMP ''General George Harrison'' in the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bay |journal=Coast Artillery Journal |volume=LXXXIX |issue=NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1946 |pages=54 |publisher=United States Coast Artillery Association |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/ada-online/coast-artillery-journal/_docs/1946/11-12/Nov-Dec%201946.pdf |accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref> and an anti-aircraft unit, the [[60th Coast Artillery (United States)|60th CA (AA)]]. The latter was posted on the higher elevations of Corregidor and was able to respond successfully to the Japanese air attacks, downing many fighters and bombers. The older stationary batteries with fixed mortars and immense cannons, for defense from attack by sea, were easily put out of commission by Japanese bombers. The American soldiers and Filipino Scouts defended the small fortress until they had little left to wage a defense.\n\nEarly in 1942, the Japanese air command installed oxygen in its bombers to fly higher than the range of the Corregidor anti-aircraft batteries, and after that time, heavier bombardment began.\n\nIn December 1941, Philippines President Manuel L. Quezon, General MacArthur, other high-ranking military officers and diplomats and families escaped the bombardment of Manila and were housed in Corregidor's [[Malinta Tunnel]]. Prior to their arrival, Malinta's laterals had served as high command headquarters, hospital and storage of food and arms. In March 1942, several U.S. Navy submarines arrived on the north side of Corregidor. The Navy brought in mail, orders, and weaponry. They took away with them the high American and Filipino government officers, gold and silver and other important records. Those who were unable to escape by submarine were eventually military [[POW]]s of Japan or placed in civilian [[concentration camps]] in Manila and other locations.\n\n[[File:Captured Japanese photograph. U.S. soldiers and sailors surrendering to Japanese forces at Corregidor, Philippine... - NARA - 531354.tif|thumb|U.S. and Filipino soldiers and sailors surrendering to Japanese forces at Corregidor]]\nCorregidor was defended by 11,000 personnel, comprising the units mentioned above that were stationed on Corregidor, the [[U.S. 4th Marine Regiment]], and U.S. Navy personnel deployed as infantry. Some were able to get to Corregidor from the Bataan Peninsula when the Japanese overwhelmed the units there. The Japanese began their final assault on Corregidor with an artillery barrage on 1 May. On the night of 5\u20136 May, two battalions of the Japanese 61st Infantry Regiment landed at the northeast end of the island. Despite strong resistance, the Japanese established a beachhead that was soon reinforced by tanks and artillery. The defenders were quickly pushed back toward the stronghold of Malinta Hill.\n\nLate on 6 May, Wainwright asked Homma for terms of surrender. Homma insisted that surrender include all Allied forces in the Philippines. Believing that the lives of all those on Corregidor would be endangered, Wainwright accepted. On 8 May, he sent a message to Sharp, ordering him to surrender the Visayan-Mindanao Force. Sharp complied, but many individuals carried on the fight as [[guerilla warfare|guerrillas]]. Few unit commanders were so hard pressed as to be forced to surrender and none had any desire to surrender. Sharp's decision to surrender involved many factors. Major Larry S. Schmidt, in a 1982 master's degree thesis, said Sharp's decision was based on two reasons: that the Japanese were capable of executing the 10,000 survivors of Corregidor, and that Sharp now knew his forces would not be reinforced by the United States, as had been previously thought.<ref>{{cite thesis|first = Larry S.|last = Schmidt|title = American Involvement in the Filipino Resistance Movement on Mindanao During the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945|type=MMAS |publisher= U.S. Army Command and General Staff College|location = Fort Leavenworth, Kans.|page = 68|url = https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b068659.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|Japanese war crimes}}\n[[File:March of Death - Resting 03.jpg|thumb|Group of American prisoners, May 1942]]\nThe defeat was the beginning of three and a half years of harsh treatment for the Allied survivors, including atrocities like the [[Bataan Death March]] and the misery of Japanese prison camps, and the \"[[Hell Ships]]\" on which American and Allied men were sent to Japan to be used as labor in mines and factories.

The defending forces outnumbered the Japanese by 3 to 2, but were a mixed force of non-combat experienced regular, national guard, constabulary and newly created Commonwealth units.

It was ordered to prepare for war in the event that negotiations with the United States did not succeed in peacefully meeting Japanese objectives. Under Terauchi's command were four corps-equivalent armies, comprising ten divisions and three combined arms brigades, including the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army]]. Operations against the Philippines and Malaya were to be conducted simultaneously when Imperial General Headquarters ordered.\n\nThe invasion of the Philippines had three objectives:\n* To prevent the use of the Philippines as an advance base of operations by American forces\n* To acquire staging areas and supply bases to enhance operations against the Netherlands East Indies\n* To secure the lines of communication between occupied areas in the south and the Japanese Home Islands.\n\n====Invasion forces====\n[[File:Advance Japanese Landings Dec 1941.jpg|thumb|300 px|Advance Japanese landings in the Philippines 8\u201320 December 1941]]\nTerauchi assigned the Philippines invasion to the 14th Army, under the command of Lieutenant General [[Masaharu Homma]].<ref name=Chun>Chun, C., 2012, The Fall of the Philippines, 1941-1942, Oxford: Osprey Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-84908-609-7}}</ref>{{rp|14,20}} Air support of ground operations was provided by the 5th Air Group, under Lieutenant General [[Hideyoshi Obata]],<ref name=Chun/>{{rp|21}} which was transferred to Formosa from Manchuria.

The two divisions used as reserves, the 71st and 91st, were not from Luzon but from the Visayas, and each had only two regiments.</ref>\n\nThe [[South Luzon Force]], activated 13 December 1941 under Brig. Gen. [[George M. Parker (general)|George M. Parker Jr.]], controlled a zone east and south of [[Manila]]. Parker had the PA [[41st Division (Philippines)|41st]] and [[51st Infantry Division (United States)|51st Infantry Division]]s and the 2nd Provisional Artillery Group of two batteries of the US 86th [[Field Artillery]] [[Regiment]] (PS).\n\nThe ''[[Visayan\u2013Mindanao Force]]'' under Brig. Gen. [[William F. Sharp]] comprised the PA [[61st Division (Philippines)|61st]], [[81st Division (Philippines)|81st]], and [[101st Division (Philippines)|101st Infantry Divisions]], reinforced after the start of the war by the newly inducted 73rd and 93rd Infantry Regiments. The 61st Division was located on [[Panay]], the 81st on [[Cebu]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]], and the 101st on [[Mindanao]]. In January a fourth division, the [[102nd Division (Philippines)|102nd]], was created on Mindanao from the field artillery regiments of the 61st and 81st Divisions acting as infantry (they had no artillery pieces), and the 103rd Infantry of the 101st Division. The 2nd Infantry of the Philippine Army's 1st Regular Division and the 2nd Battalion of the [[43d Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 43rd Infantry (Philippine Scouts)]] were also made a part of the Mindanao Force.\n\nUSAFFE's ''Reserve Force'', under MacArthur's direct control, was composed of the Philippine Division, the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Division]] (PA), and headquarters units from the PA and Philippine Department, positioned just north of Manila. The 192nd and 194th Tank Battalions formed the separate Provisional Tank Group, also under MacArthur's direct command, at [[Clark Field]]/[[Fort Stotsenburg]], where they were positioned as a mobile defense against any attempt by airborne units to seize the field.\n\nFour U.S. [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]] regiments guarded the entrance to [[Manila Bay]], including [[Corregidor Island]]. Across a narrow 3&nbsp;kilometre (2&nbsp;mi) strait of water from Bataan on Corregidor was [[Fort Mills]], defended by batteries of the 59th and 60th Coast Artillery Regiments (the latter an anti-aircraft unit), and the 91st and 92nd Coast Artillery Regiments (Philippine Scouts) of the [[Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bays]]. The 59th CA acted as a supervisory unit for the batteries of all units positioned on [[Fort Hughes|Forts Hughes]], [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|Drum]], [[Fort Frank|Frank]], and [[Fort Wint|Wint]]. The majority of the forts had been built circa 1910-1915 and, except for Fort Drum and Battery Monja on Corregidor, were unprotected against air and high-angle artillery attack except by camouflage.<ref>Shelby Stanton (1984).

Gen. [[Lewis H. Brereton]]. Previously the Philippine Department Air Force and Air Force USAFFE, the air force was activated on 16 November 1941 and was the largest USAAF combat air organization outside the United States. Its primary combat power in December 1941 consisted of 91 serviceable [[Curtiss P-40|P-40 Warhawk]] fighters and 34 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, with further modern aircraft en route. Tactically the FEAF was part of the Reserve Force, so that it fell under MacArthur's direct command.\n\nAs of 30 November 1941, the strength of US Army Troops in the Philippines, including Philippine units, was 31,095, consisting of 2,504 officers and\n28,591 enlisted (16,643 Americans and 11,957 Philippine Scouts).<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_3.htm#p49 STRENGTH AND COMPOSITION OF U.S. ARMY TROOPS IN PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, 30 NOVEMBER 1941]</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nMacArthur's mobilization plans called for induction of the ten reserve divisions between 1 September and 15 December 1941. The timetable was met on 1 September with the induction of one regiment per division, but slowed as a lack of facilities and equipment hampered training. The second regiments of the divisions were not called up until 1 November, and the third regiments were not organized until after hostilities began. Training was also seriously inhibited by language difficulties between the American cadres and the Filipino troops, and by the many differing dialects (estimated at 70) of the numerous ethnic groups comprising the army. By the outbreak of war, only two-thirds of the army had been mobilized, but additions to the force continued with the induction of the Constabulary and a portion of the regular army, until a force of approximately 130,000 men was reached.\n\nThe most crucial equipment shortfalls were in rifles and divisional light artillery. MacArthur requested 84,500 [[M1 Garand]] rifles to replace the World War I [[M1917 Enfield]]s equipping the PA, of which there were adequate numbers, but the War Department denied the request because of production difficulties. The divisions had only 20% of their artillery requirements, and while plans had been approved to significantly reduce this gap, the arrangements came too late to be implemented before war isolated the Philippines.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_3.htm#p32 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 35-36.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the Philippine Division was adequately manned, equipped, and trained. MacArthur received immediate approval to modernize it by reorganizing it as a mobile \"triangular\" division. Increasing the authorized size of the Philippine Scouts was not politically viable (because of resentments within the less-well-paid Philippine Army), so MacArthur's plan also provided for freeing up Philippine Scouts to round out other units. The transfer of the American [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|34th Infantry]] from the [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]] in the United States to the Philippine Division, accompanied by two field artillery battalions to create a pair of complete [[regimental combat team]]s, was actually underway when war broke out. The deployment ended with the troops still in the United States, where they were sent to defend Hawaii instead.\n\n====Other defense forces====\nThe [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] and [[United States Naval Districts|16th Naval District]], based at Manila, provided the naval defenses for the Philippines. Commanded by Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]], the surface combatants of the Asiatic Fleet were the heavy cruiser {{USS|Houston|CA-30|6}}, the light cruiser {{USS|Marblehead|CL-12|6}}, and 13 [[Clemson-class destroyer|World War I-era destroyers]].<ref>[http://www.asiaticfleet.com/orbat.htm United States Asiatic Fleet], complete Order of Battle including patrol craft of 16th Naval District.</ref> Its primary striking power lay in the 23 modern submarines assigned to the Asiatic Fleet. Submarine Squadron (SUBRON) Two consisted of 6 [[Salmon class submarine]]s, and SUBRON Five of 11 [[United States Porpoise class submarine|Porpoise]] and [[Sargo class submarine]]s. In September 1941, naval patrol forces in the Philippines were augmented by the arrival of the six [[PT boat]]s of [[Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three]]. Likewise, the China [[Yangtze Patrol]] gunboats also became part of the Philippine naval defenses: {{USS|Asheville|PG-21|6}} (sunk south of Java 3 March 1942), {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} (lost 2 May 1942), {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} (scuttled 6 May 1942 but salvaged by the Japanese), {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} (sunk 5 May 1942), and {{USS|Quail|AM-15|6}} (scuttled 5 May 1942). In December 1941, the naval forces were augmented by the schooner {{USS|Lanikai|1914|6}}.\n\nThe U.S. [[4th Marine Regiment]], stationed in Shanghai, China, since the late 1920s, had anticipated a withdrawal from China during the summer of 1941. As personnel were routinely transferred back to the United States or separated from the service, the regimental commander, Col. [[Samuel L. Howard]], arranged unofficially for all replacements to be placed in the 1st Special Defense Battalion, based at [[Cavite]]. When the 4th Marines arrived in the Philippines on 30 November 1941, it incorporated the Marines at Cavite and [[Olongapo Naval Station]]s into its understrength ranks.<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_29.htm#p527 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 528-529. The [[Beijing|Peking]] and [[Chinwangtao]] detachments of the 4th were stranded in China by the onset of war. The 4th Marines had only two battalions, each organized into a machine gun company and two rifle companies of only two platoons each. The amalgamation of the 1st Special Defense Battalion, Cavite, enabled the 4th to organize a third battalion, and Marines of the Marine Barracks Olangapo enabled the 1st and 2nd Battalions to field three rifle companies of three platoons each.</ref> An initial plan to divide the 4th into two regiments, mixing each with a battalion of Philippine Constabulary, was discarded after Howard showed reluctance, and the 4th was stationed on [[Corregidor]] to augment the defenses there, with details detached to Bataan to protect USAFFE headquarters.\n\nAdditionally the U.S. [[Coast and Geodetic Survey]], a paramilitary survey force, operated in [[Manila]] with the ship [[USC&GSS Pathfinder (1899\u20131941)|USC&GSS ''Research'']].<ref Name=Pt5>{{cite web |url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/web/about_ngs/history/WWII-HISTORY-DOC-5-CGS.pdf |title=World War II History of the Department Of Commerce-Part 5 U.S. Coast And Geodetic Survey |author=Coast And Geodetic Survey |year=1951 |website= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Far East Air Force controversy==\nNews reached the Philippines that an [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] was in progress at 2:20&nbsp;am local time on 8 December 1941.<ref name=Couttie2009p101>{{cite book |title=\"Chew the Bones: Maddog Essays on Philippine History |chapter=17.

In the meantime, Japanese plans to attack Clark and Iba Fields using land-based naval bombers and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighters were delayed six hours by fog at its Formosa bases, so that only a small scale Japanese Army mission attacked targets in the northern tip of Luzon. At 08:00&nbsp;am, Brereton received a phone call from Gen. [[Henry H. Arnold]] warning him not to allow his aircraft to be attacked while still on the ground. FEAF launched three squadron-sized fighter patrols and all of its serviceable bombers on Luzon between 08:00 and 08:30&nbsp;am as a precautionary move.<ref name=\"wde\">{{cite book |last=Edmunds |first=Walter D. |authorlink= |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SX0OOdZEZTIC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=Arnold+%22Brereton%22#v=onepage&q=Arnold%20%22Brereton%22&f=false |title=They Fought With What They Had |work= |accessdate=28 January 2011 |isbn=9781428915411}}, p. 77.</ref> After MacArthur gave Brereton the authorization he sought at 10:15&nbsp;am, the bombers were ordered to land and prepare for the afternoon raid on Formosa. All three pursuit squadrons began to run short on fuel and broke off their patrols at the same time.\n\nThe 20th Pursuit Squadron's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40B]] interceptors patrolled the area while the bombers landed at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]] between 10:30 and 10:45, then dispersed to their revetments for servicing.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> The 17th Pursuit Squadron, based at [[Nichols Field]], also landed at Clark and had its aircraft refueled while its pilots ate lunch, then put its pilots on alert shortly after 11:00.<ref>Edmunds, p. 83.</ref> All but two of the Clark Field B-17s were on the ground.<ref>Edmunds, p. 84.

It alerted FEAF headquarters and the command post at Clark Field, a warning that reached only the pursuit group commander, Major Orrin L. Grover, who apparently became confused by multiple and conflicting reports.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/><ref name=\"Correll, Caught on the Ground\" /> The 3rd Pursuit Squadron took off from Iba at 11:45 with instructions to intercept the western force, which was thought to have Manila as its target, but dust problems during its takeoff resulted in the fragmentation of its flights. Two flights of the 21st Pursuit Squadron (PS) at Nichols Field, six P-40Es, took off at 11:45, led by 1st Lt. [[William Dyess]]. They started for Clark but were diverted to Manila Bay as a second line of defense if the 3rd PS failed to intercept its force. The 21st's third flight, taking off five minutes later, headed toward Clark, although engine problems with its brand-new P-40Es reduced its numbers by two. The 17th Pursuit Squadron took off at 12:15&nbsp;pm from Clark, ordered to patrol Bataan and Manila Bay, while the 34th PS at Del Carmen never received its orders to protect Clark Field and did not launch.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 84\u201385.</ref> The 20th PS, dispersed at Clark, was ready to take off but did not receive orders from group headquarters.

Edmunds interviewed numerous officers present when the attack began.</ref> they achieved tactical surprise. Two squadrons of [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]] were dispersed on the ground. Most of the P-40s of the 20th PS were preparing to taxi and were struck by the first wave of 27 Japanese twin-engine [[Mitsubishi G3M]] \"Nell\" bombers; only four of the 20th PS P-40Bs managed to take off as the bombs were falling.\n\nA second bomber attack (26 [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" bombers) followed closely, then escorting Zero fighters strafed the field for 30 minutes, destroying 12 of the 17 American heavy bombers present and seriously damaging three others. Two damaged B-17s were made flyable and taken to Mindanao, where one was destroyed in a ground collision.<ref>Correll, ''Caught on the Ground''.</ref>\n\nA near-simultaneous attack on the auxiliary field at Iba to the northwest by 54 \"Betty\" bombers was also successful: all but four of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron's P-40s, short on fuel and caught in their landing pattern, were destroyed in combat or by lack of fuel.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 95\u201397. Four of the 18 airborne P-40s made Rosario airfield, while a fifth took off from Iba and found refuge there also.</ref> Twelve P-40s from the 20th (four), 21st (two), and 3rd (six) Squadrons attacked the strafers but with little success, losing at least four of their own.\n\nThe Far East Air Force lost half its planes in the 45-minute attack, and was all but destroyed over the next few days, including a number of the surviving B-17s lost to takeoff crashes of other planes.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> The 24th Pursuit Group flew its last interception on 10 December, losing 11 of the 40 or so P-40s it sent up, and the surviving P-35s of the 34th PS were destroyed on the ground at Del Carmen.<ref>Edmunds, pp. 133\u2013136.</ref> That night FEAF combat strength had been reduced to 12 operable B-17s, 22 P-40s, and 8 P-35s.<ref>Edmunds, p. 138.</ref> Fighter strength fluctuated daily until 24 December, when USAFFE ordered all its forces into Bataan. Until then P-40s and P-35s were cobbled together from spare parts taken from wrecked airplanes, and still crated P-40Es were assembled at the Philippine Air Depot. Clark Field was abandoned as a bomber field on 11 December after being used as a staging base for a handful of B-17 missions.<ref>Edmunds, p. 133.</ref> Between 17 and 20 December, the 14 surviving B-17s were withdrawn to Australia. Every other aircraft of the FEAF was destroyed or captured.<ref>Edmunds, p. 178.</ref>\n\nNo formal investigation took place regarding this failure as occurred in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. After the war, Brereton and Sutherland in effect blamed each other for FEAF being surprised on the ground, and MacArthur released a statement that he had no knowledge of any recommendation to attack Formosa with B-17s.<ref name=\"lmcf\"/> Walter D. Edmunds summarized the disaster: \"in the Philippines the personnel of our armed forces almost without exception failed to assess accurately the weight, speed, and efficiency of the Japanese Air Force.\" He quoted Maj. Gen.

Landings on [[Camiguin de Babuyanes|Camiguin Island]] and at [[Japanese Invasion of Vigan|Vigan]], [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]], and [[Gonzaga, Cagayan|Gonzaga]] in northern Luzon followed two days later.\n\nTwo B-17s attacked the Japanese ships offloading at Gonzaga. Other B-17s with fighter escort attacked the landings at Vigan. In this last coordinated action of the Far East Air Force, U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports (''[[Japanese transport Oigawa Maru|Oigawa Maru]]'' and ''[[SS Takao Maru (1927)|Takao Maru]]''), the [[cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Naka||2}}, and the [[destroyer]] {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Murasame|1935|2}}, and sank [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] ''[[Japanese minesweeper No. 10 (1938)|W-10]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/naka_t.htm |title=HIJMS NAKA: Tabular Record of Movement |author=Bob Hackett and Sander Kingsepp |year=2007 |accessdate=26 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nEarly on the morning of 12 December, the Japanese landed 2,500 men of the 16th Division at [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] on southern Luzon, {{convert|150|mi|km}} from the nearest American and Philippine forces. The attack on Mindanao followed on 19 December, using elements of the 16th Army temporarily attached to the invasion force to permit the 14th Army to use all its troops on Luzon.\n\nMeanwhile, Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]] withdrew most of his [[U.S. Asiatic Fleet]] from Philippine waters following Japanese air strikes that inflicted heavy damage on U.S. naval facilities at [[Cavite Navy Yard|Cavite]] on 10 December. Only submarines were left to contest Japanese naval superiority, and the commanders of these, conditioned by prewar doctrine that held the fleet submarine to be a scouting vessel more vulnerable to air and anti-submarine attack than it actually was, proved unequal to the task.\n\nIn a book ''A Different Kind of Victory: A Biography of Admiral Thomas C. Hart'' ([[Naval Institute Press]], 1981), James Leutze wrote:\n\n\"He had 27 subs submerged in [[Manila Bay]],...<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 235</ref> it was Washington, not the Asiatic Fleet Commander that directed the fleet to withdraw from Manila.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 230</ref>... Hart was directed by Washington to send US Navy surface forces and submarines southeast toward Australia.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 237</ref>... Douglas MacArthur and [[Henry Stimson]] ([[United States Secretary of War]]) feuding with Admiral Hart over lack of US Navy submarine action. MacArthur asked Admiral Hart: \"What in the world is the matter with your submarines?\".<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 242</ref>.. MacArthur complained that Hart's inactivity allowed Japan's navy freedom of action.<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 234</ref>... According to Stimson, MacArthur felt that Hart's ships and submarines were ineffectual, but because Admiral Hart had lost his courage. Admiral Hart's reaction to MacArthur's brickbats: \"He (MacArthur) is inclined to cut my throat and perhaps the Navy in general.\"<ref>Leutze (1981), pages 240</ref>\"\n\n===Main attack===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Withdrawal South Dec 1941.jpg|thumb|300 px|Withdrawal in the South, 25\u201331 December 1941]]\nThe main attack began early on the morning of 22 December as 43,110 men of the 48th Division and one regiment of the 16th Division, supported by artillery and approximately 90 tanks, landed at three points along the east coast of [[Lingayen Gulf]]. A few B-17s flying from Australia attacked the invasion fleet, and U.S. submarines harassed it from the adjacent waters, but to little effect.\n\nGeneral Wainwright's poorly trained and equipped 11th and 71st Divisions (PA) could neither repel the landings nor pin the enemy on the beaches. The remaining Japanese units of the divisions landed farther south along the gulf. The 26th Cavalry (PS), advancing to meet them, put up a strong fight at [[Rosario, La Union|Rosario]], but was forced to withdraw after taking heavy casualties with no hope of sufficient reinforcements. By nightfall, 23 December, the Japanese had moved ten miles (16&nbsp;km) into the interior.\n\nThe next day, 7,000 men of the 16th Division hit the beaches at three locations along the shore of [[Lamon Bay]] in southern Luzon, where they found General Parker's forces dispersed, and without artillery protecting the eastern coast, unable to offer serious resistance. They immediately consolidated their positions and began the drive north toward Manila where they would link up with the forces advancing south toward the capital for the final victory.\n\n===Withdrawal into Bataan===\nThe U.S. Philippine Division moved into the field in reaction to reports of airborne drops near Clark Field, and when this proved false, were deployed to cover the withdrawal of troops into Bataan and to resist Japanese advances in the [[Subic Bay]] area.\n\nOn 24 December, MacArthur invoked the prewar plan WPO-3 (War Plan Orange 3), which called for use of five delaying positions in central Luzon while forces withdrew into Bataan. This was carried out in part by the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Merriam |first=Ray |year=1999 |title=War in the Philippines |publisher=Merriam Press |pages=70\u201382 |isbn=1-57638-164-1 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=utbD8wwF91kC |page=70}}\n| accessdate =31 January 2008\n}}</ref> He relieved General Parker of his command of South Luzon Force and had him begin preparing defensive positions on Bataan, using units as they arrived; both the military headquarters and the Philippines government were moved there. Nine days of feverish movement of supplies into Bataan, primarily by barge from Manila, began in an attempt to feed an anticipated force of 43,000 troops for six months. (Ultimately 80,000 troops and 26,000 refugees flooded Bataan.) Nevertheless, substantial forces remained in other areas for several months.\n\n[[File:Macarthur&wainwright.jpg|thumb|200px|Generals Wainwright (left) and MacArthur]]\nUnits of both defense forces were maneuvered to hold open the escape routes into Bataan, in particular [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], the steel bridges at [[Calumpit, Bulacan|Calumpit]] over the deep [[Pampanga River]] at the north end of Manila Bay, and [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]] north of Manila. The South Luzon Force, despite its inexperience and equivocating orders to withdraw and hold, successfully executed \"leapfrogging\" retrograde techniques and crossed the bridges by 1 January. Japanese air commanders rejected appeals by the 48th Division to bomb the bridges to trap the retreating forces,<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_12.htm#p205 ''The Fall of the Philippines''], p. 208.</ref> which were subsequently demolished by Philippine Scout engineers on 1 January.\n\nThe Japanese realized the full extent of MacArthur's plan on 30 December and ordered the 48th Division to press forward and seal off Bataan. In a series of actions between 2 and 4 January, the 11th and 21st Divisions of the Philippine Army, the 26th Cavalry (PS) and the American [[M3 Stuart]] tanks of the Provisional Tank Group held open the road from San Fernando to [[Dinalupihan]] at the neck of the peninsula for the retreating forces of the South Luzon Force, then made good their own escape. Despite 50% losses in the 194th Tank Battalion during the retreat, the Stuarts and a supporting battery of [[M3 GMC|75mm SPM halftracks]] repeatedly stopped Japanese thrusts and were the final units to enter Bataan.\n\nOn 30 December, the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|American 31st Infantry]] moved to the vicinity of [[Dalton Pass]] to cover the flanks of troops withdrawing from central and southern Luzon, while other units of the Philippine Division organized positions at Bataan. The 31st Infantry then moved to a defensive position on the west side of the [[Olongapo City|Olongapo]]-Manila road, near [[Layac Junction]]\u2014at the neck of Bataan Peninsula\u2014on 5 January 1942. The junction was given up on 6 January, but the withdrawal to Bataan was successful.\n\n==Battle of Bataan==\n{{Main|Battle of Bataan}}\n[[File:Situation on Bataan 8 Jan 1942.jpg|thumb|300 px|Situation on Bataan, 8 January 1942]]\nFrom 7 to 14 January 1942, the Japanese concentrated on reconnaissance and preparations for an attack on the Main Battle Line from [[Abucay, Bataan|Abucay]] to [[Mount Natib]] to Mauban. At the same time, in a critical mistake, they also relieved the 48th Division, responsible for much of the success of Japanese operations, with the much less-capable 65th Brigade, intended as a garrison force. The Japanese 5th Air group was withdrawn from operations on 5 January in preparation for movement with the 48th Division to the [[Netherlands East Indies]].<ref>[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V2%20P1/ch6.htm#p103 Japanese Operations in the Southwest Pacific Area], p.104.</ref> U.S. and Filipino forces repelled night attacks near Abucay, and elements of the U.S. Philippine Division counterattacked on 16 January. This failed, and the division withdrew to the Reserve Battle Line from [[Pilar, Bataan|Casa Pilar]] to [[Bagac, Bataan|Bagac]] in the center of the peninsula on 26 January.\n\nThe 14th Army renewed its attacks on 23 January with an attempted amphibious landing behind the lines by a battalion of the 16th Division, then with general attacks beginning 27 January along the battle line. The amphibious landing was disrupted by a [[PT boat]] and contained in brutally dense jungle by ad hoc units made up of U.S. Army Air Corps troops, naval personnel, and Philippine Constabulary. The pocket was then slowly forced back to the cliffs, with high casualties on both sides. Landings to reinforce the surviving pocket on 26 January and 2 February were severely disrupted by air attacks from the few remaining FEAF P-40s, then trapped and eventually annihilated on 13 February.\n\nA penetration in the I Corps line was stopped and broken up into several pockets. General Homma on 8 February ordered the suspension of offensive operations in order to reorganize his forces. This could not be carried out immediately, because the 16th Division remained engaged trying to extricate a pocketed battalion of its 20th Infantry. With further losses, the remnants of the battalion, 378 officers and men, were extricated on 15 February. On 22 February, the 14th Army line withdrew a few miles to the north and USAFFE forces re-occupied the abandoned positions. The result of the \"Battle of the Points\" and \"Battle of the Pockets\" was total destruction of all three battalions of the Japanese 20th Infantry and a clear USAFFE victory.\n\n[[File:Hayward, California. As Bataan fell, as recorded in these newspapers of April 9, 1942, evacuation o . . . - NARA - 536016.jpg|thumb|California newspapers, 9 April 1942]]\nFor several weeks, the Japanese, deterred by heavy losses and reduced to a single brigade, conducted siege operations while waiting refitting and reinforcement. Both armies engaged in patrols and limited local attacks. Because of the worsening Allied position in the Asia-Pacific region, U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered MacArthur to [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|relocate to Australia]], as Supreme Allied Commander [[South West Pacific Area]]. (MacArthur's famous speech regarding the Philippines, in which he said \"I came out of Bataan and I shall return\" was made at [[Terowie, South Australia|Terowie]]\n, [[South Australia]] on 20 March.) Wainwright officially assumed control of what was now termed United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP) on 23 March. During this period, elements of the U.S. Philippine Division were shifted to assist in the defense of other sectors.\n\nBeginning 28 March, a new wave of Japanese air and artillery attacks hit Allied forces who were severely weakened by malnutrition, sickness and prolonged fighting. On 3 April, the Japanese began to break through along [[Mount Samat]], estimating that the offensive would require a month to end the campaign. The U.S. Philippine Division, no longer operating as a coordinated unit and exhausted by five days of nearly continuous combat, was unable to counterattack effectively against heavy Japanese assaults. On 8 April, the U.S. 57th Infantry Regiment (PS) and the 31st Division PA were overrun near the [[Alangan River]]. The U.S. 45th Infantry Regiment (PS), under orders to reach Mariveles and evacuate to Corregidor, finally surrendered on 10 April 1942. Only 300 men of the U.S. 31st Infantry successfully reached Corregidor.\n\n==Battle of Corregidor==\n{{Main|Battle of Corregidor}}\n[[File:Japanese bombers over Corregidor.jpg|thumb|[[Mitsubishi Ki-21|Japanese bombers]] over Corregidor]]\n[[File:Map of Corregidor 1941.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|Map of Corregidor island in 1941]]\nCorregidor was a U.S. Army Coast Artillery position defending the entrance to Manila Bay. It was armed by both older seacoast [[disappearing gun]] batteries of the [[59th Coast Artillery (United States)|59th]] and [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st Coast Artillery]] Regiments (the latter a Philippine Scouts unit), an offshore mine field of approximately 35 groups of [[controlled mines]],<ref name=CAJHarris1>{{cite journal |last1=Bocksel |first1=Arnold A. |year=1946 |title=The USAMP ''General George Harrison'' in the Harbor Defenses of Manila and Subic Bay |journal=Coast Artillery Journal |volume=LXXXIX |issue=NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 1946 |pages=54 |publisher=United States Coast Artillery Association |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/ada-online/coast-artillery-journal/_docs/1946/11-12/Nov-Dec%201946.pdf |accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref> and an anti-aircraft unit, the [[60th Coast Artillery (United States)|60th CA (AA)]]. The latter was posted on the higher elevations of Corregidor and was able to respond successfully to the Japanese air attacks, downing many fighters and bombers. The older stationary batteries with fixed mortars and immense cannons, for defense from attack by sea, were easily put out of commission by Japanese bombers. The American soldiers and Filipino Scouts defended the small fortress until they had little left to wage a defense.\n\nEarly in 1942, the Japanese air command installed oxygen in its bombers to fly higher than the range of the Corregidor anti-aircraft batteries, and after that time, heavier bombardment began.\n\nIn December 1941, Philippines President Manuel L. Quezon, General MacArthur, other high-ranking military officers and diplomats and families escaped the bombardment of Manila and were housed in Corregidor's [[Malinta Tunnel]]. Prior to their arrival, Malinta's laterals had served as high command headquarters, hospital and storage of food and arms. In March 1942, several U.S. Navy submarines arrived on the north side of Corregidor. The Navy brought in mail, orders, and weaponry. They took away with them the high American and Filipino government officers, gold and silver and other important records. Those who were unable to escape by submarine were eventually military [[POW]]s of Japan or placed in civilian [[concentration camps]] in Manila and other locations.\n\n[[File:Captured Japanese photograph. U.S. soldiers and sailors surrendering to Japanese forces at Corregidor, Philippine... - NARA - 531354.tif|thumb|U.S. and Filipino soldiers and sailors surrendering to Japanese forces at Corregidor]]\nCorregidor was defended by 11,000 personnel, comprising the units mentioned above that were stationed on Corregidor, the [[U.S. 4th Marine Regiment]], and U.S. Navy personnel deployed as infantry. Some were able to get to Corregidor from the Bataan Peninsula when the Japanese overwhelmed the units there. The Japanese began their final assault on Corregidor with an artillery barrage on 1 May. On the night of 5\u20136 May, two battalions of the Japanese 61st Infantry Regiment landed at the northeast end of the island. Despite strong resistance, the Japanese established a beachhead that was soon reinforced by tanks and artillery. The defenders were quickly pushed back toward the stronghold of Malinta Hill.\n\nLate on 6 May, Wainwright asked Homma for terms of surrender. Homma insisted that surrender include all Allied forces in the Philippines. Believing that the lives of all those on Corregidor would be endangered, Wainwright accepted. On 8 May, he sent a message to Sharp, ordering him to surrender the Visayan-Mindanao Force. Sharp complied, but many individuals carried on the fight as [[guerilla warfare|guerrillas]]. Few unit commanders were so hard pressed as to be forced to surrender and none had any desire to surrender. Sharp's decision to surrender involved many factors. Major Larry S. Schmidt, in a 1982 master's degree thesis, said Sharp's decision was based on two reasons: that the Japanese were capable of executing the 10,000 survivors of Corregidor, and that Sharp now knew his forces would not be reinforced by the United States, as had been previously thought.<ref>{{cite thesis|first = Larry S.|last = Schmidt|title = American Involvement in the Filipino Resistance Movement on Mindanao During the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945|type=MMAS |publisher= U.S. Army Command and General Staff College|location = Fort Leavenworth, Kans.|page = 68|url = https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b068659.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|Japanese war crimes}}\n[[File:March of Death - Resting 03.jpg|thumb|Group of American prisoners, May 1942]]\nThe defeat was the beginning of three and a half years of harsh treatment for the Allied survivors, including atrocities like the [[Bataan Death March]] and the misery of Japanese prison camps, and the \"[[Hell Ships]]\" on which American and Allied men were sent to Japan to be used as labor in mines and factories.

Despite its prominent position, the early historical identity of Pasinler [historic Hasan Kale], highlights the problems dealing with ancient toponyms. Various scholars have tentatively Identified modern Pasinler as Faunitis, \u00dcg\u00fcm\u00fc, Gymnias, Vaghar\u0161akert (Armenian: \u054e\u0561\u0572\u0561\u0580\u0577\u0561\u056f\u0565\u0580\u057f), and Boghberd (Armenian: \u0532\u0578\u0572\u0562\u0565\u0580\u0564). The arguments for its ancient identity are greatly influenced by the surviving castle on the southern spur of the Hasanbaba Mountain overlooking the modern town of Pasinler. This castle, Hasankale, takcs its current name from one of the Hasans, Ottoman governors of the region in the 14th century, though it is uncertain who is meant.\" [[Antonio Sagona|Sagona, Antonio G]]. and Sagona, Claudia (2004) ''An historical geography and a field survey of the Bayburt province'' (in the series: ''Archaeology at the north-east Anatolian frontier'') Peeters Press, Louvain, Belgium, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-AyP-L2stsC&pg=PA57 page 57], {{ISBN|90-429-1390-8}}</ref> and [[Turkey|Turkish]] ''Pasin''.<ref>Sadona, A.

{"title_page": "Anglican eucharistic theology", "text_new": "{{Eucharist}}\n\n'''Anglican eucharistic theology''' is diverse in practice, reflecting the comprehensiveness of [[Anglicanism]]. Its sources include [[prayer book]] [[rubric]]s, writings on [[Anglican sacraments|sacramental theology]] by [[Anglican divine]]s, and the regulations and orientations of [[ecclesiastical province]]s. The principal source material is the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (abbr: BCP), specifically its [[eucharistic prayer]]s and Article XXVIII of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]]. Article XXVIII comprises the foundational Anglican [[Anglican doctrine|doctrinal]] statement about the Eucharist, although its interpretation varies among churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] and in different traditions of [[churchmanship]] such as [[Anglo-Catholicism]] and [[Evangelical Anglicanism]]. \n\nAnglican [[eucharistic theology|eucharistic theologies]] universally affirm the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], though [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical Anglicans]] believe that this is a [[Lord's Supper in Reformed theology|pneumatic presence]], while those of an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship believe this is a corporeal presence.{{sfn|Campbell|1996|p=325}} In the former interpretation, those who receive the form or sign of the body and blood (bread and wine) in faith, receive also the spiritual body and blood of Christ. Those who receive the form or sign without faith, or for those who are wicked, Christ is not present spiritually and they consume only the physical signs of this holy presence, which further adds to their wickedness \u2013 in accordance with Article XXIX.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=The Thirty-Nine Articles |accessdate=8 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Prjkilh0?url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |archivedate=25 June 2007 }}</ref> In the latter interpretation, there exists the corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, although the precise manner of how that presence is made manifest is a [[mystery of faith]].{{sfnm |1a1=Herbert Stowe |1y=1932 |2a1=Lears |2y=1981 |2p=202}} To explain the manner of Christ's presence, some [[high church|high-church]] Anglicans, however, teach the philosophical explanation of [[consubstantiation]],{{sfn|Murphy|2007|p=512}} associated with the English [[Lollards]] and, later, erroneously with [[Martin Luther]], though Luther and the Lutheran churches explicitly rejected the doctrine of consubstatiation and actually promulgated their dogma of the [[sacramental union]].{{sfnm |1a1=Diehl |1y=1888 |1pp=349\u2013350 |2a1=Mattox |2a2=Roeber |2y=2012|2p=54}} A major leader in the Anglo-Catholic [[Oxford Movement]], [[Edward Pusey]], championed the view of consubstantiation.{{sfn|Rigg|1895|p=293}}\n\n==Sacramental theology==\n{{further|Anglican sacraments}}\nWith the [[Eucharist]], as with other aspects of theology, Anglicans are largely directed by the principle of ''[[lex orandi, lex credendi]]'' which means \"the law of prayer is the law of belief\". In other words, sacramental theology as it pertains to the Eucharist is sufficiently and fully articulated by the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of a given jurisdiction. As defined by the 16th-century Anglican theologian [[Richard Hooker]], the sacraments are said to be \"visible signs of invisible grace\";{{sfn|Hooker|2003|p=201}} similarly the ''Catechism'' of the 1662 version states that a sacrament is \"an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given to us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.\" It thus has the effect of conveying [[sanctification]] in the individual participating in the sacrament. According to this, in the Eucharist the outward and visible sign is \"bread and wine\" and the \"thing signified\", the \"body and blood of Christ\", which are truly taken and received by the faithful in the Lord's supper.\n\nSacraments have both ''form'' and ''matter''. ''Form'' is the verbal and physical liturgical action, while the ''matter'' refers to material objects used (bread and wine). In an Anglican Eucharist the form is contained in the rite and its [[rubric]]s, as articulated in the authorised prayer books of the [[ecclesiastical province]]. Central to the rite is the [[eucharistic prayer]] or \"Great Thanksgiving\".\n\nFor the vast majority of Anglicans, the Eucharist (also called \"[[Holy Communion]]\", \"[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]\", the Divine Liturgy, the \"Lord's Supper,\" or The Great Thanksgiving), is the central act of gathered worship, the appointed means by which Christ can become present to his church. For the majority of Anglicans this event constitutes the renewal of the Body of Christ as the Church through the reception of the Body of Christ as the [[Blessed Sacrament]], his spiritual body and blood. In this sacrament, Christ is both encountered and incorporated (they \"partake\" of him). As such, the eucharistic action looks backward as a memorial of Christ's sacrifice, forward as a foretaste of the [[heaven|heavenly banquet]] and to the present as an [[incarnation]] of Christ in the lives of the community and of individual believers.\n\n[[Anglican doctrine]] concerning the eucharist is contained in ''Article XXVIII - Of the Lord's Supper'' and ''XXIX - Of the Wicked which eat not the Body of Christ'' of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]]. The Catechism of the [[Church of England]], the foundational church of the Anglican Communion, is found in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and states that, as with other sacraments, the eucharist is \"an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.\"{{sfn|Blunt|1888|p=435}} The outward sign, in this instance, is the bread and wine; and the thing signified is the body and blood of Christ.\n\n==Varieties of eucharistic theology==\nBecause of the various theological movements which have influenced Anglicanism throughout history, there is no one sacramental theory accepted by all Anglicans. Early Anglican theologians, such as [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[Richard Hooker]], held to a sacramental theology similar to [[John Calvin]]. Cranmer's belief was substantially Calvinist, Receptionism and Virtualism, as shown by Peter Brooks in 1965.<ref>The Study of Liturgy, 1991, p. 316 {{ISBN|978-0-19-520922-8}}</ref> Hooker's was a more nuanced combination of Receptionism and Real Presence but agnostic as to what the elements were in themselves but insistent that \"the sacrament is a true and a real participation of Christ, who thereby imparteth himself even in his whole entire Person as a Mystical Head...\"<ref>John R. H. Moorman, IX Bishop of Ripon, The Anglican Spiritual Tradition, 1983, p. 77, {{ISBN|978-0-87243-125-6}}</ref> He brushes aside transubstantiation and consubstantiation and urges people to meditate in silence and less to dispute the manner 'how.'<ref>Moorman, p. 77</ref> The views were congenial for centuries to the majority of Anglicans.<ref>Study of Liturgy, p. 316</ref> The 19th-century [[Oxford Movement]] sought to give the Eucharist a more prominent place and upheld belief in the real presence of Christ in the sacrament.{{sfn|Poulson|1999|p=40}} Anglicans now hold a variety of sacramental theologies, representing a spectrum of theories found in other Christian traditions.\n\n===Corporeal presence===\nAnglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship, as well as some [[high church|high-church]] Evangelicals, hold to a belief in the corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist,{{sfn|Campbell|1996|p=325}} but maintain that the details of how Christ is made present remain a [[mystery of faith]],{{sfnm |1a1=Herbert Stowe |1y=1932 |2a1=Lears |2y=1981 |2p=202}} a view also held by the Orthodox Church, Lutheran Church, and Methodist Church.{{sfnm |1a1=Losch |1y=2002 |1p=90 |2a1=Neal |2y=2014 |2p=111}} Holding this view, \"the [[Tractarian]]s were concerned ... to exalt the importance of the sacrament\", but were \"generally hostile to the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]].\"{{sfnm |1a1=Poulson |1y=1999 |1p=40 |2a1=Spurr |2y=2010 |2p=100}} Article XXVIII of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] declares that \"Transubstantiation ... cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.\" [[Edgar Gibson]], the [[Bishop of Gloucester]], who was Anglo-Catholic in churchmanship, defended the phrase \"cannot be Proved by Holy Writ\" in Article XXVIII, stating,\n\n{{quote|It is hard to see how a philosophical theory such as Transubstation confessedly is, can ever be \"proved by Holy Writ.\" Romanists point to the words of institution, {{lang|grc|\u03a4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03cc \u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03ac \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5}}. But though they can certainly be claimed in the favour of the real Presence, yet to bring into them a theory of \"accidents\" remaining while the \"substance\" is changed, is to read into the text that which is certainly not contained in it, and what we deny can reasonably be referred from it.{{sfn|Gibson|1897|p=657}}}}\n\n===Pneumatic presence===\n{{see also|Lord's Supper in Reformed theology}}\n[[Low church|Low-church]] Anglicans reject belief in a corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and accordingly, usually any belief in the reservation and adoration of the sacrament. Reservation was eliminated in practice by the rubric at the end of the 1662 Communion service which ordered the reverent consumption of any consecrated bread and wine immediately after the blessing, and adoration by the \"[[Black Rubric|Declaration concerning Kneeling]]\".{{sfn|Gibson|1897|pp=666\u2013667}} Instead, they hold to a \"spiritual real presence\" view of the Eucharist similar to the views held by Reformed Protestant denominations such as [[Presbyterian]]s. Low-church parishes and ministers tend to celebrate the Eucharist less frequently (e.g., monthly) and prefer the terms \"Holy Communion\" or \"Lord's Supper\". This view has historical precedent. During the seminal years of the [[English Reformation]], Thomas Cranmer was in correspondence with many continental Reformers, several of whom came to England at his request to aid in reforms there. They included [[Martin Bucer]], [[Paul Fagius]], [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], [[Bernardino Ochino]] and [[Jan \u0141aski]]. The views of these men were in line with the Reformed doctrine of the sacrament.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nCranmer wrote on the Eucharist in his treatise ''On the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Lord's Supper'' that Christians truly receive Christ's \"self-same\" Body and Blood at Communion \u2013 but in \"an heavenly and spiritual manner\" which is close to the Calvinistic doctrine.<ref>Farris, Joshua; Hamilton, S. Mark; Speigel, James, S, ''Idealism and Christian Theology: Idealism and Christianity''. Vol. I, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|1-62-89204-39}}.</ref>\n\nThis is in agreement with the continental Reformed view found in Chapter XXI of the [[Second Helvetic Confession]]:\n\n{{quote|There is also a spiritual eating of Christ's body; not such that we think that thereby the food itself is to be changed into spirit, but whereby the body and blood of the Lord, while remaining in their own essence and property, are spiritually communicated to us, certainly not in a corporeal but in a spiritual way, by the Holy Spirit, who applies and bestows upon us these things which have been prepared for us by the sacrifice of the Lord's body and blood for us, namely, the remission of sins, deliverance, and eternal life; so that Christ lives in us and we live in him, and he causes us to receive him by true faith to this end that he may become for us such spiritual food and drink, that is, our life.\n\nBut he who comes to this sacred Table of the Lord without faith, communicates only in the sacrament and does not receive the substance of the sacrament whence comes life and salvation; and such men unworthily eat of the Lord's Table. Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and eats and drinks judgment upon himself (I Cor. 11:26-29). For when they do not approach with true faith, they dishonor the death of Christ, and therefore eat and drink condemnation to themselves.}}\n\nThis emphasis on the faith of the receiver instead of the elements, common to both the Continental Reformed churches and the Church of England, has also been called \"[[receptionism]]\". However, Christ's presence in the sacrament is objective and is in no way dependent on the attitude of the recipient who perceives it by faith.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Consubstantiation===\nThe doctrine of [[consubstantiation]], which originated out of the pre-Reformation [[Lollardy]] movement in England, is one with which some Anglicans identify.{{sfn|Murphy|2007|p=512}} The 19th-century Anglo-Catholic divine [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] (a leader of the [[Oxford Movement]]) argued strongly for the idea of consubstantiation.{{sfn|Rigg|1895|p=293}} Discussing Pusey's view, Thomas S. L. Vogan wrote:\n{{quotation|I cannot deem it unfair to apply the name of Consubstantiation to a doctrine which teaches, that \"the true flesh and true blood of Christ are in the true bread and wine,\" in such a way that \"whatsoever motion or action the bread\" and wine have, the body and blood \"of Christ also\" have \"the same;\" and that \"the substances in both cases\" are \"so mingled--that they should constitute some one thing.\"{{sfn|Vogan|1871|p=54}}}}\nIn this doctrine, the bread and wine do not disappear at the consecration, but that the Body and Blood become present without diminishing them.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nAlthough it originated with Lollardism, consubstantiation is erroneously said to be the doctrine of [[Martin Luther]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, which actually reject consubstantiation and instead teach the doctrine of [[sacramental union]].{{sfn|Pelikan|Oswald|Lehmann|1999|p=xix}}\n\nA maxim in Anglicanism concerning Christ's presence is that \"it may not be about a change of substance, but it is about a substantial change.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jeremy |author-link=Jeremy Taylor |year=1852 |chapter=Of the Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Sacrament |editor-last=Heber |editor-first=Reginald |editor-link=Reginald Heber |title=The Whole Works of the Right Reverend Jeremy Taylor |volume=6 |location=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans |page=14 |ref=harv}} Cited in {{harvnb|Ely|2012}}.</ref> If substantial denotes a spiritual property of the sacraments themselves this is the Reformed view, since, after consecration, the elements are only fit for holy use and may no longer be used as common bread and wine.{{sfn|Pelikan|Oswald|Lehmann|1999|p=xix}}\n\nThis view is expressed in the allied but [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] different doctrines of consubstantiation and sacramental union. Both views hold that Christ is present in the eucharistic elements spiritually. Such spiritual presence may or may not be believed to be in bodily form, depending on the particular doctrinal position.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} It may in fact be a mystical, yet still physical, Body of Christ, as some Anglicans{{who|date=February 2011}} hold, or a superphysical reality \"superimposed\" in, with, and under the bread and wine. Although this is similar to consubstantiation, it is different as it has a decidedly mystical emphasis.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Receptionism===\n\nAn imprecisely defined view common amongst 16th- and 17th-century Anglican theologians is known as \"[[receptionism]]\", a term not found before 1867. According to this view, although the bread and wine remain unchanged, through the worthy reception of the sacrament the communicant receives the body and blood of Christ.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=1380}} It remained \"the dominant theological position in the Church of England until the Oxford Movement in the early nineteenth century, with varying degrees of emphasis\". It is important to remember that it is \"a doctrine of the real presence\" but one which \"relates the presence primarily to the worthy receiver rather than to the elements of bread and wine\".<ref>Crockett, William R., 'Holy Communion,' in Sykes, Stephen; Booty, John, The Study of Anglicanism, 1988 p. 275 {{ISBN|978-0-8006-2087-5}}</ref>\n\n==Shape of the rite==\nAs mentioned above, the [[liturgy]] for the Eucharist is important in Anglican [[eucharistic theology]] because of the principle of ''lex orandi, lex credendi''. The liturgy is defined in the authorised prayer books of the various national churches and ecclesiastical provinces of the communion. The eucharistic rites follow one or other of two main sources, either the [[Book of Common Prayer (1549)|First English Prayer Book of 1549]] or the Second of 1552 which, with minor modifications, became the 1662 Book BCP which is still today the official and legal reference-point for the Church of England.<ref>Canons A3, A5</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2017}} The author of both rites was [[Thomas Cranmer]], who maintained that there was no theological difference between the two,{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|pp=463, 629}} but was forced to make its reformed theology more obvious when conservative clergy hostile to the English Reformation took advantage of [[loophole]]s in the 1549 prayer book to make the new liturgy as much like the old Latin [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] as possible, including [[Elevation (liturgy)|elevating the Eucharist]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 339}}\n\nSome or all of the following elements may be altered, transposed, or absent depending on the rite used by the province or national church. In modern liturgies whichever source (1549 or 1552) they follow for the sacrament, the Liturgy of the Word has, with variations, a fairly standard pattern:{{sfn|Seddon|1996|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\n*The Liturgy of the Word\n** '''The Gathering of the Community''': Beginning with a [[Trinitarian formula|Trinitarian]]-based greeting or [[liturgical year|seasonal]] acclamation; followed by the Collect for Purity; the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]], [[Kyrie eleison]], and/or [[Trisagion]]; and then the [[Collect]] of the day. During [[Lent]] and/or [[Advent]] especially, this part of the service may begin or end with a [[penance|penitential rite]].\n** '''The Proclamation of the Word''': Usually two to three readings of Scripture, one of which is always from the [[Gospel]]s, plus a [[psalm]] (or portion thereof) or [[canticle]]. This is followed by a [[sermon]] or [[homily]]; the recitation of the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] or [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] Creed;\n** The '''Prayers of the People''': Very varied in form. The [[Holy kiss|passing of the peace]] may be placed here.\n*The Liturgy of Sacrament (1549, Scottish Canon, recent prayer books)\n**'''The Celebration of the Eucharist''': The gifts of bread and wine are received, along with other gifts (such as money and/or food for a food bank, etc.), and an [[offertory]] prayer is recited. Following this, a [[eucharistic prayer]] (called \"The Great Thanksgiving\") is recited. This prayer consists of a dialogue (the [[Sursum Corda]]), a preface, the [[sanctus]] and [[Sanctus Benedictus|benedictus]], the [[Words of Institution]], the [[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]], the oblation or presentation of the gifts to God in the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, the [[epiclesis]] or request that the Holy Spirit descend upon the gifts and sanctify them to be the Body and Blood of Jesus, an eschatological statement about the end time, doxology and congregational assent, Amen. The entire prayer is consecratory. The Lord's Prayer follows, and is followed by the [[fraction (religion)|fraction]] (the breaking of the bread), the [[Prayer of Humble Access]], which is optional, the [[Agnus Dei]], and the distribution of the sacred elements (the bread and wine). There is a post-Communion prayer. A [[doxology]] or general prayer of thanksgiving may follow. The service concludes with a Trinitarian blessing and the dismissal.\n*The Liturgy of Sacrament (1552/1662 style):\n**The priest prepares the table. Invitation to examine oneself, confession, absolution, \"comfortable words\".<ref>Mt 11:28; John 3:16; I Tim 1:15 1 John 2:1</ref> The [[Sursum Corda]], preface, the [[sanctus]], [[Prayer of Humble Access]], [[Words of Institution]]. Then comes the distribution of the elements, the Lord's Prayer, concluding prayer of thanksgiving, the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] and blessing.\n\nThe theology of these rites has been considerably modified in the last 200 years, with the reintroduction of oblationary language as pertaining to an objective, material sacrifice offered to God in union with Christ. The Prayer Books of 1552, 1559, 1604 and 1662 placed sacrificial language in a post-communion prayer in order to detach it from the context of the eucharistic prayer. A prime example of these modifications can be found in the American Book of Common Prayer introduced by the first American Episcopal bishop Samuel Seabury and adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1789. He insisted on the adoption of a full eucharistic prayer of the non-Juror Scottish Episcopal Church Rite to replace the truncated version of the earlier English rites beginning in 1552. The adopted prayer included the words, \"with these thy holy gifts, which we now offer unto thee\", which were inserted after the words from the 1549 Rite \"we, thy humble servants, do celebrate and make before thy Divine Majesty, and before the words \"the memorial thy Son hath commanded us to make\" BCP (cf. these changes in the article on Samuel Seabury). An epiclesis was also restored. The insertion of these ten words in effect undid Cranmer's theology that the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving was restricted to words and sentiments in prayer.\n\n=== Church of England ===\n\nThroughout the 20th century the Eucharist in the Church of England has undergone a number of significant changes and in most churches the BCP is no longer used for many services. The Prayer Book (Alternative and Other Services) Measure of 1965 redefined where \"lawful authority lay\".\n\n* The Book of Common Prayer 1662 \n* A new concept of alternative services that could be authorised for up to seven years. Further authorisation of seven years could be granted by General Synod.\n* Provision for making legal other services outside the range of Book of Common Prayer such as family services.\n\nUnder the new measure all services that the 1928 deposited prayer book that had been in use for nearly 40 years on the say so of individual bishops lost all legal authority. They would then have to authorised as alternate services. The Liturgical Commission would not assist in this process so it was left to the House of Bishops to edit a set of rites from 1928 and publish them. These were published in December 1965 as were later to be known as Series 1. At the same time the Liturgical Commission also produced and published texts in readiness for the new measures to come into force and these were known as Series 2. The eucharist in this series met with dissent in two key places: the use of 'offer' in relation to the bread and wine in the eucharistic prayer and the provision of prayers for the dead. It took until 1967 for General Synod to agree to a shape for the service. But in 1969 the whole of Series 2 was to disappear into obscurity following a dispute between the Houses of Laity and Clergy over the funeral service. At the same that Series 1 and 2 were going through General Synod there was a growing shift in the English speaking world away from the use of Tudor language in worship. Use of modern English and addressing God as you gave birth to a further version of the eucharist which would be called Series 3. The International Consultation on English Texts (ICET) produced some recommended common texts for English speaking Christians. Unlike Series 1 and 2 which had a shape based on the BCP the series 3 communion service followed the shape that many today would recognise. Its first presentation to General Synod in 1971 led to severe criticism but after some minor revisions it was approved the following year. Although the BCP remained the norm in many parishes a high proportion were being prepared for a new series of services where God was addressed as 'you' all the way throughout.\n\n'''Alternative Service Book'''\n\nThe time limits introduced in 1966 hampered the usefulness of the new services. Many were produced in chap booklet forms. But the Church of England (Worship and Doctrine) Measure 1974 permitted General Synod to provide by canon the unlimited use of alternative services. In 1976 a working party was set up to bring all of the various series three booklets including that for the eucharist together into a single volume of reasonable This work was completed by the end of 1979 and the volume was authorised by synod the following year. Initially this was for 10 years but in 1990 this was extended for a further 10 years. The Alternative Service Book 1980 (ASB) had two communion services - Rite A and Rite B. Rite B was based on Series 1 in as far as it was based on the shape of the BCP service and was in traditional language. Rite A was based on the Series 3 communion service and the majority of the volume was written in contemporary language in recognition that English over the centuries since the BCP was produced had changed in meaning and usage. The order for Rite A is as follows:\n\n* The preparation: a greeting, the collect of purity and the penitential rite.\n* Kyrie Elesion or Gloria in Excelsis depending on the season.\n* Ministry of the Word: scriptural readings, a psalm (often not used), sermon and creed.\n* Prayers of intercession and an alternative place for the penitential rite if needed.\n* Sharing of The peace \n* Ministry of the Sacrament including the offertory and the use of one of four eucharistic prayers to consecrate the bread and wine. The shape of which were as outlined above including prayer 4 which was version of the BCP prayer in modern English. \n* The provision for the use of hymns and other sacred music\n \nThere was also an order of service for parishes who wished to have a service in modern English but still keep the shape of that found in the BCP. This prayer book proved to be successful with it being taken up by the majority of parishes with rite A being the most popular of the two. But work did not stop here. There was a distinctive language shift which included the use of inclusive language as outlined in the report Making Women Visible (1988) but which was only adopted when the revised text for ''Common Worship'' was compiled. Seasonal material was produced. Firstly in 1986 was Lent, Holy Week and Easter which was followed in 1992 by ''The Promise of His Glory'' which contained a series of material for use between All Saints and Candlemas.\n\n=== Common Worship ===\n\nCommon Worship is the name given to the library of volumes that replace the Alternative Service Book 1980. In 1994 the Liturgical Commission suggested to General Synod that it was better to produce a series of separate texts rather than to squeeze everything into one volume. This reflected the findings of the Faith in the City report published in 1985 which identified that to give people a volume of 1300 pages was a symptom of the gulf between church and ordinary people. Ease of handling was the aim of producing the new worship material. This was available in separate booklets, congregational cards, downloadable files and also part of Visual Liturgy Service composing programme. The main volumes for the eucharist are\n\n* Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England: The main or core volume from which congregational worship is drawn\n* Common Worship: President's Edition which is used from where the service is lead \n* Common Worship: Times and Seasons bringing together season material.\n\nParishes were able to draw upon the core material to produce user friendly booklets to match the season and their local situation. Within Common Worship as in the ASB there are two orders of service - Order 1 and Order 2. Order 1 is a gentle revision of Rite A found in the ASB. The shape of the service was on the whole kept unchanged but the compilers of Common Worship were able to draw upon experience of post ASB seasonal material as well as changes to worship occurring in other denominations. Major changes to the text took place to ensure that inclusive language was used as well as giving a much wider choice of text. The rite was available in both modern and traditional language as was that in Order 2.\n\nThe shape of Order 1 is as follows\n\nIntroduction \n \n* The people and the priest greet each other in the Lord's name\n* Confess their sins. This is the only place it can now happen\n* Gloria unless in the penitential seasons\n* Collect of the day\n\nThe Word\n \n* At least two readings including the Gospel\n* A sermon\n* The creed or some other profession of faith\n \nPrayers of intercession\n\nThe Meal \n \n* Sharing of the peace\n*  Receiving of offerings\n*  Consecration of bread and wine\n*  Receiving of communion\n\nEnding departing with God's blessing\n\nOrder 2 has a more prayer book feel to the service.\n\nIntroduction \n \n* The people and priest prepare for worship by hearing and responding to the commandments \n*  Pray a collect\n\nThe word\n\n* At least two readings\n* A sermon\n* A profession of faith\n\nThe Prayers\n\n* Prepare the table\n* Pray for the church and world\n* Confess their sins\n\nThe Meal\n\nPraise God for his goodness\n* Consecrate the bread and wine\n* Receive communion\n* Respond with thanksgiving\n\nEnding by departing with God's blessing\n\nEach order can draw on one of eight communion prayers\n\nPrayers A to C were drawn from those that had been in rite A of the ASB with some revisions\nPrayer D is responsorial in nature and good for all age worship\nPrayer E is the shortest and has some of the flavour of prayer A \nPrayer F is responsorial and has its origins in the Eastern Christian tradition \nPrayer G is a redraft of a prayer produced by the Roman Catholic Church\nPrayer H is a dialogue between the priest and the people which ends with sanctus as an offering of praise\n\nBut Common Worship does not end there as the material that is now available for the eucharist is considerable. It includes \n* Two versions of the summary of the law \n* Two versions of the commandments \n* The Beatitudes\n* Two versions of the comfortable words\n* Four invitations to Confession \n* Six Confessions\n* Two Absolution \n* Seven Gospel Acclamations \n* Four prayers after communion \n* Seven authorised affirmations of faith as well as the Nicene and Apostles' Creed \n* Fifteen sets of seasonal provisions\n\nThis allows churches to have a lot more variety within their worship as well as to mark the seasons in a meaningful way. The most common way of presenting the material is through service booklets to make it user friendly rather than presenting the whole volume.\n\n==Customary of the rite==\n[[File:altar.stmaryredcliffe.arp.jpg|thumb|Typical style of an Anglican altar]]\nThe rubrics of a given prayer book outline the parameters of acceptable practice with regard to ritual, [[vestments]], ornaments and method and means of distribution of the sacrament. The communal piety of a given parish or diocese will determine the expression of these rubrics and the implicit eucharist theology.\n\nUntil the latter part of the 19th century, the so-called \"Ornaments Rubric\" of the 1662 Prayer Book was interpreted to inhibit much of the ceremonial contemporary Anglicans take for granted. Priests were directed to stand at the north side or north end of the [[altar]] and candles on the altar were considered forbidden, as was the wearing of a [[chasuble]] or [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]]. The [[Ritualism|Ritualist]] controversies of the late 19th century solidified the ascendancy of the [[Oxford Movement]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and many other parts of the Anglican Communion, introducing a much greater diversity of practice.\n\n===Low church===\n[[File:WilliamWhiteCommunion.jpg|thumb|left|Bishop [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] celebrating communion in choir dress in the 19th century. Such practice remains typical of [[low church|low-church]] clergy, who object to the use of sacramental vestments.]]\nIn [[low church|low-church]] parishes ceremonial is generally kept at a minimum, according to the rubrics of historical Anglican prayer books. The service is more often called Holy Communion than the eucharist. The priest is typically attired simply in a [[cassock]], [[surplice]], and a black scarf (called a [[tippet]]). This is a priest's \"[[choir habit]]\" as worn at a service of the word, but may also be worn as eucharistic vestments as was commonly done in earlier years. In some provinces identifying Low Church tradition by vesture alone is becoming more difficult as boundaries become blurred. Many parishes that have a more charismatic flavour have generally abandoned the use of robes at most of their services and their services are similar to that found in Pentecostal churches. But even this is not universal and will depend on parish tradition with some being vested for special occasions and the eucharist if it is celebrated less frequently, or if it is part of confirmation. In some Low Church parishes the minister may replace the black preaching scarf with a stole reflecting the colour of the season.\n\nManual action is kept to the standards of the rubrics found in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (often confined to placing one's hands on the elements during the words of institution). The altar is referred to as the \"Lord's table\", the \"holy table\", or simply the \"table\". [[Candle]]s are either absent or two in number. The material on the table may be limited to the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] and [[paten]], a cloth covering and, in some instances, the prayer book. The celebration of Holy Communion may be weekly or monthly. This frequency is in keeping with the Anglican practice that predominated prior to the 20th century. After the service, and following historical rubrics, the unconsumed bread and wine are reverently eaten by the priest and other ministers. If there is more than the clergy can finish, lay persons are called to help eat the remaining elements. In accordance with the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]], the remaining bread and wine are not reserved in a [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] or [[aumbry]]. In some parishes, the president stands at the north-side of the holy table to read the service, in accordance with some interpretations of the rubrics of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.\n\n===Broad church / Central churchmanship===\nIn most [[broad church|broad-church]] parishes there is slightly more elaboration. Attending the eucharist at a broad-church parish nowadays is likely to be similar in many respects to a contemporary Roman Catholic Mass. Priests will generally be vested in an [[alb]] and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and also, in many instances, a chasuble. They may make use of a [[lavabo]] in preparation for the celebration and the chalice and paten may be initially concealed by a [[burse]] and ornamental veil. Candles will almost always be present on the altar. Broad-church Anglicans typically celebrate the eucharist every Sunday, or at least most Sundays. The rite may also be celebrated once or twice at other times during the week. The sacrament is often reserved in an [[aumbry]] or consumed. Broad-church Anglicans may not reverence the sacrament, as such, but will frequently bow when passing the altar.\n\n===Anglo-Catholic===\n[[Anglo-Catholic]] worship involves further elaboration. The priest will often be joined by a [[deacon]] and often a [[Reader (Anglican Church)|reader]] (the deacon being ordained in [[Holy Orders]]). A Reader is a lay person authorised to lead worship and preach who will also be found in low-church and broad-church traditions as well. The former will be dressed in the historic eucharistic vestments specific to their office ([[chasuble]], [[dalmatic]] and [[tunicle]], respectively). They will sometimes wear [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s and ornamented [[amice]]s. The Reader will always wear cassock, surplice and blue scarf as laid down by canon. In many churches the altar will be fixed against the \"east wall\" and the sacred ministers will celebrate Mass facing the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] (often surmounted by a [[crucifix]]) above the altar, i.e., the [[sacred]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]s and the congregation will all be facing the same direction. Apart from the tabernacle (containing the reserved sacrament) the altar is often adorned with six candles. [[Incense]] and [[Altar bell|sanctus bells]] are often used during the liturgy and the eucharist itself is often supplemented by a number of prayers from earlier liturgies prayed by the priest, sacred ministers, and servers and sometimes the people as well.\n\nAnglo-Catholic eucharistic theology places an emphasis on frequent communion, ideally daily. The unconsumed elements are typically reserved in a tabernacle or aumbry safe, either attached to a fixed altar or placed behind or to one side of a free-standing altar. Reserved sacrament is often used when visiting the sick or housebound, as well as in ministry to the dying. When the sacrament is present, Anglo-Catholics will often [[genuflect]] when passing in front of it. When absent they will bow to the altar. Often an [[aumbry]] is dignified in the same way. Many Anglo-Catholics practice [[eucharistic adoration]] and [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]], either informally or through a corporate liturgical rite.\n\n==Administration==\nWhile the matter is always bread and wine, there is some variation. The bread may be in the form of individual wafers or an actual loaf from which pieces are torn off and distributed. Wine is typically red, but may be white. In some instances, fortified wine, such as [[sherry]] or [[port wine]], is used. In still others, the option of juice is offered, usually in consideration of recipients who may be [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] (although it is considered acceptable and valid to receive the sacrament in only in one kind, i.e., the bread, ''pace'' the rubrics of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer).\n\nThe manner of administration varies. Many Anglican parishes retain the use of an [[altar rails|altar rail]], separating the area around the [[altar]] from the rest of the church. This practice is meant to convey the sanctity associated with the altar. In such churches, those who wish to receive communion will come forward and kneel at the altar rail, sometimes making the [[sign of the cross]] and cupping their hands (right over left) to receive the bread, then crossing themselves again to receive the chalice. Anglo-Catholics are often careful not to chew the bread (hence the overwhelming use of wafers in these parishes) or touch the chalice. Some prefer to have the bread placed directly on their tongue. In other parishes recipients stand before the administrators to receive Communion, while in still others participants may pass the sacrament from one to the next, often standing in a circle around the altar. The practice of using individual cups and handing out individual wafers or pieces of bread to be consumed simultaneously by the whole congregation is extremely uncommon in Anglicanism, but not unheard of.\n\nAnglican practice is that those who administer the sacrament must be licensed by the diocesan [[bishop]]. Traditionally, priests and deacons were the only ministers authorised to administer; however, many provinces now permit the licensing of lay administrants.\n\nThe question of who may receive communion likewise varies. In historic Anglican practice, the altar was \"fenced\" from those whose manner of living was considered to be un[[repent]]antly [[sin]]ful. As parishes grew and the private lives of individuals became less accessible to public knowledge, this practice receded &mdash; although priests will, on occasion, refuse to admit to communion those whom they know to be actively engaged in notoriously sinful behaviour, such as criminal activity. Most Anglican provinces keep an \"open table\", meaning that all [[baptism|baptised]] Christians are welcome to receive communion. In many others, access to the sacrament is reserved for those who have been both baptised and [[Confirmation|confirmed]], either in the Anglican or another tradition. Those who are ineligible or do not wish to receive are frequently encouraged to come forward and cross their arms to form a sign of the cross to indicate that they wish to receive a [[blessing]].\n\n==Reservation, consumption, disposal==\n\nA rubric following the Order of Holy Communion in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer instructs that any remaining bread and wine should be consumed as soon as the service concludes:\n\n{{quote|And if any of the Bread and Wine remain unconsecrated, the Curate shall have it to his own use: but if any remain of that which was consecrated, it shall not be carried out of the Church, but the Priest, and such other of the Communicants as he shall then call unto him, shall, immediately after the Blessing, reverently eat and drink the same.}}\n\nIn American Prayer Books (until 1979), the rubric read thus:\n\n{{quote|And if any of the consecrated Bread and Wine remain after the Communion, it shall not be carried out of the Church; but the Minister and other Communicants shall, immediately after the Blessing, reverently eat and drink the same.}}\n\nArticle XXVIII of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] states that, \"The Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper was not by Christ\u2019s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.\" [[Edgar Gibson]], the [[Bishop of Gloucester]] explains this article, writing that \"The statement in the Article is worded with the utmost care, and with studied moderation. It cannot be said that any one of the practices is condemned or prohibited by it. It only amounts to this: that none of them can claim to be part of the original Divine institution.\"{{sfn|Gibson|1897|pp=664\u2013665}} The Anglican priest Jonathan A. Mitchican rehashes this view, stating that Article XXVIII does not forbid the practice of reservation, but notes that it does not have an origin in Sacred Scripture.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mitchican |first=Jonathan A. |date=22 July 2011 |title=Ask an Anglican: Eucharistic Adoration |url=http://conciliaranglican.com/2011/07/22/ask-an-anglican-eucharistic-adoration/ |work=The Conciliar Anglican |access-date=11 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701041231/https://conciliaranglican.com/2011/07/22/ask-an-anglican-eucharistic-adoration/ |archive-date=1 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs such, today, only a minority of Anglican dioceses do not authorize their individual churches to reserve the sacrament between services. In these churches, reverent consumption or disposal is often practiced.

Furthermore, when an Orthodox Layman is dying, if he confesses his sins, and professes that he is dying in the full communion of the Orthodox Faith, as expressed in the Orthodox version of the Nicene Creed, and the other requirements of the said Church, and desires the Blessed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, at the hands of an Episcopal Clergyman, permission is hereby given to administer to him this Blessed Sacrament, and to be buried according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Episcopal Church.

Its sources include [[prayer book]] [[rubric]]s, writings on [[Anglican sacraments|sacramental theology]] by [[Anglican divine]]s, and the regulations and orientations of [[ecclesiastical province]]s. The principal source material is the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (abbr: BCP), specifically its [[eucharistic prayer]]s and Article XXVIII of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]]. Article XXVIII comprises the foundational Anglican [[Anglican doctrine|doctrinal]] statement about the Eucharist, although its interpretation varies among churches of the [[Anglican Communion]] and in different traditions of [[churchmanship]] such as [[Anglo-Catholicism]] and [[Evangelical Anglicanism]]. \n\nAnglican [[eucharistic theology|eucharistic theologies]] universally affirm the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], though [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical Anglicans]] believe that this is a [[Lord's Supper in Reformed theology|pneumatic presence]], while those of an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship believe this is a corporeal presence.{{sfn|Campbell|1996|p=325}} In the former interpretation, those who receive the form or sign of the body and blood (bread and wine) in faith, receive also the spiritual body and blood of Christ. Those who receive the form or sign without faith, or for those who are wicked, Christ is not present spiritually and they consume only the physical signs of this holy presence, which further adds to their wickedness \u2013 in accordance with Article XXIX.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=The Thirty-Nine Articles |accessdate=8 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5Prjkilh0?url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |archivedate=25 June 2007 }}</ref> In the latter interpretation, there exists the corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, although the precise manner of how that presence is made manifest is a [[mystery of faith]].{{sfnm |1a1=Herbert Stowe |1y=1932 |2a1=Lears |2y=1981 |2p=202}} To explain the manner of Christ's presence, some [[high church|high-church]] Anglicans, however, teach the philosophical explanation of [[consubstantiation]],{{sfn|Murphy|2007|p=512}} associated with the English [[Lollards]] and, later, erroneously with [[Martin Luther]], though Luther and the Lutheran churches explicitly rejected the doctrine of consubstatiation and actually promulgated their dogma of the [[sacramental union]].{{sfnm |1a1=Diehl |1y=1888 |1pp=349\u2013350 |2a1=Mattox |2a2=Roeber |2y=2012|2p=54}} A major leader in the Anglo-Catholic [[Oxford Movement]], [[Edward Pusey]], championed the view of consubstantiation.{{sfn|Rigg|1895|p=293}}\n\n==Sacramental theology==\n{{further|Anglican sacraments}}\nWith the [[Eucharist]], as with other aspects of theology, Anglicans are largely directed by the principle of ''[[lex orandi, lex credendi]]'' which means \"the law of prayer is the law of belief\". In other words, sacramental theology as it pertains to the Eucharist is sufficiently and fully articulated by the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of a given jurisdiction. As defined by the 16th-century Anglican theologian [[Richard Hooker]], the sacraments are said to be \"visible signs of invisible grace\";{{sfn|Hooker|2003|p=201}} similarly the ''Catechism'' of the 1662 version states that a sacrament is \"an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given to us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.\" It thus has the effect of conveying [[sanctification]] in the individual participating in the sacrament. According to this, in the Eucharist the outward and visible sign is \"bread and wine\" and the \"thing signified\", the \"body and blood of Christ\", which are truly taken and received by the faithful in the Lord's supper.\n\nSacraments have both ''form'' and ''matter''. ''Form'' is the verbal and physical liturgical action, while the ''matter'' refers to material objects used (bread and wine). In an Anglican Eucharist the form is contained in the rite and its [[rubric]]s, as articulated in the authorised prayer books of the [[ecclesiastical province]]. Central to the rite is the [[eucharistic prayer]] or \"Great Thanksgiving\".\n\nFor the vast majority of Anglicans, the Eucharist (also called \"[[Holy Communion]]\", \"[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]\", the Divine Liturgy, the \"Lord's Supper,\" or The Great Thanskgiving), is the central act of gathered worship, the appointed means by which Christ can become present to his church. For the majority of Anglicans this event constitutes the renewal of the Body of Christ as the Church through the reception of the Body of Christ as the [[Blessed Sacrament]], his spiritual body and blood. In this sacrament, Christ is both encountered and incorporated (they \"partake\" of him). As such, the eucharistic action looks backward as a memorial of Christ's sacrifice, forward as a foretaste of the [[heaven|heavenly banquet]] and to the present as an [[incarnation]] of Christ in the lives of the community and of individual believers.\n\n[[Anglican doctrine]] concerning the eucharist is contained in ''Article XXVIII - Of the Lord's Supper'' and ''XXIX - Of the Wicked which eat not the Body of Christ'' of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]]. The Catechism of the [[Church of England]], the foundational church of the Anglican Communion, is found in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and states that, as with other sacraments, the eucharist is \"an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.\"{{sfn|Blunt|1888|p=435}} The outward sign, in this instance, is the bread and wine; and the thing signified is the body and blood of Christ.\n\n==Varieties of eucharistic theology==\nBecause of the various theological movements which have influenced Anglicanism throughout history, there is no one sacramental theory accepted by all Anglicans. Early Anglican theologians, such as [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[Richard Hooker]], held to a sacramental theology similar to [[John Calvin]]. Cranmer's belief was substantially Calvinist, Receptionism and Virtualism, as shown by Peter Brooks in 1965.<ref>The Study of Liturgy, 1991, p. 316 {{ISBN|978-0-19-520922-8}}</ref> Hooker's was a more nuanced combination of Receptionism and Real Presence but agnostic as to what the elements were in themselves but insistent that \"the sacrament is a true and a real participation of Christ, who thereby imparteth himself even in his whole entire Person as a Mystical Head...\"<ref>John R. H.

But though they can certainly be claimed in the favour of the real Presence, yet to bring into them a theory of \"accidents\" remaining while the \"substance\" is changed, is to read into the text that which is certainly not contained in it, and what we deny can reasonably be referred from it.{{sfn|Gibson|1897|p=657}}}}\n\n===Pneumatic presence===\n{{see also|Lord's Supper in Reformed theology}}\n[[Low church|Low-church]] Anglicans reject belief in a corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and accordingly, usually any belief in the reservation and adoration of the sacrament. Reservation was eliminated in practice by the rubric at the end of the 1662 Communion service which ordered the reverent consumption of any consecrated bread and wine immediately after the blessing, and adoration by the \"[[Black Rubric|Declaration concerning Kneeling]]\".{{sfn|Gibson|1897|pp=666\u2013667}} Instead, they hold to a \"spiritual real presence\" view of the Eucharist similar to the views held by Reformed Protestant denominations such as [[Presbyterian]]s. Low-church parishes and ministers tend to celebrate the Eucharist less frequently (e.g., monthly) and prefer the terms \"Holy Communion\" or \"Lord's Supper\". This view has historical precedent. During the seminal years of the [[English Reformation]], Thomas Cranmer was in correspondence with many continental Reformers, several of whom came to England at his request to aid in reforms there. They included [[Martin Bucer]], [[Paul Fagius]], [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], [[Bernardino Ochino]] and [[Jan \u0141aski]]. The views of these men were in line with the Reformed doctrine of the sacrament.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nCranmer wrote on the Eucharist in his treatise ''On the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Lord's Supper'' that Christians truly receive Christ's \"self-same\" Body and Blood at Communion \u2013 but in \"an heavenly and spiritual manner\" which is close to the Calvinistic doctrine.<ref>Farris, Joshua; Hamilton, S. Mark; Speigel, James, S, ''Idealism and Christian Theology: Idealism and Christianity''. Vol. I, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|1-62-89204-39}}.</ref>\n\nThis is in agreement with the continental Reformed view found in Chapter XXI of the [[Second Helvetic Confession]]:\n\n{{quote|There is also a spiritual eating of Christ's body; not such that we think that thereby the food itself is to be changed into spirit, but whereby the body and blood of the Lord, while remaining in their own essence and property, are spiritually communicated to us, certainly not in a corporeal but in a spiritual way, by the Holy Spirit, who applies and bestows upon us these things which have been prepared for us by the sacrifice of the Lord's body and blood for us, namely, the remission of sins, deliverance, and eternal life; so that Christ lives in us and we live in him, and he causes us to receive him by true faith to this end that he may become for us such spiritual food and drink, that is, our life.\n\nBut he who comes to this sacred Table of the Lord without faith, communicates only in the sacrament and does not receive the substance of the sacrament whence comes life and salvation; and such men unworthily eat of the Lord's Table. Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and eats and drinks judgment upon himself (I Cor. 11:26-29). For when they do not approach with true faith, they dishonor the death of Christ, and therefore eat and drink condemnation to themselves.}}\n\nThis emphasis on the faith of the receiver instead of the elements, common to both the Continental Reformed churches and the Church of England, has also been called \"[[receptionism]]\". However, Christ's presence in the sacrament is objective and is in no way dependent on the attitude of the recipient who perceives it by faith.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Consubstantiation===\nThe doctrine of [[consubstantiation]], which originated out of the pre-Reformation [[Lollardy]] movement in England, is one with which some Anglicans identify.{{sfn|Murphy|2007|p=512}} The 19th-century Anglo-Catholic divine [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] (a leader of the [[Oxford Movement]]) argued strongly for the idea of consubstantiation.{{sfn|Rigg|1895|p=293}} Discussing Pusey's view, Thomas S. L. Vogan wrote:\n{{quotation|I cannot deem it unfair to apply the name of Consubstantiation to a doctrine which teaches, that \"the true flesh and true blood of Christ are in the true bread and wine,\" in such a way that \"whatsoever motion or action the bread\" and wine have, the body and blood \"of Christ also\" have \"the same;\" and that \"the substances in both cases\" are \"so mingled--that they should constitute some one thing.\"{{sfn|Vogan|1871|p=54}}}}\nIn this doctrine, the bread and wine do not disappear at the consecration, but that the Body and Blood become present without diminishing them.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nAlthough it originated with Lollardism, consubstantiation is erroneously said to be the doctrine of [[Martin Luther]] and the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, which actually reject consubstantiation and instead teach the doctrine of [[sacramental union]].{{sfn|Pelikan|Oswald|Lehmann|1999|p=xix}}\n\nA maxim in Anglicanism concerning Christ's presence is that \"it may not be about a change of substance, but it is about a substantial change.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jeremy |author-link=Jeremy Taylor |year=1852 |chapter=Of the Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Sacrament |editor-last=Heber |editor-first=Reginald |editor-link=Reginald Heber |title=The Whole Works of the Right Reverend Jeremy Taylor |volume=6 |location=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans |page=14 |ref=harv}} Cited in {{harvnb|Ely|2012}}.</ref> If substantial denotes a spiritual property of the sacraments themselves this is the Reformed view, since, after consecration, the elements are only fit for holy use and may no longer be used as common bread and wine.{{sfn|Pelikan|Oswald|Lehmann|1999|p=xix}}\n\nThis view is expressed in the allied but [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] different doctrines of consubstantiation and sacramental union. Both views hold that Christ is present in the eucharistic elements spiritually. Such spiritual presence may or may not be believed to be in bodily form, depending on the particular doctrinal position.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} It may in fact be a mystical, yet still physical, Body of Christ, as some Anglicans{{who|date=February 2011}} hold, or a superphysical reality \"superimposed\" in, with, and under the bread and wine. Although this is similar to consubstantiation, it is different as it has a decidedly mystical emphasis.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Receptionism===\n\nAn imprecisely defined view common amongst 16th- and 17th-century Anglican theologians is known as \"[[receptionism]]\", a term not found before 1867. According to this view, although the bread and wine remain unchanged, through the worthy reception of the sacrament the communicant receives the body and blood of Christ.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=1380}} It remained \"the dominant theological position in the Church of England until the Oxford Movement in the early nineteenth century, with varying degrees of emphasis\". It is important to remember that it is \"a doctrine of the real presence\" but one which \"relates the presence primarily to the worthy receiver rather than to the elements of bread and wine\".<ref>Crockett, William R., 'Holy Communion,' in Sykes, Stephen; Booty, John, The Study of Anglicanism, 1988 p. 275 {{ISBN|978-0-8006-2087-5}}</ref>\n\n==Shape of the rite==\nAs mentioned above, the [[liturgy]] for the Eucharist is important in Anglican [[eucharistic theology]] because of the principle of ''lex orandi, lex credendi''. The liturgy is defined in the authorised prayer books of the various national churches and ecclesiastical provinces of the communion. The eucharistic rites follow one or other of two main sources, either the [[Book of Common Prayer (1549)|First English Prayer Book of 1549]] or the Second of 1552 which, with minor modifications, became the 1662 Book BCP which is still today the official and legal reference-point for the Church of England.<ref>Canons A3, A5</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2017}} The author of both rites was [[Thomas Cranmer]], who maintained that there was no theological difference between the two,{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|pp=463, 629}} but was forced to make its reformed theology more obvious when conservative clergy hostile to the English Reformation took advantage of [[loophole]]s in the 1549 prayer book to make the new liturgy as much like the old Latin [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] as possible, including [[Elevation (liturgy)|elevating the Eucharist]].{{Sfn| Marshall | 2017 | p = 339}}\n\nSome or all of the following elements may be altered, transposed, or absent depending on the rite used by the province or national church. In modern liturgies whichever source (1549 or 1552) they follow for the sacrament, the Liturgy of the Word has, with variations, a fairly standard pattern:{{sfn|Seddon|1996|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\n*The Liturgy of the Word\n** '''The Gathering of the Community''': Beginning with a [[Trinitarian formula|Trinitarian]]-based greeting or [[liturgical year|seasonal]] acclamation; followed by the Collect for Purity; the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]], [[Kyrie eleison]], and/or [[Trisagion]]; and then the [[Collect]] of the day. During [[Lent]] and/or [[Advent]] especially, this part of the service may begin or end with a [[penance|penitential rite]].\n** '''The Proclamation of the Word''': Usually two to three readings of Scripture, one of which is always from the [[Gospel]]s, plus a [[psalm]] (or portion thereof) or [[canticle]]. This is followed by a [[sermon]] or [[homily]]; the recitation of the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] or [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] Creed;\n** The '''Prayers of the People''': Very varied in form. The [[Holy kiss|passing of the peace]] may be placed here.\n*The Liturgy of Sacrament (1549, Scottish Canon, recent prayer books)\n**'''The Celebration of the Eucharist''': The gifts of bread and wine are received, along with other gifts (such as money and/or food for a food bank, etc.), and an [[offertory]] prayer is recited. Following this, a [[eucharistic prayer]] (called \"The Great Thanksgiving\") is recited. This prayer consists of a dialogue (the [[Sursum Corda]]), a preface, the [[sanctus]] and [[Sanctus Benedictus|benedictus]], the [[Words of Institution]], the [[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]], the oblation or presentation of the gifts to God in the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, the [[epiclesis]] or request that the Holy Spirit descend upon the gifts and sanctify them to be the Body and Blood of Jesus, an eschatological statement about the end time, doxology and congregational assent, Amen. The entire prayer is consecratory. The Lord's Prayer follows, and is followed by the [[fraction (religion)|fraction]] (the breaking of the bread), the [[Prayer of Humble Access]], which is optional, the [[Agnus Dei]], and the distribution of the sacred elements (the bread and wine). There is a post-Communion prayer. A [[doxology]] or general prayer of thanksgiving may follow. The service concludes with a Trinitarian blessing and the dismissal.\n*The Liturgy of Sacrament (1552/1662 style):\n**The priest prepares the table. Invitation to examine oneself, confession, absolution, \"comfortable words\".<ref>Mt 11:28; John 3:16; I Tim 1:15 1 John 2:1</ref> The [[Sursum Corda]], preface, the [[sanctus]], [[Prayer of Humble Access]], [[Words of Institution]]. Then comes the distribution of the elements, the Lord's Prayer, concluding prayer of thanksgiving, the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] and blessing.\n\nThe theology of these rites has been considerably modified in the last 200 years, with the reintroduction of oblationary language as pertaining to an objective, material sacrifice offered to God in union with Christ. The Prayer Books of 1552, 1559, 1604 and 1662 placed sacrificial language in a post-communion prayer in order to detach it from the context of the eucharistic prayer. A prime example of these modifications can be found in the American Book of Common Prayer introduced by the first American Episcopal bishop Samuel Seabury and adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1789. He insisted on the adoption of a full eucharistic prayer of the non-Juror Scottish Episcopal Church Rite to replace the truncated version of the earlier English rites beginning in 1552. The adopted prayer included the words, \"with these thy holy gifts, which we now offer unto thee\", which were inserted after the words from the 1549 Rite \"we, thy humble servants, do celebrate and make before thy Divine Majesty, and before the words \"the memorial thy Son hath commanded us to make\" BCP (cf. these changes in the article on Samuel Seabury). An epiclesis was also restored. The insertion of these ten words in effect undid Cranmer's theology that the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving was restricted to words and sentiments in prayer.\n\n=== Church of England ===\n\nThroughout the 20th century the Eucharist in the Church of England has undergone a number of significant changes and in most churches the BCP is no longer used for many services. The Prayer Book (Alternative and Other Services) Measure of 1965 redefined where \"lawful authority lay\".\n\n* The Book of Common Prayer 1662 \n* A new concept of alternative services that could be authorised for up to seven years. Further authorisation of seven years could be granted by General Synod.\n* Provision for making legal other services outside the range of Book of Common Prayer such as family services.\n\nUnder the new measure all services that the 1928 deposited prayer book that had been in use for nearly 40 years on the say so of individual bishops lost all legal authority. They would then have to authorised as alternate services. The Liturgical Commission would not assist in this process so it was left to the House of Bishops to edit a set of rites from 1928 and publish them. These were published in December 1965 as were later to be known as Series 1. At the same time the Liturgical Commission also produced and published texts in readiness for the new measures to come into force and these were known as Series 2. The eucharist in this series met with dissent in two key places: the use of 'offer' in relation to the bread and wine in the eucharistic prayer and the provision of prayers for the dead. It took until 1967 for General Synod to agree to a shape for the service. But in 1969 the whole of Series 2 was to disappear into obscurity following a dispute between the Houses of Laity and Clergy over the funeral service. At the same that Series 1 and 2 were going through General Synod there was a growing shift in the English speaking world away from the use of Tudor language in worship. Use of modern English and addressing God as you gave birth to a further version of the eucharist which would be called Series 3. The International Consultation on English Texts (ICET) produced some recommended common texts for English speaking Christians. Unlike Series 1 and 2 which had a shape based on the BCP the series 3 communion service followed the shape that many today would recognise. Its first presentation to General Synod in 1971 led to severe criticism but after some minor revisions it was approved the following year. Although the BCP remained the norm in many parishes a high proportion were being prepared for a new series of services where God was addressed as 'you' all the way throughout.\n\n'''Alternative Service Book'''\n\nThe time limits introduced in 1966 hampered the usefulness of the new services. Many were produced in chap booklet forms. But the Church of England (Worship and Doctrine) Measure 1974 permitted General Synod to provide by canon the unlimited use of alternative services. In 1976 a working party was set up to bring all of the various series three booklets including that for the eucharist together into a single volume of reasonable This work was completed by the end of 1979 and the volume was authorised by synod the following year. Initially this was for 10 years but in 1990 this was extended for a further 10 years. The Alternative Service Book 1980 (ASB) had two communion services - Rite A and Rite B. Rite B was based on Series 1 in as far as it was based on the shape of the BCP service and was in traditional language. Rite A was based on the Series 3 communion service and the majority of the volume was written in contemporary language in recognition that English over the centuries since the BCP was produced had changed in meaning and usage. The order for Rite A is as follows:\n\n* The preparation: a greeting, the collect of purity and the penitential rite.\n* Kyrie Elesion or Gloria in Excelsis depending on the season.\n* Ministry of the Word: scriptural readings, a psalm (often not used), sermon and creed.\n* Prayers of intercession and an alternative place for the penitential rite if needed.\n* Sharing of The peace \n* Ministry of the Sacrament including the offertory and the use of one of four eucharistic prayers to consecrate the bread and wine. The shape of which were as outlined above including prayer 4 which was version of the BCP prayer in modern English. \n* The provision for the use of hymns and other sacred music\n \nThere was also an order of service for parishes who wished to have a service in modern English but still keep the shape of that found in the BCP. This prayer book proved to be successful with it being taken up by the majority of parishes with rite A being the most popular of the two. But work did not stop here. There was a distinctive language shift which included the use of inclusive language as outlined in the report Making Women Visible (1988) but which was only adopted when the revised text for ''Common Worship'' was compiled. Seasonal material was produced. Firstly in 1986 was Lent, Holy Week and Easter which was followed in 1992 by ''The Promise of His Glory'' which contained a series of material for use between All Saints and Candlemas.\n\n=== Common Worship ===\n\nCommon Worship is the name given to the library of volumes that replace the Alternative Service Book 1980. In 1994 the Liturgical Commission suggested to General Synod that it was better to produce a series of separate texts rather than to squeeze everything into one volume. This reflected the findings of the Faith in the City report published in 1985 which identified that to give people a volume of 1300 pages was a symptom of the gulf between church and ordinary people. Ease of handling was the aim of producing the new worship material. This was available in separate booklets, congregational cards, downloadable files and also part of Visual Liturgy Service composing programme. The main volumes for the eucharist are\n\n* Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England: The main or core volume from which congregational worship is drawn\n* Common Worship: President's Edition which is used from where the service is lead \n* Common Worship: Times and Seasons bringing together season material.\n\nParishes were able to draw upon the core material to produce user friendly booklets to match the season and their local situation. Within Common Worship as in the ASB there are two orders of service - Order 1 and Order 2. Order 1 is a gentle revision of Rite A found in the ASB. The shape of the service was on the whole kept unchanged but the compilers of Common Worship were able to draw upon experience of post ASB seasonal material as well as changes to worship occurring in other denominations. Major changes to the text took place to ensure that inclusive language was used as well as giving a much wider choice of text. The rite was available in both modern and traditional language as was that in Order 2.\n\nThe shape of Order 1 is as follows\n\nIntroduction \n \n* The people and the priest greet each other in the Lord's name\n* Confess their sins. This is the only place it can now happen\n* Gloria unless in the penitential seasons\n* Collect of the day\n\nThe Word\n \n* At least two readings including the Gospel\n* A sermon\n* The creed or some other profession of faith\n \nPrayers of intercession\n\nThe Meal \n \n* Sharing of the peace\n*  Receiving of offerings\n*  Consecration of bread and wine\n*  Receiving of communion\n\nEnding departing with God's blessing\n\nOrder 2 has a more prayer book feel to the service.\n\nIntroduction \n \n* The people and priest prepare for worship by hearing and responding to the commandments \n*  Pray a collect\n\nThe word\n\n* At least two readings\n* A sermon\n* A profession of faith\n\nThe Prayers\n\n* Prepare the table\n* Pray for the church and world\n* Confess their sins\n\nThe Meal\n\nPraise God for his goodness\n* Consecrate the bread and wine\n* Receive communion\n* Respond with thanksgiving\n\nEnding by departing with God's blessing\n\nEach order can draw on one of eight communion prayers\n\nPrayers A to C were drawn from those that had been in rite A of the ASB with some revisions\nPrayer D is responsorial in nature and good for all age worship\nPrayer E is the shortest and has some of the flavour of prayer A \nPrayer F is responsorial and has its origins in the Eastern Christian tradition \nPrayer G is a redraft of a prayer produced by the Roman Catholic Church\nPrayer H is a dialogue between the priest and the people which ends with sanctus as an offering of praise\n\nBut Common Worship does not end there as the material that is now available for the eucharist is considerable. It includes \n* Two versions of the summary of the law \n* Two versions of the commandments \n* The Beatitudes\n* Two versions of the comfortable words\n* Four invitations to Confession \n* Six Confessions\n* Two Absolution \n* Seven Gospel Acclamations \n* Four prayers after communion \n* Seven authorised affirmations of faith as well as the Nicene and Apostles' Creed \n* Fifteen sets of seasonal provisions\n\nThis allows churches to have a lot more variety within their worship as well as to mark the seasons in a meaningful way. The most common way of presenting the material is through service booklets to make it user friendly rather than presenting the whole volume.\n\n==Customary of the rite==\n[[File:altar.stmaryredcliffe.arp.jpg|thumb|Typical style of an Anglican altar]]\nThe rubrics of a given prayer book outline the parameters of acceptable practice with regard to ritual, [[vestments]], ornaments and method and means of distribution of the sacrament. The communal piety of a given parish or diocese will determine the expression of these rubrics and the implicit eucharist theology.\n\nUntil the latter part of the 19th century, the so-called \"Ornaments Rubric\" of the 1662 Prayer Book was interpreted to inhibit much of the ceremonial contemporary Anglicans take for granted. Priests were directed to stand at the north side or north end of the [[altar]] and candles on the altar were considered forbidden, as was the wearing of a [[chasuble]] or [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]]. The [[Ritualism|Ritualist]] controversies of the late 19th century solidified the ascendancy of the [[Oxford Movement]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and many other parts of the Anglican Communion, introducing a much greater diversity of practice.\n\n===Low church===\n[[File:WilliamWhiteCommunion.jpg|thumb|left|Bishop [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] celebrating communion in choir dress in the 19th century. Such practice remains typical of [[low church|low-church]] clergy, who object to the use of sacramental vestments.]]\nIn [[low church|low-church]] parishes ceremonial is generally kept at a minimum, according to the rubrics of historical Anglican prayer books. The service is more often called Holy Communion than the eucharist. The priest is typically attired simply in a [[cassock]], [[surplice]], and a black scarf (called a [[tippet]]). This is a priest's \"[[choir habit]]\" as worn at a service of the word, but may also be worn as eucharistic vestments as was commonly done in earlier years. In some provinces identifying Low Church tradition by vesture alone is becoming more difficult as boundaries become blurred. Many parishes that have a more charismatic flavour have generally abandoned the use of robes at most of their services and their services are similar to that found in Pentecostal churches. But even this is not universal and will depend on parish tradition with some being vested for special occasions and the eucharist if it is celebrated less frequently, or if it is part of confirmation. In some Low Church parishes the minister may replace the black preaching scarf with a stole reflecting the colour of the season.\n\nManual action is kept to the standards of the rubrics found in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (often confined to placing one's hands on the elements during the words of institution). The altar is referred to as the \"Lord's table\", the \"holy table\", or simply the \"table\". [[Candle]]s are either absent or two in number. The material on the table may be limited to the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] and [[paten]], a cloth covering and, in some instances, the prayer book. The celebration of Holy Communion may be weekly or monthly. This frequency is in keeping with the Anglican practice that predominated prior to the 20th century. After the service, and following historical rubrics, the unconsumed bread and wine are reverently eaten by the priest and other ministers. If there is more than the clergy can finish, lay persons are called to help eat the remaining elements. In accordance with the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]], the remaining bread and wine are not reserved in a [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] or [[aumbry]]. In some parishes, the president stands at the north-side of the holy table to read the service, in accordance with some interpretations of the rubrics of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.\n\n===Broad church / Central churchmanship===\nIn most [[broad church|broad-church]] parishes there is slightly more elaboration. Attending the eucharist at a broad-church parish nowadays is likely to be similar in many respects to a contemporary Roman Catholic Mass. Priests will generally be vested in an [[alb]] and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and also, in many instances, a chasuble. They may make use of a [[lavabo]] in preparation for the celebration and the chalice and paten may be initially concealed by a [[burse]] and ornamental veil. Candles will almost always be present on the altar. Broad-church Anglicans typically celebrate the eucharist every Sunday, or at least most Sundays. The rite may also be celebrated once or twice at other times during the week. The sacrament is often reserved in an [[aumbry]] or consumed. Broad-church Anglicans may not reverence the sacrament, as such, but will frequently bow when passing the altar.\n\n===Anglo-Catholic===\n[[Anglo-Catholic]] worship involves further elaboration. The priest will often be joined by a [[deacon]] and often a [[Reader (Anglican Church)|reader]] (the deacon being ordained in [[Holy Orders]]). A Reader is a lay person authorised to lead worship and preach who will also be found in low-church and broad-church traditions as well. The former will be dressed in the historic eucharistic vestments specific to their office ([[chasuble]], [[dalmatic]] and [[tunicle]], respectively). They will sometimes wear [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s and ornamented [[amice]]s. The Reader will always wear cassock, surplice and blue scarf as laid down by canon. In many churches the altar will be fixed against the \"east wall\" and the sacred ministers will celebrate Mass facing the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] (often surmounted by a [[crucifix]]) above the altar, i.e., the [[sacred]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]s and the congregation will all be facing the same direction. Apart from the tabernacle (containing the reserved sacrament) the altar is often adorned with six candles. [[Incense]] and [[Altar bell|sanctus bells]] are often used during the liturgy and the eucharist itself is often supplemented by a number of prayers from earlier liturgies prayed by the priest, sacred ministers, and servers and sometimes the people as well.\n\nAnglo-Catholic eucharistic theology places an emphasis on frequent communion, ideally daily. The unconsumed elements are typically reserved in a tabernacle or aumbry safe, either attached to a fixed altar or placed behind or to one side of a free-standing altar. Reserved sacrament is often used when visiting the sick or housebound, as well as in ministry to the dying. When the sacrament is present, Anglo-Catholics will often [[genuflect]] when passing in front of it. When absent they will bow to the altar. Often an [[aumbry]] is dignified in the same way. Many Anglo-Catholics practice [[eucharistic adoration]] and [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]], either informally or through a corporate liturgical rite.\n\n==Administration==\nWhile the matter is always bread and wine, there is some variation. The bread may be in the form of individual wafers or an actual loaf from which pieces are torn off and distributed. Wine is typically red, but may be white. In some instances, fortified wine, such as [[sherry]] or [[port wine]], is used. In still others, the option of juice is offered, usually in consideration of recipients who may be [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] (although it is considered acceptable and valid to receive the sacrament in only in one kind, i.e., the bread, ''pace'' the rubrics of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer).\n\nThe manner of administration varies. Many Anglican parishes retain the use of an [[altar rails|altar rail]], separating the area around the [[altar]] from the rest of the church. This practice is meant to convey the sanctity associated with the altar. In such churches, those who wish to receive communion will come forward and kneel at the altar rail, sometimes making the [[sign of the cross]] and cupping their hands (right over left) to receive the bread, then crossing themselves again to receive the chalice. Anglo-Catholics are often careful not to chew the bread (hence the overwhelming use of wafers in these parishes) or touch the chalice. Some prefer to have the bread placed directly on their tongue. In other parishes recipients stand before the administrators to receive Communion, while in still others participants may pass the sacrament from one to the next, often standing in a circle around the altar. The practice of using individual cups and handing out individual wafers or pieces of bread to be consumed simultaneously by the whole congregation is extremely uncommon in Anglicanism, but not unheard of.\n\nAnglican practice is that those who administer the sacrament must be licensed by the diocesan [[bishop]]. Traditionally, priests and deacons were the only ministers authorised to administer; however, many provinces now permit the licensing of lay administrants.\n\nThe question of who may receive communion likewise varies. In historic Anglican practice, the altar was \"fenced\" from those whose manner of living was considered to be un[[repent]]antly [[sin]]ful. As parishes grew and the private lives of individuals became less accessible to public knowledge, this practice receded &mdash; although priests will, on occasion, refuse to admit to communion those whom they know to be actively engaged in notoriously sinful behaviour, such as criminal activity. Most Anglican provinces keep an \"open table\", meaning that all [[baptism|baptised]] Christians are welcome to receive communion. In many others, access to the sacrament is reserved for those who have been both baptised and [[Confirmation|confirmed]], either in the Anglican or another tradition. Those who are ineligible or do not wish to receive are frequently encouraged to come forward and cross their arms to form a sign of the cross to indicate that they wish to receive a [[blessing]].\n\n==Reservation, consumption, disposal==\n\nA rubric following the Order of Holy Communion in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer instructs that any remaining bread and wine should be consumed as soon as the service concludes:\n\n{{quote|And if any of the Bread and Wine remain unconsecrated, the Curate shall have it to his own use: but if any remain of that which was consecrated, it shall not be carried out of the Church, but the Priest, and such other of the Communicants as he shall then call unto him, shall, immediately after the Blessing, reverently eat and drink the same.}}\n\nIn American Prayer Books (until 1979), the rubric read thus:\n\n{{quote|And if any of the consecrated Bread and Wine remain after the Communion, it shall not be carried out of the Church; but the Minister and other Communicants shall, immediately after the Blessing, reverently eat and drink the same.}}\n\nArticle XXVIII of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] states that, \"The Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper was not by Christ\u2019s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.\" [[Edgar Gibson]], the [[Bishop of Gloucester]] explains this article, writing that \"The statement in the Article is worded with the utmost care, and with studied moderation. It cannot be said that any one of the practices is condemned or prohibited by it. It only amounts to this: that none of them can claim to be part of the original Divine institution.\"{{sfn|Gibson|1897|pp=664\u2013665}} The Anglican priest Jonathan A. Mitchican rehashes this view, stating that Article XXVIII does not forbid the practice of reservation, but notes that it does not have an origin in Sacred Scripture.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mitchican |first=Jonathan A. |date=22 July 2011 |title=Ask an Anglican: Eucharistic Adoration |url=http://conciliaranglican.com/2011/07/22/ask-an-anglican-eucharistic-adoration/ |work=The Conciliar Anglican |access-date=11 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701041231/https://conciliaranglican.com/2011/07/22/ask-an-anglican-eucharistic-adoration/ |archive-date=1 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs such, today, only a minority of Anglican dioceses do not authorize their individual churches to reserve the sacrament between services. In these churches, reverent consumption or disposal is often practiced. When disposed, the elements may be finely broken/poured over the earth or placed down a \"[[piscina]]\" in the [[sacristy]], a sink with a pipe that leads underground to a pit or into the earth. What is done with the remaining elements is often reflective of [[churchmanship]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Portman |first=William |date=1 May 2000 |title=Dealing with Eucharistic 'Leftovers' Can Cause Deep Offence |url=http://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/dealing-with-eucharistic-leftovers-can-cause-deep-offence-957/ |newspaper=Anglican Journal |access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhere reservation is permissible parishes will place the sacrament (along with holy oils) in an aumbry - a cupboard inserted in the wall of the [[chancel]]. As mentioned above, [[Anglo-Catholic]] parishes believing in the corporeal presence of the blessed sacrament make use of a tabernacle or hanging [[pyx]], with which is associated various acts of reverence and adoration.\n\n==Ecumenical developments==\n{{see also|Anglican Communion and ecumenism}}\nIn 1910, [[Raphael of Brooklyn]], an Eastern Orthodox bishop, \"sanctioned an interchange of ministrations with the [[Anglicanism|Episcopalians]] in places where members of one or the other communion are without clergy of their own\".{{sfn|Smith|1912|p=149}} Raphael stated that in places \"where there is no resident Orthodox Priest\", an Anglican priest could administer Marriage, Holy Baptism, and the Blessed Sacrament to an Orthodox layperson.{{sfn|Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of New Hampshire|1910|p=411<!--|ps=: \"Inasmuch as there is a variance between your and our Churches in these matters, I suggest that, before any marriage Service is performed for Syrians desiring the services of the Protestant Episcopal Clergy, where there is no Orthodox Priest, that the Syrians shall first procure a license from me, their Bishop, giving them permission, and that, where there is a resident Orthodox Priest, that, the Episcopal Clergy may advise them to have such Service performed by him. Again, in the case of Holy Baptism, that, where there is no resident Orthodox Priest, that the Orthodox law in reference to the administration of the Sacrament be observed, namely immersion three times, with the advice to the parents and witnesses that, as soon as possible, the child shall be taken to an Orthodox Priest to receive Chrismation, which is ''absolutely binding'' according to the Law of the Orthodox Church. Furthermore, when an Orthodox Layman is dying, if he confesses his sins, and professes that he is dying in the full communion of the Orthodox Faith, as expressed in the Orthodox version of the Nicene Creed, and the other requirements of the said Church, and desires the Blessed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, at the hands of an Episcopal Clergyman, permission is hereby given to administer to him this Blessed Sacrament, and to be buried according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Episcopal Church. But, it is recommended that, if an Orthodox Service Book can be procured, that the Sacraments and Rites be performed as set forth in that Book. And now I pray God that He may hasten the time when the Spiritual Heads of the National Churches, of both yours and ours, may take our places in cementing the Union between the Anglican and Orthodox Churches, which we have so humbly begun; then there will be no need of suggestions, such as I have made, as to how, or by whom, Services shall be performed; and, instead of praying that we \"all may be one\" ''we shall known that we are one in Christ's Love and Faith''. RAPHAEL, ''Bishop of Brooklyn''.\"-->}} In 1912, however, Raphael ended the intercommunion after becoming uncomfortable with the fact that the Anglican Communion contained different [[churchmanship]]s within it, e.g. high church, Evangelical, etc.{{sfn|Smith|1912|p=149}}\n\nRepresentatives of the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches have declared that they have reached \"substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist\" in the ''Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine''<ref>[http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_eucharist.html \"Anglican/Roman Catholic Joint preparatory Commission: Agreed Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine\"]</ref> developed by the [[Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission]], as well as the commission's ''Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement''.<ref>[http://www.prounione.urbe.it/dia-int/arcic/doc/e_arcic_elucid_euch.html Anglican/Roman Catholic Joint preparatory Commission: Elucidations on Eucharist (1979)]</ref> In 1994, the Anglican\u2013Roman Catholic Consultation in the United States of America released ''Five Affirmations on the Eucharist as Sacrifice'', which stated\n{{quote|that Christ in the eucharist makes himself present sacramentally and truly when under the species of bread and wine these earthy realities are changed into the reality of his body and blood. In English the terms ''substance'', ''substantial'', and ''substantially'' have such physical and material overtones that we, adhering to ''The Final Report'', have substituted the word ''truly'' for the word ''substantially'' ...\n\n... in the light of these five affirmations [the Anglican\u2013Roman Catholic Consultation in the United States of America] records its conclusions that the eucharist as sacrifice is not an issue that divides our two Churches.{{sfn|Gros|Mulhall|2006}}}}\n\nThis amounts to an acceptance of the doctrine, with an expression of a reservation about the use of the name of the doctrine in English because the word is misunderstood by English speakers.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n* [[Black Rubric]]\n* [[Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament]]\n* [[Transignification]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|22em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Campbell\n|first=Ted\n|year=1996\n|title=Christian Confessions: A Historical Introduction\n|location=Louisville, Kentucky\n|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press\n|isbn=978-0-664-25650-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|year=1888\n|editor-last=Blunt\n|editor-first=John Henry\n|editor-link=John Henry Blunt\n|title=The Annotated Book of Common Prayer: Being an Historical, Ritual, and Theological Commentary on the Devotional System of the Church of England\n|url=https://archive.org/details/annotatedbookof00chur\n|edition=rev.\n|location=London\n|publisher=Rivingtons\n|access-date=10 September 2017\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite dictionary\n|year=2005\n|editor-last1=Cross\n|editor-first1=F.

They are further remarkable in having Arian letters engraved on their bases or capitals, a peculiarity which points unmistakably to the employment of Western artists, and which fully accounts for the superiority of their execution. The letters found are p, s, a, and b, of which the first three occur twice. Now, if the same sculptors had been employed on the railings, we might confidently expect to find the same alphabetical letters used as private marks. But the fact is just the reverse, for the whole of the 27 marks found on any portions of the railing are Indian letters. The only conclusion that I can come to from these facts is that the foreign artists who were employed on the sculptures of the gateways were certainly not engaged on any part of the railing.

The medallion represents 3 scenes: (1) The four deers running away and one of them looking back at the far left and the man with bow at the far right represent the first scene: that of the hunt.  (2) The doe lying down at the bottom left looking at the antlered deer represents the second scene: that of the pregnant doe being subjected to the slaughter today but Banyan deer tells her to go and takes her place.  Cook/Butcher behind the Banyan deer watches this [and then he goes to tell the King, who comes with his entourage].  (3) The antlered deer sitting in the middle and preaching to the king [who is listening respectfully with folded hands] and his entourage is the third scene: that one should associate with good people.<ref>http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1015.htm</ref>\n|-\n|[[File:Bharhut Kurunga Miga Jataka.jpg|250px]]\n|'''Kurunga Miga Jataka'''.

One day, the antelope was caught in the noose of a hunter, and the tortoise endeavoured to bite through the noose to free the antelope, while the woodpecker, was making cries of ill-omen, so that the hunter would remain in his hut. The antelope escaped, but the tortoise, exhausted by her efforts, was caught by the hunter. The antelope then enticed the hunter to follow her in the forest, so that the tortoise was able to flee. The antelope was the Bodhisatta, that is the Buddha in a former life, [[S\u0101riputta]], a disciple of the Buddha, was the woodpecker, [[Moggallana]], also a disciple, was the tortoise in his former life.  [[Devadatta]] however, a traditional enemy of the Buddha, was the hunter. \nThis story is meant to demonstrate the wickedness of Devadatta, as well as the friendship and collaboration between the Buddha and his disciples, even in previous lives.\n|-\n|[[File:Muga Pakha Jataka 2.jpg|250px]]\n|'''Muga Pakaya Jataka'''/ '''Mugapakkha Jataka'''/ '''Temiya Jataka'''.

He persuaded the [[Bodhisattva]] (the future Buddha), who was then in the realm of the [[Tavatimsa]], to descend into her womb so that she could bear a child. The Bodhisattva thus entered the womb of the Queen, and when he was born was called Temiya.\n\nTemiya then realized that his father was a king, but having himself been king of [[Varanasi]] in a previous life, a rule which ended with 20.000 years in hell, he did not want to inherit the throne. He thus decided to play dumb and inactive to avoid the inheritance. Being worthless, his father arranged for his death, and ordered the charioteer Sunanda to perform the crime. When Sunanda was digging the grave in preparation, Temiya explained to him his stratagem. Impressed, Sunanda then wanted to be an ascetic and follow Temiya.\n\nTemiya then gave a sermon to the King and the Queen. They were impressed and also expressed the wish to become ascetics. Soon, all the citizens of the kingdom, as well as two neighboring kingdoms, become followers of Temiya.<ref>The Illustrated Jataka & Other Stories of the Buddha by C.B.

They are further remarkable in having Arian letters engraved on their bases or capitals, a peculiarity which points unmistakably to the employment of Western artists, and which fully accounts for the superiority of their execution. The letters found are p, s, a, and b, of which the first three occur twice. Now, if the same sculptors had been employed on the railings, we might confidently expect to find the same alphabetical letters used as private marks. But the fact is just the reverse, for the whole of the 27 marks found on any portions of the railing are Indian letters. The only conclusion that I can come to from these facts is that the foreign artists who were employed on the sculptures of the gateways were certainly not engaged on any part of the railing. I conclude, therefore, that the Raja of [[Shungas]], the donor of the gateways, must have sent his own party of workmen to make them, while the smaller gifts of pillars and rails were executed by the local artists.\" in The st\u016bpa of Bharhut: a Buddhist monument ornamented with numerous sculptures illustrative of Buddhist legend and history in the third century B.

Cook/Butcher behind the Banyan deer watches this [and then he goes to tell the King, who comes with his entourage].  (3) The antlered deer sitting in the middle and preaching to the king [who is listening respectfully with folded hands] and his entourage is the third scene: that one should associate with good people.<ref>http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1015.htm</ref>\n|-\n|[[File:Bharhut Kurunga Miga Jataka.jpg|250px]]\n|'''Kurunga Miga Jataka'''.

One day, the antelope was caught in the noose of a hunter, and the tortoise endeavoured to bite through the noose to free the antelope, while the woodpecker, was making cries of ill-omen, so that the hunter would remain in his hut. The antelope escaped, but the tortoise, exhausted by her efforts, was caught by the hunter. The antelope then enticed the hunter to follow her in the forest, so that the tortoise was able to flee. The antelope was the Bodhisatta, that is the Buddha in a former life, [[S\u0101riputta]], a disciple of the Buddha, was the woodpecker, [[Moggallana]], also a disciple, was the tortoise in his former life.  [[Devadatta]] however, a traditional enemy of the Buddha, was the hunter. \nThis story is meant to demonstrate the wickedness of Devadatta, as well as the friendship and collaboration between the Buddha and his disciples, even in previous lives.\n|-\n|[[File:Muga Pakha Jataka 2.jpg|250px]]\n|'''Muga Pakaya Jataka'''/ '''Mugapakkha Jataka'''/ '''Temiya Jataka'''.

He persuaded the [[Bodhisattva]] (the future Buddha), who was then in the realm of the [[Tavatimsa]], to descend into her womb so that she could bear a child. The Bodhisattva thus entered the womb of the Queen, and when he was born was called Temiya.\n\nTemiya then realized that his father was a king, but having himself been king of [[Varanasi]] in a previous life, a rule which ended with 20.000 years in hell, he did not want to inherit the throne. He thus decided to play dumb and inactive to avoid the inheritance. Being worthless, his father arranged for his death, and ordered the charioteer Sunanda to perform the crime. When Sunanda was digging the grave in preparation, Temiya explained to him his stratagem. Impressed, Sunanda then wanted to be an ascetic and follow Temiya.\n\nTemiya then gave a sermon to the King and the Queen. They were impressed and also expressed the wish to become ascetics. Soon, all the citizens of the kingdom, as well as two neighboring kingdoms, become followers of Temiya.<ref>The Illustrated Jataka & Other Stories of the Buddha by C.B.

He is one of four individuals to have attained the rank of [[Fleet admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] of the United States Navy, the others being [[Ernest King]], [[William D. Leahy|William Leahy]], and [[Chester W. Nimitz]].\n\nBorn in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], Halsey graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1904. He served in the [[Great White Fleet]] and, during [[World War I]], commanded the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}}. He took command of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} in 1935 after completing a course in naval aviation, and was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1938. At the start of the [[Pacific War|War in the Pacific]] (1941\u20131945), Halsey commanded the task force centered on the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} in a series of raids against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-held targets. \n\nHalsey was made commander, [[South Pacific Area]], and led the Allied forces over the course of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle for Guadalcanal]] (1942\u201343) and the [[Solomon Islands campaign|fighting up the Solomon chain]] (1942\u201345).<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\">Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 183.</ref>  In 1943 he was made commander of the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]], the post he held through the rest of the war.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\">Potter, p.&nbsp;112.</ref> He took part in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]]. He was promoted to fleet admiral in December 1945 and retired from active service in March 1947.\n\n==Early years==\nHalsey was born in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], on October 30, 1882, the son of [[United States Navy]] Captain [[William F. Halsey Sr.]]  \n\nHalsey was of [[English American|English]] ancestry, all of his ancestors came to America from England and all of them emigrated from [[England]] to [[New England]] in the early 1600s.  He felt a \"kinship\" with his ancestors, including Captain John Halsey of colonial Massachusetts who served in the British Royal Navy in [[Queen Anne's War]] from 1702 to 1713 where he raided French shipping.<ref>Admiral \"Bull\" Halsey: The Life and Wars of the Navy's Most Controversial Commander by John Wukovits pg. 1-2</ref><ref>Admiral Bill Halsey: A Naval Life by Thomas Alexander Hughes, pg. 16</ref> Through his father he was a descendant of Senator [[Rufus King]], who was an American lawyer, politician, diplomat, and [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]].

He chose Virginia because his best friend, Karl Osterhause, was there. While there, Halsey joined the [[Delta Psi]] fraternity and was also a member of the secretive [[Seven Society]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Bill |title=Seven Society's Secret Still Secret |newspaper=Washington Post |page=C8 |date=1965-02-15}}</ref> After his first year, Halsey received his appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy|United States Naval Academy at Annapolis]], and entered the Academy in the fall of 1900. While attending the academy he [[Varsity letter|lettered]] in football as a fullback and earned several [[Navy Midshipmen|athletic]] honors. Halsey graduated from the Naval Academy on February 2, 1904.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wukovits|first=John |title = Admiral \"Bull Halsey\" |year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn = 978-0-230-60284-7 |page=9 }}</ref> \n\nFollowing graduation he spent his early service years in [[battleship]]s, and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship {{USS|Kansas|BB-21|6}} as [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt's]] [[Great White Fleet]] [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe from 1907 to 1909. Halsey was on the bridge of the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-11|6}} on April 13, 1904, when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others. No explosion occurred, but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death 31 officers and enlisted sailors. This resulted in Halsey dreading the 13th of every month, especially when it fell on a Friday.<ref>Borneman, p.&nbsp;47.</ref>\n\nAfter his service on ''Missouri'', Halsey served aboard torpedo boats, beginning with {{USS|Du Pont|TB-7|6}} in 1909. Halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] to full lieutenant, skipping the rank of [[Lieutenant, junior grade|lieutenant (junior grade)]].<ref name=\"wukovits2010\">{{cite book|title=Admiral \"Bull\" Halsey: The Life and Wars of the Navy's Most Controversial Commander|last=Wukovits|first=John|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-60284-7}}</ref> Torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his, and he commanded the First Group of the Atlantic Fleet's Torpedo Flotilla in 1912 through 1913. Halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and [[destroyer]]s during the 1910s and 1920s. At that time, the destroyer and the torpedo boat, though extremely hazardous delivery methods, were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships. Then-[[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Halsey's World War I service, including command of {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}} in 1918, earned him the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\n== Interwar years ==\nIn October 1922, he was the [[Naval Attach\u00e9|naval attach\u00e9]] at the American Embassy in [[Berlin]], Germany. One year later, he was given additional duty as naval attach\u00e9 at the American Embassies in [[Oslo|Christiania]], Norway; [[Copenhagen]], Denmark; and [[Stockholm]], Sweden. He then returned to sea duty, again in destroyers in European waters, in command of {{USS|Dale|DD-290|6}} and {{USS|Osborne|DD-295|6}}. Upon his return to the U.S. in 1927, he served one year as executive officer of the battleship {{USS|Wyoming|BB-32|6}}, and then for three years in command of {{USS|Reina Mercedes|IX-25|6}}, the station ship at the Naval Academy. Then-[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Halsey continued his destroyer duty on his next two-year stint at sea, starting in 1930 as the Commander of Destroyer Division Three of the Scouting Force, before returning to study at the [[Naval War College]] in Newport, Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm |title = Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey Jr. |publisher=[[Naval Historical Center]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the chief of the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], Navy Admiral [[Ernest King]], offered Halsey command of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. \"I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot,\" said Halsey at the time. Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, \"What do you think that the old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!\"<ref>Borneman, p. 157.</ref> He went on to command the USS ''Saratoga'', and later the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] at [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, \"The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good.\" Halsey was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.\n\n==World War II==\nTraditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This view was challenged when Army Air Corps General [[Billy Mitchell]] demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal. The adage \"Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power\" was well known.<ref>Morison, ''The Rising Sun in the Pacific'', p. 190.</ref> Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wildenberg |first=Thomas |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/sheerluck_midway.htm |title=Midway: Sheer Luck or Better Doctrine? |journal=Naval College War Review |date=Winter 2005 |volume=58 |number=1 }} Wildenberg quotes Browning's thesis: \"Every carrier we have knows what it means to be 'bopped' with all planes on deck, because her hands were tied by uncertainty as to her next move...\"</ref> Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Husband Kimmel's]] hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to \"get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him.\" Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.\n\nIn April 1940, Halsey's ships, as part of Battle Fleet, moved to Hawaii and in June 1940, he was promoted to vice admiral (temporary rank), and was appointed commander Carrier Division 2 and commander Aircraft Battle Force.<ref name=wukovits2010 />\n\nWith tensions high and war imminent, U.S. Naval intelligence indicated [[Wake Island]] would be the target of a Japanese surprise attack. In response, on 28 November 1941 Admiral Kimmel ordered Halsey to take {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} to ferry aircraft to Wake Island to reinforce the Marines there. Kimmel had given Halsey \"a free hand\" to attack and destroy any Japanese military forces encountered.<ref name=wukovits2010 /> The planes flew off her deck on December 2. Highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the Japanese carrier force, Halsey gave orders to \"sink any shipping sighted, shoot down any plane encountered.\" Protested his operations officer, \"Goddammit, Admiral, you can't start a private war of your own! Who's going to take the responsibility?\" Said Halsey, \"I'll take it! If anything gets in my way, we'll shoot first and argue afterwards.\"<ref name=\"Books: The General and the Admiral\">{{cite web |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793941,00.html#ixzz1aL8AA1Tz |title = Books: The General and the Admiral |work=Time |date=November 10, 1947 }}</ref>  \n\nA storm delayed ''Enterprise'' on her return voyage to Hawaii. Instead of returning on December 6 as planned, she was still {{convert|200|mi}} out at sea, when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at Wake Island, but at [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] itself. News of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to Pearl Harbor, attempting to identify itself as American.<ref>Millis, p. 357.</ref> The plane was shot down, and her pilot and crew were lost. In the immediate wake of the attack upon Pearl Harbor,  Admiral Kimmel named Halsey \"commander of all the ships at sea.\"<ref name=wukovits2010 /> ''Enterprise'' searched south and west of the [[Hawaiian islands]] for the Japanese attackers, but did not locate the six Japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west.\n\n===Early Pacific carrier raids===\n[[File:Douglas SBD flies over USS Enterprise (CV-6) and USS Saratoga (CV-3) on 19 December 1942.jpg|thumb|right|An SBD Dauntless flies anti-submarine patrol over ''Enterprise'' and ''Saratoga''.]]\n\nHalsey and ''Enterprise'' slipped back into Pearl Harbor on the evening of December 8. Surveying the wreckage of the Pacific Fleet, he remarked, \"Before we're through with them, the Japanese language will be spoken only in hell.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Admiral Halsey's Story |url = https://archive.org/details/AdmiralHalseysStory |author= J.

Above all else, he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the U.S. Navy's fighting spirit when most required.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey''.</ref> In the early months of the war, as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another, Halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy. Serving as commander, [[Carrier Strike Group Two#Historical background|Carrier Division 2]], aboard his flagship ''Enterprise'', Halsey led a series of hit-and-run raids against the Japanese, striking the [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids|Gilbert and Marshall]] islands in February, Wake Island in March, and carrying out the [[Doolittle Raid]] in April 1942 against the Japanese capital [[Tokyo]] and other places on Japan's largest and most populous island [[Honshu]], the first air raid to strike the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], providing an important boost to American [[morale]]. Halsey's slogan, \"Hit hard, hit fast, hit often,\" soon became a byword for the Navy.\n\nHalsey returned to Pearl Harbor from his last raid on May 26, 1942, in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand. He had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier ''Enterprise,'' directing the Navy's counterstrikes. [[Psoriasis]] covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching, making it nearly impossible for him to sleep. Gaunt and having lost {{convert|20|lb|kg}}, he was medically ordered to the hospital in Hawaii.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the Japanese were planning an attack on the central Pacific island of Midway. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], [[CinCPAC|Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet]], determined to take the opportunity to engage them. Losing Midway would have been a very serious threat because the Japanese then could easily take Hawaii and threaten the west coast of the United States. The loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral, Halsey, on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to Nimitz.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 85.</ref> Nimitz met with Halsey, who recommended his cruiser division commander, Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Raymond Spruance]], to take command for the upcoming [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] operation.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 84.</ref> Nimitz considered the move, but it would mean stepping over Rear Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank Fletcher]] of Task Force 17, who was the senior of the two men. After interviewing Fletcher and reviewing his reports from the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] engagement, Nimitz was convinced that Fletcher's performance was sound, and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of Midway.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 86.</ref> Acting upon Halsey's recommendations, Nimitz then made Rear Admiral Spruance commander of Halsey's Task Force 16, comprising the carriers ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet''. To aid Spruance, who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force, Halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff, Captain [[Miles Browning]]. The ensuing harrowing Battle of Midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the United States and a dramatic victory for the U.S. Navy.\n\nHalsey's skin condition was so serious, he was sent on the light cruiser {{USS|Detroit|CL-8|6}} to San Francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment.  The skin condition soon receded but Halsey was ordered to stand down for the next six weeks and relax. While detached stateside during his convalescence, he visited family and traveled to Washington D.C. In late August, he accepted a speaking engagement at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Prior to the discussion of his raids against the Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, Halsey informed the midshipmen before him, \"Missing the Battle of Midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career, but I am going back to the Pacific where I intend personally to have a crack at those yellow-bellied sons of bitches and their carriers,\" which was received with loud applause.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;150.</ref>\n\nAt the completion of his convalescence in September 1942, Admiral Nimitz reassigned Halsey to Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet.\n\n===South Pacific Area Command===\n[[File:Admiral William F Halsey.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Halsey in the South Pacific.]]\n\nAfter being medically approved to return to duty, Halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the South Pacific Area. Since ''Enterprise'' was still laid up in Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs following the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], and the other ships of Task Force 16 were still being readied, he began a familiarization trip to the south Pacific on October 15, 1942, arriving at area headquarters at [[Noum\u00e9a]] in [[New Caledonia#Second World War|New Caledonia]] on October 18. The [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Campaign]] was at a critical juncture, with the 1st Marine Division, 11,000 men, under the combat command of Marine Major General [[Alexander Vandegrift|Alexander A. Vandegrift]] holding on by a thread around Henderson (Air) Field.  The Marines did receive additional support from the U.S. Army's 164th Regiment with a complement of 2,800 soldiers on October 13.  This addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself.\n\nDuring this critical juncture, naval support was tenuous due to Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley]]'s reticence, malaise and lackluster performance.<ref name=wukovits2010 />  Pacific Fleet commander Chester Nimitz had concluded that Vice Admiral Ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted.<ref>Morison, pp. 199\u2013207; Frank, pp. 368\u2013378; Dull, pp. 235\u2013237.</ref> Nimitz made his decision to change the [[South Pacific Area]] command while Halsey was en route. As Halsey's aircraft came to rest in Noum\u00e9a, a whaleboat came alongside carrying Ghormley's flag lieutenant. Meeting him before he could board the flagship, the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from Nimitz:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | YOU WILL TAKE COMMAND OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC AREA AND SOUTH PACIFIC FORCES IMMEDIATELY<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\"/>}}\n\nThe order came as an awkward surprise to Halsey. Ghormley was a long time personal friend, and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at Annapolis. Awkward or not, the two men carried out their directives. Halsey's command now included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. News of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered Marines, energizing his command. He was widely considered the U.S. Navy's most aggressive admiral, and with good reason. He set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed. Ghormley had been unsure of his command's ability to maintain the Marine toehold on Guadalcanal, and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the [[Bataan Death March|Bataan Peninsula]] disaster. Halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the Marines. He not only intended to counter the Japanese efforts to dislodge them, he intended to secure the island. Above all else, he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the Japanese. It was two days after Halsey had taken command in October 1942 that he gave an order that all naval officers in the South Pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms. As Richard Frank commented in his account of the Battle for Guadalcanal:\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Halsey said he gave this order to conform to Army practice and for comfort. To his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle |author=Richard Frank |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-016561-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/guadalcanal00rich }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey led the South Pacific command through what was for the U.S. Navy the most tenuous phase of the war. Halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around Guadalcanal, including the carrier engagements of the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. These engagements checked the Japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots. [[File:Nimitz and Halsey 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Admirals Nimitz and Halsey discuss South Pacific strategy in early 1943.]] In November Halsey's willingness to place at risk his command's two fast battleships in the confined waters around Guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the U.S. Navy winning the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], the decisive naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign that doomed the Japanese garrison and wrested control from the Japanese.\n\nJapanese naval aviation proved to be formidable during the Solomon campaign.<ref>Seal, Jon, and Michael Ahn. {{cite web |url = http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |title = An Interview with Joseph Jacob 'Joe' Foss. |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060209105228/http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |archive-date=February 9, 2006 |df=mdy-all |publisher = [[Microsoft Games Studios]] |date=March 2000 |access-date=August 3, 2011 }}</ref>  In April 1943, Halsey assigned Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]] to Commander Air, [[Solomon Islands]] (ComAirSols) where he directed a mixed bag of Army, Navy, Marine and New Zealand aircraft in the airwar over Guadalcanal and up the Solomon chain.  Said Halsey: \"I knew we'd probably catch hell from the Japs in the air.  That's why I sent Pete Mitscher up there.  Pete was a fighting fool and I knew it.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 145.</ref>\n\nTypical for the period was an exchange that occurred between Halsey and one of his staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked \"If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive.\" The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: \"As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;221.</ref>\n\nHalsey's forces spent the rest of the year [[Solomon Islands campaign|battling]] up the [[Solomon Islands]] chain to [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].  At Bougainville the Japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island, and another at the northern most peninsula, with a fourth on Buki just across the northern passage.  Here, instead of landing near the Japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the Japanese defenders, Halsey landed his invasion force of 14,000 Marines in [[Empress Augusta Bay]], about halfway up the west coast of Bougainville.  There he had the Seabees clear and build their own airfield.  Two days after the landing, a large cruiser force was sent down from Japan to Rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against Halsey's screening force and supply ships in Empress Augusta Bay.  The Japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year, but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers, along with one light cruiser and four destroyers.  At [[Rabaul]] the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle. Halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them.  The battleships {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}, {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the Central Pacific to support the upcoming invasion of Tarawa.  Other than the destroyer screen, the only force Halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|2}}.  Rabaul was a heavily fortified port, with five airfields and extensive anti-aircraft batteries.  Other than the surprise raid at Pearl Harbor, no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft.  It was highly dangerous to the aircrews, and to the carriers as well.  With the landing in the balance, Halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of Rabaul, then launch a daybreak raid on the base.  Aircraft from recently captured [[Vella Lavella]] were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers. All available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself.  The [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|mission]] was a stunning success, so damaging the cruiser force at Rabaul as to make them no longer a threat.  Aircraft losses in the raid were light.  Halsey later described the threat to the landings as \"the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as ComSoPac.\"<ref>Potter, ''Admiral Arleigh Burke'', pp.&nbsp;98\u201399.</ref>\n\nFollowing the successful Bougainville operation, he then isolated and neutralized the Japanese naval stronghold at Rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] in a series of amphibious landings known as [[Operation Cartwheel]]. This enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself.  With the neutralization of Rabaul, major operations in the South Pacific Command came to a close.  With his determination and grit, Halsey had bolstered his command's resolve and seized the initiative from the Japanese until ships, aircraft and crews produced and trained in the States could arrive in 1943 and 1944 to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416\u2013430.</ref>\n\n===Battles of the Central Pacific===\n[[File:VAdm John S. McCain and Adm William F. Halsey aboard USS New Jersey (BB-62), December 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Halsey (''right'') confers with Task Force 38 commander and fellow 'dirty trickster' Adm. [[John S. McCain Sr.]] on board Halsey's flagship, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|6}} in December 1944]]As the war progressed it moved out of the South Pacific and into the Central Pacific. Halsey's command shifted with it, and in May 1944 he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]. He commanded actions from the [[Philippines]] to Japan. From September 1944 to January 1945, he led the campaigns to take the [[Palaus]], [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] and [[Luzon]], and on many raids on Japanese bases, including off the shores of Formosa, China, and Vietnam.\n\nBy this point in the conflict the U.S. Navy was doing things the Japanese high command had not thought possible. The [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in. Moreover, the Navy's ability to establish [[USS Cascade (AD-16)#Service Squadron 4 and Service Squadron 10|forward operating ports]] as they did at [[Majuro#History|Majuro]], [[Enewetak Atoll#History|Enewetak]] and [[Ulithi#History|Ulithi]], and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces, allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western Pacific. The Japanese Navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy. The U.S. Navy remained at sea and on station, dominating whatever region it entered. The size of the Pacific Ocean, which Japanese planners had thought would limit the U.S. Navy's ability to operate in the western Pacific, would not be adequate to protect Japan.\n\nCommand of the \"big blue fleet\" was alternated with [[Raymond Spruance]].{{NoteTag|The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the name given to the main fleet of the US Navy in the Pacific.  The term stems from pre-war planning, called the color plans because each nation included was given a color code name. In these potential plans the British navy was red, the German navy black, and so forth. The Imperial Japanese Navy was termed the \"Orange Fleet\".  The U.S. fleet was the \"Blue Fleet\".  The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the massive fleet that the U.S. Navy anticipated they would win the war with.  It was thought this fleet would largely come into being by late 1943, early 1944.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" />}}  Under Spruance the fleet designation was the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]] and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 58\". Under Halsey the fleet was designated Third Fleet and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 38\".<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" /> The split command structure was intended to confuse the Japanese and created a higher tempo of operations. While Spruance was at sea operating the fleet, Halsey and his staff, self-dubbed the \"Department of Dirty Tricks\", would be planning the next series of operations.<ref>Cutler, ''The Battle of Leyte Gulf'', p. 209.</ref> The two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating, professional and cautious. Most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance; most common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey.<ref>{{cite book |title=America's Fighting Admirals:Winning the War at Sea in World War II |last=Tuohy |first=William |publisher=Zenith Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 323] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7603-2985-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 }}</ref>\n\n====Leyte Gulf====\n[[File:Halsey messing with crew.jpg|thumb|right|Halsey dines with crew of USS ''New Jersey'' (November 1944)]]\nIn October 1944, amphibious forces of the U.S. [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] carried out [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur's]] major landings on the island of [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] in the Central Philippines. Halsey's Third Fleet was assigned to cover and support Seventh Fleet operations around Leyte. Halsey's plans assumed the Japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort, creating an opportunity to engage it decisively. Halsey directed the Third Fleet \"will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/9fe423c2-9276-41c7-be29-04260b8a04c3/Replacing-Battleships-with-Aircraft-Carriers-in-th|last=Hone|first=Thomas|title=Replacing Battleships with Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific in World War II|work=Naval War College Review|date=Winter 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2017|p=71}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the invasion, the Japanese launched their final major naval effort, an operation known as 'Sho-Go', involving almost all their surviving fleet. It was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the [[Leyte Gulf]]. The Northern Force of Admiral Ozawa was built around the remaining Japanese aircraft carriers, now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots. The Northern Force was meant to lure the covering U.S. forces away from the Gulf while two surface battle-groups, the Center Force and the Southern Force, were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping. These forces were built around the remaining strength of the Japanese Navy, and comprised a total of 7 battleships and 16 cruisers. The operation brought about the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]].\n\nThe Center Force commanded by Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] was located October 23 coming through the Palawan Passage by two American submarines, which [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The submarine action in Palawan Passage .2823 October.29|attacked the force]], sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third. The following day Third Fleet's aircraft carriers launched strikes against Kurita's Center Force, [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea|sinking]] the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} and damaging the heavy cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|My\u014dk\u014d||2}}, causing the force to turn westward back towards its base. Kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the [[San Bernardino Strait]]. At this point Ozawa's Northern Force was located by Third Fleet scout aircraft. Halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the Japanese carrier forces, planning to strike them at dawn of October 25. He considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait, and made tentative plans to do so, but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover, weakening his chance to crush the remaining Japanese carrier forces. The entire Third Fleet steamed northward. San Bernardino Strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet.\n\n====Battle off Samar====\nIn moving Third Fleet northwards, Halsey failed to advise Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid|Thomas Kinkaid]] of Seventh Fleet of his decision. Seventh Fleet intercepts of organizational messages from Halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that Halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the San Bernardino Strait, but this was not the case. Kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with Halsey, and neither had confirmed this with Nimitz.\n\nDespite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of October 24\u201325 of Kurita's Center Force in the San Bernardino Strait, Halsey continued to take Third Fleet northwards, away from Leyte Gulf.\n\n[[File:Halsey Mccain.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Halsey with Vice Admiral [[John S. McCain Sr.]]]]\n\nWhen Kurita's Center Force emerged from the San Bernardino Strait on the morning of October 25, there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and [[destroyer escort]]s, Task Unit 77.4.3 \"Taffy 3\", which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarines, not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since the battle of Midway, led by the largest battleship in the world. Advancing down the coast of the island of Samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the Leyte Gulf landing, they took Seventh Fleet's escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise.\n\nIn the desperate [[Battle off Samar]] which followed, Kurita's ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers' screen, and damaged a number of other ships as well. The remarkable resistance of the screening ships of Taffy 3 against Kurita's battle-group remains one of the most heroic feats in the history of the US Navy. Their efforts and those of the several hundred aircraft that the escort carriers could put up, many of whom, however could not be armed with the most effective ordinance to deal with heavy surface ships in time, took a heavy toll on Kurita's ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case. Mistaking the escort carriers for Halsey's fleet carriers, and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the Third Fleet battleship group, he decided to withdraw back through the San Bernardino Strait and to the west without achieving his objective of disrupting the Leyte landing.\n\nWhen the Seventh Fleet's escort carriers found themselves under attack from the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours,<ref name=\"Willmott\">{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=H.

The world wonders\". The tail end of this message, [[The world wonders]], was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Finally Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney|Robert \"Mick\" Carney]], confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"<ref name=\"Books: The General and the Admiral\"/>\n\nHalsey cooled but continued to steam Third Fleet northward to close on Ozawa's Northern Force for a full hour after receiving the signal from Nimitz.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Then, Halsey ordered Task Force 34 south. As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers. The refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> By the time Task Force 34 arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the Seventh Fleet's escort carrier groups. Kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area. A single straggling destroyer was caught by Halsey's advance cruisers and destroyers, but the rest of Kurita's force was able to escape.\n\nMeanwhile the major part Third Fleet continued to close on Ozawa's Northern Force, which included one fleet carrier (the last surviving Japanese carrier of the six that had attacked Pearl Harbor) and three light carriers. The [[Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o]] resulted in Halsey's Third Fleet sinking all four of Ozawa's carriers.\n\nThe same attributes that made Halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war, his desire to bring the fight to the enemy, his willingness to take on a gamble, worked against him in the later stages of the war. Halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle, with naval historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison|Samuel Morison]] terming the Third Fleet run to the north \"Halsey's Blunder.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', pp. 376\u2013380.</ref> However, the destruction of the Japanese carriers had been an important goal up to that point, and the Leyte landings were still successful despite Halsey falling for the Japanese Navy's decoy.\n\n=== Halsey's Typhoon ===\n{{Main|Typhoon Cobra (1944)}}\n\n[[File:USS Langley (CVL-27) during Typhoon Cobra, December 1944.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Langley|CVL-27|6}} struggles in Typhoon Cobra.]]\n\nAfter the Leyte Gulf engagement, December found the Third Fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of [[Typhoon Cobra]], which was dubbed \"Halsey's Typhoon\" by many.\n\nWhile conducting operations off the Philippines, the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a Pacific storm. Rather than move Third Fleet away, Halsey chose to remain on station for another day. In fairness, he received conflicting information from Pearl Harbor and his own staff. The Hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm, which would have cleared Task Force 38 by some {{convert|200|mi|km|spell=in}}. Eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/william-bull-halsey-legendary-world-war-ii-admiral.htm |title=William Bull Halsey: Legendary World War II Admiral |author=Barrett Tillman |work=historynet.com |date=July 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Halsey played the odds, declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of Third Fleet to hold formation. On the evening of December 17 Third Fleet was unable to land its combat air patrol due to the pitching and rolling decks of the carriers. All the aircraft were ditched in the ocean and lost, but the pilots were all saved by accompanying destroyers. By 10:00&nbsp;a.m. the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously. With increasingly heavy seas the fleet still attempted to maintain stations. The threat was greatest to the fleet's destroyers, which did not have the fuel reserves of the larger ships and were running dangerously low. Finally, at 11:49&nbsp;a.m., Halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them. Many of the smaller ships had already been forced to do so. \n\nBetween 11:00&nbsp;a.m. and 2:00&nbsp;p.m., the typhoon did its worst damage, tossing the ships in {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on|0}} waves. The barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at {{convert|83|kn|kph|lk=in|0}} with gusts well over {{convert|100|kn|kph|0}}. At 1:45&nbsp;p.m. Halsey issued a typhoon warning to Fleet Weather Central. By this time Third Fleet had lost three of its destroyers. By the time the storm had cleared the next day a great many ships in the fleet had been damaged, 146 aircraft were destroyed and 802 seamen had been lost. For the next three days Third Fleet conducted search and rescue operations, finally retiring to [[Ulithi]] on 22 December 1944.\n\nFollowing the typhoon a Navy court of inquiry was convened on board {{USS|Cascade|AD-16|6}} in the Naval base at Ulithi. Admiral Nimitz, CINCPAC, was in attendance at the court. Forty-three-year-old Captain Herbert K. Gates, of ''Cascade'', was the Judge Advocate.<ref>Drury.</ref> The inquiry found that though Halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon, it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\">Melton, ''Sea Cobra''.</ref> The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy had faced some nine years earlier in what they termed \"[[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#The Fourth Fleet incident|The Fourth Fleet Incident]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy 1887\u20131941 |last1=Evans |first1=David |last2=Peattie |first2=Mark|publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=243 |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87021-192-8}}</ref>\n\n===End of the war===\n[[File:Nimitz missouri.jpg|thumb|Fleet Admiral Nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board USS ''Missouri''. Behind him stand Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rear Adm. Forrest Sherman, and Halsey (''middle'').]]\nDuring January 1945 the Third Fleet attacked Formosa and Luzon, and [[South China Sea raid|raided the South China Sea]] in support of the landing of US Army forces on Luzon. At the conclusion of this operation, Halsey passed command of the ships that made up Third Fleet to Admiral Spruance on January 26, whereupon its designation changed to [[United States Fifth Fleet#History|Fifth Fleet]]. Returning home Halsey was asked about General MacArthur, who was not the easiest man to work with, and vied with the Navy over the conduct and management of the war in the Pacific.<ref>Willmott, pp. 178\u2013181.</ref> Halsey had worked well with MacArthur and did not mind saying so. When a reporter asked Halsey if he thought MacArthur's fleet (7th Fleet) would get to Tokyo first, the admiral grinned and answered \"We're going there together.\"  Then seriously he added \"He's a very fine man. I have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him.\"<ref>''Utica Daily Press'', February 20, 1945.</ref>\n\nSpruance held command of Fifth Fleet until May, when command returned to Halsey. In early June 1945 the Third Fleet again sailed through the path of [[Typhoon Connie]]. On this occasion, six men were swept overboard and lost, along with 75 airplanes lost or destroyed, with another 70 badly damaged. Though some ships sustained significant damage, none were lost.  A Navy court of inquiry was again convened, this time recommending that Halsey be reassigned, but Admiral Nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation, citing Halsey's prior service record, despite that record including a previous instance of negligently sailing his fleet through a typhoon.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\" />\n\nHalsey led Third Fleet through the final stages of the war, striking targets on the Japanese homeland itself. Third Fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon Tokyo, the [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|naval base at Kure]] and the northern Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and Third Fleet battleships engaged in the [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|bombardment of a number of Japanese coastal cities]] in preparation for an invasion of Japan, which ultimately never had to be undertaken.\n\nAfter the cessation of hostilities, Halsey, still aggressively cautious of Japanese kamikaze attacks, ordered Third Fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqu\u00e9: {{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Cessation of hostilities.<br />War is over. <br />If any Japanese airplanes appear, shoot them down in a friendly way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caviar and Commissars: the Experience of a US Naval Officer in Stalin's Russia |author=Kemp Tolley |page=245|publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-1-55750-407-4}}</ref>}}\nHe was present when [[Surrender of Japan|Japan formally surrendered]] on the deck of his [[flagship]], {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, on September 2, 1945.\n\n==Postwar years==\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Halsey]]\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, 54 ships of the Third Fleet returned to the United States, with Halsey's four-star flag flying from USS ''South Dakota'', for the annual Navy Day Celebrations in San Francisco on October 27, 1945. He hauled down his flag on 22 November 1945, and was assigned special duty in the office of the Secretary of the Navy. On December 11, 1945, he took the oath as [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]], becoming the fourth and still the most recent naval officer awarded that rank. Halsey made a goodwill flying trip, passing by [[Central America|Central]] and South America, covering nearly {{convert|28,000|mi}} and 11 nations. He retired from active service in March 1947, but as a Fleet Admiral, he was not taken off active duty status.\n\nHalsey was asked about the weapons used to win the war and he answered:\n{{Quote | style = font-size: 100%; | If I had to give credit to the instruments and machines that won us the war in the Pacific, I would rate them in this order: submarines first, radar second, planes third, bulldozers fourth.<ref>{{cite book |title = Admiral Halsey's Story |first=William |last=Halsey |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1947|page=69 |isbn = 978-1-4367-1143-2 }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey joined the New Jersey Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] in 1946. Upon retirement, he joined the board of two subsidiaries of the [[International Telephone and Telegraph Company]], including the [[American Cable and Radio Corporation]], and served until 1957. He maintained an office near the top of the ITT Building at 67 Broad Street, New York City in the late 1950s. He was involved in a number of efforts to preserve his former flagship {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} as a memorial in [[New York Harbor]].

Tora! Tora!]]''; by [[Robert Mitchum]] in the 1976 film, ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'', and by [[Dennis Quaid]] in the 2019 film ''[[Midway (2019 film)|Midway]]''.\n* Halsey makes a brief appearance in [[Herman Wouk]]'s novel ''[[The Winds of War]]'', and has a more substantial supporting role in the sequel ''[[War and Remembrance]]''. Wouk was extremely critical of Halsey's handling of the battle at Leyte Gulf, but also said he was too great a builder of naval morale to be retired in disgrace.  (Chapter 92)  Halsey was portrayed in the 1983 television [[miniseries]] adaptation of ''The Winds of War'' by [[Richard X. Slattery]], and in the 1988 miniseries adaptation of ''War and Remembrance'' by [[Pat Hingle]].\n* Halsey has been portrayed in a number of other films and TV miniseries, played by [[Glenn Morshower]] ([[Pearl Harbor (film)|''Pearl Harbor'']], 2001), [[Kenneth Tobey]] (''[[MacArthur (film)|MacArthur]]'', 1977), [[Jack Diamond (actor)|Jack Diamond]] (''[[Battle Stations (1956 film)|Battle Stations]]'', 1956), [[John Maxwell (actor)|John Maxwell]], (''[[The Eternal Sea]]'', 1955) and [[Morris Ankrum]] (''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', 1944).\n* An \"Admiral Halsey\" is mentioned in the [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]] song \"[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]\". The chorus of \"hands across the water, heads across the sky\" was a reference to the American aid programs of World War II. McCartney later specified that the second half of the song was indeed in honor of William Halsey.<ref>{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Garry |year=2003 |title=Band on the Run: A History of Paul McCartney and Wings |publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing |location=New York |page=196 |isbn=0-87833-304-5}}</ref>\n* On March 4, 1951, Halsey appeared as a mystery guest on episode No. 40 of the game show, ''[[What's My Line]]'', where the panel correctly deduced his identity.<ref>{{cite web |work=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/whats-my-line/episode-40/episode/92668/summary.html# |title=Episode No. 40 Summary}}</ref>\n* In the television series, ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', one of Captain Binghampton's catchphrases whenever he would get frustrated with one of McHale's schemes was, \"What in the name of Halsey is going on here?\"\n* Halsey is mentioned in the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius, while engaged in battle with the Soviet attack submarine ''Konovalov'', asks [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]] what books he wrote for the CIA. Ryan mentions one about Admiral Halsey, entitled ''The Fighting Sailor'' (not to be confused with a real book of the same title); Ramius reveals his awareness of the book and expresses disdain for Ryan's assessment of Halsey, saying, \"Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly.\"\n* The fictional aircraft carrier USS ''William Halsey'' in [[Darren Sapp]]'s novel, ''[[Fire on the Flight Deck]]'', is named for Halsey.\n* On May 30, 2018, he was added as an unlockable unique commander for the United States Navy in the videogame [[World of Warships]].\n* A character in [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s ''[[The Orville]]'' is named Admiral Halsey, presumably after Admiral Halsey.\n* Halsey appears as a purchasable general in the Easytech mobile game ''[[World Conqueror 4]]''.\n\n\u2022   In ''Bridge over the River Kwai'', William Holden feigning madness replies, \u201cI'm getting worse, you know.

He is one of four individuals to have attained the rank of [[Fleet admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] of the United States Navy, the others being [[Ernest King]], [[William D. Leahy|William Leahy]], and [[Chester W. Nimitz]].\n\nBorn in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], Halsey graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1904. He served in the [[Great White Fleet]] and, during [[World War I]], commanded the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}}. He took command of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} in 1935 after completing a course in naval aviation, and was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1938. At the start of the [[Pacific War|War in the Pacific]] (1941\u20131945), Halsey commanded the task force centered on the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} in a series of raids against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-held targets. \n\nHalsey was made commander, [[South Pacific Area]], and led the Allied forces over the course of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle for Guadalcanal]] (1942\u201343) and the [[Solomon Islands campaign|fighting up the Solomon chain]] (1942\u201345).<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\">Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 183.</ref>  In 1943 he was made commander of the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]], the post he held through the rest of the war.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\">Potter, p.&nbsp;112.</ref> He took part in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]]. He was promoted to fleet admiral in December 1945 and retired from active service in March 1947.\n\n==Early years==\nHalsey was born in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], on October 30, 1882, the son of [[United States Navy]] Captain [[William F. Halsey Sr.]]  \n\nHalsey was of [[English American|English]] ancestry, all of his ancestors came to America from England and all of them emigrated from [[England]] to [[New England]] in the early 1600s.  He felt a \"kinship\" with his ancestors, including Captain John Halsey of colonial Massachusetts who served in the British Royal Navy in [[Queen Anne's War]] from 1702 to 1713 where he raided French shipping.<ref>Admiral \"Bull\" Halsey: The Life and Wars of the Navy's Most Controversial Commander by John Wukovits pg. 1-2</ref><ref>Admiral Bill Halsey: A Naval Life by Thomas Alexander Hughes, pg. 16</ref> Through his father he was a descendant of Senator [[Rufus King]], who was an American lawyer, politician, diplomat, and [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]].

He chose Virginia because his best friend, Karl Osterhause, was there. While there, Halsey joined the [[Delta Psi]] fraternity and was also a member of the secretive [[Seven Society]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Bill |title=Seven Society's Secret Still Secret |newspaper=Washington Post |page=C8 |date=1965-02-15}}</ref> After his first year, Halsey received his appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy|United States Naval Academy at Annapolis]], and entered the Academy in the fall of 1900. While attending the academy he [[Varsity letter|lettered]] in football as a fullback and earned several [[Navy Midshipmen|athletic]] honors. Halsey graduated from the Naval Academy on February 2, 1904.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wukovits|first=John |title = Admiral \"Bull Halsey\" |year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn = 978-0-230-60284-7 |page=9 }}</ref> \n\nFollowing graduation he spent his early service years in [[battleship]]s, and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship {{USS|Kansas|BB-21|6}} as [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt's]] [[Great White Fleet]] [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe from 1907 to 1909. Halsey was on the bridge of the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-11|6}} on April 13, 1904, when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others. No explosion occurred, but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death 31 officers and enlisted sailors. This resulted in Halsey dreading the 13th of every month, especially when it fell on a Friday.<ref>Borneman, p.&nbsp;47.</ref>\n\nAfter his service on ''Missouri'', Halsey served aboard torpedo boats, beginning with {{USS|Du Pont|TB-7|6}} in 1909. Halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] to full lieutenant, skipping the rank of [[Lieutenant, junior grade|lieutenant (junior grade)]].<ref name=\"wukovits2010\">{{cite book|title=Admiral \"Bull\" Halsey: The Life and Wars of the Navy's Most Controversial Commander|last=Wukovits|first=John|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-60284-7}}</ref> Torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his, and he commanded the First Group of the Atlantic Fleet's Torpedo Flotilla in 1912 through 1913. Halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and [[destroyer]]s during the 1910s and 1920s. At that time, the destroyer and the torpedo boat, though extremely hazardous delivery methods, were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships. Then-[[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Halsey's World War I service, including command of {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}} in 1918, earned him the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\n== Interwar years ==\nIn October 1922, he was the [[Naval Attach\u00e9|naval attach\u00e9]] at the American Embassy in [[Berlin]], Germany. One year later, he was given additional duty as naval attach\u00e9 at the American Embassies in [[Oslo|Christiania]], Norway; [[Copenhagen]], Denmark; and [[Stockholm]], Sweden. He then returned to sea duty, again in destroyers in European waters, in command of {{USS|Dale|DD-290|6}} and {{USS|Osborne|DD-295|6}}. Upon his return to the U.S. in 1927, he served one year as executive officer of the battleship {{USS|Wyoming|BB-32|6}}, and then for three years in command of {{USS|Reina Mercedes|IX-25|6}}, the station ship at the Naval Academy. Then-[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Halsey continued his destroyer duty on his next two-year stint at sea, starting in 1930 as the Commander of Destroyer Division Three of the Scouting Force, before returning to study at the [[Naval War College]] in Newport, Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm |title = Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey Jr. |publisher=[[Naval Historical Center]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the chief of the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], Navy Admiral [[Ernest King]], offered Halsey command of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. \"I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot,\" said Halsey at the time. Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, \"What do you think that the old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!\"<ref>Borneman, p. 157.</ref> He went on to command the USS ''Saratoga'', and later the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] at [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, \"The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good.\" Halsey was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.\n\n==World War II==\nTraditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This view was challenged when Army Air Corps General [[Billy Mitchell]] demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal. The adage \"Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power\" was well known.<ref>Morison, ''The Rising Sun in the Pacific'', p. 190.</ref> Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wildenberg |first=Thomas |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/sheerluck_midway.htm |title=Midway: Sheer Luck or Better Doctrine? |journal=Naval College War Review |date=Winter 2005 |volume=58 |number=1 }} Wildenberg quotes Browning's thesis: \"Every carrier we have knows what it means to be 'bopped' with all planes on deck, because her hands were tied by uncertainty as to her next move...\"</ref> Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Husband Kimmel's]] hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to \"get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him.\" Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.\n\nIn April 1940, Halsey's ships, as part of Battle Fleet, moved to Hawaii and in June 1940, he was promoted to vice admiral (temporary rank), and was appointed commander Carrier Division 2 and commander Aircraft Battle Force.<ref name=wukovits2010 />\n\nWith tensions high and war imminent, U.S. Naval intelligence indicated [[Wake Island]] would be the target of a Japanese surprise attack. In response, on 28 November 1941 Admiral Kimmel ordered Halsey to take {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} to ferry aircraft to Wake Island to reinforce the Marines there. Kimmel had given Halsey \"a free hand\" to attack and destroy any Japanese military forces encountered.<ref name=wukovits2010 /> The planes flew off her deck on December 2. Highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the Japanese carrier force, Halsey gave orders to \"sink any shipping sighted, shoot down any plane encountered.\" Protested his operations officer, \"Goddammit, Admiral, you can't start a private war of your own! Who's going to take the responsibility?\" Said Halsey, \"I'll take it! If anything gets in my way, we'll shoot first and argue afterwards.\"<ref name=\"Books: The General and the Admiral\">{{cite web |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793941,00.html#ixzz1aL8AA1Tz |title = Books: The General and the Admiral |work=Time |date=November 10, 1947 }}</ref>  \n\nA storm delayed ''Enterprise'' on her return voyage to Hawaii. Instead of returning on December 6 as planned, she was still {{convert|200|mi}} out at sea, when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at Wake Island, but at [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] itself. News of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to Pearl Harbor, attempting to identify itself as American.<ref>Millis, p. 357.</ref> The plane was shot down, and her pilot and crew were lost. In the immediate wake of the attack upon Pearl Harbor,  Admiral Kimmel named Halsey \"commander of all the ships at sea.\"<ref name=wukovits2010 /> ''Enterprise'' searched south and west of the [[Hawaiian islands]] for the Japanese attackers, but did not locate the six Japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west.\n\n===Early Pacific carrier raids===\n[[File:Douglas SBD flies over USS Enterprise (CV-6) and USS Saratoga (CV-3) on 19 December 1942.jpg|thumb|right|An SBD Dauntless flies anti-submarine patrol over ''Enterprise'' and ''Saratoga''.]]\n\nHalsey and ''Enterprise'' slipped back into Pearl Harbor on the evening of December 8. Surveying the wreckage of the Pacific Fleet, he remarked, \"Before we're through with them, the Japanese language will be spoken only in hell.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Admiral Halsey's Story |url = https://archive.org/details/AdmiralHalseysStory |author= J.

Above all else, he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the U.S. Navy's fighting spirit when most required.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey''.</ref> In the early months of the war, as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another, Halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy. Serving as commander, [[Carrier Strike Group Two#Historical background|Carrier Division 2]], aboard his flagship ''Enterprise'', Halsey led a series of hit-and-run raids against the Japanese, striking the [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids|Gilbert and Marshall]] islands in February, Wake Island in March, and carrying out the [[Doolittle Raid]] in April 1942 against the Japanese capital [[Tokyo]] and other places on Japan's largest and most populous island [[Honshu]], the first air raid to strike the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], providing an important boost to American [[morale]]. Halsey's slogan, \"Hit hard, hit fast, hit often,\" soon became a byword for the Navy.\n\nHalsey returned to Pearl Harbor from his last raid on May 26, 1942, in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand. He had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier ''Enterprise,'' directing the Navy's counterstrikes. [[Psoriasis]] covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching, making it nearly impossible for him to sleep. Gaunt and having lost {{convert|20|lb|kg}}, he was medically ordered to the hospital in Hawaii.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the Japanese were planning an attack on the central Pacific island of Midway. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], [[CinCPAC|Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet]], determined to take the opportunity to engage them. Losing Midway would have been a very serious threat because the Japanese then could easily take Hawaii and threaten the west coast of the United States. The loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral, Halsey, on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to Nimitz.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 85.</ref> Nimitz met with Halsey, who recommended his cruiser division commander, Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Raymond Spruance]], to take command for the upcoming [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] operation.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 84.</ref> Nimitz considered the move, but it would mean stepping over Rear Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank Fletcher]] of Task Force 17, who was the senior of the two men. After interviewing Fletcher and reviewing his reports from the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] engagement, Nimitz was convinced that Fletcher's performance was sound, and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of Midway.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 86.</ref> Acting upon Halsey's recommendations, Nimitz then made Rear Admiral Spruance commander of Halsey's Task Force 16, comprising the carriers ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet''. To aid Spruance, who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force, Halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff, Captain [[Miles Browning]]. The ensuing harrowing Battle of Midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the United States and a dramatic victory for the U.S. Navy.\n\nHalsey's skin condition was so serious, he was sent on the light cruiser {{USS|Detroit|CL-8|6}} to San Francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment.  The skin condition soon receded but Halsey was ordered to stand down for the next six weeks and relax. While detached stateside during his convalescence, he visited family and traveled to Washington D.C. In late August, he accepted a speaking engagement at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Prior to the discussion of his raids against the Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, Halsey informed the midshipmen before him, \"Missing the Battle of Midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career, but I am going back to the Pacific where I intend personally to have a crack at those yellow-bellied sons of bitches and their carriers,\" which was received with loud applause.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;150.</ref>\n\nAt the completion of his convalescence in September 1942, Admiral Nimitz reassigned Halsey to Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet.\n\n===South Pacific Area Command===\n[[File:Admiral William F Halsey.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Halsey in the South Pacific.]]\n\nAfter being medically approved to return to duty, Halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the South Pacific Area. Since ''Enterprise'' was still laid up in Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs following the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], and the other ships of Task Force 16 were still being readied, he began a familiarization trip to the south Pacific on October 15, 1942, arriving at area headquarters at [[Noum\u00e9a]] in [[New Caledonia#Second World War|New Caledonia]] on October 18. The [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Campaign]] was at a critical juncture, with the 1st Marine Division, 11,000 men, under the combat command of Marine Major General [[Alexander Vandegrift|Alexander A. Vandegrift]] holding on by a thread around Henderson (Air) Field.  The Marines did receive additional support from the U.S. Army's 164th Regiment with a complement of 2,800 soldiers on October 13.  This addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself.\n\nDuring this critical juncture, naval support was tenuous due to Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley]]'s reticence, malaise and lackluster performance.<ref name=wukovits2010 />  Pacific Fleet commander Chester Nimitz had concluded that Vice Admiral Ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted.<ref>Morison, pp. 199\u2013207; Frank, pp. 368\u2013378; Dull, pp. 235\u2013237.</ref> Nimitz made his decision to change the [[South Pacific Area]] command while Halsey was en route. As Halsey's aircraft came to rest in Noum\u00e9a, a whaleboat came alongside carrying Ghormley's flag lieutenant. Meeting him before he could board the flagship, the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from Nimitz:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | YOU WILL TAKE COMMAND OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC AREA AND SOUTH PACIFIC FORCES IMMEDIATELY<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\"/>}}\n\nThe order came as an awkward surprise to Halsey. Ghormley was a long time personal friend, and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at Annapolis. Awkward or not, the two men carried out their directives. Halsey's command now included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. News of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered Marines, energizing his command. He was widely considered the U.S. Navy's most aggressive admiral, and with good reason. He set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed. Ghormley had been unsure of his command's ability to maintain the Marine toehold on Guadalcanal, and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the [[Bataan Death March|Bataan Peninsula]] disaster. Halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the Marines. He not only intended to counter the Japanese efforts to dislodge them, he intended to secure the island. Above all else, he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the Japanese. It was two days after Halsey had taken command in October 1942 that he gave an order that all naval officers in the South Pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms. As Richard Frank commented in his account of the Battle for Guadalcanal:\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Halsey said he gave this order to conform to Army practice and for comfort. To his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle |author=Richard Frank |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-016561-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/guadalcanal00rich }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey led the South Pacific command through what was for the U.S. Navy the most tenuous phase of the war. Halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around Guadalcanal, including the carrier engagements of the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. These engagements checked the Japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots. [[File:Nimitz and Halsey 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Admirals Nimitz and Halsey discuss South Pacific strategy in early 1943.]] In November Halsey's willingness to place at risk his command's two fast battleships in the confined waters around Guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the U.S. Navy winning the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], the decisive naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign that doomed the Japanese garrison and wrested control from the Japanese.\n\nJapanese naval aviation proved to be formidable during the Solomon campaign.<ref>Seal, Jon, and Michael Ahn. {{cite web |url = http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |title = An Interview with Joseph Jacob 'Joe' Foss. |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060209105228/http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |archive-date=February 9, 2006 |df=mdy-all |publisher = [[Microsoft Games Studios]] |date=March 2000 |access-date=August 3, 2011 }}</ref>  In April 1943, Halsey assigned Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]] to Commander Air, [[Solomon Islands]] (ComAirSols) where he directed a mixed bag of Army, Navy, Marine and New Zealand aircraft in the airwar over Guadalcanal and up the Solomon chain.  Said Halsey: \"I knew we'd probably catch hell from the Japs in the air.  That's why I sent Pete Mitscher up there.  Pete was a fighting fool and I knew it.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 145.</ref>\n\nTypical for the period was an exchange that occurred between Halsey and one of his staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked \"If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive.\" The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: \"As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;221.</ref>\n\nHalsey's forces spent the rest of the year [[Solomon Islands campaign|battling]] up the [[Solomon Islands]] chain to [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].  At Bougainville the Japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island, and another at the northern most peninsula, with a fourth on Buki just across the northern passage.  Here, instead of landing near the Japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the Japanese defenders, Halsey landed his invasion force of 14,000 Marines in [[Empress Augusta Bay]], about halfway up the west coast of Bougainville.  There he had the Seabees clear and build their own airfield.  Two days after the landing, a large cruiser force was sent down from Japan to Rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against Halsey's screening force and supply ships in Empress Augusta Bay.  The Japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year, but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers, along with one light cruiser and four destroyers.  At [[Rabaul]] the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle. Halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them.  The battleships {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}, {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the Central Pacific to support the upcoming invasion of Tarawa.  Other than the destroyer screen, the only force Halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|2}}.  Rabaul was a heavily fortified port, with five airfields and extensive anti-aircraft batteries.  Other than the surprise raid at Pearl Harbor, no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft.  It was highly dangerous to the aircrews, and to the carriers as well.  With the landing in the balance, Halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of Rabaul, then launch a daybreak raid on the base.  Aircraft from recently captured [[Vella Lavella]] were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers. All available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself.  The [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|mission]] was a stunning success, so damaging the cruiser force at Rabaul as to make them no longer a threat.  Aircraft losses in the raid were light.  Halsey later described the threat to the landings as \"the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as ComSoPac.\"<ref>Potter, ''Admiral Arleigh Burke'', pp.&nbsp;98\u201399.</ref>\n\nFollowing the successful Bougainville operation, he then isolated and neutralized the Japanese naval stronghold at Rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] in a series of amphibious landings known as [[Operation Cartwheel]]. This enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself.  With the neutralization of Rabaul, major operations in the South Pacific Command came to a close.  With his determination and grit, Halsey had bolstered his command's resolve and seized the initiative from the Japanese until ships, aircraft and crews produced and trained in the States could arrive in 1943 and 1944 to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416\u2013430.</ref>\n\n===Battles of the Central Pacific===\n[[File:VAdm John S. McCain and Adm William F. Halsey aboard USS New Jersey (BB-62), December 1944.jpg|thumb|right|Halsey (right) confers with Task Force 38 commander and fellow 'dirty trickster' Adm. [[John S. McCain Sr.]] on board Halsey's flagship, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|6}} in December 1944]]As the war progressed it moved out of the South Pacific and into the Central Pacific. Halsey's command shifted with it, and in May 1944 he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]. He commanded actions from the [[Philippines]] to Japan. From September 1944 to January 1945, he led the campaigns to take the [[Palaus]], [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] and [[Luzon]], and on many raids on Japanese bases, including off the shores of Formosa, China, and Vietnam.\n\nBy this point in the conflict the U.S. Navy was doing things the Japanese high command had not thought possible. The [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in. Moreover, the Navy's ability to establish [[USS Cascade (AD-16)#Service Squadron 4 and Service Squadron 10|forward operating ports]] as they did at [[Majuro#History|Majuro]], [[Enewetak Atoll#History|Enewetak]] and [[Ulithi#History|Ulithi]], and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces, allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western Pacific. The Japanese Navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy. The U.S. Navy remained at sea and on station, dominating whatever region it entered. The size of the Pacific Ocean, which Japanese planners had thought would limit the U.S. Navy's ability to operate in the western Pacific, would not be adequate to protect Japan.\n\nCommand of the \"big blue fleet\" was alternated with [[Raymond Spruance]].{{NoteTag|The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the name given to the main fleet of the US Navy in the Pacific.  The term stems from pre-war planning, called the color plans because each nation included was given a color code name. In these potential plans the British navy was red, the German navy black, and so forth. The Imperial Japanese Navy was termed the \"Orange Fleet\".  The U.S. fleet was the \"Blue Fleet\".  The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the massive fleet that the U.S. Navy anticipated they would win the war with.  It was thought this fleet would largely come into being by late 1943, early 1944.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" />}}  Under Spruance the fleet designation was the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]] and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 58\". Under Halsey the fleet was designated Third Fleet and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 38\".<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" /> The split command structure was intended to confuse the Japanese and created a higher tempo of operations. While Spruance was at sea operating the fleet, Halsey and his staff, self-dubbed the \"Department of Dirty Tricks\", would be planning the next series of operations.<ref>Cutler, ''The Battle of Leyte Gulf'', p. 209.</ref> The two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating, professional and cautious. Most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance; most common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey.<ref>{{cite book |title=America's Fighting Admirals:Winning the War at Sea in World War II |last=Tuohy |first=William |publisher=Zenith Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 323] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7603-2985-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 }}</ref>\n\n====Leyte Gulf====\n[[File:Halsey messing with crew.jpg|thumb|right|Halsey dines with crew of USS ''New Jersey'' (November 1944)]]\nIn October 1944, amphibious forces of the U.S. [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] carried out [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur's]] major landings on the island of [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] in the Central Philippines. Halsey's Third Fleet was assigned to cover and support Seventh Fleet operations around Leyte. Halsey's plans assumed the Japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort, creating an opportunity to engage it decisively. Halsey directed the Third Fleet \"will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/9fe423c2-9276-41c7-be29-04260b8a04c3/Replacing-Battleships-with-Aircraft-Carriers-in-th|last=Hone|first=Thomas|title=Replacing Battleships with Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific in World War II|work=Naval War College Review|date=Winter 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2017|p=71}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the invasion, the Japanese launched their final major naval effort, an operation known as 'Sho-Go', involving almost all their surviving fleet. It was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the [[Leyte Gulf]]. The Northern Force of Admiral Ozawa was built around the remaining Japanese aircraft carriers, now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots. The Northern Force was meant to lure the covering U.S. forces away from the Gulf while two surface battle-groups, the Center Force and the Southern Force, were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping. These forces were built around the remaining strength of the Japanese Navy, and comprised a total of 7 battleships and 16 cruisers. The operation brought about the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]].\n\nThe Center Force commanded by Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] was located October 23 coming through the Palawan Passage by two American submarines, which [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The submarine action in Palawan Passage .2823 October.29|attacked the force]], sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third. The following day Third Fleet's aircraft carriers launched strikes against Kurita's Center Force, [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea|sinking]] the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} and damaging the heavy cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|My\u014dk\u014d||2}}, causing the force to turn westward back towards its base. Kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the [[San Bernardino Strait]]. At this point Ozawa's Northern Force was located by Third Fleet scout aircraft. Halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the Japanese carrier forces, planning to strike them at dawn of October 25. He considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait, and made tentative plans to do so, but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover, weakening his chance to crush the remaining Japanese carrier forces. The entire Third Fleet steamed northward. San Bernardino Strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet.\n\n====Battle off Samar====\nIn moving Third Fleet northwards, Halsey failed to advise Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid|Thomas Kinkaid]] of Seventh Fleet of his decision. Seventh Fleet intercepts of organizational messages from Halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that Halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the San Bernardino Strait, but this was not the case. Kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with Halsey, and neither had confirmed this with Nimitz.\n\nDespite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of October 24\u201325 of Kurita's Center Force in the San Bernardino Strait, Halsey continued to take Third Fleet northwards, away from Leyte Gulf.\n\n[[File:Halsey Mccain.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Halsey with Vice Admiral [[John S. McCain Sr.]]]]\n\nWhen Kurita's Center Force emerged from the San Bernardino Strait on the morning of October 25, there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and [[destroyer escort]]s, Task Unit 77.4.3 \"Taffy 3\", which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarines, not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since the battle of Midway, led by the largest battleship in the world. Advancing down the coast of the island of Samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the Leyte Gulf landing, they took Seventh Fleet's escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise.\n\nIn the desperate [[Battle off Samar]] which followed, Kurita's ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers' screen, and damaged a number of other ships as well. The remarkable resistance of the screening ships of Taffy 3 against Kurita's battle-group remains one of the most heroic feats in the history of the US Navy. Their efforts and those of the several hundred aircraft that the escort carriers could put up, many of whom, however could not be armed with the most effective ordinance to deal with heavy surface ships in time, took a heavy toll on Kurita's ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case. Mistaking the escort carriers for Halsey's fleet carriers, and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the Third Fleet battleship group, he decided to withdraw back through the San Bernardino Strait and to the west without achieving his objective of disrupting the Leyte landing.\n\nWhen the Seventh Fleet's escort carriers found themselves under attack from the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours,<ref name=\"Willmott\">{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=H.

The world wonders\". The tail end of this message, [[The world wonders]], was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Finally Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney|Robert \"Mick\" Carney]], confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"<ref name=\"Books: The General and the Admiral\"/>\n\nHalsey cooled but continued to steam Third Fleet northward to close on Ozawa's Northern Force for a full hour after receiving the signal from Nimitz.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Then, Halsey ordered Task Force 34 south. As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers. The refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> By the time Task Force 34 arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the Seventh Fleet's escort carrier groups. Kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area. A single straggling destroyer was caught by Halsey's advance cruisers and destroyers, but the rest of Kurita's force was able to escape.\n\nMeanwhile the major part Third Fleet continued to close on Ozawa's Northern Force, which included one fleet carrier (the last surviving Japanese carrier of the six that had attacked Pearl Harbor) and three light carriers. The [[Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o]] resulted in Halsey's Third Fleet sinking all four of Ozawa's carriers.\n\nThe same attributes that made Halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war, his desire to bring the fight to the enemy, his willingness to take on a gamble, worked against him in the later stages of the war. Halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle, with naval historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison|Samuel Morison]] terming the Third Fleet run to the north \"Halsey's Blunder.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', pp. 376\u2013380.</ref> However, the destruction of the Japanese carriers had been an important goal up to that point, and the Leyte landings were still successful despite Halsey falling for the Japanese Navy's decoy.\n\n=== Halsey's Typhoon ===\n{{Main|Typhoon Cobra (1944)}}\n\n[[File:USS Langley (CVL-27) during Typhoon Cobra, December 1944.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Langley|CVL-27|6}} struggles in Typhoon Cobra.]]\n\nAfter the Leyte Gulf engagement, December found the Third Fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of [[Typhoon Cobra]], which was dubbed \"Halsey's Typhoon\" by many.\n\nWhile conducting operations off the Philippines, the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a Pacific storm. Rather than move Third Fleet away, Halsey chose to remain on station for another day. In fairness, he received conflicting information from Pearl Harbor and his own staff. The Hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm, which would have cleared Task Force 38 by some {{convert|200|mi|km|spell=in}}. Eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/william-bull-halsey-legendary-world-war-ii-admiral.htm |title=William Bull Halsey: Legendary World War II Admiral |author=Barrett Tillman |work=historynet.com |date=July 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Halsey played the odds, declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of Third Fleet to hold formation. On the evening of December 17 Third Fleet was unable to land its combat air patrol due to the pitching and rolling decks of the carriers. All the aircraft were ditched in the ocean and lost, but the pilots were all saved by accompanying destroyers. By 10:00&nbsp;a.m. the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously. With increasingly heavy seas the fleet still attempted to maintain stations. The threat was greatest to the fleet's destroyers, which did not have the fuel reserves of the larger ships and were running dangerously low. Finally, at 11:49&nbsp;a.m., Halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them. Many of the smaller ships had already been forced to do so. \n\nBetween 11:00&nbsp;a.m. and 2:00&nbsp;p.m., the typhoon did its worst damage, tossing the ships in {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on|0}} waves. The barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at {{convert|83|kn|kph|lk=in|0}} with gusts well over {{convert|100|kn|kph|0}}. At 1:45&nbsp;p.m. Halsey issued a typhoon warning to Fleet Weather Central. By this time Third Fleet had lost three of its destroyers. By the time the storm had cleared the next day a great many ships in the fleet had been damaged, 146 aircraft were destroyed and 802 seamen had been lost. For the next three days Third Fleet conducted search and rescue operations, finally retiring to [[Ulithi]] on 22 December 1944.\n\nFollowing the typhoon a Navy court of inquiry was convened on board {{USS|Cascade|AD-16|6}} in the Naval base at Ulithi. Admiral Nimitz, CINCPAC, was in attendance at the court. Forty-three-year-old Captain Herbert K. Gates, of ''Cascade'', was the Judge Advocate.<ref>Drury.</ref> The inquiry found that though Halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon, it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\">Melton, ''Sea Cobra''.</ref> The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy had faced some nine years earlier in what they termed \"[[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#The Fourth Fleet incident|The Fourth Fleet Incident]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy 1887\u20131941 |last1=Evans |first1=David |last2=Peattie |first2=Mark|publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=243 |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87021-192-8}}</ref>\n\n===End of the war===\n[[File:Nimitz missouri.jpg|thumb|Fleet Admiral Nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board USS ''Missouri''. Behind him stand Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rear Adm. Forrest Sherman, and Halsey (''middle'').]]\nDuring January 1945 the Third Fleet attacked Formosa and Luzon, and [[South China Sea raid|raided the South China Sea]] in support of the landing of US Army forces on Luzon. At the conclusion of this operation, Halsey passed command of the ships that made up Third Fleet to Admiral Spruance on January 26, whereupon its designation changed to [[United States Fifth Fleet#History|Fifth Fleet]]. Returning home Halsey was asked about General MacArthur, who was not the easiest man to work with, and vied with the Navy over the conduct and management of the war in the Pacific.<ref>Willmott, pp. 178\u2013181.</ref> Halsey had worked well with MacArthur and did not mind saying so. When a reporter asked Halsey if he thought MacArthur's fleet (7th Fleet) would get to Tokyo first, the admiral grinned and answered \"We're going there together.\"  Then seriously he added \"He's a very fine man. I have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him.\"<ref>''Utica Daily Press'', February 20, 1945.</ref>\n\nSpruance held command of Fifth Fleet until May, when command returned to Halsey. In early June 1945 the Third Fleet again sailed through the path of [[Typhoon Connie]]. On this occasion, six men were swept overboard and lost, along with 75 airplanes lost or destroyed, with another 70 badly damaged. Though some ships sustained significant damage, none were lost.  A Navy court of inquiry was again convened, this time recommending that Halsey be reassigned, but Admiral Nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation, citing Halsey's prior service record, despite that record including a previous instance of negligently sailing his fleet through a typhoon.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\" />\n\nHalsey led Third Fleet through the final stages of the war, striking targets on the Japanese homeland itself. Third Fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon Tokyo, the [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|naval base at Kure]] and the northern Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and Third Fleet battleships engaged in the [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|bombardment of a number of Japanese coastal cities]] in preparation for an invasion of Japan, which ultimately never had to be undertaken.\n\nAfter the cessation of hostilities, Halsey, still aggressively cautious of Japanese kamikaze attacks, ordered Third Fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqu\u00e9: {{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Cessation of hostilities.<br />War is over. <br />If any Japanese airplanes appear, shoot them down in a friendly way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caviar and Commissars: the Experience of a US Naval Officer in Stalin's Russia |author=Kemp Tolley |page=245|publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-1-55750-407-4}}</ref>}}\nHe was present when [[Surrender of Japan|Japan formally surrendered]] on the deck of his [[flagship]], {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, on September 2, 1945.\n\n==Postwar years==\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Halsey]]\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, 54 ships of the Third Fleet returned to the United States, with Halsey's four-star flag flying from USS ''South Dakota'', for the annual Navy Day Celebrations in San Francisco on October 27, 1945. He hauled down his flag on 22 November 1945, and was assigned special duty in the office of the Secretary of the Navy. On December 11, 1945, he took the oath as [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]], becoming the fourth and still the most recent naval officer awarded that rank. Halsey made a goodwill flying trip, passing by [[Central America|Central]] and South America, covering nearly {{convert|28,000|mi}} and 11 nations. He retired from active service in March 1947, but as a Fleet Admiral, he was not taken off active duty status.\n\nHalsey was asked about the weapons used to win the war and he answered:\n{{Quote | style = font-size: 100%; | If I had to give credit to the instruments and machines that won us the war in the Pacific, I would rate them in this order: submarines first, radar second, planes third, bulldozers fourth.<ref>{{cite book |title = Admiral Halsey's Story |first=William |last=Halsey |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1947|page=69 |isbn = 978-1-4367-1143-2 }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey joined the New Jersey Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] in 1946. Upon retirement, he joined the board of two subsidiaries of the [[International Telephone and Telegraph Company]], including the [[American Cable and Radio Corporation]], and served until 1957. He maintained an office near the top of the ITT Building at 67 Broad Street, New York City in the late 1950s. He was involved in a number of efforts to preserve his former flagship {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} as a memorial in [[New York Harbor]].

Tora! Tora!]]''; by [[Robert Mitchum]] in the 1976 film, ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'', and by [[Dennis Quaid]] in the 2019 film ''[[Midway (2019 film)|Midway]]''.\n* Halsey makes a brief appearance in [[Herman Wouk]]'s novel ''[[The Winds of War]]'', and has a more substantial supporting role in the sequel ''[[War and Remembrance]]''. Wouk was extremely critical of Halsey's handling of the battle at Leyte Gulf, but also said he was too great a builder of naval morale to be retired in disgrace.  (Chapter 92)  Halsey was portrayed in the 1983 television [[miniseries]] adaptation of ''The Winds of War'' by [[Richard X. Slattery]], and in the 1988 miniseries adaptation of ''War and Remembrance'' by [[Pat Hingle]].\n* Halsey has been portrayed in a number of other films and TV miniseries, played by [[Glenn Morshower]] ([[Pearl Harbor (film)|''Pearl Harbor'']], 2001), [[Kenneth Tobey]] (''[[MacArthur (film)|MacArthur]]'', 1977), [[Jack Diamond (actor)|Jack Diamond]] (''[[Battle Stations (1956 film)|Battle Stations]]'', 1956), [[John Maxwell (actor)|John Maxwell]], (''[[The Eternal Sea]]'', 1955) and [[Morris Ankrum]] (''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', 1944).\n* An \"Admiral Halsey\" is mentioned in the [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]] song \"[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]\". The chorus of \"hands across the water, heads across the sky\" was a reference to the American aid programs of World War II. McCartney later specified that the second half of the song was indeed in honor of William Halsey.<ref>{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Garry |year=2003 |title=Band on the Run: A History of Paul McCartney and Wings |publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing |location=New York |page=196 |isbn=0-87833-304-5}}</ref>\n* On March 4, 1951, Halsey appeared as a mystery guest on episode No. 40 of the game show, ''[[What's My Line]]'', where the panel correctly deduced his identity.<ref>{{cite web |work=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/whats-my-line/episode-40/episode/92668/summary.html# |title=Episode No. 40 Summary}}</ref>\n* In the television series, ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', one of Captain Binghampton's catchphrases whenever he would get frustrated with one of McHale's schemes was, \"What in the name of Halsey is going on here?\"\n* Halsey is mentioned in the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius, while engaged in battle with the Soviet attack submarine ''Konovalov'', asks [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]] what books he wrote for the CIA. Ryan mentions one about Admiral Halsey, entitled ''The Fighting Sailor'' (not to be confused with a real book of the same title); Ramius reveals his awareness of the book and expresses disdain for Ryan's assessment of Halsey, saying, \"Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly.\"\n* The fictional aircraft carrier USS ''William Halsey'' in [[Darren Sapp]]'s novel, ''[[Fire on the Flight Deck]]'', is named for Halsey.\n* On May 30, 2018, he was added as an unlockable unique commander for the United States Navy in the videogame [[World of Warships]].\n* A character in [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s ''[[The Orville]]'' is named Admiral Halsey, presumably after Admiral Halsey.\n* Halsey appears as a purchasable general in the Easytech mobile game ''[[World Conqueror 4]]''.\n\n\u2022   In ''Bridge over the River Kwai'', William Holden feigning madness replies, \u201cI'm getting worse, you know.

The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically {{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}.\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

Great-grandfather of the artist \u2013 Anton Antonovich Vrubel \u2013 was originally from [[Bia\u0142ystok]] and served as a judge in his local town. His son {{ill|Mikhail Antonovich Vrubel|ru|\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1799-1859) became a professional military. He retired at the rank of Major General, was twice married and had three sons and four daughters .{{sfn|\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430|1914|p=156}} For the last ten years of his life, Mikhail Antonovich served as an [[ataman]] of the [[Astrakhan Cossacks]]. At that time, the Astrakhan governor was a famous cartographer and admiral {{ill|Grigori Basargin|ru|\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. The governor\u2019s daughter Anna later married the second son of Mikhail Antonovich from the first marriage, Alexander, who previously graduated from the [[Cadet Corps]], served in the Tengin Infantry Regiment, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Caucasian]] and [[Crimean War]]s. In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born. Altogether, they had four children, each of whom was born one after the other.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=7\u201412}}\n\nMikhail Vrubel was born on March 17, 1856. At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863. From the left \u2013 Elizaveta Vessel-Vrubel]]\nDue to constant relocations of their father, Anna and Mikhail spent their childhood moving to the places where Alexander was assigned to serve. In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them. Sometimes they behaved coldly to their stepmother calling her with an ironic nickname \"Madrin'ka \u2014 perl materei\". They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting. According to Dmitrieva, \"the boy was like a boy, gifted, but rather promising a versatile amateur than an obsessed artist, whom he later became\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel with his sister Anna.

At that time, a copy of \"[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The last Judgement]]\" by [[Michelangelo]] was exhibited in Saratov. The painting impressed Mikhail so much, that, according to his sister, he reproduced it from his memory in all details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=28}}\n\n===Gymnasium===\n\nMikhail Vrubel started his education at the {{ill|Fifth St. Petersburg Gymnasium|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f}} where the school directorate paid particular attention to the modernization of teaching methods, the advancement of [[Classics|classical studies]], the literary development of high school students, dance and gymnastics lessons. His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A. I. Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]].

In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century. The 1880s have just only passed, the first search for national antiquity just started, which no one else besides specialists was interested in, and even those specialists were interested more from the historical point rather than artistic <\u2026> Vrubel in Kiev was the first who bridged archaeological pioneering and restorations to a live contemporary art. At the same time, he did not think of stylization. He felt like an accomplice in the hard work of the ancient masters and tried to be worthy of them.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}}}}\n\nPrakhov\u2019s invitation was almost coincidental \u2013 he was looking for a qualified painter with some academic training to paint murals in the church but at the same time not to be recognised enough so he would not require a higher salary{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=113}}. Judging from the correspondence with the family, Vrubel's contract with Prakhov was for the completion of four icons in the duration of 76 days. The salary  indicated  was 300 rubles paid in every 24 working days.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=123}}\n[[File:St. Cyril's Church's Frescoes.jpg|thumb|right|\"Descent of Holy Spirit on the Apostles\"]] \nVrubel staged his arrival in Kiev in his signature style. Lev Kovalsky, who in 1884 was a student at the  Kiev Art School appointed to pick Mikhail up in the station, later recalled:\n{{Quote|... Against a background of primitive Kirillovsky hills, a blond, almost white, young man with a particular head and small, almost white, moustaches, stood behind my back. He was of a moderate height, very proportionate, wearing\u2026 it stroke me the most\u2026black velvet costume with stockings, short trousers and anklets. <...> In general, he was impersonating a young Venetian from the paintings of [[Tintoretto]] or [[Titian]]; however, I found out about it only many years later when I visited Venice.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=13}}}}\n\n[[File:Mikhail-Vrubel-Icon3-(fragment).png|thumb|150px|right|\u201c{{ill|Virgin and Child|ru|Madonna (\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0441 \u043c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0435\u043c)}}\u201d (fragment)]] \n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - Womans Head (1885).png|left|150px|thumb|Woman\u2019s Head (Emily Prakhova)]]\nThe [[fresco]] \"Descent of Holy Spirit on the Apostles\" that Vrubel painted on the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of the St. Cyril's church bridged both features of Byzantine art and his own portrait pursuits. The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition. The background is coloured in blue while the golden rays are coming up to the apostles from the circle featuring the [[Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}} The model for the Mary\u2019s figure was a paramedic M. Ershova \u2013 a frequent guest in the Prakhov's house and the future wife of one of the painters participating in the restoration process.  To Mary\u2019s left stands the apostle that was painted from [[protoiereus]] Petr (Lebedintsev) who at that time taught at the Richelieu lyceum. To Mary's right stands the second apostle for whom the Kiev archaeologist {{ill|Viktor Goshkevich|ru|\u0413\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} was modelling. The third from the right was the head of the Kirillovsky parish Peter Orlovsky who originally discovered the remains of old paintings and interested the [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]] in their reconstruction. The fourth apostle, folded his hands in a prayer, was Prakhov. Besides the \"Descent\", Vrubel painted the \"The entry into Jerusalem\" and \"The Angels\u2019Lamentation\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=124}} The \"Descent\" was painted directly on the wall, without any cardboard and even any preliminary sketches \u2013 only certain details were previously specified on small sheets of paper. Remarkably, the painting depicts Apostles in a semicircle with their [[Halo (religious iconography)|limbs]] connecting to the Holy Spirit emblem. This painting style was of Byzantine origin and was inspired with hammered [[winged altarpiece]] from one of the [[\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438|Tiflis]] monasteries.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=123\u2014125}}\n\n===The first trip to Italy===\n[[File:Vrubel Moses.jpg|thumb|right|Icon of the Prophet Moses]]\nVrubel travelled to Venice together with Samuel Gaiduk who was a young artist painting in accordance with Mikhail's sketches.  Their trip had been not without some \u201cadventures\u201d, however. According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio. They both were interested in churches on the abandoned island [[Torcello]]{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=134\u2014135}}.\n\nDmitrieva described Vrubel's artistic evolution as following: \"Neither [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese]], nor magnificent [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] atmosphere of the Venetian [[Cinquecento]] attracted him. The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle.

There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"...

In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\".

Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The story is not included in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but can be seen in some icons from the Italian Renaissance. Though he clearly understood their significance and originality, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings since they differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would have unbalanced the relative integrity of the already-assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noted that the a new cathedral \"in a very special style\" would need to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nWhile painting murals in the Kiev churches, Vrubel simultaneously was drawn to the image of the Demon. According to P. Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer his acquired during the painting of sacred images techniques to  create completely the opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles.

He even noted that this painting would unlikely connect both with the public and the critics from the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued the destroyed shit together. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich \u2013 the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait - fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis manifested itself in the following incident. Once, Vrubel visited Prakhov where was already a company of artists participating in the painting of the cathedral. Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and he will have to urgently travel to Kharkiv; thus, painters raised money for his trip. The next day, Alexander Vrubel came to Prakhov looking for a sun. Confused Prakhiv had to explain to him the Vrubel\u2019s disappearance with his infatuation with one English singer from the cafesantan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=183\u2014184}} Furthermore, friends tried to ensure that Vrubel gets a regular income. He was assigned with a minor work in the Vladimyr's Cathedral \u2013 to draw ornaments and the \"Seven days for an eternity\" in one of the [[plafond]]s according to the sketches made by brothers [[Pavel Svedomsky|Pavel]] and {{ill|Alexander Swedomsky|ru|\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}.

Most likely, he travelled there because he fell in love with a circus horsewoman which he met thanks to Yasinsky's brother who performed under the pseudonym \"Alexander Zemgano\". As a result, Vrubel settled at the Korovin\u2019s studio on the {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya street|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=193\u2014194}} Vrubel, Korovin and Serov even had an idea to share a studio but, however, it did not translate into reality due to deteriorating relations with Serov.

Altogether, there were 18 painters, including Ilya Repin, [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], [[Leonid Pasternak]], [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]. In this cohort, Vrubel was the only one who was completely unknown to the public.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} It is not known who drew the attention of the publishers to Vrubel. According to different versions, Vrubel was introduced to Konchalovsky by Mamontov, Korovin and even Pasternak who was responsible for editing.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} The salary for the work was quite small (800 rubles for 5 big and 13 small illustrations){{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=238}}. However, Vrubel' illustrations passed with difficulties since due to its complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. However, the main difficulty was the fact that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. Despite this, on April 10, 1891, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] and right after the publication was widely discussed in the press. It was the press that harshly criticized illustrations made by Vrubel, primarily for its \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him and thus the painter changed his views on aesthetics suggesting that the \"true art\" is incomprehensible to almost anyone, and \"comprehensibility\" was as suspicious in his eyes as for others was  \"incomprehensibility\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=62}}\n\nVrubel made all his illustrations in black watercolour; monochromaticity made it possible to emphasize the dramatic nature of the plot and at the same time made it possible to show the range of textured pursuits explored by the artist. The Demon was an archetypal \"fallen angel\" that simultaneously bridged men and female figures. Tamara was differently depicted on every image, and that emphasized her unavoidable choice between earthly and heavenly.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=14}} According to Dmitrieva, Vrubel\u2019 illustrations show the painterl being at the top of his game as a graphic artist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=37}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d (\u0441\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Demon Seated, 1890.

Later was used as a stamp of Abramtsevo factory]] \n\nOn July 20, 1890, a 22-year old painter A. Mamontov died in the [[Abramtsevo Colony]]. His friend Mikhail Vrubel attended the funeral and was so fond of local landscapes that decided to stay in there. In Abramtsevo, Vrubel became fascinated with [[ceramic]]s and soon after that Mikhail proudly mentioned to his sister Anna that he now heads the \"factory of ceramic tiles and [[terracotta]] decorations\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=253, 246}} Savva Mamontov did not understand Vrubel' aesthetic aspirations but recognized his talent, and by any means was trying to create a suitable living environment for the painter. For the first time in his life, Vrubel ceased to be a freeloader in noble families and started earning good money by fulfilling orders on several furnace compositions; decorating a majolica chapel on the grave of A. Mamontov; projecting the extension in the \"Roman-Byzantine style\" to the Mamontov's mansion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=245\u2014246}} According to Dmitrieva, \"Vrubel\u2026 seemed to be irreplaceable as he could easily do any art, except writing texts.

From the one hand, movement supporters discussed a revival of Russian traditional crafts. From the other hand, machine fabrication contradicted the uniqueness which was the main art principle in Art Nouveau.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|pp=195\u2014196}} Vrubel worked in both Abramtsevo and Talashkino. However, both of these studies differed in the accents of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of maiolic art in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to maiolica because of its simplicity, spontaneity of generalization of form with a rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material. The lack of craftsmanship with its patterns allowed to put his fantasies into life.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=203}} In Abramtsevo, Vrubel' plans were supported and brought to life by the famous ceramist [[Peter Vaulin]].{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=209}}\n\n===The return trip to Italy===\nIn 1891, the Mamontov family went to Italy. They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]]. Savva Mamontov paid Vrubel a monthly salary; however, an attempt to settle him in the Mamontov's house led to a scandal with Elizaveta after which Vrubel decided to stay with Svedomsky.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=264}}\n\nVrubel did not get along with other Russian artists working in Rome and continuously accused them with the lack of artistic talent, plagiarism, and other things. He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.  Svedomskys unconditionally recognized Vrubel's creative superiority and not only settled him at their house but also shared commercial orders with him.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=264\u2014266}} In the end, Mamontov arranged Vrubel's stay at the studio of half Italian [[Alexander Rizzoni]] who graduated from the Russian Academy of Arts. Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved). Elizaveta Mamontova later wrote:\n{{Quote|I visited Vrubel, he painted a life-size Snow Maiden's head in watercolour against the background of a pine tree covered with snow.

The main feature of this composition is its timelessness \u2013 it is impossible to say when the action took place. The figures were chaotically arranged, \"compressing\" space, which is projected onto the plane.

Due to regular commissioned works made for Mamontov, Vrubel\u2019s reputation in Moscow grew greatly. For instance, the painter received the order to decorate the Dunker family mansion on the Povarskaya Street. Also, together with the most famous architect of Moscow Art Nouveau [[Fyodor Schechtel]], Vrubel decorated the Zinaida Morozova's mansion on Spiridonovka street and A.

The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern. Vrubel's sculpture attracted the attention of his contemporaries. For instance, at the end of his life,  [[Aleksandr Matveyev (sculptor)|Aleksandr Matveyev]] mentioned that \"without Vrubel there would be no [[Sergey Konenkov]]...\".{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}}\n\nThe gothic composition \"Robert and the Nuns\" is usually considered as the most important Vrubel's sculpture; it decorates the staircase of the Morozov mansion.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}} Literature on architecture emphasizes the exclusive role that Vrubel played in forming artistic appearances of the Moscow Art Nouveau.

According to the Korovin\u2019s memoirs, after getting a large salary for watercolour panels, he spent them as follows:\n{{quote|He organized the dinner in the hotel \"Paris\" where he also lived.

Savva Mamontov was a curator of the exposition dedicated to the [[Far North (Russia)|Russian North]]. It was him who noticed that the neighbouring section of arts lacks the paintings that would cover two large empty walls. Mamontov discussed with the Minister of Finance his idea to cover these walls with large panels with total area 20 \u00d7 5 m and ordered these panels from Vrubel.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=297}} At that time, the painter was busy decorating the Morozov's mansion in Moscow. However, he agreed to take the offer even though the order was quite big \u2013 the total area of paintings was 100 square meters, and it needed to be finished in three months.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=299}} He planned to decorate the first wall with the painting \"[[Mikula Selyaninovich]]\" that metaphorically depicted the Russian land. For the second wall, Vrubel chose \"The Princess of the Dream\" inspired by a work of the same name made by the French poet [[Edmond Rostand]]. The second painting symbolically represented the painter's dream of beauty.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=60}}\n\nIt was impossible to complete the order in such short notice. That is why Vrubel instructed painter T. Safonov from Nizhny Novgorod to start working on \"Mikula\". Safonov was supposed to paint according to Vrubel's sketches. The decorative frieze was finished by A. Karelin \u2013 son of a Russian photographer {{ill|Andrei Karelin|ru|\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043d, \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u041e\u0441\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=303}}\n\nOn March 5, 1896, academician [[Albert Nikolayevitch Benois]] reported to the Academy of Arts that the work that was being carried out in the art pavilion is incompatible with its thematic goals. Thus, Benois demanded from Vrubel sketches of the alleged panels. After arriving in Nizhny Novgorod on April 25, Benois sent a telegram: \n{{quote| Vrubel's panels are terrifying; we need to take them off, waiting for the juri.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=304}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel.

The committee included [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev]], [[Konstantin Savitsky]], [[Pavel Brullov]], and others. They concluded that it is impossible to exhibit Vrubel's works. Mamontov told Vrubel to continue working and went to Saint Petersburg to persuade the members of the committee. At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee. However, his claims were rejected, and on May 22 Vrubel had to leave the exhibition hall while all of his works had been already taken.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=304\u2014305}}\n\nVrubel lost nothing financially since Mamontov bought both paintings for {{nobr|5 000}} rubles each. He also agreed with [[Vasily Polenov]] and Konstantin Korovin for them finishing the half-ready \"Mikula\". Canvases were rolled up and brought back to Moscow where Polenov and Korovin started working on them while Vrubel was finishing \"The Princess of the Dream\" in a shed of the Abramtsevo Pottery factory. Both canvases arrived in Nizhny Novgorod right before the emperor's visit scheduled on July 15-17.

The painter was able to finish ''Pan'' in one day while being in [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Tenisheva]]\u2019s mansion in [[Talashkino]]. The plot was drawn in a canvas on which he previously started to paint the portrait of his wife.

Stored at the [[Russian Museum]]]]\n\nTen years later, Vrubel returned to the theme of Demon which is evident from his correspondence with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] at the end of 1898. Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom. His eyes, as if prophetically, captured the whole tragic fate of his fragility.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}}}\n\nThe birth of Savva led to a dramatic change in the routine of the family. Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively. Despite usual 3-4 hours, he worked up to 14 hours, and sometimes even more, with a flash of artificial lightning, never leaving the room and barely coming off the painting. Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910)==\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients.

Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

As with the illustrations for Lermontov' works, Vrubel created a lot of graphic sketches trying to catch and solve the problem of a \"black-white colourness\". However, the final version had the figures of sea princess on it, about which Vrubel later told to Prakhov:\n{{Quote|After all, I did not intend to paint any \"sea princesses\" in my \"Pearl\". I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\". Later Vrubel kept seeing in their figures something obscene that appeared in the painting against his own will.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}\n\nIn February 1905, Vrubel again started having the symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nVera Usoltseva, the wife of doctor Usoltsev, described Vrubel's condition to Nadezhda Vrubel as follows:\n{{Quote| Mikhail's condition did not change. His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time. But, unfortunately, he tore his new summer coat and trousers apart. He pretended to be calm, went to bed, covered himself with a blanket, and started to tugging the cloth underneath and tearing it into strips before the servant had noticed \u2026 His physical strength is high, which is rare for an intelligent person\u2026 You asked, should you write to him or not. No, you should not. He does not pay attention to letters and does not write them himself. He is often in the hands of delusion\u2026. the love to you is a red thread which is visible in all of his conversations\u2026 So, he explained to me that the coat and trousers would be of use to you if one puts multi-coloured pieces of matter into the holes\u2026.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=446\u2014448}}}}\nOnly after half of the year Vrubel started more or less adequately show responsiveness to the physical environment. However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis. In addition, the painter was diagnosed with an [[optic neuropathy]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=449\u2014450}} Mikhail was kept in the clinic almost exclusively at the expense of his wife, which was not an easy task because a month of stay in the Usoltsev's clinic cost 100-150 rubles. On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

On  November 28 1905, he was awarded the title Academician of painting \"for fame in the artistic field\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=452\u2014453}} After that, the editor of \"{{ill|Zolotoe runo|ru|\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u043d\u043e (\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b)}}\" Nicolai Ryabushinsky visited Vrubel in the clinic with the offer to paint  [[Valery Bryusov]]. The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in. He entered with a wrong, heavy gait as if he was dragging his feet. To tell the truth, I was shocked when I saw Vrubel. It was a frail and sick person in a dirty, crumpled shirt. He had a reddish face and bird of prey eyes; protruding hair instead of a beard. First impression: crazy! <...> In real life, all small Vrubel's movement reflected his disorder. However, when his hand took a pencil or a lump of coal, it became very steady and confident. Lines that he drew were infallible.\n\nHis artistic strength survived everything else in him. The human died, was destroyed, but the master continued to live.\n\nDuring the first session, the first draft was already finished. I am really sorry that nobody thought of taking a picture of this dark drawing. It was almost even more remarkable in terms of performance, facial expression, and similarity than the later portrait painted with coloured pencils.{{sfn|\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432|2002|pp=242\u2014244}}}}\n\nThen Ryabushinsky commissioned Serov to paint the portrait of Vrubel. They organized the work, so Vrubel was able to paint Bruysov in the mornings, while Serov painted Vrubel in the afternoons.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=453}} Even though Nadezhda Zabela was concerned if Vrubel could handle such stress, Usoltsev categorically said that \"as an artist, he was healthy and deeply healthy.\" The first issue of the \"Zolotoe runo\" was published on February 1, 1906, with the Bryusov's poem \"To M. A. Vrubel\" opening the issue. Twelve days later, Vrubel complained to his wife that he could not read or paint. In few days, he became completely blind.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=456}}\n===Fading away.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses. The request was approved, and Vrubel started receiving 75 rubles in summer and 100 rubles in winter months.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=458}}\n\nAfter Vrubel lost his sight, his violent seizures occurred much rarer. Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him. Especially often they re-read [[Ivan Turgenev]] 's [[prose poetry]] and [[Anton Chekhov]] 's novella [[The Steppe (novella)|The Steppe]] on the grounds of which Vrubel once created a painting. Ekaterina Ge later recalled:\n{{quote|... Mikhail Alexandrovich was very much engaged into reading and could not stand only sad endings, and always composed a new one instead, a more happy one \u2026 sometimes he was so got into himself that could listen to neither reading nor songs and was telling something like fairytales of his emerald eyes, life in the ancient world and how he made all the famous [[Renaissance]] works.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}}}}\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel\u2019s funeral on April 3, 1910.

Some days he experienced enlightening and then complained about the misfortune that befell him. Besides, he followed the ascetic practices that promised to bring back his lost sight \u2013 refused to eat, stood the whole night before the bed.

In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute. Ekaterina Ge remembered that he \"took [[quinine]] almost with pleasure, and when he saw a [[sodium salicylate]], he said: \"This is so ugly\". Even before that the doctor Usoltsev wrote that \"It was different with him than with any other patients that usually lose the most thin or aesthetic sense first because for them they come the last; Vrubel's aesthetic sense died last because it was the first for him\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=461}}\n\nOn the eve of his death on 1 (14) April, 1910, Vrubel put himself in order, washed with cologne, and at night said to the nurse who was caring of him: \u201cNikolay, it\u2019s enough for me to lie here \u2013 we will go to the Academy.\u201d Indeed, the next day the coffin with Vrubel was put in the Academy of Arts.

She was buried near with her husband. Russian sculptor [[Leonid Sherwood]] decided to construct the tombstone on their graves, but by 1913 he was able only to set up the black granite pedestal. After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] was severely damaged and many graves were destroyed. In the 1930s, a necropolis museum was organized in the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. Then they started to move the graves of famous artists from the Novodevichy Cemetery to a new museum, but the transfer remained unfinished due to lack of finance and later beginning of the [[World War II|war]]. An alleged transfer of the Vrubel\u2019s ash did not take place as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://family-history.ru/material/biography/mesto/vrubel/mogila/ |title=\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447\u044c\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 |publisher=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Family-History.ru |access-date=2014-11-17}}</ref> In 2015, the public initiated establishment of the new tombstone on the Vrubel\u2019s grave, but local authorities refused the installation<ref>{{cite web\n|title=\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://planeta.ru/campaigns/mihail_vrubel |publisher=Planeta.ru |access-date=2017-10-29}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0410. |title=\u0412 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/26736/3763475/ |date=2017-09-26 |publisher=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 |access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref>\n\nVrubel\u2019s works are exhibited in [[The State Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow, [[Russian Museum]] in Saint Petersburg, Vrubel Museum of Fine Arts in Omsk, Kiev Art Gallery, [[Odessa Art Museum]], [[Belarusian National Arts Museum]], and other places.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D|title=\u041c. \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u201c\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0413\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u201d - \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c |publisher=www.artmuseum.by|accessdate=2019-01-11 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103060635/http://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D |archivedate=2019-01-03}}</ref> Many commemorative sights and objects are named after Vrubel in Omsk, Kiev, Voronezh, Moscow, Saratov, Odessa.\n\nMany researchers and critics have differently evaluated the impact that Vrubel had on Russian and Global art. According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia. Vrubel had to wait for his admirers, customers and patrons to appear only in the mid-1890s.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68, 73}}\n\n==In the cinema==\n* [[1953]] \u2014 ''[[Rimsky-Korsakov (film)|Rimsky-Korsakov]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430, \u0410. \u041d.\n|title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0432 XIX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0435\n|publisher=\u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|year=1999\n|pages=448\n|isbn=5-250-02693-1\n|ref=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0412. \u042f.\n|title=\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430. \u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u041e\u041b\u041c\u0410-\u041f\u0420\u0415\u0421\u0421\n|year=2002\n|pages=415\n|isbn=5-94850-030-6\n|ref=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\n|title=\u0412\u0435\u0441\u044c \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433 \u043d\u0430 1914 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0433. \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\n|place=Saint Petersburg\n|publisher=\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0410. \u0421. \u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u00ab\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f\u00bb\n|year=1914\n|isbn=5-94030-052-9\n|ref=Suvorkin}} \n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\n|title=\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\n|place=Leningrad\n|publisher=\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\n|year=1976\n|pages=383\n|ref=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d, \u041c. \u042e.\n|title=\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c. \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u0410\u0412\u0420\u041e\u0420\u0410\n|year=2010\n|pages=160\n|isbn=978-5-7300-0825-0\n|ref=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d. \u0410.\n|title=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432. \u0412\u044b\u043f.

19th-20th century Russian painter who worked in all genres of art, including painting, graphics, decorative sculpture, and theatrical art. In 1896, Vrubel married the famous singer [[Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel]] whom he regularly painted. \n\nSoviet historian {{ill|Nina Dmitrieva|ru|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430}} compared Vrubel\u2019s artistic biography to a three-act drama with prologue and epilogue, while the transition between acts was rapid and unexpected. The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically {{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}.\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

Great-grandfather of the artist \u2013 Anton Antonovich Vrubel \u2013 was originally from [[Bia\u0142ystok]] and served as a judge in his local town. His son {{ill|Mikhail Antonovich Vrubel|ru|\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1799-1859) became a professional military.

At that time, the Astrakhan governor was a famous cartographer and admiral {{ill|Grigori Basargin|ru|\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. The governor\u2019s daughter Anna later married the second son of Mikhail Antonovich from the first marriage, Alexander, who previously graduated from the [[Cadet Corps]], served in the Tengin Infantry Regiment, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Caucasian]] and [[Crimean War]]s. In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born. Altogether, they had four children, each of whom was born one after the other.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=7\u201412}}\n\nMikhail Vrubel was born on March 17, 1856. At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863.

In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them. Sometimes they behaved coldly to their stepmother calling her with an ironic nickname \"Madrin'ka \u2014 perl materei\". They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting.

The painting impressed Mikhail so much, that, according to his sister, he reproduced it from his memory in all details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=28}}\n\n===Gymnasium===\n\nMikhail Vrubel started his education at the {{ill|Fifth St. Petersburg Gymnasium|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f}} where the school directorate paid particular attention to the modernization of teaching methods, the advancement of [[Classics|classical studies]], the literary development of high school students, dance and gymnastics lessons. His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A. I. Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]. Papmels put on quite a spread and everything about them was opposite to the way the Vrubel family lived; their house was a full bowl, even in an excessively literal sense, and during his time with Papmels, Vrubel firstly discovered his passion for wine which was never been lacking.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=61}}}}\n\nIt was the Papmel family prone to [[aestheticism]] and bohemian lifestyle that encouraged Vrubel's [[dandy]]ism and a desire to paint. In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century.

Lev Kovalsky, who in 1884 was a student at the  Kiev Art School appointed to pick Mikhail up in the station, later recalled:\n{{Quote|...

The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition. The background is coloured in blue while the golden rays are coming up to the apostles from the circle featuring the [[Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}} The model for the Mary\u2019s figure was a paramedic M.

To Mary\u2019s left stands the apostle that was painted from [[protoiereus]] Petr (Lebedintsev) who at that time taught at the Richelieu lyceum.

The third from the right was the head of the Kirillovsky parish Peter Orlovsky who originally discovered the remains of old paintings and interested the [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]] in their reconstruction. The fourth apostle, folded his hands in a prayer, was Prakhov. Besides the \"Descent\", Vrubel painted the \"The entry into Jerusalem\" and \"The Angels\u2019Lamentation\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=124}} The \"Descent\" was painted directly on the wall, without any cardboard and even any preliminary sketches \u2013 only certain details were previously specified on small sheets of paper. Remarkably, the painting depicts Apostles in a semicircle with their [[Halo (religious iconography)|limbs]] connecting to the Holy Spirit emblem. This painting style was of Byzantine origin and was inspired with hammered [[winged altarpiece]] from one of the [[\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438|Tiflis]] monasteries.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=123\u2014125}}\n\n===The first trip to Italy===\n[[File:Vrubel Moses.jpg|thumb|right|Icon of the Prophet Moses]]\nVrubel travelled to Venice together with Samuel Gaiduk who was a young artist painting in accordance with Mikhail's sketches.  Their trip had been not without some \u201cadventures\u201d, however. According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio. They both were interested in churches on the abandoned island [[Torcello]]{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=134\u2014135}}.\n\nDmitrieva described Vrubel's artistic evolution as following: \"Neither [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese]], nor magnificent [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] atmosphere of the Venetian [[Cinquecento]] attracted him. The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle. Fresco sketch for the Vladimir Cathedral, 1887]]\nAfter returning from Venice in 1885, Vrubel spent May and part of June in Kiev. There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"...

Edwards, together with [[Kyriak Kostandi]], tried to reform the Odessa Art School and decided to decided to elicit Vrubel's help. He settled Vrubel in his own house and tried to persuade him to stay in Odessa forever.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=151\u2014153}} In summer, Serov arrived in Odessa and Vrubel for the first time told him about his plan to paint the \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\". In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\". Vrubel used to throw his money in the caf\u00e9-\u0441hantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=174\u2014177}}\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone Crying, the second version.

Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\n\nAt the same time, Adrian Prakhov organized painting of the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] and, without regard to his personal attitudes, invited Vrubel. Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The story is not included in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but can be seen in some icons from the Italian Renaissance. Though he clearly understood their significance and originality, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings since they differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would have unbalanced the relative integrity of the already-assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noted that the a new cathedral \"in a very special style\" would need to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nWhile painting murals in the Kiev churches, Vrubel simultaneously appealed to the image of the Demon. According to P. Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer his acquired during the painting of sacred images techniques to  create completely the opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles.

He even noted that this painting would unlikely connect both with the public and the critics from the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued the destroyed shit together. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich \u2013 the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait - fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis manifested itself in the following incident. Once, Vrubel visited Prakhov where was already a company of artists participating in the painting of the cathedral. Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and he will have to urgently travel to Kharkiv; thus, painters raised money for his trip. The next day, Alexander Vrubel came to Prakhov looking for a sun. Confused Prakhiv had to explain to him the Vrubel\u2019s disappearance with his infatuation with one English singer from the cafesantan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=183\u2014184}} Furthermore, friends tried to ensure that Vrubel gets a regular income. He was assigned with a minor work in the Vladimyr's Cathedral \u2013 to draw ornaments and the \"Seven days for an eternity\" in one of the [[plafond]]s according to the sketches made by brothers [[Pavel Svedomsky|Pavel]] and {{ill|Alexander Swedomsky|ru|\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}.

Most likely, he travelled there because he fell in love with a circus horsewoman which he met thanks to Yasinsky's brother who performed under the pseudonym \"Alexander Zemgano\". As a result, Vrubel settled at the Korovin\u2019s studio on the {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya street|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=193\u2014194}} Vrubel, Korovin and Serov even had an idea to share a studio but, however, it did not translate into reality due to deteriorating relations with Serov.

Altogether, there were 18 painters, including Ilya Repin, [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], [[Leonid Pasternak]], [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]. In this cohort, Vrubel was the only one who was completely unknown to the public.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} It is not known who drew the attention of the publishers to Vrubel.

However, Vrubel' illustrations passed with difficulties since due to its complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. However, the main difficulty was the fact that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. Despite this, on April 10, 1891, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] and right after the publication was widely discussed in the press. It was the press that harshly criticized illustrations made by Vrubel, primarily for its \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him and thus the painter changed his views on aesthetics suggesting that the \"true art\" is incomprehensible to almost anyone, and \"comprehensibility\" was as suspicious in his eyes as for others was  \"incomprehensibility\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=62}}\n\nVrubel made all his illustrations in black watercolour; monochromaticity made it possible to emphasize the dramatic nature of the plot and at the same time made it possible to show the range of textured pursuits explored by the artist.

Later was used as a stamp of Abramtsevo factory]] \n\nOn July 20, 1890, a 22-year old painter A. Mamontov died in the [[Abramtsevo Colony]]. His friend Mikhail Vrubel attended the funeral and was so fond of local landscapes that decided to stay in there. In Abramtsevo, Vrubel became fascinated with [[ceramic]]s and soon after that Mikhail proudly mentioned to his sister Anna that he now heads the \"factory of ceramic tiles and [[terracotta]] decorations\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=253, 246}} Savva Mamontov did not understand Vrubel' aesthetic aspirations but recognized his talent, and by any means was trying to create a suitable living environment for the painter. For the first time in his life, Vrubel ceased to be a freeloader in noble families and started earning good money by fulfilling orders on several furnace compositions; decorating a majolica chapel on the grave of A. Mamontov; projecting the extension in the \"Roman-Byzantine style\" to the Mamontov's mansion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=245\u2014246}} According to Dmitrieva, \"Vrubel\u2026 seemed to be irreplaceable as he could easily do any art, except writing texts.

From the one hand, movement supporters discussed a revival of Russian traditional crafts. From the other hand, machine fabrication contradicted the uniqueness which was the main art principle in Art Nouveau.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|pp=195\u2014196}} Vrubel worked in both Abramtsevo and Talashkino. However, both of these studies differed in the accents of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of maiolic art in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to maiolica because of its simplicity, spontaneity of generalization of form with a rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material. The lack of craftsmanship with its patterns allowed to put his fantasies into life.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=203}} In Abramtsevo, Vrubel' plans were supported and brought to life by the famous ceramist [[Peter Vaulin]].{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=209}}\n\n===The return trip to Italy===\nIn 1891, the Mamontov family went to Italy. They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]]. Savva Mamontov paid Vrubel a monthly salary; however, an attempt to settle him in the Mamontov's house led to a scandal with Elizaveta after which Vrubel decided to stay with Svedomsky.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=264}}\n\nVrubel did not get along with other Russian artists working in Rome and continuously accused them with the lack of artistic talent, plagiarism, and other things. He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.  Svedomskys unconditionally recognized Vrubel's creative superiority and not only settled him at their house but also shared commercial orders with him.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=264\u2014266}} In the end, Mamontov arranged Vrubel's stay at the studio of half Italian [[Alexander Rizzoni]] who graduated from the Russian Academy of Arts. Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved). Elizaveta Mamontova later wrote:\n{{Quote|I visited Vrubel, he painted a life-size Snow Maiden's head in watercolour against the background of a pine tree covered with snow. Beautiful in colours, but the face had gumboil and angry eyes. How ironic, he had to come to Rome to paint the Russian winter.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=268}}}}\n\nVrubel continued to work in Abramtsevo.

The main feature of this composition is its timelessness \u2013 it is impossible to say when the action took place. The figures were chaotically arranged, \"compressing\" space, which is projected onto the plane. A pair for the Venice became the \"Spain\" which critics recognize as one of the Vrubel's most perfectly arranged paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=55}}\n\n===Decorative works===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043d\u0438.jpg|thumb|left|\u201dRobert and the Nuns.

Due to regular commissioned works made for Mamontov, Vrubel\u2019s reputation in Moscow grew greatly. For instance, the painter received the order to decorate the Dunker family mansion on the Povarskaya Street. Also, together with the most famous architect of Moscow Art Nouveau [[Fyodor Schechtel]], Vrubel decorated the Zinaida Morozova's mansion on Spiridonovka street and A. Morozov's house in Podsosenskiy lane.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=272}}\n\nVrubel' decorative works illustrate how universal his talents were. The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern. Vrubel's sculpture attracted the attention of his contemporaries. For instance, at the end of his life,  [[Aleksandr Matveyev (sculptor)|Aleksandr Matveyev]] mentioned that \"without Vrubel there would be no [[Sergey Konenkov]]...\".{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}}\n\nThe gothic composition \"Robert and the Nuns\" is usually considered as the most important Vrubel's sculpture; it decorates the staircase of the Morozov mansion.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}} Literature on architecture emphasizes the exclusive role that Vrubel played in forming artistic appearances of the Moscow Art Nouveau. The artist created several compositions (small sculptural plastics from maiolica and tiles) which decorated important buildings in modern and pseudo-Russian style ([[Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station]], {{ill|Osobnyak M.

Thus, Benois demanded from Vrubel sketches of the alleged panels. After arriving in Nizhny Novgorod on April 25, Benois sent a telegram: \n{{quote| Vrubel's panels are terrifying; we need to take them off, waiting for the juri.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=304}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel.

The committee included [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev]], [[Konstantin Savitsky]], [[Pavel Brullov]], and others. They concluded that it is impossible to exhibit Vrubel's works. Mamontov told Vrubel to continue working and went to Saint Petersburg to persuade the members of the committee. At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee. However, his claims were rejected, and on May 22 Vrubel had to leave the exhibition hall while all of his works had been already taken.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=304\u2014305}}\n\nVrubel lost nothing financially since Mamontov bought both paintings for {{nobr|5 000}} rubles each. He also agreed with [[Vasily Polenov]] and Konstantin Korovin for them finishing the half-ready \"Mikula\". Canvases were rolled up and brought back to Moscow where Polenov and Korovin started working on them while Vrubel was finishing \"The Princess of the Dream\" in a shed of the Abramtsevo Pottery factory. Both canvases arrived in Nizhny Novgorod right before the emperor's visit scheduled on July 15-17.

On the contrary, Maxim Gorky was against Vrubel. He made fun of \"Mikula\" by comparing it with a fictional character Chernomor. \"The Princess of the Dream\" resent him with its \"antics, ugliness of otherwise beautiful plot\". In five articles, Gorky exposed Vrubel's \"poverty of spirit and poverty of imagination\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=309\u2014311}}\n\n[[File:Vrubel Siren.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Lilacs, 1900.

Around the same time, the Russian premiere of the [[fairy-tail opera]] \u201c[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]\u201d was about to take place.

Originally, Konstantin Korovin was responsible for the decorations and costumes but because of illness had to renounce the order in favour of Mikhail Vrubel who had never even attended an opera before.

Nevertheless, on July 28 they engaged in the [[Russian Church, Geneva|Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] in Geneva, Switzerland. The couple spent their honeymoon in a guesthouse in [[Lucerne]]. Then Vrubel continued his work on the panel for the Morozov\u2019s gothic cabinet.

However, Vrubel did not many commissions in the city and had to live on his wife\u2019s money. This prompted him to turn to theatrical painting and costume designs.

His [[migraine]]s got so strong that the painter had to take [[phenacetin]] in large quantities (according to his sister in law \u2013 up to 25 [[grain]]s and more).

The painter was able to finish ''Pan'' in one day while being in [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Tenisheva]]\u2019s mansion in [[Talashkino]].

Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom.

Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively.

Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910)==\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

At the same time, Vrubel\u2019s hallucinations were caused by a [[bipolar disorder]] common among artists.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=437}} Due to progressive methods applied in the Usoltsev's clinic and frequent visits of Nadezhda and Anna Vrubel (they rented a house nearby and visited Mikhail daily), Vrubel almost fully rehabilitated. Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients. The doctor constantly invited artists and singers for organized house concerts. Patients attended evening events together with medical staff{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}. Usoltsev valued Vrubel's art and in every possible way, encouraged his creative pursuits.

At that time, the painter primarily drew portraits of doctors, orderlies, patients, acquaintances, players in cards and chess, landscape sketches. He also sketched the corners of his room and some simple objects, such as chairs, a dress threw on a chair, a crumpled bed (seria \"Insomnia\"), candlestick, carafe, a rose in a glass. Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

As with the illustrations for Lermontov' works, Vrubel created a lot of graphic sketches trying to catch and solve the problem of a \"black-white colourness\". However, the final version had the figures of sea princess on it, about which Vrubel later told to Prakhov:\n{{Quote|After all, I did not intend to paint any \"sea princesses\" in my \"Pearl\". I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\". Later Vrubel kept seeing in their figures something obscene that appeared in the painting against his own will.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}\n\nIn February 1905, Vrubel again started having the symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906.

His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time.

However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis.

On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses.

Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him.

In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute. Ekaterina Ge remembered that he \"took [[quinine]] almost with pleasure, and when he saw a [[sodium salicylate]], he said: \"This is so ugly\".

Hence he borrowed 25 rubles from me and left. He came back soon, took a large basin and a bucket of water, and poured some cologne from a beautiful bottle from  [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]]  into the water. He undressed and stood in a basin, pouring himself out of a bucket. Then he lighted the iron stove and put four eggs inside, and later ate them with a loaf of baked bread.

After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] was severely damaged and many graves were destroyed. In the 1930s, a necropolis museum was organized in the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]].

According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia.

Colbert first performed professionally as an [[understudy]] for [[Steve Carell]] at [[Second City Chicago]], where his troupe mates included [[Paul Dinello]] and [[Amy Sedaris]], comedians with whom he developed the sketch comedy series ''[[Exit 57]]''. He wrote and performed on the short-lived ''[[The Dana Carvey Show|Dana Carvey Show]]'' before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series ''[[Strangers with Candy]]''. He gained attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher [[Chuck Noblet]].\n\nColbert's work as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news-parody series ''[[The Daily Show]]'' gained him wide recognition. In 2005, he left ''The Daily Show'' to host ''The Colbert Report''. Following ''The Daily Show''{{'}}s news-parody concept, ''The Colbert Report'' was a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows including ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', in which he portrayed a [[Stephen Colbert (character)|caricatured version]] of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Pundit|political pundits]]. The series became one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]] in 2006. After ending ''The Colbert Report'', he was hired in 2015 to succeed retiring [[David Letterman]] as host of the [[Late Show (CBS TV series)|''Late Show'']] on CBS. He hosted the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in September 2017.\n\nColbert has won nine [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, two [[Grammy Award]]s, and two [[Peabody Awards]].

[[Xanax]] was just lovely. Y'know, for a while. And then I realized that the gears were still smoking. I just couldn't hear them anymore. But I could feel them, I could feel the gearbox heating up and smoke pouring out of me&nbsp;... I stopped the Xanax after, like, nine days. I went, 'This isn't helping.' So I just suffered through it. I'd sometimes hold the bottle, to go like, 'I could stop this feeling if I wanted, but I'm not going to. Because I know if I stop the feeling, somehow I'm not working through it, like I have got to go through the tunnel with the spiders in it.'\n\n<br /><br />\"And then one morning I woke up and my skin wasn't on fire, and it took me a while to figure out what it was. I wake up the next morning, I'm perfectly fine, to the point where my body's still humming. I'm a bell that's been rung so hard that I can still feel myself vibrating.

Colbert first performed professionally as an [[understudy]] for [[Steve Carell]] at [[Second City Chicago]], where his troupe mates included [[Paul Dinello]] and [[Amy Sedaris]], comedians with whom he developed the sketch comedy series ''[[Exit 57]]''. He wrote and performed on the short-lived ''[[The Dana Carvey Show|Dana Carvey Show]]'' before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series ''[[Strangers with Candy]]''. He gained attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher [[Chuck Noblet]].\n\nColbert's work as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news-parody series ''[[The Daily Show]]'' gained him wide recognition. In 2005, he left ''The Daily Show'' to host ''The Colbert Report''. Following ''The Daily Show''{{'}}s news-parody concept, ''The Colbert Report'' was a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows including ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', in which he portrayed a [[Stephen Colbert (character)|caricatured version]] of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Pundit|political pundits]]. The series became one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]] in 2006. After ending ''The Colbert Report'', he was hired in 2015 to succeed retiring [[David Letterman]] as host of the [[Late Show (CBS TV series)|''Late Show'']] on CBS. He hosted the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in September 2017.\n\nColbert has won nine [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, two [[Grammy Award]]s, and two [[Peabody Awards]].

[[Xanax]] was just lovely. Y'know, for a while. And then I realized that the gears were still smoking. I just couldn't hear them anymore. But I could feel them, I could feel the gearbox heating up and smoke pouring out of me&nbsp;... I stopped the Xanax after, like, nine days. I went, 'This isn't helping.' So I just suffered through it. I'd sometimes hold the bottle, to go like, 'I could stop this feeling if I wanted, but I'm not going to. Because I know if I stop the feeling, somehow I'm not working through it, like I have got to go through the tunnel with the spiders in it.'\n\n<br /><br />\"And then one morning I woke up and my skin wasn't on fire, and it took me a while to figure out what it was. I wake up the next morning, I'm perfectly fine, to the point where my body's still humming. I'm a bell that's been rung so hard that I can still feel myself vibrating.

{"title_page": "Military of the Qing dynasty", "text_new": "{{Short description|Historical military force}}[[File:The Qianlong Emperor in Ceremonial Armour on Horseback.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Qianlong Emperor]] in Ceremonial Armour on Horseback, by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (Jesuit painter)|Giuseppe Castiglione]].]]\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] (1636\u20131912) was established by conquest and maintained by armed force. The founding emperors personally organized and led the armies, and the continued cultural and political legitimacy of the dynasty depended on the ability to defend the country from invasion and expand its territory. Therefore, military institutions, leadership, and finance were fundamental to the dynasty's initial success and ultimate decay. The early military system centered on the [[Eight Banners]], a hybrid institution that also played social, economic, and political roles.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=40}} The Banner system was developed on an informal basis as early as 1601, and formally established in 1615 by [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] leader [[Nurhaci]] (1559\u20131626), the retrospectively recognized founder of the Qing. His son [[Hong Taiji]] (1592\u20131643), who renamed the Jurchens \"[[Manchu people|Manchus]],\" created eight Mongol banners to mirror the Manchu ones and eight \"Han-martial\" ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u6f22\u8ecd}}|p=H\u00e0nj\u016bn|labels=no}}) banners manned by Chinese who surrendered to the Qing before the full-fledged [[Qing conquest of Ming|conquest of China proper]] began in 1644. After 1644, the Ming Chinese troops that surrendered to the Qing were integrated into the [[Green Standard Army]], a corps that eventually outnumbered the Banners by three to one.\n\nThe use of gunpowder during the [[High Qing]] can compete with the three [[gunpowder empires]] in western Asia.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA95#v=onepage&q&f=false Millward 2007], p. 95.</ref> Manchu imperial princes led the Banners in defeating the Ming armies, but after lasting peace was established starting in 1683, both the Banners and the Green Standard Armies started to lose their efficiency. Garrisoned in cities, soldiers had few occasions to drill. The Qing nonetheless used superior armament and logistics to expand deeply into Central Asia, defeat the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongols]] in 1759, and complete their conquest of [[Xinjiang]]. Despite the dynasty's pride in the [[Ten Great Campaigns]] of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735\u20131796), the Qing armies became largely ineffective by the end of the 18th century. It took almost ten years and huge financial waste to defeat the badly equipped [[White Lotus Rebellion]] (1795\u20131804), partly by legitimizing militias led by local Han Chinese elites. The [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850\u20131864), a large-scale uprising that started in southern China, marched within miles of Beijing in 1853. The Qing court was forced to let its Han Chinese [[Zongdu|governors-general]], first led by [[Zeng Guofan]], raise regional armies. This new type of army and leadership defeated the rebels but signaled the end of Manchu dominance of the military establishment.\n\nThe military technology of the European [[Industrial Revolution]] made China's armament and military rapidly obsolete. In 1860 British and French forces in the [[Second Opium War]] captured Beijing and sacked the [[Old Summer Palace|Summer Palace]]. The shaken court attempted to modernize its military and industrial institutions by buying European technology. This [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] established [[shipyard]]s (notably the [[Jiangnan Shipyard#Kiangnan Arsenal|Jiangnan Arsenal]] and the [[Foochow Arsenal]]) and bought modern guns and battleships in Europe. The Qing navy became the largest in East Asia. But organization and logistics were inadequate, officer training was deficient, and corruption widespread. The [[Beiyang Fleet]] was virtually destroyed and the modernized ground forces defeated in the 1895 [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. The Qing created a [[New Army]], but could not prevent the [[Eight Nation Alliance]] from invading China to put down the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer Uprising]] in 1900.  The [[Wuchang Uprising|revolt]] of a New Army corps in 1911 led to the [[Xinhai Revolution|fall of the dynasty]].\n\n==Eight Banners system==\n{{main|Eight Banners}}\n[[File:The Qianlong Emperor\u2019s Southern Inspection Tour.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Qianlong Emperor's Southern Inspection Tour, Scroll Twelve: Return to the Palace (detail), 1764\u20131770, by [[Xu Yang (Qing dynasty)|Xu Yang]].]]\n\nOne of the keys to [[Nurhaci]]'s successful unification of [[Manchu people|Jurchen tribes]] and his challenge to the [[Ming dynasty]] in the early seventeenth century was the formation of the [[Eight Banners]], a uniquely [[Manchu people|Manchu]] institution that was militarily efficient, but also played economic, social, and political roles.<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2001}}, pp. 40 (uniquely Manchu) and 57 (role on Nurhaci's success).</ref> As early as 1601 and possibly a few years earlier, Nurhaci made his soldiers and their families register into permanent companies known as ''niru'', the same name as the smaller hunting parties in which Jurchen men traditionally joined to practice military operations and wage war.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=58}} Sometime before 1607, these companies were themselves grouped into larger units called ''g\u016bsa'', or \"banners,\" differentiated by colors: yellow, white, red, and blue.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=59}} In 1615 a red border was added to each flag (except for the red banner, to which a white border was added) to form a total of eight banners that Jurchen troops carried into battles.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=59}} The banner system allowed Nurhaci's new state to absorb defeated Jurchen tribes simply by adding companies; this integration in turn helped to reorganize [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] society beyond petty clan affiliations.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|p=34}}\n\nAs Qing power expanded north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], the Banner system kept expanding too. Soon after defeating the [[Chahar Mongols]] with the help of other Mongol tribes in 1635, Nurhaci's son and successor [[Hong Taiji]] incorporated his new Mongol subjects and allies into the Mongol Eight Banners, which ran parallel to the original Manchu banners.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|p=58}} Hong Taiji was more prudent in integrating Chinese troops.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=75}} In 1629, he first created a \"Chinese army\" ([[Manchu language|Manchu]]: {{MongolUnicode|\u1828\u1873\u1874\u1820\u1828<br>\u1834\u1823\u1823\u1865\u1820}} ''nikan cooha''; {{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u6f22\u8ecd}}|p=H\u00e0nj\u016bn}}) of about 3000 men.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|p=57}} In 1631 these Chinese units absorbed men that could build and operate European-style cannon, and were therefore renamed \"Heavy Troops\" ([[Manchu language|M.]]: ''ujen cooha''; {{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u91cd\u8ecd}}|p=Zh\u00f2ngj\u016bn}}).{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|pp=57\u201358}} By 1633 they counted about 20 companies and 4,500 men fighting under black standards.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|pp=57\u201358}} These Chinese companies were grouped into two banners in 1637, four in 1639, and finally eight banners in 1642.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|p=58}} These \"Hanjun\" banners are known as the \"Chinese\" or \"Chinese-martial\" banners.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=58}} (\"Han-ch\u00fcn [Hanjun] banners\"); {{harvnb|Elliott|2001|p=74}} (\"Chinese Eight Banners\"); {{harvnb|Crossley|1997|p=204}} (\"Chinese-martial banners\").</ref>\n\nSelect groups of Han Chinese bannermen were mass transferred into Manchu Banners by the Qing, changing their ethnicity from Han Chinese to Manchu.

Manchu families adopted Han Chinese sons from families of bondservant [[Booi Aha]] (baoyi) origin and they served in Manchu company registers as detached household Manchus and the Qing imperial court found this out in 1729. Manchu Bannermen who needed money helped falsify registration for Han Chinese servants being adopted into the Manchu banners and Manchu families who lacked sons were allowed to adopt their servant's sons or servants themselves.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elliott |first1=Mark C. |title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China |date=2001 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0804746842 |page=324 |edition=illustrated, reprint |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&pg=PA324}}</ref> The Manchu families were paid to adopt Han Chinese sons from bondservant families by those families.

Han Chinese foster-son and separate register bannermen made up 800 out of 1,600 soldiers of the Mongol Banners and Manchu Banners of Hangzhou in 1740 which was nearly 50%. Han Chinese foster-son made up 220 out of 1,600 unsalaried troops at Jingzhou in 1747 and an assortment of Han Chinese separate-register, Mongol, and Manchu bannermen were the remainder. Han Chinese secondary status bannermen made up 180 of 3,600 troop households in Ningxia while Han Chinese separate registers made up 380 out of 2,700 Manchu soldiers in Liangzhou. The result of these Han Chinese fake Manchus taking up military positions resulted in many legitimate Manchus being deprived of their rightful positions as soldiers in the Banner armies, resulting in the real Manchus unable to receive their salaries as Han Chinese infiltrators in the banners stole their social and economic status and rights. These Han Chinese infiltrators were said to be good military troops and their skills at marching and archery were up to par so that the Zhapu lieutenant general couldn't differentiate them from true Manchus in terms of military skills.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elliott |first1=Mark C. |title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China |date=2001 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0804746842 |page=325 |edition=illustrated, reprint |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&pg=PA325}}</ref> Manchu Banners contained a lot of \"false Manchus\" who were from Han Chinese civilian families but were adopted by Manchu bannermen after the Yongzheng reign. The  Jingkou and Jiangning Mongol banners and Manchu Banners had 1,795 adopted Han Chinese and the Beijing Mongol Banners and Manchu Banners had 2,400 adopted Han Chinese in statistics taken from the 1821 census.

In Fujian, it was traitors Northern Han Bannermen who were the ones carrying out the fighting for the Qing and this disproved the entirely irrelevant claim that alleged fear of the water on part of the Manchus had to do with the coastal evacuation and seaban.<ref>[Sealords live in vain : Fujian and the making of a maritime frontier in seventeenth-century China p. 198.</ref> A poem shows northern Han bannermen referring to the [[Tanka boat people|Tanka people]] living at the coast and rivers of Southern Fujian as \"barbarians\".<ref>[Sealords live in vain : Fujian and the making of a maritime frontier in seventeenth-century China p. 206.</ref>\n\nThe banners in their order of precedence were as follows: yellow, bordered yellow, white, red, bordered white, bordered red, blue, and bordered blue.

The remaining Banners were known as the \"Lower Five Banners\" ({{zh|p=xi\u00e0 w\u01d4 q\u00ed|c=\u4e0b\u4e94\u65d7}}) and were commanded by hereditary Manchu princes descended from Nurhachi's immediate family, known informally as the \"[[Iron cap prince|Iron Cap Princes]].\" In Nurhaci's era and the early Hong Taiij era, these princes formed the [[Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers|ruling council of the Manchu nation]] as well as high command of the army.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n;Upper Three Banners\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Plain Yellow Banner.svg|[[Plain Yellow Banner]]\n|Bordered Yellow Banner.svg|[[Bordered Yellow Banner]]\n|Plain White Banner.svg|[[Plain White Banner]]\n}}\n;Lower Five Banners\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Plain Red Banner.svg|[[Plain Red Banner]]\n|Bordered White Banner.svg|[[Bordered White Banner]]\n|Bordered Red Banner.svg|[[Bordered Red Banner]]\n|Plain Blue Banner.svg|[[Plain Blue Banner]]\n|Bordered Blue Banner.svg|[[Bordered Blue Banner]]\n}}\n\n==[[Green Standard Army]]==\n{{main|Green Standard Army}}\n[[File:A Chinese soldier bearing weapons on his back, riding a horse Wellcome V0037646.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A Chinese Green Standard Army soldier]]\nAfter capturing [[Beijing]] in 1644 and as the Qing rapidly gained control of large tracts of former Ming territory, the relatively small Banner armies were further augmented by remnants of Ming forces that surrendered to the Qing. Some of these troops were first accepted into the Chinese-martial banners, but after 1645 they were integrated a new military unit called the [[Green Standard Army]], named after the color of their battle pennants.<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2001|p=480}} (integration of surrendered Ming troops into Green Standards); {{harvnb|Crossley|1999|pp=118\u201319}} (Chinese troops integrated into the Chinese banners in 1644; access restricted starting in 1645).</ref> The Qing created Chinese armies in the regions it conquered.

In addition, regional governors from provincial down to village level maintained their own irregular local militias for police duties and disaster relief. These militias were usually granted small annual stipends from regional coffers for part-time service obligations.\n\nThe Qing divided the command structure of the Green Standard Army in the provinces between the high-ranking officers and low ranking officers, the best and strongest unit was under the control of the highest-ranking officers but at the same time, these units were outnumbered by other units divided between individual lower ranking officers so none of them could revolt on their own against the Qing because they did not control the entire armies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chu |first1=Wen Djang |title=The Moslem rebellion in northwest China, 1862 -

Only under special circumstances sanctioned by imperial edict were social movements between banners permitted. In contrast, the [[Green Standard Army]] was originally intended to be a professional force.\n\nAfter defeating the remnants of the Ming forces, the Manchu Banner Army of approximately 200,000 strong at the time was evenly divided; half was designated the Forbidden Eight Banner Army ({{zh|c=\u7981\u65c5\u516b\u65d7|p=j\u00ecnl\u01da b\u0101q\u00ed}}) and was stationed in Beijing. It served both as the capital's garrison and the Qing government's main strike force. The remainder of the Banner troops was distributed to guard key cities in China. These were known as the Territorial Eight Banner Army ({{zh|t=\u99d0\u9632\u516b\u65d7|s=\u9a7b\u9632\u516b\u65d7|p=zh\u00f9f\u00e1ng b\u0101q\u00ed}}). The Manchu court, keenly aware its own minority status, reinforced a strict policy of racial segregation between the Manchus and Mongols from Han Chinese for fear of being sinicized by the latter. This policy applied directly to the Banner garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities they were stationed in. In cities where there were limitation of space such as in [[Qingzhou]], a new fortified town would be purposely erected to house the Banner garrison and their families. Beijing being the imperial seat, the regent [[Dorgon]] had the entire Chinese population forcibly relocated to the southern suburbs which became known as the \"Outer Citadel\" ({{zh|c=\u5916\u57ce|p=w\u00e0ich\u00e9ng}}). The northern walled city called \"Inner Citadel\" ({{zh|c=\u5167\u57ce|p=n\u00e8ich\u00e9ng}}) was portioned out to the remaining Manchu Eight Banners, each responsible for guarding a section of the Inner Citadel surrounding the [[Forbidden City]] palace complex.{{efn|{{zh|t=\u7d2b\u7981\u57ce|p=z\u01d0j\u00ecnch\u00e9ng}}; [[Manchu language|Ma]]: [[File:Dabk\u016bri dorgi hoton.png|40px]] ''Dabk\u016bri dorgi hoton''}} {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nMilitary training was undertaken by martial artists in the Qing armed forces.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ba Gua Zhang An Historical Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FT0vjrmHeFcC&pg=PA128&dq=qing+army+martial+arts+instructors&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJzaPXv9vOAhXC6x4KHctVCQ4Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=qing%20army%20martial%20arts%20instructors&f=false|year=2010|publisher=Ben Hill Bey|isbn=978-0-557-46679-5|pages=128\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAssociations for martial arts were joined by Manchu Bannermen in Beijing.<ref name=\"Crossley1990\">{{cite book|author=Pamela Kyle Crossley|title=Orphan Warriors: Three Manchu Generations and the End of the Qing World|url=https://archive.org/details/orphanwarriorsth00cros_0|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00877-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/orphanwarriorsth00cros_0/page/174 174]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA hall for martial arts was where the military careers of Muslim Generals [[Ma Fulu]] and [[Ma Fuxiang]] started in Hezhou.<ref name=\"Lipman1998\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8Nzux7z6KAC&pg=PA168&dq=ma+fuxiang|date=1 July 1998|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-80055-4|pages=168\u2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.360doc.com/content/12/0715/19/8500692_224390692.shtml</ref>\n\nSoldiers and officers in the Qing army were taught by the Muslim martial arts instructor [[Wang Zi-Ping]] before he fought in the Boxer rebellion.<ref>http://m.zwbk.org/lemma/457905 http://www.china.com.cn/guoqing/2016-01/27/content_37676554_6.htm  http://culture.163.com/06/0222/13/2AIPRMAB00281MU3.html  http://m.qulishi.com/news/201507/34764_5.html {{cite web |url=http://www.wanhuajing.com/d293423 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611090711/http://www.wanhuajing.com/d293423 |archivedate=2016-06-11 }}</ref> Another teacher of martial arts in the military in Beijing was Wang Xiang Zhai.<ref name=\"Tang2015\">{{cite book|author=C S Tang|title=The Complete Book of Yiquan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FppBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA33&dq=qing+army+martial+arts+instructors&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJzaPXv9vOAhXC6x4KHctVCQ4Q6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=qing%20army%20martial%20arts%20instructors&f=false|date=21 March 2015|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-0-85701-172-5|pages=33\u2013}}</ref> The trainers in martial arts in the army had to deal with a massive assortment of different armaments such as spears and swords.<ref name=\"GreenSvinth2010\">{{cite book|author1=Thomas A.

River and coastal naval defence was the responsibility of the waterborne units of the [[Green Standard Army]], which were based at Jingkou (now [[Zhenjiang]]) and [[Hangzhou]].\n\nIn 1661, a naval unit was established at [[Jilin]] to defend against Russian incursions into [[Manchuria]]. Naval units were also added to various [[Eight Banners|Banner]] garrisons subsequently, referred to collectively as the \"Eight Banners Navy\". In 1677, the Qing court re-established the Fujian Fleet in order to combat the Ming-loyalist [[Kingdom of Tungning]] based on [[Taiwan]]. This conflict culminated in the Qing victory the [[Battle of Penghu]] in 1683 and the surrender of the Tungning shortly after the battle.\n\nThe Qing, like the Ming, placed considerable importance on the building of a strong navy. However unlike the Europeans, they did not perceive the need to dominate the open ocean and hence monopolise trade, and instead focused on defending, by means of patrols, their inner sea space. The Qing demarcated and controlled their inner seas in the same manner as land territory.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Po  |first=Chung-yam |date=28 June 2013 |publisher=Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg |title=Conceptualizing the Blue Frontier: The Great Qing and the Maritime World in the Long Eighteenth Century |type= |chapter= |pages=85-95 |docket= |oclc= |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/18877/1/PhD_Dissertation_CyPO.pdf |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Kangxi Emperor and his successors established a four-zone sea defence system consisting of the Bohai Gulf (Dengzhou fleet, Jiaozhou fleet, L\u00fcshun fleet and Tianjin/Daigu fleet), Jiangsu-Zhejiang coast (Jiangnan fleet and Zhejiang fleet), Taiwan Strait (Fujian fleet) and the Guangdong coast (Guangdong Governor's fleet and Guangdong regular fleet).

As a result, after a century of peace and lack of field training the Manchu Banner troops had deteriorated greatly in their combat worthiness. Secondly, before the conquest, the Manchu banner was a \"citizen\" army, and its members were Manchu farmers and herders obligated to provide military service to the state at times of war. The Qing government's decision to turn the banner troops into a professional force whose every welfare and need was met by state coffers brought wealth, and with it corruption, to the rank and file of the Manchu Banners and hastened its decline as a fighting force. Bannermen frequently went into debt as a result of drinking, gambling, and spending time at theaters and brothels, leading to a general ban on theater-going within the Eight Banners.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|pp=284-290}}\n\n[[File:\u0421\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0415\u0448\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0435, 1759, \u0443\u0439\u0433\u0443\u0440\u044b-\u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0446\u044bvs\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0447\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043e-\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b-\u0445\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0446\u044b.jpg|thumb|left|230px|A battle between Qing troops and the Uyghur Khojas near Lake Eshilkul in 1759.]]\n\nAt the same time, a similar decline was occurring in the [[Green Standard Army]]. During peacetime, soldiering became merely a source of supplementary income. Soldiers and commanders alike neglected training in pursuit of their own economic gains. Corruption was rampant as regional unit commanders submitted pay and supply requisitions based on exaggerated head counts to the quartermaster department and pocketed the difference. When Green Standard troops proved unable to fire their guns accurately while suppressing a rebellion of [[White Lotus]] followers under [[Wang Lun]] in 1774, the governor-general blamed the failure on enemy magic, prompting a furious reply from the Qianlong Emperor in which he described incompetence with firearms as a \"common and pervasive disease\" of the [[Green Standard Army]], whose gunners were full of excuses.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|pp=63-65}}\n\nQing emperors attempted to reverse the decline of the military through a variety of means.

The rebels massacred the entire Manchu garrison and their families in the city and made it their capital.{{sfn|Crossley|1990|pp=126\u201327}} Shortly thereafter, a [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Taiping]] expeditionary force penetrated as far north as the suburbs of [[Tianjin]] in what was considered the imperial heartlands. In desperation the Qing court ordered a Chinese mandarin, [[Zeng Guofan]], to organize regional ({{zh|p=tu\u00e1ny\u01d2ng|t=\u5718\u52c7|s=\u56e2\u52c7}}) and village ({{zh|p=xi\u0101ngy\u01d2ng|t=\u9109\u52c7|s=\u4e61\u52c7}}) [[militia]]s into a standing army called [[tuanlian]] to contain the rebellion. Zeng Guofan's strategy was to rely on local gentries to raise a new type of military organization from those provinces that the Taiping rebels directly threatened. This new force became known as the [[Xiang Army]], named after the [[Hunan]] region where it was raised. The Xiang Army was a hybrid of local militia and a standing army. It was given professional training, but was paid for out of regional coffers and funds its commanders \u2014 mostly members of the Chinese gentry \u2014 could muster. The Xiang Army and its successor, the [[Huai Army]], created by Zeng Guofan's colleague and student [[Li Hongzhang]], were collectively called the \"[[Yong Ying]]\" (Brave Camp).{{sfn|Liu|Smith|1980|pp=202\u201310}}\n\nBefore forming and commanding the Xiang Army, Zeng Guofan had no military experience. Being a classically educated Mandarin, his blueprint for the Xiang Army was taken from a historical source \u2014 the Ming general [[Qi Jiguang]], who, because of the weakness of regular Ming troops, had decided to form his own \"private\" army to repel raiding [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] in the mid-16th century. Qi Jiguang's doctrine was based on Neo-Confucian ideas of binding troops' loyalty to their immediate superiors and also to the regions in which they were raised. This initially gave the troops an excellent ''[[esprit de corps]]''. Qi Jiguang's army was an ad hoc solution to the specific problem of combating pirates, as was Zeng Guofan's original intention for the Xiang Army, which was raise to eradicate the Taiping rebels. However, circumstances led to the Yongying system becoming a permanent institution within the Qing military, which in the long run created problems of its own for the beleaguered central government.\n[[File:Great Rear Attack by Our Second Army at Weihaiwei.jpg|thumb|left|In 1894\u20131895, fighting over influence in Korea, Japanese troops defeated Qing forces.]]\nFirst, the Yongying system signaled the end of Manchu dominance in Qing military establishment. Although the Banners and Green Standard armies lingered on as parasites depleting resources, henceforth the Yongying corps became the Qing government's de facto first-line troops. Secondly the Yongying corps were financed through provincial coffers and were led by regional commanders. This devolution of power weakened the central government's grip on the whole country, a weakness further aggravated by foreign powers vying to carve up autonomous colonial territories in different parts of the Qing Empire in the later half of the 19th century. Despite these serious negative effects, the measure was deemed necessary as tax revenue from provinces occupied and threatened by rebels had ceased to reach the cash-strapped central government. Finally, the nature of Yongying command structure fostered nepotism and cronyism amongst its commanders, whom, as they ascended the bureaucratic ranks laid the seeds to Qing's eventual demise and the outbreak of regional warlordism in China during the first half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Liu|Smith|1980|pp=202\u201310}}\n\nBy the late 19th century, China was fast descending into a semi-colonial state. Even the most conservative elements within the Qing court could no longer ignore China's military weakness in contrast to the foreign \"barbarians\" literally beating down its gates. In 1860, during the [[Second Opium War]], the capital Beijing was captured and the Summer Palace sacked by a relatively small Anglo-French coalition force numbering 25,000.\n\n==Self-Strengthening and military modernization==\n{{Main|Self-Strengthening Movement}}\n\n[[File:\u6821\u9605\u9646\u519b.jpg|thumb|Several notable figures such as [[Zaitao]], [[Zaixun, Prince Rui|Zaixun]], [[Xu Shichang]], [[Sheng Xuanhuai]], [[Zaizhen]], and [[Yinchang]]]]\nAlthough the Chinese invented gunpowder, and firearms had been in continual use in Chinese warfare since as far back as the [[Song dynasty]], the advent of modern weaponry resulting from the European [[Industrial Revolution]] had rendered China's traditionally trained and equipped army and navy obsolete.\n\nAfter the humiliating capture of Beijing and the sack of the Summer Palace in 1860, officials like Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and the Manchu [[Wenxiang]] made efforts to acquire advanced western weapons and copy western military organization.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=156}} Special brigades of Chinese soldiers equipped with modern rifles and commanded by foreign officers (one example is the [[Ever Victorious Army]] commanded by [[Frederick Townsend Ward]] and later [[Charles George Gordon]]) helped Zeng and Li to defeat the Taiping rebels.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=156}} Li Hongzhang's [[Huai Army]] also acquired western rifles and incorporated some western drills.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=156}} Meanwhile, in Beijing, Prince Gong and Wenxiang created an elite army, the \"[[Peking Field Force]]\", which was armed with Russian rifles and French cannon and drilled by British officers.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|pp=156\u201357}} When this force of 2,500 bannermen defeated a bandit army more than ten times more numerous, they seemed to prove Wenxiang's point that a small but well-trained and well-equipped banner army would be sufficient to defend the capital in the future.{{sfn|Crossley|1990|p=145}}\n\nOne major emphasis of the reforms was to improve the weaponry of Chinese armies. In order to produce modern rifles, artillery, and ammunition, Zeng Guofan created an [[arsenal]] in Suzhou, which was moved to Shanghai and expanded into the [[Jiangnan Arsenal#Kiangnan Arsenal|Jiangnan Arsenal]].{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=157}} In 1866 the sophisticated [[Fuzhou Shipyard]] was created under the leadership of [[Zuo Zongtang]], its focus being the building of modern warships for coastal defense.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=157}} From 1867 to 1874 it built fifteen new ships.{{sfn|Wright|1957|p=212}} Other arsenals were created in Nanjing, Tianjin (it served as a major source of ammunition for northern Chinese armies in the 1870s and 1880s), [[Lanzhou]] (to support Zuo Zongtang's quelling of [[Dungan revolt (1862\u201377)|a large Muslim uprising]] in the northwest), Sichuan, and Shandong.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=157}} [[Prosper Giquel]], a French naval officer who served as adviser at the Fuzhou Shipyard, wrote in 1872 that China was quickly becoming a formidable rival to western powers.{{sfn|Wright|1957|p=220}}\n\nThanks to these reforms and improvements, the Qing government gained a major advantage over domestic rebels.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=158}} After vanquishing the Taiping in 1864, the newly equipped armies defeated the [[Nian Rebellion]] in 1868, the [[Miao Rebellion (1854\u201373)|Guizhou Miao]] in 1873, the [[Panthay Rebellion]] in Yunnan in 1873, and in 1877 the massive [[Dungan revolt (1862\u201377)|Muslim uprising]] that had engulfed Xinjiang since 1862.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=158}} In addition to quelling domestic revolts, the Qing also fought foreign powers with relative success.

The founding emperors personally organized and led the armies, and the continued cultural and political legitimacy of the dynasty depended on the ability to defend the country from invasion and expand its territory. Therefore, military institutions, leadership, and finance were fundamental to the dynasty's initial success and ultimate decay. The early military system centered on the [[Eight Banners]], a hybrid institution that also played social, economic, and political roles.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=40}} The Banner system was developed on an informal basis as early as 1601, and formally established in 1615 by [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] leader [[Nurhaci]] (1559\u20131626), the retrospectively recognized founder of the Qing. His son [[Hong Taiji]] (1592\u20131643), who renamed the Jurchens \"[[Manchu people|Manchus]],\" created eight Mongol banners to mirror the Manchu ones and eight \"Han-martial\" ({{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u6f22\u8ecd}}|p=H\u00e0nj\u016bn|labels=no}}) banners manned by Chinese who surrendered to the Qing before the full-fledged [[Qing conquest of Ming|conquest of China proper]] began in 1644. After 1644, the Ming Chinese troops that surrendered to the Qing were integrated into the [[Green Standard Army]], a corps that eventually outnumbered the Banners by three to one.\n\nThe use of gunpowder during the [[High Qing]] can compete with the three [[gunpowder empires]] in western Asia.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA95#v=onepage&q&f=false Millward 2007], p. 95.</ref> Manchu imperial princes led the Banners in defeating the Ming armies, but after lasting peace was established starting in 1683, both the Banners and the Green Standard Armies started to lose their efficiency. Garrisoned in cities, soldiers had few occasions to drill. The Qing nonetheless used superior armament and logistics to expand deeply into Central Asia, defeat the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Mongols]] in 1759, and complete their conquest of [[Xinjiang]]. Despite the dynasty's pride in the [[Ten Great Campaigns]] of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735\u20131796), the Qing armies became largely ineffective by the end of the 18th century. It took almost ten years and huge financial waste to defeat the badly equipped [[White Lotus Rebellion]] (1795\u20131804), partly by legitimizing militias led by local Han Chinese elites. The [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850\u20131864), a large-scale uprising that started in southern China, marched within miles of Beijing in 1853. The Qing court was forced to let its Han Chinese [[Zongdu|governors-general]], first led by [[Zeng Guofan]], raise regional armies. This new type of army and leadership defeated the rebels but signaled the end of Manchu dominance of the military establishment.\n\nThe military technology of the European [[Industrial Revolution]] made China's armament and military rapidly obsolete. In 1860 British and French forces in the [[Second Opium War]] captured Beijing and sacked the [[Old Summer Palace|Summer Palace]]. The shaken court attempted to modernize its military and industrial institutions by buying European technology. This [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] established [[shipyard]]s (notably the [[Jiangnan Shipyard#Kiangnan Arsenal|Jiangnan Arsenal]] and the [[Foochow Arsenal]]) and bought modern guns and battleships in Europe. The Qing navy became the largest in East Asia. But organization and logistics were inadequate, officer training was deficient, and corruption widespread. The [[Beiyang Fleet]] was virtually destroyed and the modernized ground forces defeated in the 1895 [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. The Qing created a [[New Army]], but could not prevent the [[Eight Nation Alliance]] from invading China to put down the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer Uprising]] in 1900.  The [[Wuchang Uprising|revolt]] of a New Army corps in 1911 led to the [[Xinhai Revolution|fall of the dynasty]].\n\n==Eight Banners system==\n{{main|Eight Banners}}\n[[File:The Qianlong Emperor\u2019s Southern Inspection Tour.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Qianlong Emperor's Southern Inspection Tour, Scroll Twelve: Return to the Palace (detail), 1764\u20141770, by [[Xu Yang (Qing dynasty)|Xu Yang]].]]\n\nOne of the keys to [[Nurhaci]]'s successful unification of [[Manchu people|Jurchen tribes]] and his challenge to the [[Ming dynasty]] in the early seventeenth century was the formation of the [[Eight Banners]], a uniquely [[Manchu people|Manchu]] institution that was militarily efficient, but also played economic, social, and political roles.<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2001}}, pp. 40 (uniquely Manchu) and 57 (role on Nurhaci's success).</ref> As early as 1601 and possibly a few years earlier, Nurhaci made his soldiers and their families register into permanent companies known as ''niru'', the same name as the smaller hunting parties in which Jurchen men traditionally joined to practice military operations and wage war.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=58}} Sometime before 1607, these companies were themselves grouped into larger units called ''g\u016bsa'', or \"banners,\" differentiated by colors: yellow, white, red, and blue.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=59}} In 1615 a red border was added to each flag (except for the red banner, to which a white border was added) to form a total of eight banners that Jurchen troops carried into battles.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=59}} The banner system allowed Nurhaci's new state to absorb defeated Jurchen tribes simply by adding companies; this integration in turn helped to reorganize [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] society beyond petty clan affiliations.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|p=34}}\n\nAs Qing power expanded north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], the Banner system kept expanding too. Soon after defeating the [[Chahar Mongols]] with the help of other Mongol tribes in 1635, Nurhaci's son and successor [[Hong Taiji]] incorporated his new Mongol subjects and allies into the Mongol Eight Banners, which ran parallel to the original Manchu banners.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|p=58}} Hong Taiji was more prudent in integrating Chinese troops.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|p=75}} In 1629, he first created a \"Chinese army\" ([[Manchu language|Manchu]]: {{MongolUnicode|\u1828\u1873\u1874\u1820\u1828<br>\u1834\u1823\u1823\u1865\u1820}} ''nikan cooha''; {{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u6f22\u8ecd}}|p=H\u00e0nj\u016bn}}) of about 3000 men.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|p=57}} In 1631 these Chinese units absorbed men that could build and operate European-style cannon, and were therefore renamed \"Heavy Troops\" ([[Manchu language|M.]]: ''ujen cooha''; {{Zh|c=|s=|t={{linktext|\u91cd\u8ecd}}|p=Zh\u00f2ngj\u016bn}}).{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|pp=57\u201358}} By 1633 they counted about 20 companies and 4,500 men fighting under black standards.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|pp=57\u201358}} These Chinese companies were grouped into two banners in 1637, four in 1639, and finally eight banners in 1642.{{sfn|Roth Li|2002|p=58}} These \"Hanjun\" banners are known as the \"Chinese\" or \"Chinese-martial\" banners.<ref>{{harvnb|Roth Li|2002|p=58}} (\"Han-ch\u00fcn [Hanjun] banners\"); {{harvnb|Elliott|2001|p=74}} (\"Chinese Eight Banners\"); {{harvnb|Crossley|1997|p=204}} (\"Chinese-martial banners\").</ref>\n\nSelect groups of Han Chinese bannermen were mass transferred into Manchu Banners by the Qing, changing their ethnicity from Han Chinese to Manchu.

Han Chinese foster-son and separate register bannermen made up 800 out of 1,600 soldiers of the Mongol Banners and Manchu Banners of Hangzhou in 1740 which was nearly 50%. Han Chinese foster-son made up 220 out of 1,600 unsalaried troops at Jingzhou in 1747 and an assortment of Han Chinese separate-register, Mongol, and Manchu bannermen were the remainder. Han Chinese secondary status bannermen made up 180 of 3,600 troop households in Ningxia while Han Chinese separate registers made up 380 out of 2,700 Manchu soldiers in Liangzhou. The result of these Han Chinese fake Manchus taking up military positions resulted in many legitimate Manchus being deprived of their rightful positions as soldiers in the Banner armies, resulting in the real Manchus unable to receive their salaries as Han Chinese infiltrators in the banners stole their social and economic status and rights.

In addition, regional governors from provincial down to village level maintained their own irregular local militias for police duties and disaster relief. These militias were usually granted small annual stipends from regional coffers for part-time service obligations.\n\nThe Qing divided the command structure of the Green Standard Army in the provinces between the high ranking officers and low ranking officers, the best and strongest unit was under the control of the highest ranking officers but at the same time, these units were outnumbered by other units divided between individual lower ranking officers so none of them could revolt on their own against the Qing because they did not control the entire armies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chu |first1=Wen Djang |title=The Moslem rebellion in northwest China, 1862 -

Only under special circumstances sanctioned by imperial edict were social movements between banners permitted. In contrast, the [[Green Standard Army]] was originally intended to be a professional force.\n\nAfter defeating the remnants of the Ming forces, the Manchu Banner Army of approximately 200,000 strong at the time was evenly divided; half was designated the Forbidden Eight Banner Army ({{zh|c=\u7981\u65c5\u516b\u65d7|p=j\u00ecnl\u01da b\u0101q\u00ed}}) and was stationed in Beijing. It served both as the capital's garrison and the Qing government's main strike force. The remainder of the Banner troops was distributed to guard key cities in China. These were known as the Territorial Eight Banner Army ({{zh|t=\u99d0\u9632\u516b\u65d7|s=\u9a7b\u9632\u516b\u65d7|p=zh\u00f9f\u00e1ng b\u0101q\u00ed}}). The Manchu court, keenly aware its own minority status, reinforced a strict policy of racial segregation between the Manchus and Mongols from Han Chinese for fear of being sinicized by the latter. This policy applied directly to the Banner garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities they were stationed in. In cities where there were limitation of space such as in [[Qingzhou]], a new fortified town would be purposely erected to house the Banner garrison and their families. Beijing being the imperial seat, the regent [[Dorgon]] had the entire Chinese population forcibly relocated to the southern suburbs which became known as the \"Outer Citadel\" ({{zh|c=\u5916\u57ce|p=w\u00e0ich\u00e9ng}}). The northern walled city called \"Inner Citadel\" ({{zh|c=\u5167\u57ce|p=n\u00e8ich\u00e9ng}}) was portioned out to the remaining Manchu Eight Banners, each responsible for guarding a section of the Inner Citadel surrounding the [[Forbidden City]] palace complex.{{efn|{{zh|t=\u7d2b\u7981\u57ce|p=z\u01d0j\u00ecnch\u00e9ng}}; [[Manchu language|Ma]]: [[File:Dabk\u016bri dorgi hoton.png|40px]] ''Dabk\u016bri dorgi hoton''}} {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nMilitary training was undertaken by martial artists in the Qing armed forces.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ba Gua Zhang An Historical Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FT0vjrmHeFcC&pg=PA128&dq=qing+army+martial+arts+instructors&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJzaPXv9vOAhXC6x4KHctVCQ4Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=qing%20army%20martial%20arts%20instructors&f=false|year=2010|publisher=Ben Hill Bey|isbn=978-0-557-46679-5|pages=128\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAssociations for martial arts were joined by Manchu Bannermen in Beijing.<ref name=\"Crossley1990\">{{cite book|author=Pamela Kyle Crossley|title=Orphan Warriors: Three Manchu Generations and the End of the Qing World|url=https://archive.org/details/orphanwarriorsth00cros_0|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00877-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/orphanwarriorsth00cros_0/page/174 174]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA hall for martial arts was where the military careers of Muslim Generals [[Ma Fulu]] and [[Ma Fuxiang]] started in Hezhou.<ref name=\"Lipman1998\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8Nzux7z6KAC&pg=PA168&dq=ma+fuxiang|date=1 July 1998|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-80055-4|pages=168\u2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.360doc.com/content/12/0715/19/8500692_224390692.shtml</ref>\n\nSoldiers and officers in the Qing army were taught by the Muslim martial arts instructor [[Wang Zi-Ping]] before he fought in the Boxer rebellion.<ref>http://m.zwbk.org/lemma/457905 http://www.china.com.cn/guoqing/2016-01/27/content_37676554_6.htm  http://culture.163.com/06/0222/13/2AIPRMAB00281MU3.html  http://m.qulishi.com/news/201507/34764_5.html {{cite web |url=http://www.wanhuajing.com/d293423 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611090711/http://www.wanhuajing.com/d293423 |archivedate=2016-06-11 }}</ref> Another teacher of martial arts in the military in Beijing was Wang Xiang Zhai.<ref name=\"Tang2015\">{{cite book|author=C S Tang|title=The Complete Book of Yiquan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FppBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA33&dq=qing+army+martial+arts+instructors&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJzaPXv9vOAhXC6x4KHctVCQ4Q6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=qing%20army%20martial%20arts%20instructors&f=false|date=21 March 2015|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-0-85701-172-5|pages=33\u2013}}</ref> The trainers in martial arts in the army had to deal with a massive assortment of different armaments such as spears and swords.<ref name=\"GreenSvinth2010\">{{cite book|author1=Thomas A.

River and coastal naval defence was the responsibility of the waterborne units of the [[Green Standard Army]], which were based at Jingkou (now [[Zhenjiang]]) and [[Hangzhou]].\n\nIn 1661, a naval unit was established at [[Jilin]] to defend against Russian incursions into [[Manchuria]]. Naval units were also added to various [[Eight Banners|Banner]] garrisons subsequently, referred to collectively as the \"Eight Banners Navy\". In 1677, the Qing court re-established the Fujian Fleet in order to combat the Ming-loyalist [[Kingdom of Tungning]] based on [[Taiwan]]. This conflict culminated in the Qing victory the [[Battle of Penghu]] in 1683 and the surrender of the Tungning shortly after the battle.\n\nThe Qing, like the Ming, placed considerable importance on the building of a strong navy. However unlike the Europeans, they did not perceive the need to dominate the open ocean and hence monopolise trade, and instead focused on defending, by means of patrols, their inner sea space. The Qing demarcated and controlled their inner seas in the same manner as land territory.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Po  |first=Chung-yam |date=28 June 2013 |publisher=Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg |title=Conceptualizing the Blue Frontier: The Great Qing and the Maritime World in the Long Eighteenth Century |type= |chapter= |pages=85-95 |docket= |oclc= |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/18877/1/PhD_Dissertation_CyPO.pdf |access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Kangxi Emperor and his successors established a four-zone sea defence system consisting of the Bohai Gulf (Dengzhou fleet, Jiaozhou fleet, L\u00fcshun fleet and Tianjin/Daigu fleet), Jiangsu-Zhejiang coast (Jiangnan fleet and Zhejiang fleet), Taiwan Strait (Fujian fleet) and the Guangdong coast (Guangdong Governor's fleet and Guangdong regular fleet).

As a result, after a century of peace and lack of field training the Manchu Banner troops had deteriorated greatly in their combat worthiness. Secondly, before the conquest, the Manchu banner was a \"citizen\" army, and its members were Manchu farmers and herders obligated to provide military service to the state at times of war. The Qing government's decision to turn the banner troops into a professional force whose every welfare and need was met by state coffers brought wealth, and with it corruption, to the rank and file of the Manchu Banners and hastened its decline as a fighting force. Bannermen frequently went into debt as a result of drinking, gambling, and spending time at theaters and brothels, leading to a general ban on theater-going within the Eight Banners.{{sfn|Elliott|2001|pp=284-290}}\n\n[[File:\u0421\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0415\u0448\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0435, 1759, \u0443\u0439\u0433\u0443\u0440\u044b-\u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0446\u044bvs\u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0447\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043e-\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b-\u0445\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0446\u044b.jpg|thumb|left|230px|A battle between Qing troops and the Uyghur Khojas near Lake Eshilkul in 1759.]]\n\nAt the same time, a similar decline was occurring in the [[Green Standard Army]]. During peacetime, soldiering became merely a source of supplementary income. Soldiers and commanders alike neglected training in pursuit of their own economic gains. Corruption was rampant as regional unit commanders submitted pay and supply requisitions based on exaggerated head counts to the quartermaster department and pocketed the difference. When Green Standard troops proved unable to fire their guns accurately while suppressing a rebellion of [[White Lotus]] followers under [[Wang Lun]] in 1774, the governor-general blamed the failure on enemy magic, prompting a furious reply from the Qianlong Emperor in which he described incompetence with firearms as a \"common and pervasive disease\" of the [[Green Standard Army]], whose gunners were full of excuses.{{sfn|Waley-Cohen|2006|pp=63-65}}\n\nQing emperors attempted to reverse the decline of the military through a variety of means.

The rebels massacred the entire Manchu garrison and their families in the city and made it their capital.{{sfn|Crossley|1990|pp=126\u201327}} Shortly thereafter, a [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Taiping]] expeditionary force penetrated as far north as the suburbs of [[Tianjin]] in what was considered the imperial heartlands. In desperation the Qing court ordered a Chinese mandarin, [[Zeng Guofan]], to organize regional ({{zh|p=tu\u00e1ny\u01d2ng|t=\u5718\u52c7|s=\u56e2\u52c7}}) and village ({{zh|p=xi\u0101ngy\u01d2ng|t=\u9109\u52c7|s=\u4e61\u52c7}}) [[militia]]s into a standing army called [[tuanlian]] to contain the rebellion. Zeng Guofan's strategy was to rely on local gentries to raise a new type of military organization from those provinces that the Taiping rebels directly threatened. This new force became known as the [[Xiang Army]], named after the [[Hunan]] region where it was raised. The Xiang Army was a hybrid of local militia and a standing army. It was given professional training, but was paid for out of regional coffers and funds its commanders \u2014 mostly members of the Chinese gentry \u2014 could muster. The Xiang Army and its successor, the [[Huai Army]], created by Zeng Guofan's colleague and student [[Li Hongzhang]], were collectively called the \"[[Yong Ying]]\" (Brave Camp).{{sfn|Liu|Smith|1980|pp=202\u201310}}\n\nBefore forming and commanding the Xiang Army, Zeng Guofan had no military experience. Being a classically educated Mandarin, his blueprint for the Xiang Army was taken from a historical source \u2014 the Ming general [[Qi Jiguang]], who, because of the weakness of regular Ming troops, had decided to form his own \"private\" army to repel raiding [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] in the mid-16th century. Qi Jiguang's doctrine was based on Neo-Confucian ideas of binding troops' loyalty to their immediate superiors and also to the regions in which they were raised. This initially gave the troops an excellent ''[[esprit de corps]]''. Qi Jiguang's army was an ad hoc solution to the specific problem of combating pirates, as was Zeng Guofan's original intention for the Xiang Army, which was raise to eradicate the Taiping rebels. However, circumstances led to the Yongying system becoming a permanent institution within the Qing military, which in the long run created problems of its own for the beleaguered central government.\n[[File:Great Rear Attack by Our Second Army at Weihaiwei.jpg|thumb|left|In 1894\u20131895, fighting over influence in Korea, Japanese troops defeated Qing forces.]]\nFirst, the Yongying system signaled the end of Manchu dominance in Qing military establishment. Although the Banners and Green Standard armies lingered on as parasites depleting resources, henceforth the Yongying corps became the Qing government's de facto first-line troops. Secondly the Yongying corps were financed through provincial coffers and were led by regional commanders. This devolution of power weakened the central government's grip on the whole country, a weakness further aggravated by foreign powers vying to carve up autonomous colonial territories in different parts of the Qing Empire in the later half of the 19th century. Despite these serious negative effects, the measure was deemed necessary as tax revenue from provinces occupied and threatened by rebels had ceased to reach the cash-strapped central government. Finally, the nature of Yongying command structure fostered nepotism and cronyism amongst its commanders, whom, as they ascended the bureaucratic ranks laid the seeds to Qing's eventual demise and the outbreak of regional warlordism in China during the first half of the 20th century.{{sfn|Liu|Smith|1980|pp=202\u201310}}\n\nBy the late 19th century, China was fast descending into a semi-colonial state. Even the most conservative elements within the Qing court could no longer ignore China's military weakness in contrast to the foreign \"barbarians\" literally beating down its gates. In 1860, during the [[Second Opium War]], the capital Beijing was captured and the Summer Palace sacked by a relatively small Anglo-French coalition force numbering 25,000.\n\n==Self-Strengthening and military modernization==\n{{Main|Self-Strengthening Movement}}\n\n[[File:\u6821\u9605\u9646\u519b.jpg|thumb|Several notable figures such as [[Zaitao]], [[Zaixun, Prince Rui|Zaixun]], [[Xu Shichang]], [[Sheng Xuanhuai]], [[Zaizhen]], and [[Yinchang]]]]\nAlthough the Chinese invented gunpowder, and firearms had been in continual use in Chinese warfare since as far back as the [[Song dynasty]], the advent of modern weaponry resulting from the European [[Industrial Revolution]] had rendered China's traditionally trained and equipped army and navy obsolete.\n\nAfter the humiliating capture of Beijing and the sack of the Summer Palace in 1860, officials like Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and the Manchu [[Wenxiang]] made efforts to acquire advanced western weapons and copy western military organization.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=156}} Special brigades of Chinese soldiers equipped with modern rifles and commanded by foreign officers (one example is the [[Ever Victorious Army]] commanded by [[Frederick Townsend Ward]] and later [[Charles George Gordon]]) helped Zeng and Li to defeat the Taiping rebels.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=156}} Li Hongzhang's [[Huai Army]] also acquired western rifles and incorporated some western drills.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=156}} Meanwhile, in Beijing, Prince Gong and Wenxiang created an elite army, the \"[[Peking Field Force]]\", which was armed with Russian rifles and French cannon and drilled by British officers.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|pp=156\u201357}} When this force of 2,500 bannermen defeated a bandit army more than ten times more numerous, they seemed to prove Wenxiang's point that a small but well-trained and well-equipped banner army would be sufficient to defend the capital in the future.{{sfn|Crossley|1990|p=145}}\n\nOne major emphasis of the reforms was to improve the weaponry of Chinese armies. In order to produce modern rifles, artillery, and ammunition, Zeng Guofan created an [[arsenal]] in Suzhou, which was moved to Shanghai and expanded into the [[Jiangnan Arsenal#Kiangnan Arsenal|Jiangnan Arsenal]].{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=157}} In 1866 the sophisticated [[Fuzhou Shipyard]] was created under the leadership of [[Zuo Zongtang]], its focus being the building of modern warships for coastal defense.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=157}} From 1867 to 1874 it built fifteen new ships.{{sfn|Wright|1957|p=212}} Other arsenals were created in Nanjing, Tianjin (it served as a major source of ammunition for northern Chinese armies in the 1870s and 1880s), [[Lanzhou]] (to support Zuo Zongtang's quelling of [[Dungan revolt (1862\u201377)|a large Muslim uprising]] in the northwest), Sichuan, and Shandong.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=157}} [[Prosper Giquel]], a French naval officer who served as adviser at the Fuzhou Shipyard, wrote in 1872 that China was quickly becoming a formidable rival to western powers.{{sfn|Wright|1957|p=220}}\n\nThanks to these reforms and improvements, the Qing government gained a major advantage over domestic rebels.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=158}} After vanquishing the Taiping in 1864, the newly equipped armies defeated the [[Nian Rebellion]] in 1868, the [[Miao Rebellion (1854\u201373)|Guizhou Miao]] in 1873, the [[Panthay Rebellion]] in Yunnan in 1873, and in 1877 the massive [[Dungan revolt (1862\u201377)|Muslim uprising]] that had engulfed Xinjiang since 1862.{{sfn|Horowitz|2002|p=158}} In addition to quelling domestic revolts, the Qing also fought foreign powers with relative success.
