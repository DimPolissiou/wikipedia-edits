This movie marks the third collaboration between [[Jason Segel]] and [[Paul Rudd]], who had worked together on ''[[Knocked Up]]'' and ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Klaven ([[Paul Rudd]]), a [[Los Angeles]] [[real estate]] agent, proposes to his girlfriend Zooey Rice ([[Rashida Jones]]), and she accepts. Peter seems to not have any close friends to share the good news with, only family and mainly female acquaintances. After overhearing Zooey's friends voicing their concerns over his lack of close male friends, Peter decides that he needs to find male friends in order to have a [[Groomsman#Best man|best man]] for the upcoming wedding.\n\nPeter turns to his [[homosexuality|gay]] younger brother, Robbie ([[Andy Samberg]]), for advice on dealing with men. He makes a series of overtures toward various men, including Barry ([[Jon Favreau]]), the persistently hot-headed husband of Zooey's friend Denise ([[Jaime Pressly]]) who doesn't really like Peter all that much to begin with, a problem that only escalates when Peter inadvertently projectile-vomits on Barry after winning a [[beer]]-drinking contest.\n\nFeeling rejected, Peter is about to give up, when during an open house at [[Lou Ferrigno]]'s mansion which Peter is trying to sell, he meets Sydney Fife ([[Jason Segel]]), an investor who is attending the show simply to pick up divorced women and take advantage of the free food. The two quickly become friends, especially bonding over their mutual adoration of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. Peter introduces Sydney to Zooey at their engagement party, but the meeting takes an unfortunate turn when a nervous Sydney makes a very awkward toast.\n\nThe next night, Peter agrees to attend a Rush concert with Sydney, on the condition that he can bring Zooey. During the concert, Zooey is left feeling ignored by Peter and Sydney. The next day, while shopping for tuxedos, Sydney asks Peter why he is marrying Zooey, and also asks for an $8,000 loan. After some thought, Peter decides to lend Sydney the money, and later grants him the honor of being best man at his wedding. Zooey, meanwhile, has become suspicious of Sydney. Peter tells Zooey that he lent Sydney money and asks her if she knows why they are getting married, since he had no answer to Sydney's question. (He wasn't aware that it was a question that was supposed to stay between him and Sydney.) Hurt and angry, Zooey leaves.\n\nPeter leaves for work the next morning only to discover that Sydney has used the $8,000 loan to purchase several ridiculous [[billboard|billboard advertisements]] promoting Peter's real estate business (using pictures of Peter he took of him on his iPhone). Still upset over his fight with Zooey, Peter confronts Sydney and decides to end their friendship. Peter then patches things up with Zooey, explaining to her that while he is nervous, he is ready to get married. While Zooey and Peter prepare for the wedding, Sydney finds himself alone and desperate to hang with someone.\n\nAt work, Peter discovers that Sydney's billboard advertising campaign was successful, as he won back the right to the lucrative Ferrigno listing and many others left messages wanting him to sell their houses. Feeling encouraged, Peter finally stands up to his insufferable colleague, Tevin Downey ([[Rob Huebel]]), who had been badgering Peter for half the selling rights to the Ferrigno property (both to help him and to get in on the commission). When Tevin makes one final attempt to get a piece of it, Peter slaps him across his face and tells him to stay away from it.\n\nPeter feels bad about fighting with Sydney but does not re-invite him to the wedding. Instead, he assembles an array of random groomsmen that includes Robbie, father Oswald ([[J. K. Simmons]]), and Ferrigno. Before the wedding, Zooey sees Peter looking forlorn, clearly missing his friend Sydney. She calls and invites Sydney, who is, unbeknownst to them, already en route to the wedding. Just before the vows are to be taken, Sydney makes a dramatic entrance via [[moped]]. He informs Peter and Zooey that he is, in fact, a successful investor and returns the money he borrowed from Peter, stating that the billboards were the couple's wedding present. Peter and Zooey declare their love to each other, Sydney assumes the role of best man, and the wedding commences.\n\nAs the end credits begin to roll, we see the wedding reception, where Peter and Sydney join the hired band (played by [[OK Go]]) in a rendition of the Rush song \"[[Limelight (song)|Limelight]]\" pulling Zooey on stage to join them. After the song ends, Sydney attempts to toast the newlyweds and Peter runs to frantically stop him as the screen cuts out (still remembering Sydney's ill-advised toast at the engagement dinner.)\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:IloveyoumanTXpremiereMarch09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jon Favreau]], [[Jaime Pressly]], [[Jason Segel]], [[John Hamburg]], Larry Levin, [[Rashida Jones]], and [[Paul Rudd]] at the [[premiere]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in March 2009.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Peter Klaven\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Sydney Fife\n* [[Rashida Jones]] as Zooey Rice\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Robbie Klaven\n* [[Josh Cooke]] as Alan, Robbie's boyfriend\n* [[J.

This movie marks the third collaboration between [[Jason Segel]] and [[Paul Rudd]], who had worked together on ''[[Knocked Up]]'' and ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Klaven ([[Paul Rudd]]), a [[Los Angeles]] [[real estate]] agent, proposes to his girlfriend Zooey Rice ([[Rashida Jones]]), and she accepts. Peter seems to not have any close friends to share the good news with, only family and mainly female acquaintances. After overhearing Zooey's friends voicing their concerns over his lack of close male friends, Peter decides that he needs to find male friends in order to have a [[Groomsman#Best man|best man]] for the upcoming wedding.\n\nPeter turns to his [[homosexuality|gay]] younger brother, Robbie ([[Andy Samberg]]), for advice on dealing with men. He makes a series of overtures toward various men, including Barry ([[Jon Favreau]]), the persistently hot-headed husband of Zooey's friend Denise ([[Jaime Pressly]]) who doesn't really like Peter all that much to begin with, a problem that only escalates when Peter inadvertently projectile-vomits on Barry after winning a [[beer]]-drinking contest.\n\nFeeling rejected, Peter is about to give up, when during an open house at [[Lou Ferrigno]]'s mansion which Peter is trying to sell, he meets Sydney Fife ([[Jason Segel]]), an investor who is attending the show simply to pick up divorced women and take advantage of the free food. The two quickly become friends, especially bonding over their mutual adoration of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. Peter introduces Sydney to Zooey at their engagement party, but the meeting takes an unfortunate turn when a nervous Sydney makes a very awkward toast.\n\nThe next night, Peter agrees to attend a Rush concert with Sydney, on the condition that he can bring Zooey. During the concert, Zooey is left feeling ignored by Peter and Sydney. The next day, while shopping for tuxedos, Sydney asks Peter why he is marrying Zooey, and also asks for an $8,000 loan. After some thought, Peter decides to lend Sydney the money, and later grants him the honor of being best man at his wedding. Zooey, meanwhile, has become suspicious of Sydney. Peter tells Zooey that he lent Sydney money and asks her if she knows why they are getting married, since he had no answer to Sydney's question. (He wasn't aware that it was a question that was supposed to stay between him and Sydney.) Hurt and angry, Zooey leaves.\n\nPeter leaves for work the next morning only to discover that Sydney has used the $8,000 loan to purchase several ridiculous [[billboard|billboard advertisements]] promoting Peter's real estate business (using pictures of Peter he took of him on his iPhone). Still upset over his fight with Zooey, Peter confronts Sydney and decides to end their friendship. Peter then patches things up with Zooey, explaining to her that while he is nervous, he is ready to get married. While Zooey and Peter prepare for the wedding, Sydney finds himself alone and desperate to hang with someone.\n\nAt work, Peter discovers that Sydney's billboard advertising campaign was successful, as he won back the right to the lucrative Ferrigno listing and many others left messages wanting him to sell their houses. Feeling encouraged, Peter finally stands up to his insufferable colleague, Tevin Downey ([[Rob Huebel]]), who had been badgering Peter for half the selling rights to the Ferrigno property (both to help him and to get in on the commission). When Tevin makes one final attempt to get a piece of it, Peter slaps him across his face and tells him to stay away from it.\n\nPeter feels bad about fighting with Sydney but does not re-invite him to the wedding. Instead, he assembles an array of random groomsmen that includes Robbie, father Oswald ([[J. K. Simmons]]), and Ferrigno. Before the wedding, Zooey sees Peter looking forlorn, clearly missing his friend Sydney. She calls and invites Sydney, who is, unbeknownst to them, already en route to the wedding. Just before the vows are to be taken, Sydney makes a dramatic entrance via [[moped]]. He informs Peter and Zooey that he is, in fact, a successful investor and returns the money he borrowed from Peter, stating that the billboards were the couple's wedding present. Peter and Zooey declare their love to each other, Sydney assumes the role of best man, and the wedding commences.\n\nAs the end credits begin to roll, we see the wedding reception, where Peter and Sydney join the hired band (played by [[OK Go]]) in a rendition of the Rush song \"[[Limelight (song)|Limelight]]\" pulling Zooey on stage to join them. After the song ends, Sydney attempts to toast the newlyweds and Peter runs to frantically stop him as the screen cuts out (still remembering Sydney's ill-advised toast at the engagement dinner.)\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:IloveyoumanTXpremiereMarch09.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jon Favreau]], [[Jaime Pressly]], [[Jason Segel]], [[John Hamburg]], Larry Levin, [[Rashida Jones]], and [[Paul Rudd]] at the [[premiere]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in March 2009.]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Peter Klaven\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Sydney Fife\n* [[Rashida Jones]] as Zooey Rice\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Robbie Klaven\n* [[Josh Cooke]] as Alan, Robbie's boyfriend\n* [[J.

{"title_page": "TNM staging system", "text_new": "The '''TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors''' ('''TNM''') is a globally recognised standard for classifying the extent of spread of [[cancer]]. It is a classification system of the anatomical extent of [[tumor]] cancers. It has gained wide international acceptance for many solid tumor cancers, but is not applicable to [[leukaemia]] and tumors of the [[central nervous system]]. Most common tumors have their own TNM classification. Sometimes also described as the AJCC system. \n\nTNM was developed and is maintained by the [[Union for International Cancer Control]] (UICC). It is also used by the [[American Joint Committee on Cancer]] (AJCC) and the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] (FIGO). In 1987, the UICC and AJCC staging systems were unified into the single TNM staging system. TNM is a notation system that describes the stage of a cancer, which originates from a solid tumor, using [[alphanumeric]] codes:\n\n*'''T''' describes the size of the original (primary) '''tumor''' and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, \n*'''N''' describes nearby (regional) [[lymph nodes|lymph '''nodes''']] that are involved,\n*'''M''' describes distant '''[[metastasis]]''' (spread of cancer from one part of the body to another).\n\nThe TNM staging system for all solid tumors was devised by [[Pierre Denoix]] between 1943 and 1952, using the size and extension of the primary tumor, its lymphatic involvement, and the presence of metastases to classify the progression of cancer.<ref>Denoix PF. Enquete permanent dans les centres anticancereaux. Bull Inst Nat Hyg 1946;1:70\u20135.</ref>\n\n==General outline==\nThe TNM classification comprises staging algorithms for almost all cancers, with the primary exception of pediatric cancers. The general outline for the TNM classification is below. The values in parentheses give a range of what can be used for all cancer types, but not all cancers use this full range.\n\n===Mandatory parameters===\n[[File:Diagram showing the T stages of bladder cancer CRUK 372.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the T stages of [[bladder cancer]]]]\n* {{Anchor|T}} '''T''': size or direct extent of the primary tumor\n** Tx: tumor cannot be assessed\n** Tis: [[carcinoma in situ]]\n** T0: no evidence of tumor\n** T1, T2, T3, T4: size and/or extension of the primary tumor\n* {{Anchor|N}} '''N''': degree of spread to regional [[lymph node]]s\n** Nx: lymph nodes cannot be assessed\n** N0: no regional [[lymph]] [[Lymph node|nodes]] [[metastasis]]\n** N1: regional lymph node metastasis present; at some sites, tumor spread to closest or small number of regional lymph nodes\n** N2: tumor spread to an extent between N1 and N3 (N2 is not used at all sites)\n** N3: tumor spread to more distant or numerous regional lymph nodes (N3 is not used at all sites)\n* {{Anchor|M}} '''M''': presence of distant [[metastasis]]\n** M0: no distant metastasis\n** M1: metastasis to distant organs (beyond regional lymph nodes)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/staging |title=Cancer staging |date= |publisher=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Mx designation was removed from the 7th edition of the AJCC/UICC system, but referred to cancers that could not be evaluated for distant metastasis.\n\n===Other parameters===\n* '''G''' (1\u20134): the ''[[Grading (tumors)|grade]]'' of the cancer cells (i.e. they are \"low grade\" if they appear similar to normal cells, and \"high grade\" if they appear poorly [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]])\n* '''S''' (0\u20133): elevation of serum [[tumor markers]]\n* '''R''' (0\u20132): the completeness of the operation (''[[Segmental resection|resection]]''-boundaries free of cancer cells or not)\n* '''L''' (0\u20131): invasion into [[lymphatic system|lymphatic vessel]]s\n* '''V''' (0\u20132): invasion into [[vein]] (no, microscopic, macroscopic)\n* '''C''' (1\u20135): a modifier of the '''certainty''' (quality) of the last mentioned parameter (has been removed in the TNM 8th edition)\n\n===Prefix modifiers===\n* '''c''': stage is determined from evidence acquired before treatment (including clinical examination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration). The c-prefix is implicit in absence of the p-prefix.\n* '''p''': stage given by [[histopathologic]] examination of a surgical specimen\n* '''y''': stage assessed after [[chemotherapy]] and/or radiation therapy; in other words, the individual had [[neoadjuvant therapy]].\n* '''r''': stage for a recurrent tumor in an individual that had some period of time free from the disease.\n* '''a''': stage determined at [[autopsy]].\n* '''u''': stage determined by [[ultrasonography]] or [[endosonography]]. Clinicians often use this modifier although it is not an officially defined one\n\nFor the T, N and M parameters exist subclassifications for some cancer-types (e.g. T1a, Tis, N1i)\n\n===UICC Stage and AJCC Prognostic Stage Groups===\nThe TNM system is used to record the anatomical extent of disease. It is useful to condense these categories into groups. [[carcinoma in situ]] is categorized stage 0; often tumors localized to the organ of origin are staged as I or II depending on the extent, locally extensive spread, to regional [[Lymph node|nodes]] are staged as III, and those with distant [[metastasis]] staged as stage IV. However, in some tumor types stage groups do not conform to this simplified schema. The stage group is adopted with the intention that categories within each group are more or less homogeneous in respect of survival, and that the [[survival rates]] are distinctive between groups.\nThe [[Union for International Cancer Control]] (UICC) uses the term '''Stage''' to define the anatomical extent of disease. The [[American Joint Committee on Cancer]] (AJCC) uses the term '''Prognostic Stage Group''' which may also include additional prognostic factors in addition to anatomical extent of disease.\n\n==Examples==\n* Small, low-grade cancer, no metastasis, no spread to regional lymph nodes, cancer completely removed, resection material seen by pathologist: pT1 pN0 M0 R0 G1; this grouping of T, N, and M would be considered [[Cancer Staging|Stage]] I.\n* Large, high grade cancer, with spread to regional lymph nodes and other organs, not completely removed, seen by pathologist: pT4 pN2 M1 R1 G3; this grouping of T, N, and M would be considered Stage IV. \n\nWhile most Stage I tumors are curable; most Stage IV tumors are inoperable.\n\n==Uses and aims==\nSome of the aims for adopting a global standard are to:\n* Aid medical staff in staging the tumor helping to plan the treatment.\n* Give an indication of [[prognosis]].\n* Assist in the evaluation of the results of treatment.\n* Enable facilities around the world to collate information more productively.\n\nSince the number of combinations of categories is high, combinations are grouped to stages for better analysis.\n\n==Versions==\nIt is crucial to be aware that the criteria used in the TNM system have varied over time, sometimes fairly substantially, according to the different editions that AJCC and UICC have released.

It is a classification system of the anatomical extent of [[tumor]] cancers. It has gained wide international acceptance for many solid tumor cancers, but is not applicable to [[leukaemia]] and tumors of the [[central nervous system]]. Most common tumors have their own TNM classification. Sometimes also described as the AJCC system. \n\nTNM was developed and is maintained by the [[Union for International Cancer Control]] (UICC). It is also used by the [[American Joint Committee on Cancer]] (AJCC) and the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] (FIGO). In 1987, the UICC and AJCC staging systems were unified into the single TNM staging system. TNM is a notation system that describes the stage of a cancer, which originates from a solid tumor, using [[alphanumeric]] codes:\n\n*'''T''' describes the size of the original (primary) '''tumor''' and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, \n*'''N''' describes nearby (regional) [[lymph nodes|lymph '''nodes''']] that are involved,\n*'''M''' describes distant '''[[metastasis]]''' (spread of cancer from one part of the body to another).\n\nThe TNM staging system for all solid tumors was devised by [[Pierre Denoix]] between 1943 and 1952, using the size and extension of the primary tumor, its lymphatic involvement, and the presence of metastases to classify the progression of cancer.<ref>Denoix PF. Enquete permanent dans les centres anticancereaux. Bull Inst Nat Hyg 1946;1:70\u20135.</ref>\n\n==General outline==\nThe TNM classification comprises staging algorithms for almost all cancers, with the primary exception of pediatric cancers.\nThe general outline for the TNM classification is below. The values in parentheses give a range of what can be used for all cancer types, but not all cancers use this full range.\n\n===Mandatory parameters===\n[[File:Diagram showing the T stages of bladder cancer CRUK 372.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the T stages of [[bladder cancer]]]]\n* {{Anchor|T}} '''T''': size or direct extent of the primary tumor\n** Tx: tumor cannot be assessed\n** Tis: [[carcinoma in situ]]\n** T0: no evidence of tumor\n** T1, T2, T3, T4: size and/or extension of the primary tumor\n* {{Anchor|N}} '''N''': degree of spread to regional [[lymph node]]s\n** Nx: lymph nodes cannot be assessed\n** N0: no regional [[lymph]] [[Lymph node|nodes]] [[metastasis]]\n** N1: regional lymph node metastasis present; at some sites, tumor spread to closest or small number of regional lymph nodes\n** N2: tumor spread to an extent between N1 and N3 (N2 is not used at all sites)\n** N3: tumor spread to more distant or numerous regional lymph nodes (N3 is not used at all sites)\n* {{Anchor|M}} '''M''': presence of distant [[metastasis]]\n** M0: no distant metastasis\n** M1: metastasis to distant organs (beyond regional lymph nodes)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/staging |title=Cancer staging |date= |publisher=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Mx designation was removed from the 7th edition of the AJCC/UICC system, but referred to cancers that could not be evaluated for distant metastasis.\n\n===Other parameters===\n* '''G''' (1\u20134): the ''[[Grading (tumors)|grade]]'' of the cancer cells (i.e. they are \"low grade\" if they appear similar to normal cells, and \"high grade\" if they appear poorly [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]])\n* '''S''' (0\u20133): elevation of serum [[tumor markers]]\n* '''R''' (0\u20132): the completeness of the operation (''[[Segmental resection|resection]]''-boundaries free of cancer cells or not)\n* '''L''' (0\u20131): invasion into [[lymphatic system|lymphatic vessel]]s\n* '''V''' (0\u20132): invasion into [[vein]] (no, microscopic, macroscopic)\n* '''C''' (1\u20135): a modifier of the '''certainty''' (quality) of the last mentioned parameter (has been removed in the TNM 8th edition)\n\n===Prefix modifiers===\n* '''c''': stage is determined from evidence acquired before treatment (including clinical examination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration). The c-prefix is implicit in absence of the p-prefix.\n* '''p''': stage given by [[histopathologic]] examination of a surgical specimen\n* '''y''': stage assessed after [[chemotherapy]] and/or radiation therapy; in other words, the individual had [[neoadjuvant therapy]].\n* '''r''': stage for a recurrent tumor in an individual that had some period of time free from the disease.\n* '''a''': stage determined at [[autopsy]].\n* '''u''': stage determined by [[ultrasonography]] or [[endosonography]]. Clinicians often use this modifier although it is not an officially defined one\n\nFor the T, N and M parameters exist subclassifications for some cancer-types (e.g. T1a, Tis, N1i)\n\n===UICC Stage and AJCC Prognostic Stage Groups===\nThe TNM system is used to record the anatomical extent of disease. It is useful to condense these categories into groups. [[carcinoma in situ]] is categorized stage 0; often tumors localized to the organ of origin are staged as I or II depending on the extent, locally extensive spread, to regional  [[Lymph node|nodes]]  are staged as III, and those with distant [[metastasis]] staged as stage IV.  However, in some tumor types stage groups do not conform to this simplified schema. The stage group is adopted with the intention that categories within each group are more or less homogeneous in respect of survival, and that the [[survival rates]] are distinctive between groups.\nThe [[Union for International Cancer Control]] (UICC) uses the term '''Stage''' to define the anatomical extent of disease. The [[American Joint Committee on Cancer]] (AJCC) uses the term '''Prognostic Stage Group''' which may also include additional prognostic factors in addition to anatomical extent of disease.\n\n==Examples==\n* Small, low-grade cancer, no metastasis, no spread to regional lymph nodes, cancer completely removed, resection material seen by pathologist: pT1 pN0 M0 R0 G1; this grouping of T, N, and M would be considered [[Cancer Staging|Stage]] I.\n* Large, high grade cancer, with spread to regional lymph nodes and other organs, not completely removed, seen by pathologist: pT4 pN2 M1 R1 G3; this grouping of T, N, and M would be considered Stage IV. \n\nWhile most Stage I tumors are curable; most Stage IV tumors are inoperable.\n\n==Uses and aims==\nSome of the aims for adopting a global standard are to:\n* Aid medical staff in staging the tumor helping to plan the treatment.\n* Give an indication of [[prognosis]].\n* Assist in the evaluation of the results of treatment.\n* Enable facilities around the world to collate information more productively.\n\nSince the number of combinations of categories is high, combinations are grouped to stages for better analysis.\n\n==Versions==\nIt is crucial to be aware that the criteria used in the TNM system have varied over time, sometimes fairly substantially, according to the different editions that AJCC and UICC have released.

His main interest was the chemistry of plants and animals, and he later conducted important research on the chemical structure of the common animal substance [[chitin]], for which he received his [[doctorate]] with distinction in 1929.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mystic Chemist: The Life of Albert Hofmann and His Discovery of LSD|year=2013|publisher=Synergetic Press|location=Santa Fe, NM|isbn=978-0-907791-46-1|page=16|author=Dieter Hagenbach|edition=First English|author2=Lucius Werthm\u00fcller|author3=Stanislav Grof}}</ref>\n\nRegarding his decision to pursue a career as a chemist, Hofmann provided insight during a speech he delivered to the 1996 Worlds of Consciousness Conference in Heidelberg, Germany:\n\n{{quote|One often asks oneself what roles planning and chance play in the realization of the most important events in our lives. [...] This [career] decision was not easy for me. I had already taken a Latin matricular exam, and therefore a career in the humanities stood out most prominently in the foreground. Moreover, an artistic career was tempting. In the end, however, it was a problem of theoretical knowledge which induced me to study chemistry, which was a great surprise to all who knew me.

''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983),</ref> The first two-party system consisted of the [[Federalist Party]], who supported the ratification of the Constitution, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] or the [[Anti-Administration party]] (Anti-Federalists), who opposed the powerful central government, among others, that the Constitution established when it took effect in 1789.<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Political Parties: Federalists and Anti-Federalists|work=Boundless Political Science|publisher=Boundless.com|date=May 26, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2016|url=https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/the-history-of-political-parties-55/the-first-political-parties-federalists-and-anti-federalists-316-1572/}}</ref>\n\nThe modern two-party system consists of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].

In some states, [[Independent voter#In the United States|independents]] are not allowed to vote in primary elections, but in others, they can vote in any primary election of their choice. Although the term \"independent\" often is used as a synonym for \"moderate,\" \"centrist,\" or \"swing voter,\" to refer to a politician or voter who holds views that incorporate facets of both liberal and conservative ideologies, most self-described independents consistently support one of the two major parties when it comes time to vote, according to [[Vox Media]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10814522/independents-voters-facts-myths|title=9 media myths about independent voters, debunked|last=Klar|first=Samara|date=2016-01-22|website=Vox|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==History and early political parties==\n[[File:PartyVotes-Presidents.png|thumb|right|400px|Popular votes to political parties during presidential elections.]]\n[[File:Political Parties Derivation in the United States.svg|thumb|400px|Political parties derivation. Dotted line means unofficially.]]\nThe [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]] is silent on the subject of political parties. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists, given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]  at the helm of this political faction, that created the environment in which partisanship, once distasteful, came to being.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref><ref>Gordon S.

The Federalist Party grew from the national network of Washington's Secretary of the Treasury, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who favored a strong united central government, close ties to Britain, a centralized banking system, and close links between the government and men of wealth.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was founded by Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)</ref> The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]] came to power in 1800 and the Federalists were too elitist to compete effectively. The Federalists survived in the Northeast, but their refusal to support the [[War of 1812]] verged on secession and was a devastating blow when the war ended well. The [[Era of Good Feelings]] under [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] (1816\u20131824) marked the end of the First Party System and a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952)</ref>\n\n===Second Party System: 1828\u20131854===\n{{Main|Second Party System}}\nThe Second Party System operated from about 1828 to 1854, following the splintering of the Democratic-Republican Party. Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]], that grew from the [[National Republican Party]];  and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed both the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up [[industry]] at the expense of the [[taxpayer]].\n\nThe Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the primacy of [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism.

The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] was in large part the opposition party during this period, although it often controlled the Senate or the House of Representatives, or both.\n\n[[American Civil War|Civil war]] and [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] issues polarized the parties until the [[Compromise of 1877]], which ended the latter. Thus both parties became broad-based voting coalitions and the race issue pulled newly enfranchised African Americans ([[Freedman|Freedmen]]) into the Republican Party while white southerners ([[Redeemers]]) joined the Democratic Party. The Democratic coalition also had conservative pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, traditional Democrats in the North (many of them former [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), and Catholic immigrants, among others. The Republican coalition also consisted of businessmen, shop owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, and professionals who were attracted to the party's modernization policies.<ref>Paul Kleppner; Paul.

It began after the Republicans blamed the Democrats for the [[Panic of 1893]], which later resulted in [[William McKinley]]'s victory over [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].\n\nThe central domestic issues changed to government regulation of railroads and large corporations (\"[[Trust (business)|trusts]]\"), the protective tariff, the role of [[Trade union|labor unions]], [[Child labour|child labor]], the need for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary elections, direct election of senators, [[racial segregation]], efficiency in government, [[women's suffrage]], and control of immigration. Most voting blocs continued unchanged, but some realignment took place, giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new strength in the border states. Historians have long debated why no [[Labor Party of the United States|Labor Party]] emerged in the United States, in contrast to Western Europe.<ref>Robin Archer, ''Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?''

Roosevelt]] and the activist [[New Deal]]. They promoted American liberalism, anchored in a coalition of specific liberal groups, especially [[Ethnoreligious group|ethno-religious]] constituencies (Catholics, Jews, African Americans), white Southerners, well-organized labor unions, urban machines, progressive intellectuals, and populist farm groups.\n\nOpposition Republicans were split between a conservative wing, led by [[Ohio]] Senator [[Robert A. Taft]], and a more successful moderate wing exemplified by the politics of Northeastern leaders such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Jacob Javits]], and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]]. The latter steadily lost influence inside the GOP after 1964.<ref>Nicol C. Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)</ref>\n\nExperts debate whether this era ended (and a [[Sixth Party System]] subsequently emerged) in the mid-1960s when the New Deal coalition died, the early 1980s when the [[Moral Majority]] and the [[Reagan coalition]] were formed, the early 1990s when [[Third Way]] emerged among Democrats, the mid-1990s during the [[Republican Revolution]], or if the Fifth system continues in some form to the present.\n\nSince the 1930s, the Democrats positioned themselves more towards [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] while [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] increasingly dominated the GOP.<ref>[[Matthew Levendusky]], ''The Partisan Sort: How Liberals Became Democrats and Conservatives Became Republicans'' (U Chicago Press, 2009)</ref> However, new voter coalitions emerged during the latter half of the 20th century, with conservatives and the Republicans becoming dominant in the South, rural areas, and suburbs; while liberals and the Democrats increasingly started to rely on a coalition of African-Americans, Hispanics and white urban progressives.\n\n===Minor parties and independents===\n{{See also|Independent politician#United States}}\nAlthough American politics have been dominated by the two-party system, several other political parties have also emerged throughout the country's history. The oldest third party was the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], which was formed in upstate New York in 1828. The party's creators feared the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], believing they were a powerful secret society that was attempting to rule the country in defiance of republican principles.<ref>Morris, Richard B.

From its founding until the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party was the dominant party among white southerners, and as such, was then the party most associated with the defense of slavery. However, following the [[Great Society]] under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Democratic Party became the more progressive party on issues of civil rights, while losing dominance in the Southern states to the Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic Party since 1912 has positioned itself as the liberal party on domestic issues. The economic philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's agenda since 1932. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] controlled the White House until 1968, with the exception of the two terms of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] from 1953\u20131961. Since the mid-20th century, Democrats have generally been in the [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] and currently support [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. Democrats are currently strongest in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in major American urban centers. African-Americans and Latinos tend to be disproportionately Democratic, as do [[trade union]]s.\n\nIn 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million registered voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.<ref name=\"Neuhart20040122\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/neuharth/2004-01-22-neuharth_x.htm|last=Neuhart|first=Al|title=Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=January 22, 2004}}</ref> Although his party lost the election for president in 2004, [[Barack Obama]] would later go on to become president in 2009 and continue to be the president until January 2017.  Obama was the 15th Democrat to hold the office, and from the [[2006 United States elections|2006 midterm elections]] until the [[2014 United States elections|2014 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party was also the [[Two-party system|majority party]] in the [[United States Senate]].\n\nA 2011 ''[[USA Today]]'' review of state voter rolls indicates that the number of registered Democrats declined in 25 of 28 states (some states do not register voters by party). During this time, Republican registration also declined, as independent or no preference voting was on the rise.  But in 2011 Democrats numbers shrank 800,000, and from 2008 they were down by 1.7 million, or 3.9%.<ref name=\"Wolf\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-12-22/voters-political-parties/52171688/1|title=Voters leaving Republican, Democratic parties in droves|author=Wolf, Richard|first=|date=December 22, 2011|work=USA Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> In 2018, the Democratic party was the largest in the United States with roughly 60 Million registered members.\n\n===Republican Party===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States)|History of the United States Republican Party}}\nThe Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States of America. Since the 1880s it has been nicknamed (by the media) the \"Grand Old Party\"  or GOP, although it is younger than the Democratic Party.\n\nFounded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who used the party machinery to support victory in the [[American Civil War]]. The GOP dominated national politics during the [[Third Party System]], from 1854 to 1896, and the [[Fourth Party System]] from 1896 to 1932.\n\nSince its founding, the Republican Party has been the more market-oriented of the two American political parties, often favoring policies that aid American business interests.  As a party whose power was once based on the voting power of Union Army veterans, this party has traditionally supported more aggressive defense measures and more lavish veterans' benefits. Today, the Republican Party supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] platform, with further foundations in [[economic liberalism]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and [[social conservatism]].  The Republican Party tends to be strongest in the [[Southern United States]] and the \"[[Flyover country|flyover states]]\", as well as suburban and rural areas in other states. One significant base of support for the Republican Party is [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]], who have wielded significant power in the party since the early 1970s.  \n\nRepublicans at the time of Eisenhower are very different from New a.k.a. Neo-Republicans of the twenty-first century. The policies of Barack Obama were found to be to the right of Richard \"tricky Dick\" Nixon because of how far the spectrum has shifted to the right. What used to be considered centrist thinking in Eisenhower's time is now to the left of Democrats today. Twenty-first century Neo-Republicans generally currently oppose [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] (a.k.a. \"Blue Dog\" Democrats, or wolves in sheep's clothing) have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. In fact, the entire political spectrum has shifted to the right since the mid-twentieth century. \"Neo-Republicans\" also oppose [[trade union]]s and abortion.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] is the 18th and the current Republican to be elected to the office of [[President of the United States]]. Since the [[2010 United States elections|2010 midterm elections]], the Republicans held a majority in the United States House of Representatives until the 2018 midterms where they lost it to the Democratic Party. Additionally, since the 2014 elections, the Republican Party has controlled the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president|title=2016 Election News, Candidates & Polls|publisher=}}</ref> In 2018, the Republican party had roughly 55 million registered members, making it the second largest party in the United States.\n\n==Minor parties==\nThe United States also has an array of minor parties, the largest of which (on the basis of support for their Presidential candidates in the 2016 election), are the Libertarian, Green, and Constitution parties.\n{{Main|List of political parties in the United States}}\n\n===Libertarian Party===\n{{Main|Libertarian Party (United States)}}\nThe Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1971.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml Libertarian Party:Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130133301/http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml |date=2006-01-30 }}, LP.org</ref> It is the largest continuing [[third party (United States)|third party]] in the United States, claiming well over 500,000 registered voters across all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2017/07/27/new-registration-data-for-the-united-states/|title=New Voter Registration Nation Totals|first=Richard|last=Winger|date=27 July 2017|work=ballot-access.org|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref> As of 2019, they have about 176 elected officials, including 1 state legislator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/elected-officials/|title=Elected Officials|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was former New Mexico governor, [[Gary Johnson]].

In [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], Johnson ran again, receiving over four million votes, or 3.3% of the popular vote.\n\nThe Libertarian Party's core mission is to reduce the size, influence, and expenditures of all levels of government. To this effect, the party supports minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[Government of the United States|federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]], [[drug liberalization]], [[separation of church and state]], [[Free migration|open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries, and a more representative republic.<ref name=LPOption>{{cite web|title=The Libertarian Option|url=http://www.lp.org/introduction/the-libertarian-option|website=The Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian National Committee, Inc.|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref> As of 2016, it is the third largest organized political party in the United States.\n\n===Green Party===\n{{Main|Green Party of the United States}}\nIn the [[United States]], the Green Party has been active as a [[third party (United States)|third party]] since the 1980s.

It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992 by Howard Phillips. The party's official name was changed to the \"Constitution Party\" in 1999; however, some state affiliate parties are known under different names.\n\nThe Constitution Party is strongly pro-life (i.e. opposed to [[abortion]]), and supports [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], and restrictions on immigration. It calls for protectionist trade policies.\n\nIn 2006, [[Rick Jore]] of [[Montana]] became the first Constitution Party candidate elected to a state-level office,<ref>[http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp \"State Legislature results\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116040533/http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp |date=2006-11-16 }}, ''Missoulian'', November 8, 2006, retrieved November 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.helenair.com/articles/2006/11/09/montana/a01110906_02.txt Control of state Legislature unclear], ''Helena Independent Record''</ref> though the Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the national party a short time before the election.\n\nIn 2010 former Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] was the Constitution Party candidate for governor of [[Colorado]], coming in second with 617,030 votes, 36.4% and ahead of the Republican candidate, Dan Maes, with 11.1%.\n\nThe Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee was former Congressman [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia.\n\nTennessee Attorney [[Darrell Castle]] was the 2016 Constitution Party nominee for President of the United States and Scott Bradley of Utah was the nominee for Vice President.\n\n==Issues==\n{{See also|Left\u2013right political spectrum#Contemporary usage in the United States|label 1=Usage of \"left\u2013right\" politics in the United States|Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties|label 2=Organization of American political parties}}\n\nBecause American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries, not all members of a party subscribe to all of the officially held positions in their respective [[party platform|party's platform]]. The usual degree of variation generally is higher for the larger parties. Party members may hold different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal levels, and an elected official once in office may act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this has led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\" and \"[[Democrat In Name Only]]\" \u2013 RINO and DINO, respectively). Furthermore, the modern American [[political spectrum]], and the usage of [[Left\u2013right political spectrum|left\u2013right politics]], differs from the rest of the world. For example, the Democratic Party, the primary left-of-center party in the country, generally supports a [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] position rather than a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] one, though there are exceptions.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Critchlow, Donald T.

Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation, as outlined in his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers. Hamilton and Madison, who wrote the aforementioned Federalist Papers against political factions, ended up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. It was the split camps of Federalists, given rise with Hamilton as a leader, and Democratic-Republicans, with Madison and [[Thomas Jefferson]]  at the helm of this political faction, that created the environment in which partisanship, once distasteful, came to being.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780\u20131840'' (1970)</ref><ref>Gordon S.

The Federalist Party grew from the national network of Washington's Secretary of the Treasury, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who favored a strong united central government, close ties to Britain, a centralized banking system, and close links between the government and men of wealth.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was founded by Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.<ref>William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)</ref> The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]] came to power in 1800 and the Federalists were too elitist to compete effectively. The Federalists survived in the Northeast, but their refusal to support the [[War of 1812]] verged on secession and was a devastating blow when the war ended well. The [[Era of Good Feelings]] under [[James Monroe|President James Monroe]] (1816\u20131824) marked the end of the First Party System and a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952)</ref>\n\n===Second Party System: 1828\u20131854===\n{{Main|Second Party System}}\nThe Second Party System operated from about 1828 to 1854, following the splintering of the Democratic-Republican Party. Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]], that grew from the [[National Republican Party]];  and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]]. The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed both the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up [[industry]] at the expense of the [[taxpayer]].\n\nThe Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the primacy of [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. Central political battles of this era were the [[Bank War]] and the [[Spoils system]] of federal patronage.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=3123555|title=Politics and Society: Toward a Jacksonian Synthesis|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|volume=10|issue=2|pages=135\u2013161|last1=Feller|first1=Daniel|year=1990|doi=10.2307/3123555}}</ref> The 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of decline in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. In addition, the fading of old economic issues removed many of the unifying forces holding the party together.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:1em; text-align:center\"\n|+ [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|Presidential election victories]] by party system<ref>Using the definitions of: First Party System: 1796\u20131824, Second Party System: 1828\u20131852, Third Party System: 1856\u20131892, Fourth Party System: 1896\u20131928, Fifth Party System: 1932\u20131964, Sixth Party System: 1968\u2013present</ref>\n|-\n!Party System\n!Party A\n!Party B\n|-\n!First\n|{{party shading/Democratic-Republican}}|7\n|{{party shading/Federalist}}|1\n|-\n!Second\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|5\n|{{party shading/Whig}}|2\n|-\n!Third\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|3\n|{{party shading/Republican}}|7\n|-\n!Fourth\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|2\n|{{party shading/Republican}}|7\n|-\n!Fifth\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|7\n|{{party shading/Republican}}|2\n|-\n!Sixth\n|{{party shading/Democratic}}|5\n|{{party shading/Republican}}|7\n|}\n\n===Third Party System: 1854\u20131890s===\n{{Main|Third Party System}}\nThe Third Party System stretched from 1854 to the mid-1890s, and was characterized by the emergence of the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which adopted many of the economic policies of the Whigs, such as national banks, railroads, high tariffs, homesteads and aid to land grant colleges. The [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] was in large part the opposition party during this period, although it often controlled the Senate or the House of Representatives, or both.\n\n[[American Civil War|Civil war]] and [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] issues polarized the parties until the [[Compromise of 1877]], which ended the latter. Thus both parties became broad-based voting coalitions and the race issue pulled newly enfranchised African Americans ([[Freedman|Freedmen]]) into the Republican Party while white southerners ([[Redeemers]]) joined the Democratic Party. The Democratic coalition also had conservative pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, traditional Democrats in the North (many of them former [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), and Catholic immigrants, among others. The Republican coalition also consisted of businessmen, shop owners, skilled craftsmen, clerks, and professionals who were attracted to the party's modernization policies.<ref>Paul Kleppner; Paul.

This period also corresponded to the [[Progressive Era]], and was dominated by the Republican Party. It began after the Republicans blamed the Democrats for the [[Panic of 1893]], which later resulted in [[William McKinley]]'s victory over [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]].\n\nThe central domestic issues changed to government regulation of railroads and large corporations (\"[[Trust (business)|trusts]]\"), the protective tariff, the role of [[Trade union|labor unions]], [[Child labour|child labor]], the need for a new banking system, corruption in party politics, primary elections, direct election of senators, [[racial segregation]], efficiency in government, [[women's suffrage]], and control of immigration. Most voting blocs continued unchanged, but some realignment took place, giving Republicans dominance in the industrial Northeast and new strength in the border states.

They promoted American liberalism, anchored in a coalition of specific liberal groups, especially [[Ethnoreligious group|ethno-religious]] constituencies (Catholics, Jews, African Americans), white Southerners, well-organized labor unions, urban machines, progressive intellectuals, and populist farm groups.\n\nOpposition Republicans were split between a conservative wing, led by [[Ohio]] Senator [[Robert A.

These two parties have won every [[United States presidential election]] since 1852 and have controlled the [[United States Congress]] to some extent [[Divided government in the United States|since at least 1856]]. There are numerous minor, or third parties. The Libertarian, Green, Reform, Independent and other parties have won elections throughout history at different levels, but the success of those parties is sparse.\n\n==Major parties==\n===Democratic Party===\n{{Main|Democratic Party (United States)|History of the United States Democratic Party}}\nThe Democratic Party is one of two major political parties in the U.S.  Founded as the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] in 1792 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Kenneth F.|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. campaigns, elections, and electoral behavior: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zP4wDcT3PeQC|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5489-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zP4wDcT3PeQC&pg=PA176&dq=%22democratic+republican%22+madison+jefferson 176]}}</ref> it is the oldest extant voter-based political party in the world.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jules|last=Witcover|title=Party of the People: A History of the Democrats|url=https://archive.org/details/partyofpeoplehis00witc|url-access=registration|year=2003|chapter=1 | page=[https://archive.org/details/partyofpeoplehis00witc/page/n0 3]}} \"The Democratic Party of the United States, the oldest existing in the world....\"</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Micklethwait|authorlink=John Micklethwait|author2=Wooldridge, Adrian|title=The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America|url=https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick|url-access=registration|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/rightnationconse00mick/page/15 15]}} \"The country possesses the world's oldest written constitution (1787); the Democratic Party has a good claim to being the world's oldest political party.\"</ref>\n\nThe Democratic Party at its founding supported a different set of issues than it presently supports.  From its founding until the mid-20th century, the Democratic Party was the dominant party among white southerners, and as such, was then the party most associated with the defense of slavery. However, following the [[Great Society]] under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Democratic Party became the more progressive party on issues of civil rights, while losing dominance in the Southern states to the Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic Party since 1912 has positioned itself as the liberal party on domestic issues. The economic philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's agenda since 1932. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] controlled the White House until 1968, with the exception of the two terms of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] from 1953\u20131961. Since the mid-20th century, Democrats have generally been in the [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] and currently support [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. Democrats are currently strongest in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in major American urban centers. African-Americans and Latinos tend to be disproportionately Democratic, as do [[trade union]]s.\n\nIn 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million registered voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.<ref name=\"Neuhart20040122\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/columnist/neuharth/2004-01-22-neuharth_x.htm|last=Neuhart|first=Al|title=Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats|work=USA Today|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=January 22, 2004}}</ref> Although his party lost the election for president in 2004, [[Barack Obama]] would later go on to become president in 2009 and continue to be the president until January 2017.  Obama was the 15th Democrat to hold the office, and from the [[2006 United States elections|2006 midterm elections]] until the [[2014 United States elections|2014 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party was also the [[Two-party system|majority party]] in the [[United States Senate]].\n\nA 2011 ''[[USA Today]]'' review of state voter rolls indicates that the number of registered Democrats declined in 25 of 28 states (some states do not register voters by party). During this time, Republican registration also declined, as independent or no preference voting was on the rise.  But in 2011 Democrats numbers shrank 800,000, and from 2008 they were down by 1.7 million, or 3.9%.<ref name=\"Wolf\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-12-22/voters-political-parties/52171688/1|title=Voters leaving Republican, Democratic parties in droves|author=Wolf, Richard|first=|date=December 22, 2011|work=USA Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> In 2018, the Democratic party was the largest in the United States with roughly 60 Million registered members.\n\n===Republican Party===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States)|History of the United States Republican Party}}\nThe Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States of America. Since the 1880s it has been nicknamed (by the media) the \"Grand Old Party\"  or GOP, although it is younger than the Democratic Party.\n\nFounded in 1854 by Northern anti-slavery activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence in 1860 with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who used the party machinery to support victory in the [[American Civil War]]. The GOP dominated national politics during the [[Third Party System]], from 1854 to 1896, and the [[Fourth Party System]] from 1896 to 1932.\n\nSince its founding, the Republican Party has been the more market-oriented of the two American political parties, often favoring policies that aid American business interests.  As a party whose power was once based on the voting power of Union Army veterans, this party has traditionally supported more aggressive defense measures and more lavish veterans' benefits. Today, the Republican Party supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] platform, with further foundations in [[economic liberalism]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and [[social conservatism]].  The Republican Party tends to be strongest in the [[Southern United States]] and the \"[[Flyover country|flyover states]]\", as well as suburban and rural areas in other states.  One significant base of support for the Republican Party is [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]], who have wielded significant power in the party since the early 1970s. Despite having so called \"Christians\" as supporters, ironically, Republicans are mostly known to be war-mongers, who have no issues with profiting from the deaths of the young men and women of America who are soldiers for their nation. I wonder what kind of bombs thse Christian Republicans think Jesus would recommend for the US to use against it's enemies?  \n\nRepublicans at the time of Eisenhower are very different from New a.k.a. Neo-Republicans of the twenty-first century. The policies of Barack Obama were found to be to the right of Richard \"tricky Dick\" Nixon because of how far the spectrum has shifted to the right. What used to be considered centrist thinking in Eisenhower's time is now to the left of Democrats today. Twenty-first century Neo-Republicans generally currently oppose [[social justice]], [[social liberalism]], a [[mixed economy]], and the [[welfare state]], although [[Bill Clinton]] and other [[New Democrats]] (a.k.a. \"Blue Dog\" Democrats, or wolves in sheep's clothing) have pushed for [[free trade]] and [[neoliberalism]], which is seen to have shifted the party rightwards. In fact, the entire political spectrum has shifted to the right since the mid-twentieth century. \"Neo-Republicans\" oppose [[trade union]]s, make it difficult for women seeking an abortion to have easy access to getting one at family planning clinics ans other legal offices and have thrown up legislation which limits where and when a woman may access these services,  thereby lengthening the time the baby stays within the womb and ultimately bringing more unplanned and unwanted children into our already over populated world and doing (God only knows what) damage to our society as a whole.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] is the 18th and the current Republican to be elected to the office of [[President of the United States]]. [[Donald Trump]] is also an excellent example of how far to the right the United States political structure has moved since the death of President Kennedy in 1963. [[Donald Trump]] is supported by people in the U.S.A. so far to the right that they support fascism. Also many Americans were fooled into voting for him because he was a television personality for many years on the show \"The Apprentice.\" This \"cult of personality\" identification and the complete personality facade he put on to generate populist appeal can only explain [[Donald Trump]]'s election to some degree. The fact is, that, once again, [[Donald Trump]] was elected not by the people of the United States, but by the United States Electoral College, a system which is outdated and a majority of U.S. citizens feel should be abolished. Had the U.S. Electoral College system not been in place, neither [[Donald Trump]] nor [[George W. Bush]] would have been made [[President of the United States]]. Moreover, if the United States had a federally mandated [[Ranked voting#Instant-runoff%20voting|Instant-runoff voting]]/[[Ranked voting|ranked preferential]] [[Electoral system|voting method]] which gives a voter had a week to cast their ballot, and every voter was given election day off as a national holiday, then elections in the U.S.A. would be a whole lot more fair and just. However, it's clear that as of Spring 2020, and in the midst of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] neither the New Democrats nor the Neo-Republicans desire either of these things to happen this to happen because it would make them both lose power. Since the [[2010 United States elections|2010 midterm elections]], the Republicans held a majority in the United States House of Representatives until the 2018 midterms where they lost it to the Democratic Party. Additionally, since the 2014 elections, the Republican Party has controlled the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/president|title=2016 Election News, Candidates & Polls|publisher=}}</ref> In 2018, the Republican party had roughly 55 million registered members, making it the second largest party in the United States.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, both the Republican and Democrat parties in the United States operate in the interest of big corporations who fund their re-election campaigns and respond to the citizens of the U.S.A. acting more like rival dominating gang members (with their blue and red rags to identify them) than as elected representatives supposedly serving the will of the people. With only a two party system the citizens of the United States are constantly being forced to decide between the lesser of two evils at all times, in every election. Having a federally mandated [[Ranked voting#Instant-runoff%20voting|Instant-runoff voting]]/[[Ranked voting|ranked preferential]] [[Electoral system|voting method]] in place would solve this problem very efficiently. \n\n==Minor parties==\nThe United States also has an array of minor parties, the largest of which (on the basis of support for their Presidential candidates in the 2016 election), are the Libertarian, Green, and Constitution parties.\n{{Main|List of political parties in the United States}}\n\n===Libertarian Party===\n{{Main|Libertarian Party (United States)}}\nThe Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1971.<ref>[http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml Libertarian Party:Our History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130133301/http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml |date=2006-01-30 }}, LP.org</ref> It is the largest continuing [[third party (United States)|third party]] in the United States, claiming well over 500,000 registered voters across all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2017/07/27/new-registration-data-for-the-united-states/|title=New Voter Registration Nation Totals|first=Richard|last=Winger|date=27 July 2017|work=ballot-access.org|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref> As of 2019, they have about 176 elected officials, including 1 state legislator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/elected-officials/|title=Elected Officials|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was former New Mexico governor, [[Gary Johnson]].

It calls for protectionist trade policies.\n\nIn 2006, [[Rick Jore]] of [[Montana]] became the first Constitution Party candidate elected to a state-level office,<ref>[http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp \"State Legislature results\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116040533/http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp |date=2006-11-16 }}, ''Missoulian'', November 8, 2006, retrieved November 8, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.helenair.com/articles/2006/11/09/montana/a01110906_02.txt Control of state Legislature unclear], ''Helena Independent Record''</ref> though the Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the national party a short time before the election.\n\nIn 2010 former Congressman [[Tom Tancredo]] was the Constitution Party candidate for governor of [[Colorado]], coming in second with 617,030 votes, 36.4% and ahead of the Republican candidate, Dan Maes, with 11.1%.\n\nThe Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee was former Congressman [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia.\n\nTennessee Attorney [[Darrell Castle]] was the 2016 Constitution Party nominee for President of the United States and Scott Bradley of Utah was the nominee for Vice President.\n\n==Issues==\n{{See also|Left\u2013right political spectrum#Contemporary usage in the United States|label 1=Usage of \"left\u2013right\" politics in the United States|Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties|label 2=Organization of American political parties}}\n\nBecause American political parties are more loosely organized than those in other countries, not all members of a party subscribe to all of the officially held positions in their respective [[party platform|party's platform]]. The usual degree of variation generally is higher for the larger parties. Party members may hold different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal levels, and an elected official once in office may act contradictory to many of his or her party's positions (this has led to terms such as \"[[Republican In Name Only]]\" and \"[[Democrat In Name Only]]\" \u2013 RINO and DINO, respectively). Furthermore, the modern American [[political spectrum]], and the usage of [[Left\u2013right political spectrum|left\u2013right politics]], differs from the rest of the world. For example, the Democratic Party, the primary left-of-center party in the country, generally supports a [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] position rather than a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] one, though there are exceptions.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Critchlow, Donald T.
