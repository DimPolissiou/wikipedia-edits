During his high school years in Athens, he also worked as a pharmacy employee. He was admitted to the [[Athens University of Economics and Business|Higher School of Economic and Commercial Studies]] (known today as the Athens University of Economics and Business) in 1940. In 1939, still a high school student, Glezos participated in the creation of an [[anti-fascist]] youth group against the Italian occupation of the [[Dodecanese]] and the dictatorship of [[Ioannis Metaxas]]. At the onset of World War II, he volunteered to join the Greek army in the Albanian front against Italy but was rejected because he was underage. Instead, he worked as a volunteer for the Hellenic Ministry of Economics. During the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], he worked for the Hellenic [[Red Cross]] and the municipality of Athens, while actively involved in the [[Greek Resistance|resistance]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-164-0368-04, Athen, Hakenkreuzflagge auf der Akropolis.jpg|thumb|The swastika on the Akropolis]]According to popular tradition, on 27 April 1941 [[Konstantinos Koukidis]] was ordered to lower the Greek flag, and raise the Nazi swastika flag. Koukidis allegedly lowered the flag and jumped from the Acropolis holding it, rather than raise the Nazi flag.\n\nOn 30 May 1941 Glezos and [[Apostolos Santas]] climbed on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] and tore down the [[Flag of Nazi Germany|swastika]], which had been there since 27 April 1941, when the Nazi forces had entered Athens. It inspired not only the Greeks, but all subjected people, to resist the occupation, and established them both as two international anti-Nazi heroes. The Nazi regime responded by sentencing the perpetrators to death ''in absentia,'' but they did not learn who they were until much later. Glezos was [[arrest]]ed by the German occupation forces on 24 March 1942 and was subjected to imprisonment and torture. As a result of his treatment, he was affected by [[tuberculosis]]. He was arrested on 21 April 1943 by the Italian occupation forces and spent three months in jail.\n\n== Career and political activism ==\n\n=== Post-war period ===\n[[File:Manolis Glezos Soviet stamp.jpg|thumb|Glezos on a 1959 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] postage stamp.]]\nThe end of World War II was not the end of Glezos' plight. On 3 March 1948, in the midst of the [[Greek Civil War]], he was put to trial for his political convictions and sentenced to death multiple times by the national government. His death penalties were reduced to a life sentence in 1950. Even though he was still imprisoned, Manolis Glezos was elected member of the Hellenic Parliament in 1951, under the flag of the [[United Democratic Left]], also known as EDA ({{lang|el|\u0395\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac, \u0395\u0394\u0391}}). Upon his election, he went on a [[hunger strike]] demanding the release of his fellow EDA MPs that were imprisoned or exiled in the Greek islands. He ended his hunger strike upon the release of 7 MPs from their exile. He was released from prison on 16 July 1954.\n\nOn 5 December 1958, he was arrested again and convicted of [[espionage]], which was the common pretext for the persecution of the supporters of the left during the [[Cold War]]. The [[Soviet Union]] reacted circulating a postage stamp with Glezos, while the Greek government responded with a postage stamp depicting [[Imre Nagy]]. His release on 15 December 1962 was a result of the public outcry in Greece and abroad, including winning the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. During his second term of post-war political imprisonment, Glezos was reelected MP with EDA in 1961. At the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of 21 April 1967, Glezos was arrested at 2 am, together with the rest of the political leaders. During the ''[[Regime of the Colonels]]'', the military dictatorship led by [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]], he was imprisoned and [[Exile|exiled]] until his release in 1971.\n\nManolis Glezos' sentences, from the Second World War to the [[Greek Civil War]] and the ''Regime of the Colonels'' total 11 years and 4 months of imprisonment, and 4 years and 6 months of exile.\n\n=== Since 1974 ===\nAfter the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374#Collapse|restoration of democracy in Greece]] in 1974, Glezos participated in the reviving of EDA. In the elections of [[1981 Greek legislative election|October 1981]] and [[1985 Greek legislative election|June 1985]], he was elected Member of the [[Greek Parliament]], on a  [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) ticket. In 1984 he was elected Member of the [[European Parliament]], again on a PASOK ticket. He was the President of EDA from 1985 until 1989. In the meantime, in 1986, he withdrew from the Parliament, in order to try to implement a [[grassroots democracy]] experiment. He did so in the community of [[Aperathu]], where he was elected as the President of the Community Council in 1986 elections. He then essentially abolished the privileges of the council, introducing a \"[[constitution]]\" and establishing a local [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]] that had total control over the community administration. This model worked for several years, but in the long term the interest of the rest of his community wore off and the assembly was abandoned. Glezos remained the President until 1989.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} \n\nIn the [[2000 Greek legislative election]] he led the list of [[Synaspismos]] (in English ''Coalition'') party of the radical left. In 2002, he formed the political group [[Active Citizens]] (which is part of [[Coalition of the Radical Left]], an alliance with [[Synaspismos]] and other minor parties of the Greek left) and he ran as a candidate prefect for [[Attica]].\n\nIn March 2010, Glezos was participating in a protest demonstration in Athens, when he was hit in the face by a police tear gas canister. He was carried away injured.<ref name=\"Teargas incident BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8551227.stm|title= Greece does not need financial aid, says Angela Merkel|date=2010-03-05|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2012, Glezos was arrested by riot police while protesting in Athens.<ref name=\"Teargas incident Twitter\">{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/VeriasA/status/168855869260443648/photo/1|title= Man who ripped down swastika in Athens arrested|date=2010-03-05|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> He was sprayed with tear gas by one of the police officers in that area.\n\nIn the June 2012 parliamentary election, Glezos was elected as MP of the [[Coalition of Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) party.\n\nGlezos was a SYRIZA candidate for the [[European Parliament]] in the [[2014 European Parliament election in Greece|elections of 25 May 2014]]. He was elected to the European Parliament with over 430,000 votes, more than any other candidate in Greece.

As an MEP he also participated in a support protest in Brussels, along with thousands of Belgians<ref> RT video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26kEcfSHpo \"Thousands of Belgians support Greek OHI (No)\"] (03/07/2015)</ref> in favour of Greeks voting negatively in the referendum, a few days before the latter takes place.<ref> Solidarity protest in Brussels (03/07/2015). See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQoMnPr3V_w video] </ref> \nHe resigned from his position in the European Parliament in July 2015, being succeeded by [[Nikolaos Chountis]]. The same year, he left SYRIZA before the [[September 2015 Greek legislative election|September 2015 Greek election]], where he was an MP candidate with the newly-formed [[Popular Unity (Greece)|Popular Unity]] party.\n\nIn 2018, Manolis Glezos publicly voiced his opposition to the [[Prespa Agreement]] between Athens and Skopje on the resolution of the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] -despite the agreement being promoted by the SYRIZA government party which he formerly supported. In an article for the Greek daily paper ''[[Kathimerini]]'', he insisted that the people of the [[North Macedonia|neighbouring country]] should \"define themselves in accordance with their history, language, traditions... taking out of their mind the word Macedonia\". <ref> Greek City Times, Resistance icon Glezos to Skopje:  [https://greekcitytimes.com/2018/02/13/greek-resistance-icon-glezos-to-skopje-take-out-of-your-mind-the-word-macedonia-3/?amp|\"Take out of your mind the word Macedonia\"]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.kathimerini.gr/948102/article/epikairothta/politikh/ar8ro-manwlh-glezoy-sthn-k-ypografoyn-grammatia-poy-den-mporoyn-na-e3oflhsoyn|author=Manolis Glezos|newspaper=[[Kathimerini]]|date=2018-02-11|language=Greek|title=\u0391\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bb\u03b7 \u0393\u03bb\u03ad\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u00ab\u039a\u00bb: \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03be\u03bf\u03c6\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd|trans-title=Article by Manolis Glezos in \u00abK\u00bb: they are signing checks which cannot be redeemed|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>.\n\n== Non-political career ==\nApart from his political work, Glezos invented a system to prevent [[flood]]s, combat [[erosion]] and preserve underground [[water]], that works by the constructions of a series of very small dams that redirect water to [[aquifer]]s. For his contributions to democracy, to geological sciences, and to linguistics he was pronounced honorary Doctor of Philosophy of the [[University of Patras]] (Department of Geology) in 1996, of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] (Department of Civil Engineering) in 2001, of the [[National Technical University of Athens]] (School of Mining & Metallurgical Engineering) in 2003, and of the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]] (School of Philosophy) in 2008.\n==Death==\n\nOn 30 March 2020, Glezos died of heart failure. [[Alexis Tsipras]] said, \"He will remain for all eternity the symbol of a fighter who knew how to sacrifice himself for people.\"<ref name=death>{{cite news |title=Veteran leftist and resistance fighter Manolis Glezos dies at 98 |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/251143/article/ekathimerini/news/veteran-leftist-and-resistance-fighter-manolis-glezos-dies-at-98 |accessdate=30 March 2020 |work=Kathimerini  |language=English}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\nGlezos wrote articles in Greek newspapers since 1942 and was the editor of the newspapers ''[[Rizospastis]]'' and ''[[I Avgi]]'' in the 1950s.

At the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of 21 April 1967, Glezos was arrested at 2 am, together with the rest of the political leaders. During the ''[[Regime of the Colonels]]'', the military dictatorship led by [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]], he was imprisoned and [[Exile|exiled]] until his release in 1971.\n\nManolis Glezos' sentences, from the Second World War to the [[Greek Civil War]] and the ''Regime of the Colonels'' total 11 years and 4 months of imprisonment, and 4 years and 6 months of exile.\n\n=== Since 1974 ===\nAfter the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374#Collapse|restoration of democracy in Greece]] in 1974, Glezos participated in the reviving of EDA. In the elections of [[1981 Greek legislative election|October 1981]] and [[1985 Greek legislative election|June 1985]], he was elected Member of the [[Greek Parliament]], on a  [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) ticket. In 1984 he was elected Member of the [[European Parliament]], again on a PASOK ticket. He was the President of EDA from 1985 until 1989. In the meantime, in 1986, he withdrew from the Parliament, in order to try to implement a [[grassroots democracy]] experiment. He did so in the community of [[Aperathu]], where he was elected as the President of the Community Council in 1986 elections. He then essentially abolished the privileges of the council, introducing a \"[[constitution]]\" and establishing a local [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]] that had total control over the community administration. This model worked for several years, but in the long term the interest of the rest of his community wore off and the assembly was abandoned. Glezos remained the President until 1989.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} \n\nIn the [[2000 Greek legislative election]] he led the list of [[Synaspismos]] (in English ''Coalition'') party of the radical left. In 2002, he formed the political group [[Active Citizens]] (which is part of [[Coalition of the Radical Left]], an alliance with [[Synaspismos]] and other minor parties of the Greek left) and he ran as a candidate prefect for [[Attica]].\n\nIn March 2010, Glezos was participating in a protest demonstration in Athens, when he was hit in the face by a police tear gas canister. He was carried away injured.<ref name=\"Teargas incident BBC\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8551227.stm|title= Greece does not need financial aid, says Angela Merkel|date=2010-03-05|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2012, Glezos was arrested by riot police while protesting in Athens.<ref name=\"Teargas incident Twitter\">{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/VeriasA/status/168855869260443648/photo/1|title= Man who ripped down swastika in Athens arrested|date=2010-03-05|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> He was sprayed with tear gas by one of the police officers in that area.\n\nIn the June 2012 parliamentary election, Glezos was elected as MP of the [[Coalition of Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) party.\n\nGlezos was a SYRIZA candidate for the [[European Parliament]] in the [[2014 European Parliament election in Greece|elections of 25 May 2014]].

The same year, he left SYRIZA before the [[Setember 2015 Greek legislative election|September 2015 Greek election]], where he was an MP candidate with the newly-formed \"[[Popular Unity ( Greece)|Popular Unity]]\" party.\n\nIn 2018, Manolis Glezos publicly voiced his opposition to the [[Prespa Agreement]] between Athens and Skopje on the resolution of the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] -despite the agreement being promoted by the SYRIZA government party which he formerly supported.

Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March.

The group recorded the album at RCA Studios in California in December 1965 and March 1966, during breaks between their international tours. It was released in the United Kingdom on 15 April 1966 by [[Decca Records]] and in the United States on 2 July by [[London Records]]. It is the band's fourth British and sixth American studio album, and follows closely after a series of international hit singles that helped bring the Stones newfound wealth and popularity that rivalled their contemporaries, [[the Beatles]].\n\nThe album is considered by music scholars to be an artistic breakthrough for the Rolling Stones. It is their first to consist entirely of original compositions, all of which were credited to [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]]. [[Brian Jones]] emerged as a key contributor and experimented with instruments not usually associated with [[popular music]], including the [[sitar]], [[Appalachian dulcimer]], Japanese [[Koto (instrument)|koto]] and [[marimba]]s, as well as guitar and harmonica. Along with Jones' instrumental textures, the Stones incorporated a wider range of [[chord (music)|chord]]s and stylistic elements beyond their [[Chicago blues]] and [[R&B]] influences, such as [[pop music|pop]], [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Middle Eastern music]]. Influenced in part by intense love affairs outside the band and their demanding touring itinerary, Jagger and Richards wrote the album around [[psychodramatic]] themes of love, sex, desire, [[Expressions of dominance|power and dominance]], hate, obsession, [[modern society]] and [[pop icon|rock stardom]]. Women feature as prominent characters in their often dark, sarcastic, casually offensive lyrics.\n\nThe album's release was briefly delayed by controversy over the proposed packaging and title \u2013 ''Could You Walk on the Water?'' \u2013 by the Stones' manager/producer [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. Decca and London rejected his idea, fearing the allusion to [[Jesus walking on water]] would provoke a negative reaction from [[Christianity in the United States|Christians in the US]]. In response to the lack of [[creative control]], and without another idea for the title, the Stones bitterly settled on ''Aftermath'', and two different photos of the band were used for the cover to each edition of the album. The UK release featured a run-time of approximately 54 minutes, the longest for a popular music [[LP record|LP]] up to that point. The American edition was issued with a shorter track listing, substituting the [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" in place of four of the British version's songs, in keeping with the industry preference for shorter LPs in the US market at the time.\n\n''Aftermath'' was an immediate commercial success in both the UK and the US, topping the [[UK Albums Chart|British albums chart]] for eight consecutive weeks and eventually achieving [[RIAA certification|platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Rivalling the contemporaneous impact of the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), the album reflected the [[youth culture]] and values of 1960s [[Swinging London]] and the burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] while attracting thousands of new fans to the Rolling Stones. An inaugural release of the [[album era]], it marked the beginnings of the LP replacing the single as popular music's dominant product and artistic medium. The album was also highly successful with critics, although some listeners were offended by the derisive attitudes towards female characters in certain songs. Its subversive music solidified the band's rebellious rock image while pioneering the darker psychological and social content that [[glam rock]] and British [[punk rock]] would explore in the 1970s. ''Aftermath'' has since been considered the most important of the Stones' early, formative music and their first classic album, frequently ranking on professional lists of the greatest albums.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1965, [[the Rolling Stones]]' popularity increased markedly with a series of international hit singles written by the band's lead singer [[Mick Jagger]] and their guitarist [[Keith Richards]].<ref>{{harvnb|Perone|2012|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Erlewine|n.d.}}.</ref> This success attracted the attention of [[Allen Klein]], an American businessman who became their US representative in August while [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], the group's manager, continued in the role of promoter and record producer.<ref>{{harvnb|Charone|1979|pp=75\u201376}}; {{harvnb|Bockris|1992|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Norman|2001|p=176}}.</ref> One of Klein's first actions on the band's behalf was to force [[Decca Records]] to grant a $1.2 million royalty advance to the group, bringing the members their first signs of financial wealth and allowing them to purchase country houses and new cars.{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=134}} Their [[The Rolling Stones 1965 tours#2nd American tour|October\u2013December 1965 tour of North America]] was the group's fourth and largest tour there up to that point.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=208}} According to the biographer [[Victor Bockris]], through Klein's involvement, the concerts afforded the band \"more publicity, more protection and higher fees than ever before\".{{sfn|Bockris|1992|p=69}}\n\n{{quote box|quoted = 1|quote=In 1966, inspired by the formidable women around them, driven by the twin engines of ambition and drugs, the Rolling Stones continued a run of visionary hit singles and began to release albums that stood as crucial works of the era.

This time we were able to relax a little, take our time.\"{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=213}} The main engineer for the album, [[David Hassinger|Dave Hassinger]], was pivotal in making the group feel comfortable during the sessions, as he let them experiment with instrumentals and team up with session musicians like [[Jack Nitzsche]] to variegate their sound. Wyman recalled that Nitzsche and Jones would pick up instruments that were in the studio and experiment with sounds for each song. According to Jagger, Richards was writing a lot of melodies and the group would perform them in different ways, which were mainly thought out in the studio.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=100}} In the recollection of the engineer [[Denny Bruce]], the songs often developed through Nitzsche organising the musical ideas on piano.{{sfn|Trynka|2015|p=177}} Wyman was later critical of Oldham for nurturing Jagger and Richards as songwriters to the exclusion of the rest of the band.{{sfn|Charone|1979|p=84}} The bassist also complained that \"Paint It, Black\" should have been credited to the band's collective pseudonym, [[Nanker Phelge]], rather than Jagger\u2013Richards, since the song originated from a studio improvisation by himself, Jones and Watts, with Jones providing the melody line.<ref>{{harvnb|Wyman|2002|p=234}}; {{harvnb|Trynka|2015|p=187}}.</ref>\n\nJones proved important in shaping the album's tone and arrangements, as he experimented with instruments that were unusual in [[popular music]], such as the [[marimba]], [[sitar]] and [[Appalachian dulcimer]].{{sfn|Norman|2001|p=197}} Davis cites the \"acid imagery and exotic influences\" on ''Rubber Soul'', particularly [[George Harrison]]'s use of the Indian sitar on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]\", as the inspiration for Jones' experimentation with the instrument in January 1966: \"One night George put the massive sitar in Brian's hands, and within an hour Brian was working out little melodies.\"{{sfn|Davis|2001|pp=155\u201356}} According to Nitzsche, Jones deserved a co-writing credit for \"[[Under My Thumb]]\", which Nitzsche recalled as being an unoriginal-sounding three-chord sequence until Jones discovered a Mexican marimba left behind from a previous session, and transformed the piece by providing its central [[riff]].{{sfn|Trynka|2015|pp=185\u201386}} Wyman agreed, saying, \"Well, without the marimba part, it's not really a song, is it?\"{{sfn|Trynka|2015|p=187}}\n\n[[File:Dulcimercilp.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An orange-brown coloured Appalachian dulcimer laid out on a light blue cloth|An [[Appalachian dulcimer]], one of several instruments Jones introduced to the Stones' sound for the album]]\n\nDuring the recording sessions, Richards and Oldham dismissed Jones' interest in exotic instrumentation as an affectation.{{sfn|Trynka|2015|p=188}} According to the music journalist [[Barbara Charone]], writing in 1979, everyone connected with the Stones credited Jones for \"literally transforming certain records with some odd magical instrument\".{{sfn|Charone|1979|p=83}} While Nitzsche was shocked at how cruelly they treated Jones, he later said that Jones was sometimes absent or incapacitated by drugs.<ref>{{harvnb|Trynka|2015|pp=177\u201378}}; {{harvnb|Charone|1979|p=85}}.</ref> Hassinger recalled seeing Jones often \"laying on the floor, stoned or on some trip\" and unable to play, but that his bandmates would wait for him to leave rather than entering into an argument as other bands would.{{sfn|Charone|1979|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nBecause of Jones' distractions, Richards ended up playing most of the guitar parts for ''Aftermath'', making it one of the first albums to have him do so. Richards later said he found the challenge musically rewarding but resented Jones for his unprofessional attitude when the band were under extreme pressure to record and maintain a hectic touring schedule.<ref>{{harvnb|Charone|1979|p=85}}; {{harvnb|Bockris|1992|pp=70\u201371}}.</ref> On some songs, Richards supported Wyman's bass lines with a [[fuzz bass]] part, which the music historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon suggest was influenced by [[Paul McCartney]]'s use on the track \"[[Think for Yourself]]\" from the Beatles' ''Rubber Soul'' album.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|pp=149, 152, 155}} ''Aftermath'' was also the first Stones LP to be recorded in true [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]], as opposed to [[Stereophonic sound#Pseudo-stereo|electronically recreated stereo]].{{sfn|Fremer|2010}}\n\n== Musical style ==\nAccording to the musicologist David Malvinni, ''Aftermath'' is the culmination of the Rolling Stones' stylistic development dating back to 1964, a synthesis of previously explored sounds from the [[blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]], [[folk rock]] and [[pop ballad]]s.{{sfn|Malvinni|2016|p=43}} Margotin and Guesdon go further in saying the album shows the Stones to be free from influences that had overwhelmed their earlier music, specifically the band's [[Chicago blues]] roots.

Not all dumb, not by any means, but that's how one got. You got really cut off.\"{{sfn|Bockris|1992|p=70}}\n\nIn Guesdon and Margotin's view, the Stones express a more compassionate attitude towards women in \"Mother's Little Helper\", which examines a [[housewife]]'s reliance on [[pharmaceutical drugs]] to cope with her daily life, and in \"Lady Jane\"'s story of romantic [[courtship]].{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|p=138}} By contrast, Davis writes of ''Aftermath'' containing a \"blatant attack on motherhood\" and says that \"Mother's Little Helper\" addresses \"tranquilised suburban housewives\".{{sfn|Davis|2001|pp=161\u201362}} According to Hassinger, his wife Marie provided the inspiration for \"Mother's Little Helper\" when she supplied some [[Depressant|downers]] in response to a request from one of the studio staff.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|p=142}} Davis likens \"Lady Jane\" to a [[Tudor period|Tudor]] love song with lyrics apparently inspired by [[Henry VIII]]'s love letters to [[Lady Jane Seymour]].{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=162}} Some listeners assumed the song was about Jagger's high-society friend Jane Ormsby-Gore, daughter of [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech]].{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=162}} In what the music journalist [[Chris Salewicz]] terms a \"disingenuous\" claim, Jagger told Shrimpton that \"Lady Jane\" was written for her.{{sfn|Salewicz|2002|p=106}}\n\nOverall, the darker themes lead Margotin and Guesdon to call ''Aftermath'' \"a sombre album in which desolation, paranoia, despair and frustration are echoed as track succeeds track\".{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|p=138}} According to [[Steven Hyden]], Jagger's songwriting explores \"sex as pleasure, sex as [[Power (social and political)|power]], love disguised as hate and hate disguised as love\".{{sfn|Hyden|2008}} Moon believes the time period's [[flower power]] ideology is recast in a dark light on \"these tough, lean, desperately lonely songs\", while Norman calls them \"songs of callow male triumph\" in which Jagger alternately displays childlike charm and misogynistic scorn.<ref>{{harvnb|Moon|2004|p=697}}; {{harvnb|Norman|2001|p=197}}.</ref> While songs such as \"Stupid Girl\" and \"Under My Thumb\" may be misogynistic, they are also interpreted as dark representations of the narrator's hateful masculinity.

However, the band uses musical connections between songs as well as the subtheme of travel, the use of feline metaphors for women and other lyrical connections to suggest that the characters whom lead singer Mick Jagger portrays throughout the album are really one and perhaps stem from the deep recesses of his psyche.{{sfn|Perone|2012|pp=91\u201392}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Carnaby Street, London in 1968.jpg|thumb|right|''Swinging London'', [[Carnaby Street]], c. 1968.

The group recorded the album at RCA Studios in California in December 1965 and March 1966, during breaks between their international tours. It was released in the United Kingdom on 15 April 1966 by [[Decca Records]] and in the United States on 2 July by [[London Records]]. It is the band's fourth British and sixth American studio album, and follows closely after a series of international hit singles that helped bring the Stones newfound wealth and popularity that rivalled their contemporaries, [[the Beatles]].\n\nThe album is considered by music scholars to be an artistic breakthrough for the Rolling Stones. It is their first to consist entirely of original compositions, all of which were credited to [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]]. [[Brian Jones]] emerged as a key contributor and experimented with instruments not usually associated with [[popular music]], including the [[sitar]], [[Appalachian dulcimer]], Japanese [[Koto (instrument)|koto]] and [[marimba]]s, as well as guitar and harmonica. Along with Jones' instrumental textures, the Stones incorporated a wider range of [[chord (music)|chord]]s and stylistic elements beyond their [[Chicago blues]] and [[R&B]] influences, such as [[pop music|pop]], [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Middle Eastern music]]. Influenced in part by intense love affairs outside the band and their demanding touring itinerary, Jagger and Richards wrote the album around [[psychodramatic]] themes of love, sex, desire, [[Expressions of dominance|power and dominance]], hate, obsession, [[modern society]] and [[pop icon|rock stardom]]. Women feature as prominent characters in their often dark, sarcastic, casually offensive lyrics.\n\nThe album's release was briefly delayed by controversy over the proposed packaging and title \u2013 ''Could You Walk on the Water?'' \u2013 by the Stones' manager/producer [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. Decca and London rejected his idea, fearing the allusion to [[Jesus walking on water]] would provoke a negative reaction from [[Christianity in the United States|Christians in the US]]. In response to the lack of [[creative control]], and without another idea for the title, the Stones bitterly settled on ''Aftermath'', and two different photos of the band were used for the cover to each edition of the album. The UK release featured a run-time of approximately 54 minutes, the longest for a popular music [[LP record|LP]] up to that point. The American edition was issued with a shorter track listing, substituting the [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" in place of four of the British version's songs, in keeping with the industry preference for shorter LPs in the US market at the time.\n\n''Aftermath'' was an immediate commercial success in both the UK and the US, topping the [[UK Albums Chart|British albums chart]] for eight consecutive weeks and eventually achieving [[RIAA certification|platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Rivalling the contemporaneous impact of the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), the album reflected the [[youth culture]] and values of 1960s [[Swinging London]] and the burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] while attracting thousands of new fans to the Rolling Stones. An inaugural release of the [[album era]], it marked the beginnings of the LP replacing the single as popular music's dominant product and artistic medium. The album was also highly successful with critics, although some listeners were offended by the derisive attitudes towards female characters in certain songs. Its subversive music solidified the band's rebellious rock image while pioneering the darker psychological and social content that [[glam rock]] and British [[punk rock]] would explore in the 1970s. ''Aftermath'' has since been considered the most important of the Stones' early, formative music and their first classic album, frequently ranking on professional lists of the greatest albums.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1965, [[the Rolling Stones]]' popularity increased markedly with a series of international hit singles written by the band's lead singer [[Mick Jagger]] and their guitarist [[Keith Richards]].<ref>{{harvnb|Perone|2012|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Erlewine|n.d.}}.</ref> This success attracted the attention of [[Allen Klein]], an American businessman who became their US representative in August while [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], the group's manager, continued in the role of promoter and record producer.<ref>{{harvnb|Charone|1979|pp=75\u201376}}; {{harvnb|Bockris|1992|p=69}}; {{harvnb|Norman|2001|p=176}}.</ref> One of Klein's first actions on the band's behalf was to force [[Decca Records]] to grant a $1.2 million royalty advance to the group, bringing the members their first signs of financial wealth and allowing them to purchase country houses and new cars.{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=134}} Their [[The Rolling Stones 1965 tours#2nd American tour|October\u2013December 1965 tour of North America]] was the group's fourth and largest tour there up to that point.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=208}} According to the biographer [[Victor Bockris]], through Klein's involvement, the concerts afforded the band \"more publicity, more protection and higher fees than ever before\".{{sfn|Bockris|1992|p=69}}\n\n{{quote box|quoted = 1|quote=In 1966, inspired by the formidable women around them, driven by the twin engines of ambition and drugs, the Rolling Stones continued a run of visionary hit singles and began to release albums that stood as crucial works of the era. The influence of a powerful new female energy on the Stones was undeniable \u2026 At the same time, it was the era of '[[Stupid Girl (Rolling Stones song)|Stupid Girl]]' and '[[Under My Thumb]],' [[misogynist]] songs of [[Expressions of dominance|dominance]] set to the Stones' darkest, most ardent music.|source=\u2014[[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]] (2001){{sfn|Davis|2001|p=155}}|width=24%|align=left|style=padding:8px;|border=1px}}\n\nBy this time, the Rolling Stones had begun to respond to the increasingly sophisticated music of [[the Beatles]], to whom they had long been promoted by Oldham as a rougher alternative.<ref>{{harvnb|Erlewine|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Simonelli|2013|pp=44\u201345}}; {{harvnb|Philo|2015|p=71}}.</ref> With the success of the Jagger-Richards-penned singles \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" (1965), \"[[Get Off of My Cloud]]\" (1965) and \"[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]\" (1966), the band increasingly rivalled the Beatles' musical and cultural influence.{{sfn|Williams|2002}} The Stones' outspoken, surly attitude on songs like \"Satisfaction\" alienated [[the establishment]] detractors of [[rock music]], which, as the music historian Colin King explains, \"only made the group more appealing to those sons and daughters who found themselves estranged from the hypocrisies of the adult world \u2013 an element that would solidify into an increasingly militant and disenchanted [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] as the decade wore on.\"{{sfn|King|2004|=68}} Like other contemporary British and American rock acts, with ''Aftermath'' the Stones sought to create an album as an artistic statement, inspired by the Beatles' achievements with their December 1965 release ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' \u2013 an [[LP record|LP]] that Oldham later described as having \"changed the musical world we lived in then to the one we still live in today\".<ref>{{harvnb|Simonelli|2013|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Kubernik|2015}}.</ref>\n\nWithin the Stones, tensions were rife as [[Brian Jones]] continued to be viewed by fans and the press as the band's leader, a situation that Jagger and Oldham resented.<ref>{{harvnb|Salewicz|2002|p=98}}; {{harvnb|Trynka|2015|p=180}}.</ref> The group dynamics were also affected by some of the band members' romantic entanglements.{{sfn|Davis|2001|pp=155\u201356}} Jones' new relationship with the German model [[Anita Pallenberg]], which had taken on [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] aspects, helped renew his confidence and encourage him to experiment musically, while her intelligence and sophistication both intimidated and elicited envy from the other Stones.{{sfn|Davis|2001|pp=147, 155\u201356}} Jagger came to view his girlfriend, [[Chrissie Shrimpton]], as inadequate by comparison; while Jagger sought a more glamorous companion commensurate with his newfound wealth, the aura surrounding Jones and Pallenberg contributed to the end of his and Shrimpton's increasingly acrimonious relationship.<ref>{{harvnb|Salewicz|2002|p=98}}; {{harvnb|Norman|2001|pp=197, 201}}.</ref> Richards' relationship with [[Linda Keith]] also deteriorated as her drug use escalated to include [[Methaqualone|Mandrax]] and heroin.{{sfn|Salewicz|2002|p=99}} The band's biographer [[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]] describes these entanglements as a \"revolution under way within the Stones\", adding that \"Anita Pallenberg restored the faltering Brian Jones to his place in the band and in the Rolling Stones mythos.

He also notes how Richards' guitar riff and solo on the latter track are \"minimalistic, in a fairly low [[tessitura]] and relatively emotionless\", compared to previous Stones hits like \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\", \"Get Off of My Cloud\" and \"19th Nervous Breakdown\".{{sfn|Perone|2012|pp=95-96}}\n\n== Lyrics and themes ==\n{{quote box|quoted = 1|quote=It was almost as if women in all their contradictory humanity symbolised the conditions of life that were the ultimate target of the Stones' anger.|source=\u2014An unnamed music critic (c. 1966){{sfn|Bockris|1992|p=70}}|width=24%|align=left|style=padding:8px;|border=1px}}\n\n''Aftermath''{{'}}s diverse musical style contrasts the dark themes explored in Jagger and Richards' lyrics, which often scorn female lovers. Margotin and Gueson say that Jagger, who had been accused of misogyny before the album, is avenging real-life grievances with the songs, using \"language and imagery that had the power to hurt\". \"[[Stupid Girl (The Rolling Stones song)|Stupid Girl]]\", which assails the \"supposed greed and facile certitudes of women\", is speculated by the writers to indirectly criticise Shrimpton. \"High and Dry\" expresses a cynical outlook on a lost romantic connection, while \"Under My Thumb\", \"Out of Time\" and \"Think\" show how \"a man's revenge on his mistress (or perhaps wife) becomes a source of real pleasure\".{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|p=138}} Shrimpton was devastated by the lyrics to \"Out of Time\", in which Jagger sings, \"You're obsolete, my baby, my poor old-fashioned baby\".{{sfn|Salewicz|2002|pp=103, 107}}{{refn|group=nb|She was also devastated by the withering depiction of a neurotic girl in \"19th Nervous Breakdown\".{{sfn|Salewicz|2002|pp=103, 107}}}} Savage views such songs as evoking \"the nastiness of the Rolling Stones' constructed image\" in lyrical form by capturing Jagger's antipathy towards Shrimpton, whom he describes as a \"feisty upper-middle-class girl who gave as good as she got\".{{sfn|Savage|2015|p=72}} Conceding that [[male chauvinism]] became a key theme of the Stones' lyrics from late 1965 onwards, Richards later told Bockris: \"It was all a spin-off from our environment ... hotels and too many dumb chicks. Not all dumb, not by any means, but that's how one got. You got really cut off.\"{{sfn|Bockris|1992|p=70}}\n\nIn Guesdon and Margotin's view, the Stones express a more compassionate attitude towards women in \"Mother's Little Helper\", which examines a [[housewife]]'s reliance on [[pharmaceutical drugs]] to cope with her daily life, and in \"Lady Jane\"'s story of romantic [[courtship]].{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|p=138}} By contrast, Davis writes of ''Aftermath'' containing a \"blatant attack on motherhood\" and says that \"Mother's Little Helper\" addresses \"tranquilised suburban housewives\".{{sfn|Davis|2001|pp=161\u201362}} According to Hassinger, his wife Marie provided the inspiration for \"Mother's Little Helper\" when she supplied some [[Depressant|downers]] in response to a request from one of the studio staff.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|p=142}} Davis likens \"Lady Jane\" to a [[Tudor period|Tudor]] love song with lyrics apparently inspired by [[Henry VIII]]'s love letters to [[Lady Jane Seymour]].{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=162}} Some listeners assumed the song was about Jagger's high-society friend Jane Ormsby-Gore, daughter of [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech]].{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=162}} In what the music journalist [[Chris Salewicz]] terms a \"disingenuous\" claim, Jagger told Shrimpton that \"Lady Jane\" was written for her.{{sfn|Salewicz|2002|p=106}}\n\nOverall, the darker themes lead Margotin and Guesdon to call ''Aftermath'' \"a sombre album in which desolation, paranoia, despair and frustration are echoed as track succeeds track\".{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|p=138}} According to [[Steven Hyden]], Jagger's songwriting explores \"sex as pleasure, sex as [[Power (social and political)|power]], love disguised as hate and hate disguised as love\".{{sfn|Hyden|2008}} Moon believes the time period's [[flower power]] ideology is recast in a dark light on \"these tough, lean, desperately lonely songs\", while Norman calls them \"songs of callow male triumph\" in which Jagger alternately displays childlike charm and misogynistic scorn.<ref>{{harvnb|Moon|2004|p=697}}; {{harvnb|Norman|2001|p=197}}.</ref> While songs such as \"Stupid Girl\" and \"Under My Thumb\" may be misogynistic, they are also interpreted as dark representations of the narrator's hateful masculinity. Misogyny, as on \"Under My Thumb\", \"may be just a tool for restoring the fragile narcissism and arrogance of the male narrator\", muses the music scholar Norma Coates.<ref>{{harvnb|Hyden|2008}}; {{harvnb|Coates|2019}}.</ref> Referring to the American version of the LP, Perone identifies numerous musical and lyrical features that lend ''Aftermath'' a conceptual unity which, although not sufficient for it to be considered a [[concept album]], allows for the record to be understood \"as a psychodrama around the theme of love, desire and obsession that never quite turns out right\", or \"as part of a dark male fantasy world, perhaps constructed as a means of dealing with loneliness caused by a broken relationship or a series of broken relationships with women.\"{{sfn|Perone|2012|pp=91\u201392, 97}} As he explains:\n\n<blockquote>The individual songs seem to ping-pong back and forth between themes of love/desire for women and the desire to control women and out-and-out misogyny. However, the band uses musical connections between songs as well as the subtheme of travel, the use of feline metaphors for women and other lyrical connections to suggest that the characters whom lead singer Mick Jagger portrays throughout the album are really one and perhaps stem from the deep recesses of his psyche.{{sfn|Perone|2012|pp=91\u201392}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Carnaby Street, London in 1968.jpg|thumb|right|''Swinging London'', [[Carnaby Street]], c. 1968.

At age 76 in 2006, he became the second-oldest inmate at the time to be executed in the United States since 1976, after [[John B. Nixon]], who was executed in Mississippi in December 2005 at age 77. This record has since been broken by [[Walter Moody]].\n\nPro-death penalty activists cite Allen's actions as a reason to support capital punishment in the United States. He was already serving a life sentence for one murder when he was convicted of organizing the killing of three more people.\n\nWhile in prison, Allen then acknowledged his Native American [[Choctaw]] heritage. He also claimed to be deaf, blind and severely disabled, requiring a wheelchair for mobility. He did not know any [[sign language]] to communicate with hearing people. During his execution, he was able to walk from his wheelchair to the death podium unassisted. In addition, he appeared to be looking straight at his family prior to receiving the first dose of drugs during his lethal injection procedure. Allen had a confirmed advanced case of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], and he suffered a perhaps related [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on September 2, 2005. His lawyers declared that \"he presents absolutely no danger at this point, as incapacitated as he is. There's no legitimate state purpose served by executing him. It would be gratuitous punishment.\" They argued that his execution would constitute [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and requested that he be granted [[clemency]] by California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], which was subsequently refused.\n\n==Murder of Mary Sue Kitts==\nIn 1974, Allen plotted the [[burglary]] of Fran's Market, a [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]-area [[supermarket]] owned by Ray and Fran Schletewitz, whom Allen had known for years. The plot involved his son, Roger Allen, as well as Ed Savala, Carl Mayfield, and Charles Jones. Mayfield and Jones worked for Clarence Ray Allen in his security guard business as well as part of a burglary enterprise allegedly operated by Allen. As part of the burglary plot against Fran's Market, he arranged for someone to steal a set of door and alarm keys from the market owner's son, Bryon Schletewitz, age 19, while Schletewitz was swimming in Allen's pool. Allen then arranged a date between Schletewitz and Mary Sue Kitts (his son Roger's girlfriend) for the evening, during which time the burglary took place. The burglary netted $500 in cash and $10,000 in money orders from the store's safe. Following the commission of the burglary, Kitts told Bryon Schletewitz that Allen had committed the crime, which she knew as she had helped Allen cash [[money order]]s that had been stolen from the store.<ref name=\"DoubleLife\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-01-12/news/17275973_1_san-joaquin-valley-fresno-county-clarence-ray-allen/4\n |title=Double life of a Death Row killer \n |author=Jim Doyle \n |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] \n |date=January 12, 2006 \n}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSchletewitz confronted Roger Allen, informing him that he had been told of the crime by Kitts, and Roger Allen admitted the crime. When Roger Allen told his father Clarence of Bryon's accusation, Clarence Allen stated that they (Schletewitz and Kitts) would have to be \"dealt with.\" He enlisted three employees of his security firm, Charles Jones, Carl Mayfield, and Lee Furrow. According to an opinion filed on May 6, 2004 in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:\n\n:Allen called a meeting at his house and told Jones, Mayfield, and Furrow that Kitts had been talking too much and should be killed. Allen called for a vote on the issue of Kitts's execution. The vote was unanimous because those present feared what would happen if they did not go along with Allen's plan. Allen had previously told his criminal accomplices that he would kill snitches and that he had friends and connections to do the job for him even if he were in prison. He had also referred to himself as a Mafia hitman and stated that the \"secret witness program\" was useless because a good lawyer could always discover an informant's name and address. Allen kept a newspaper article about the murder of a man and woman in Nevada, and claimed he had \"blown them in half\" with a shotgun.<ref name=\"FindLawOrder\">\n{{cite web\n |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1050550.html\n |title=ALLEN v.

After an unsuccessful attempt to poison her with [[cyanide]] capsules, Allen called Furrow to learn if he had killed Kitts. Furrow told Allen he was in the process of strangling her and Allen replied, \"do it.\" After killing Kitts, Furrow threw her body into the [[Friant-Kern Canal]]. The body has never been found.\n\n==Execution at Fran's Market==\nWhile in [[Folsom Prison]], Allen conspired with fellow inmate [[Billy Ray Hamilton]] to murder the various witnesses who had testified against him, including Bryon Schletewitz. Allen intended to obtain a new trial, where there would be no witnesses to testify to his acts.\n\nAfter Hamilton was [[paroled]] from Folsom Prison, he carried out Allen's orders. On September 5, 1980, Hamilton and his girlfriend, Connie Barbo, went to Fran's Market, east of Fresno, California. Bryon Schletewitz, the son of the market's owner, worked at the market. There, Hamilton murdered Schletewitz and fellow employees Josephine Rocha, 17, and Douglas White, 18, with a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and wounded two other people, Joe Rios and Jack Abbott.<ref name=\"FresnoExecution\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://www.fresnobee.com/local/story/11697658p-12423869c.html\n |title=Fresno killer Allen put to death; U.S. Supreme Court refuses to intervene in 1980 triple murder\n |author=Bill McEwen, Tim Eberly and John Ellis\n |newspaper=[[The Fresno Bee]]\n |date=January 17, 2006\n}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Hamilton shot Schletewitz at near point-blank range in the forehead and then killed Rocha and White after forcing them to lie on the floor of the store.  Rios, also an employee of the market, was shot as well but raised his arm as Hamilton fired on him and this action undoubtedly saved his life.  The other wounded survivor, Abbott, was a neighbor who heard the shotgun blasts, came to the market to investigate, and was also shot by Hamilton.  Abbott returned fire and wounded Hamilton, who escaped from the scene.\n\nFive days after the events at Fran's Market, Hamilton was arrested while attempting to rob a liquor store.  On his person was found a \"hit list\" with the names and addresses of the witnesses who testified against Allen at his trial for Kitts' murder; Bryon Schletewitz was on the list.\n\n==Legal proceedings==\nIn 1980, the [[California Attorney General]] filed charges against Allen and prosecuted the trial in [[Glenn County, California]], due to a change of venue. The trial took place in 1982 and lasted 23 days, and 58 witnesses were called to testify.<ref>''''Allen v. Woodford'', 395 F.3d 979, 989-990'', ''''</ref>  Ultimately, the jury convicted Allen of triple [[murder]] and [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to murder eight witnesses.\n\nAs special circumstances making Allen eligible for the death penalty, the jury also found that Allen had previously been convicted of murder, had committed multiple murders, and had murdered witnesses in retaliation for their prior testimony and to prevent future testimony.  During a seven-day penalty phase, the Attorney General introduced evidence of Allen's career orchestrating violent robberies in the Central Valley, including ten violent crimes and six prior felony convictions.  The jury returned a unanimous verdict of death, and the Glenn County Superior Court sentenced Allen on November 22, 1980.\n\nIn 1987, the [[California Supreme Court]] affirmed Allen's death sentence. [[Associate Justice]] Joseph Grodin's opinion referred to Allen's crimes as \"sordid events\" with an \"extraordinarily massive amount\" of aggravating evidence.  In a dissenting opinion, California Supreme Court Justice Broussard stated that the prosecutor influenced the jury by telling them that \"if you conclude that aggravating evidence outweighs the [[Mitigating factor|mitigating evidence]], you shall return a death sentence,\" while the law does not mandate a death sentence in such a situation.  According to Justice Broussard, this led to a lack of freedom for the jury to make a \"normative decision.\"\n\nIn 2005, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found that Allen's trial counsel had been inadequate, and the evidence against him was largely the testimony of Allen's several accomplices, who painted him as the mastermind who forced them by threats and scare tactics to commit robberies and murders.  However the court denied rehearing in Allen's case.  In her opinion for the panel, Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw concluded:\n\n: Evidence of Allen's guilt is overwhelming.  Given the nature of his crimes, sentencing him to another life term would achieve none of the traditional purposes underlying punishment.  Allen continues to pose a threat to society, indeed to those very persons who testified against him in the Fran's Market triple-murder trial here at issue, and has proven that he is beyond rehabilitation.  He has shown himself more than capable of arranging murders from behind bars.  If the death penalty is to serve any purpose at all, it is to prevent the very sort of murderous conduct for which Allen was convicted.\n\nDeputy [[California Attorney General]] Ward Campbell stated in an interview:\n: Well, Mr. Allen has cited his age, the length of time on death row, claims about innocence, errors at his trial.  We found and told the governor we found all those reasons to be unpersuasive given the nature of his crime, which was in fact a direct attack on the criminal justice system perpetrated by a man whom Society thought to be safe from.  They thought they were safe from him because he was behind bars and yet he continued to perpetrate these types of crimes and none of the factors that they cite now overshadow or outbalance those reasons for now executing the judgment of the people of the State of California.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to grant Allen [[clemency]], stating that \"his conduct did not result from youth or inexperience, but instead resulted from the hardened and calculating decisions of a mature man.\"  Schwarzenegger also cited a poem in which Allen glorified his actions, where Allen wrote, \"We rob and steal and for those who squeal are usually found dying or dead.\"\n\nOn January 15, 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Allen's claim that executing an aged or infirm person was cruel and unusual punishment, observing that his mental acuity was unimpaired and that he had been fifty years of age when he arranged the murders from prison.  Judge Kim Wardlaw writing for the panel of judges Susan Graber, Richard Clifton, and herself: \n: His age and experience only sharpened his ability to coldly calculate the execution of the crime.  Nothing about his current ailments reduces his culpability and thus they do not lessen the retributive or deterrent purposes of the death penalty.\n\nThe [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear the case, albeit over the dissent of Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], who stated: \"I believe that in the circumstances he raises a significant question as to whether his execution would constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\"\n\n==1983 Chino Hills murders==\n[[Kevin Cooper (prisoner)|Kevin Cooper]] was convicted of the 1983 murder of a family in the Chino Hills.

He also claimed to be deaf, blind and severely disabled, requiring a wheelchair for mobility. He did not know any [[sign language]] to communicate with hearing people. During his execution, he was able to walk from his wheelchair to the death podium unassisted. In addition, he appeared to be looking straight at his family prior to receiving the first dose of drugs during his lethal injection procedure. Allen had a confirmed advanced case of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], and he suffered a perhaps related [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on September 2, 2005. His lawyers declared that \"he presents absolutely no danger at this point, as incapacitated as he is. There's no legitimate state purpose served by executing him. It would be gratuitous punishment.\" They argued that his execution would constitute [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and requested that he be granted [[clemency]] by California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], which was subsequently refused.\n\n==Murder of Mary Sue Kitts==\nIn 1974, Allen plotted the [[burglary]] of Fran's Market, a [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]-area [[supermarket]] owned by Ray and Fran Schletewitz, whom Allen had known for years. The plot involved his son, Roger Allen, as well as Ed Savala, Carl Mayfield, and Charles Jones. Mayfield and Jones worked for Clarence Ray Allen in his security guard business as well as part of a burglary enterprise allegedly operated by Allen. As part of the burglary plot against Fran's Market, he arranged for someone to steal a set of door and alarm keys from the market owner's son, Bryon Schletewitz, age 19, while Schletewitz was swimming in Allen's pool. Allen then arranged a date between Schletewitz and Mary Sue Kitts (his son Roger's girlfriend) for the evening, during which time the burglary took place. The burglary netted $500 in cash and $10,000 in money orders from the store's safe. Following the commission of the burglary, Kitts told Bryon Schletewitz that Allen had committed the crime, which she knew as she had helped Allen cash [[money order]]s that had been stolen from the store.<ref name=\"DoubleLife\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-01-12/news/17275973_1_san-joaquin-valley-fresno-county-clarence-ray-allen/4\n |title=Double life of a Death Row killer \n |author=Jim Doyle \n |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] \n |date=January 12, 2006 \n}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSchletewitz confronted Roger Allen, informing him that he had been told of the crime by Kitts, and Roger Allen admitted the crime. When Roger Allen told his father Clarence of Bryon's accusation, Clarence Allen stated that they (Schletewitz and Kitts) would have to be \"dealt with.\" He enlisted three employees of his security firm, Charles Jones, Carl Mayfield, and Lee Furrow. According to an opinion filed on May 6, 2004 in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:\n\n:Allen called a meeting at his house and told Jones, Mayfield, and Furrow that Kitts had been talking too much and should be killed. Allen called for a vote on the issue of Kitts's execution. The vote was unanimous because those present feared what would happen if they did not go along with Allen's plan. Allen had previously told his criminal accomplices that he would kill snitches and that he had friends and connections to do the job for him even if he were in prison. He had also referred to himself as a Mafia hitman and stated that the \"secret witness program\" was useless because a good lawyer could always discover an informant's name and address. Allen kept a newspaper article about the murder of a man and woman in Nevada, and claimed he had \"blown them in half\" with a shotgun.<ref name=\"FindLawOrder\">\n{{cite web\n |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1050550.html\n |title=ALLEN v.

After an unsuccessful attempt to poison her with [[cyanide]] capsules, Allen called Furrow to learn if he had killed Kitts. Furrow told Allen he was in the process of strangling her and Allen replied, \"do it.\" After killing Kitts, Furrow threw her body into the [[Friant-Kern Canal]]. The body has never been found.\n\n==Execution at Fran's Market==\nWhile in [[Folsom Prison]], Allen conspired with fellow inmate [[Billy Ray Hamilton]] to murder the various witnesses who had testified against him, including Bryon Schletewitz. Allen intended to obtain a new trial, where there would be no witnesses to testify to his acts.\n\nAfter Hamilton was [[paroled]] from Folsom Prison, he carried out Allen's orders. On September 5, 1980, Hamilton and his girlfriend, Connie Barbo, went to Fran's Market, east of Fresno, California. Bryon Schletewitz, the son of the market's owner, worked at the market. There, Hamilton murdered Schletewitz and fellow employees Josephine Rocha, 17, and Douglas White, 18, with a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and wounded two other people, Joe Rios and Jack Abbott.<ref name=\"FresnoExecution\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://www.fresnobee.com/local/story/11697658p-12423869c.html\n |title=Fresno killer Allen put to death; U.S. Supreme Court refuses to intervene in 1980 triple murder\n |author=Bill McEwen, Tim Eberly and John Ellis\n |newspaper=[[The Fresno Bee]]\n |date=January 17, 2006\n}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Hamilton shot Schletewitz at near point-blank range in the forehead and then killed Rocha and White after forcing them to lie on the floor of the store.  Rios, also an employee of the market, was shot as well but raised his arm as Hamilton fired on him and this action undoubtedly saved his life.  The other wounded survivor, Abbott, was a neighbor who heard the shotgun blasts, came to the market to investigate, and was also shot by Hamilton.  Abbott returned fire and wounded Hamilton, who escaped from the scene.\n\nFive days after the events at Fran's Market, Hamilton was arrested while attempting to rob a liquor store.  On his person was found a \"hit list\" with the names and addresses of the witnesses who testified against Allen at his trial for Kitts' murder; Bryon Schletewitz was on the list.\n\n==Legal proceedings==\nIn 1980, the [[California Attorney General]] filed charges against Allen and prosecuted the trial in [[Glenn County, California]], due to a change of venue. The trial took place in 1982 and lasted 23 days, and 58 witnesses were called to testify.<ref>''''Allen v. Woodford'', 395 F.3d 979, 989-990'', ''''</ref>  Ultimately, the jury convicted Allen of triple [[murder]] and [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to murder eight witnesses.\n\nAs special circumstances making Allen eligible for the death penalty, the jury also found that Allen had previously been convicted of murder, had committed multiple murders, and had murdered witnesses in retaliation for their prior testimony and to prevent future testimony.  During a seven-day penalty phase, the Attorney General introduced evidence of Allen's career orchestrating violent robberies in the Central Valley, including ten violent crimes and six prior felony convictions.  The jury returned a unanimous verdict of death, and the Glenn County Superior Court sentenced Allen on November 22, 1980.\n\nIn 1987, the [[California Supreme Court]] affirmed Allen's death sentence. [[Associate Justice]] Joseph Grodin's opinion referred to Allen's crimes as \"sordid events\" with an \"extraordinarily massive amount\" of aggravating evidence.  In a dissenting opinion, California Supreme Court Justice Broussard stated that the prosecutor influenced the jury by telling them that \"if you conclude that aggravating evidence outweighs the [[Mitigating factor|mitigating evidence]], you shall return a death sentence,\" while the law does not mandate a death sentence in such a situation.  According to Justice Broussard, this led to a lack of freedom for the jury to make a \"normative decision.\"\n\nIn 2005, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found that Allen's trial counsel had been inadequate, and the evidence against him was largely the testimony of Allen's several accomplices, who painted him as the mastermind who forced them by threats and scare tactics to commit robberies and murders.  However the court denied rehearing in Allen's case.  In her opinion for the panel, Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw concluded:\n\n: Evidence of Allen's guilt is overwhelming.  Given the nature of his crimes, sentencing him to another life term would achieve none of the traditional purposes underlying punishment.  Allen continues to pose a threat to society, indeed to those very persons who testified against him in the Fran's Market triple-murder trial here at issue, and has proven that he is beyond rehabilitation.  He has shown himself more than capable of arranging murders from behind bars.  If the death penalty is to serve any purpose at all, it is to prevent the very sort of murderous conduct for which Allen was convicted.\n\nDeputy [[California Attorney General]] Ward Campbell stated in an interview:\n: Well, Mr. Allen has cited his age, the length of time on death row, claims about innocence, errors at his trial.  We found and told the governor we found all those reasons to be unpersuasive given the nature of his crime, which was in fact a direct attack on the criminal justice system perpetrated by a man whom Society thought to be safe from.  They thought they were safe from him because he was behind bars and yet he continued to perpetrate these types of crimes and none of the factors that they cite now overshadow or outbalance those reasons for now executing the judgment of the people of the State of California.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to grant Allen [[clemency]], stating that \"his conduct did not result from youth or inexperience, but instead resulted from the hardened and calculating decisions of a mature man.\"  Schwarzenegger also cited a poem in which Allen glorified his actions, where Allen wrote, \"We rob and steal and for those who squeal are usually found dying or dead.\"\n\nOn January 15, 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Allen's claim that executing an aged or infirm person was cruel and unusual punishment, observing that his mental acuity was unimpaired and that he had been fifty years of age when he arranged the murders from prison.  Judge Kim Wardlaw writing for the panel of judges Susan Graber, Richard Clifton, and herself: \n: His age and experience only sharpened his ability to coldly calculate the execution of the crime.  Nothing about his current ailments reduces his culpability and thus they do not lessen the retributive or deterrent purposes of the death penalty.\n\nThe [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear the case, albeit over the dissent of Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], who stated: \"I believe that in the circumstances he raises a significant question as to whether his execution would constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\"\n\n==1983 Chino Hills murders==\n[[Kevin Cooper (prisoner)|Kevin Cooper]] was convicted of the 1983 murder of a family in the Chino Hills.
