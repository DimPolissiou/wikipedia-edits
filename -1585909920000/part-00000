It is seen that these additional binding steps are required to stabilize the NMJ.\n\nThe requirement for Agrin and MuSK in the formation of the NMJ was demonstrated primarily by [[knockout mouse]] studies.

A protein called [[Dok-7]] has shown to be additionally required for the formation of the secondary scaffold; it is apparently recruited after MuSK phosphorylation and before acetylcholine receptors are clustered.\n\n==Structure==\nThere are three potential [[heparan sulfate]] (HS) attachment sites within the primary structure of agrin, but it is thought that only two of these actually carry HS chains when the protein is expressed.\n\nIn fact, one study concluded that at least two attachment sites are necessary by inducing synthetic agents.  Since agrin fragments induce acetylcholine receptor aggregation as well as phosphorylation of the MuSK receptor, researchers spliced them and found that the variant did not trigger phosphorylation.

It is seen that these additional binding steps are required to stabilize the NMJ.\n\nThe requirement for Agrin and MuSK in the formation of the NMJ was demonstrated primarily by [[knockout mouse]] studies.

A protein called [[Dok-7]] has shown to be additionally required for the formation of the secondary scaffold; it is apparently recruited after MuSK phosphorylation and before acetylcholine receptors are clustered.\n\n==Structure==\nThere are three potential [[heparan sulfate]] (HS) attachment sites within the primary structure of agrin, but it is thought that only two of these actually carry HS chains when the protein is expressed.\n\nIn fact, one study concluded that at least two attachment sites are necessary by inducing synthetic agents.  Since agrin fragments induce acetylcholine receptor aggregation as well as phosphorylation of the MuSK receptor, researchers spliced them and found that the variant did not trigger phosphorylation.

A much more plausibile version, according to [[Iorgu Iordan]], would be that the name is actually coming from a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word: people living in the neighbouring village of [[Cara\u0219ova]] 15&nbsp;km away, referring to this place, that in those days was a similar village to theirs, as being \u201eu re\u010dice\u201d (at the creek).

Archaeological research found traces of habitation going back to the [[Neolithic]], [[Dacia]]n and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras. It was mentioned in 1673 under the name of ''Reszinitza'', whose citizens paid taxes to [[Timi\u0219oara]], and by the years 1690\u20131700, it was mentioned as being part of the District of Boc\u0219a together with other towns in the B\u00e2rzava Valley. The town was referenced to in the conscription acts of 1717 under the name of ''Retziza''. On 3 July 1771, it became an important metal-manufacturing center in the region. The foundation of the industrial Re\u0219i\u021ba were laid with the establishment of factories near the villages of ''Re\u0219i\u021ba Rom\u00e2n\u0103'' (''Reschiza Kameral\u0103'' or ''Ol\u00e1h Resitza'') and ''Re\u0219i\u021ba Montan\u0103'' (''Eisenwerk Reschitza'', ''N\u00e9met(h) Reschitza'' or ''Resiczb\u00e1nya''). Re\u0219i\u021ba Montan\u0103 was at first inhabited by Romanians {{Dubious|date=April 2013}} {{Quotation needed|date=April 2013}}, and later, in 1776, 70 German families settled there. Between 1880 and 1941, Germans were the dominant population in the city, with as many of them as 12,096 residing here in 1941, as opposed to 9,453 Romanians, and 1861 Hungarians living here in the same year. Between the years 1910\u20131925, Re\u0219i\u021ba had the status of a rural area, and in 1925, it was declared a town thanks to its development to a powerful industrial location in modern Romania. In 1968, it became a municipality.\n\nAfter 1989 Re\u0219i\u021ba lost most of its importance and its economy faced a drawback, along with the [[Economy of Romania|Romanian economy]]. The population also suffered a decrease, dropping from 110,000 in 1989 to 86,000 in 2006. After the fall of [[Communist Romania|communism]], the [[Re\u0219i\u021ba Steelworks]] (''Combinatul Siderurgic Re\u0219i\u021ba'', CSR) were bought by an American investor who brought the factory just one step away from bankruptcy. Today the steelworks are run by TMK Europe GmbH, a German subsidiary of the OAO TMK, Moscow, who has projects of modernization for the CSR.\n\n==The city==\n\nThe city is situated along the [[B\u00e2rzava River (Timi\u0219)|B\u00e2rzava river]], which meets the [[Doman River|Doman river]] in the centre of town.

The two are called as [[Re\u0219i\u021ba works]] and are the factories which sustained the city's life for more than 300 years. The first factories were built in 1771, during the reign of [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]. During the 19th century, the steel works were known as [[Imperial Austrian State Railways|StEG]]. After the end of [[World War I]], when [[Banat]] became part of Romania, they changed their name again, this time to Uzinele \u0219i Domeniile Re\u0219i\u021ba or UDR (Re\u0219i\u021ba Works and Domains). Only later, under the Communist [[Communist Romania|regime]], did the UDR split to CSR and UCMR.\n\nThe economy of Re\u0219i\u021ba has faced a drawback since 1989, but began recovering as investment is on the rise.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n* Industry: Automobile industry, Iron industry, texture industry, civilian constructions;\n* Agriculture: 1% of the labour force of the city works in agriculture;\n* Services: public alimentation, internal and international transport;\n* Tourism: 2 tourism societies (Tourist Semenic SA and BIRTA SA).\n\n===Shopping===\nRe\u0219i\u021ba currently has 9 supermarkets of which three [[Carrefour]] supermarkets, two in the [[Gov\u00e2ndari]] district (one of them was previously a Billa supermarket) and one in the Nera Shopping Center, three [[Lidl]] supermarkets, two [[Kaufland]] supermarkets, one near the road entrance from [[Boc\u0219a]] and one in [[Lunca B\u00e2rz\u0103vii]] and a [[Penny (supermarket)|Penny]] establishment also situated in [[Lunca B\u00e2rz\u0103vii]].

A much more plausibile version, according to [[Iorgu Iordan]], would be that the name is actually coming from a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word: people living in the neighbouring village of [[Cara\u0219ova]] 15&nbsp;km away, referring to this place, that in those days was a similar village to theirs, as being \u201eu re\u010dice\u201d (at the creek). It can also be noted that almost all Slavic countries have places with the name of [[Re\u010dice]] (pronounced Reci\u021be in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]).<ref name=\"\u00cenceputurile Re\u0219i\u021bei/Beginnings of Resita\">{{cite web|url = http://istoriabanatului.wordpress.com/page/10/?archives-list=1|title = \u00cenceputurile Re\u0219i\u021bei|publisher = istoriabanatului|date = 17 June 2009|accessdate = 24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nHistorically, the town has its origins in the 15th century under the name of ''Rechyoka'' and ''Rechycha''. Archaeological research found traces of habitation going back to the [[Neolithic]], [[Dacia]]n and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras. It was mentioned in 1673 under the name of ''Reszinitza'', whose citizens paid taxes to [[Timi\u0219oara]], and by the years 1690\u20131700, it was mentioned as being part of the District of Boc\u0219a together with other towns in the B\u00e2rzava Valley. The town was referenced to in the conscription acts of 1717 under the name of ''Retziza''. On 3 July 1771, it became an important metal-manufacturing center in the region. The foundation of the industrial Re\u0219i\u021ba were laid with the establishment of factories near the villages of ''Re\u0219i\u021ba Rom\u00e2n\u0103'' (''Reschiza Kameral\u0103'' or ''Ol\u00e1h Resitza'') and ''Re\u0219i\u021ba Montan\u0103'' (''Eisenwerk Reschitza'', ''N\u00e9met(h) Reschitza'' or ''Resiczb\u00e1nya''). Re\u0219i\u021ba Montan\u0103 was at first inhabited by Romanians {{Dubious|date=April 2013}} {{Quotation needed|date=April 2013}}, and later, in 1776, 70 German families settled there. Between 1880 and 1941, Germans were the dominant population in the city, with as many of them as 12,096 residing here in 1941, as opposed to 9,453 Romanians, and 1861 Hungarians living here in the same year. Between the years 1910\u20131925, Re\u0219i\u021ba had the status of a rural area, and in 1925, it was declared a town thanks to its development to a powerful industrial location in modern Romania. In 1968, it became a municipality.\n\nAfter 1989 Re\u0219i\u021ba lost most of its importance and its economy faced a drawback, along with the [[Economy of Romania|Romanian economy]]. The population also suffered a decrease, dropping from 110,000 in 1989 to 86,000 in 2006.

PTFE is [[hydrophobic]]: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated [[London dispersion force]]s due to the high [[electronegativity]] of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of [[friction]] of any solid.\n\nPTFE is used as a [[non-stick coating]] for pans and other cookware. It is nonreactive, partly because of the strength of [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond]]s, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. It is also frequently employed as coating on [[catheter]]s; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Happy Pan Poster.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Advertisement of the Happy Pan, a Teflon-coated pan from the 1960s]]\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=  | audio1 = [https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/teflon \"From stove tops to outer space...

PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with [[bismaleimide]] resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.\n\nBecause of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in [[hose]] assemblies, [[expansion joint#Pipe expansion joints|expansion joint]]s, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.\n\n[[Gore-Tex]] is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores. The roof of the [[Hubert H.

It is nonreactive, partly because of the strength of [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond]]s, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions.

PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with [[bismaleimide]] resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.\n\nBecause of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in [[hose]] assemblies, [[expansion joint#Pipe expansion joints|expansion joint]]s, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.\n\n[[Gore-Tex]] is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores.

It is notable for its extremely low coefficient of friction, its hydrophobia (which serves to inhibit rust), and for the dry film it forms after application, which allows it to resist collecting particles that might otherwise form an abrasive paste.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://interflonusa.com/what-is-micpol/#assembly|title=What is MicPol?|work=Lubrication|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPTFE (Teflon) is best known for its use in coating non-stick [[frying pan]]s and other cookware, as it is [[hydrophobic]] and possesses fairly high heat resistance.\n\n[[File:PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, rolls of 15 and 25 mm widths.jpg|thumb|right|PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing]]\n\nThe sole plates of some clothes irons are coated with PTFE (Teflon).<ref>[http://pratique.leparisien.fr/fiches-pratiques/electromenager/repassage/fers-a-repasser-semelle-teflon-1600004600043011#xtref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.fr%252F Fers \u00e0 repasser semelle teflon - Fiche pratique - Le Parisien].

However, there has been relatively little conversation about the presence of these chemicals in our everyday lives and the public\u2019s sheer exposure to PFAS through primary contact from commercial products used in our everyday lives. Several peer reviewed studies have shown that the mean and median concentration of PFOA in household dust in the US was found to be between approximately 10,000 and 50,000 parts per trillion (ppt)3. These studies highlight the fact that there is significantly more PFOA in the ambient dust in the average home than the levels currently being discussed as thresholds for drinking water. Because PFAS is in the products we use, is transported through air and water and has been found in the food we eat, there are numerous public exposure pathways for PFAS beyond drinking water. <ref>{{http://www.mwra.com/01news/2019/2019-11-PFAS-fact-sheet.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Ecotoxicity == \n[[Sodium trifluoroacetate]] and the similar compound chlorodifluoroacetate can both be generated when PTFE undergoes thermolysis, as well as producing longer chain polyfluoro- and/or polychlorofluoro- (C3-C14) carboxylic acids which may be equally persistent.

The Boogeyman and the Little Boogeyman lost to Finlay and Hornswoggle in a mixed tag team match at [[No Way Out (2007)|No Way Out]].
