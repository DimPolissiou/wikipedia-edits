This neighbourhood to the North of the old city of Aleppo developed since the late [[Mameluke]] period. This area became the Christian quarter of [[Al-Jdayde|Jdeideh]] which was organically clustered around its churches. Here lived the notables of Aleppo's Christian communities, notably the [[Armenians in Syria|Armenians]] who specialised in trade with India and Persia.<ref name=\":1\" />\n \nThe \u0120azaleh House was built in front of two large Muslim [[waqf]]s \u2014 created in 1583-90 and 1653 \u2014 and together they form the monumental heart of a lively mixed Christian-Muslim neighbourhood.<ref>See Jdayde's [[Waqf of Ibshir Mustafa Pasha Complex|Waqf of Ibshir Mustafa Pasha]] for further information.</ref> Unique for its size and decor, Beit Ghazaleh embodies the wealth and power of the Christian community in 17th century Aleppo. The decorative panels of Beit Ghazaleh do not include human figure representations; made by local craftsmen, the panels display many painted inscriptions presenting a mix of popular sayings, mystic poetry<ref>Their authors were either Muslim or Christian.</ref> and biblical psalms. This diversity of sources underlines the rich Arab culture and the [[eclecticism]] typical of Aleppo urban ''\u00e9lites''.\n\n== A palace built around many courtyards ==\n\n[[File:Beit Gazaleh RCh 2014 Ground Floor.jpg|thumb|150px|The six courtyards of Beit Ghazaleh (RC Heritage)]]\n\nThroughout the centuries, the [[mansion]]'s footprint expanded or contracted according to changing needs and fortunes. However, it always maintained a main central [[courtyard]] of 250m<sup>2</sup>. At its apex, the house covered an area of approximately 1,600m<sup>2</sup>, with 570m<sup>2</sup> occupied by six courtyards. The actual size of the complex is practically invisible from the outside.\n\nThe present entrance was opened in the 19th century on the main street on the house\u2019s East side. This entrance leads to the principal courtyard, the focal centre and the main thoroughfare to the rest of the house. [[Polychrome]] marble tiles, forming a \"carpet\" in front of the ''iwan'', precede the great [[fountain]] in the courtyard, with its games of water, stone basins and cascades.  The fine wall decorations in the courtyard are said to have been carved by the Armenian sculptor Khachadur Bali a member of the [[Balyan family|Balyan]] family of Ottoman court architects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asor-syrianheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ASOR-CHI-Weekly-Report-107-108r2.pdf|title=ASOR CHI Weekly Report 107|last=Michael D.

This line divides the courtyard's paving, basin and garden into a precise geometry. The rest of the space is organized according to the needs of the household and the shape of the plot without concern for symmetry.\n\nAll around the main courtyard, windows and doors punctuate the facades. Above these openings, the relative intricacy of the low relief decor surrounding them establishes the hierarchy of the rooms with the ''[[iwan]]'' at its summit. The stone decor of the ''iwan'' facade and of its annexes likely dates from the mid-17th century. The painted wooden panels of the ''[[qubba]]''<ref>This Arabic term generally designates a dome which may indicate a funereal function. In the local arab architecture of the Near East (Syria) an ''[[iwan]]'' is almost always built between two ''quabba'' (qubbatayn) the access to which is generally regulated by the ''iwan''  and therefore are like \"alcoves\" (ai-qubba). They can be covered by a cupola or a wood ceiling.</ref> and the surviving panels of the ''iwan'' are likely dated from the same period. The ''iwan'', first meant to provide comfort from the summer heat,<ref>The ''[[iwan]]'' is rather an airy space for the cool early hours of summer days or sunny periods during the winter and are open to the north in Syria.</ref>  is thus the \"centre\" of the house and plays an essential symbolic role representing the power of the master of Beit Ghazaleh.\n\n== Rooms around the central courtyard ==\n\n[[File:Palazzo ghazaleh 3 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|One of the interiors of the Ghazaleh House]]\n\nThe five rectangular rooms accessible from the courtyard were once decorated with woodwork that has now almost entirely disappeared. The sixth room to the West is a vast T-shaped ''qa'a'',<ref>In domestic arab architecture (notably in Syria and Egypt), this term designates a principal room, by its dimensions, the richness of its decor and its relative importance in the building.  This room is generally multifunctional and often centrally located and remarkable by the extent of its architecture.</ref> indicative of wealth and power.\n\n== The North facade ==\n\n[[File:2 Beit Gazaleh RCh 2010 DSC 1740.jpg|thumb|150px|right|North facade of the \u0120azaleh House]]\n\nOpposite the ''[[iwan]]'', the North fa\u00e7ade dates from the end of the 17th century. It is remarkable for its lavish decor, unique in Aleppo. In the centre, the ''[[ablaq]]''<ref>[[Polychrome]] elements presented in horizontal bands</ref>  emphasizes the strict symmetry of the facade, while the interior spaces do not follow the same organization. According to an inscription, the large room in the East Wing dates from 1691. Its rich interior decoration, partially refurbished in the 19th century, includes four distinct sets of inscriptions:\n* [[Psalm 91]]<ref>Often quoted to express confidence in God the protector</ref> of the Bible on the ceiling cornice;\n* Popular sayings on the cornice of the wooden panelling;\n* The fifteen [[Transom (architectural)|transom]] panels above the openings reproduce a poem by [[Abu Al-Fath Al-Busti|Ab\u00fb al-Fath al-Bust\u00ee]]<ref>Notable Arabian poet. See this [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-islamica/abu-al-fath-al-busti-COM_0060%20 reference] for further information</ref>  addressing the themes of the condemnation of excess and unnecessary, reflections on human relationships, the need for God's help, and the need to be in control of one's body and improve one's heart and mind;\n* The inscriptions above the niches on the North side reproduce the verses of [[al-Mutanabbi]] on honour, wisdom and ignorance.\n\n== The floors ==\n\n[[File:Beitghazale10708242.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Ghazaleh House floors prior to renovation]]\n\nThe floor of the ''iwan'', and of some other rooms, has retained its old split-level organization. The spaces where you stand and circulate, the corridors and the ''ataba-s'',<ref>The term gives the idea of entrance, of transitions and of the edge of a room and its rather specific Syrian use (''durqa\u2019a'' in Egypt).  The ''atabe'' is mainly characterised by the low level of its floor close to that of the exterior of the room and about forty centimetres lower than that of the room.  One can stand upright and deposit ones shoes before getting installed on the ground at the upper part of the room.</ref> are roughly at the same level as the courtyard. The rest of each room, covered with mats and rugs, is about 50 centimetres higher. The line of sight and the height of cushions determine the height of the sills and windows and thus the internal and external organization of the facades.\n\n== The hammam ==\n\n[[File:Beit Gazaleh RCh 2006 Hammam.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Ghazaleh House hammam interior]]\n\nThe [[Turkish bath|hammam]] steam bath in the northwest corner is comparable to a public bath, but presents a simplified plan because the vast '[[qa'a|q\u00e2\u2018a]]' served as a dressing room and resting space before and after bathing.\n\nKitchens and other service quarters, stables, granaries and warehouses for provisions were likely situated to the North-east and South of the house, accessible from the alleys that surround the plot to the house's North and the South.\n\n== The West wing (the Q\u00e2\u2018a) ==\n\n[[File:Palazzo ghazaleh 3 2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The grand q\u00e2\u2018a of Beit Ghazaleh]]\n\nThe southwest corner of the courtyard, and the West wing, was completely rebuilt in 1737. It includes three key elements: a very large rectangular room with a fireplace, a large '[[Qa'a (room)|q\u00e2\u2018a]]' and a hammam. The T-shaped 'q\u00e2\u2018a' includes three ''iwan-s'' with wooden ceilings framing a ''ataba'' with a small octagonal basin in the centre, covered with a dome. The fourth facade of the ''ataba'' opens towards the central courtyard. Its interior decor includes stone tiles with geometric patterns and wooden panels painted with cups and fruit bouquets in vases.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'q\u00e2\u2018a' has two sets of inscriptions. The poem calligraphy on transoms (in praise of the Master of the House) begins with a discourse on wine. It ends with a dedication and the name of Jirjis along with a date of 1737. Inscriptions on the ceilings offer praise to the Virgin and include a poem of love typical of [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic texts.\n\n== The 19th century additions ==\n[[File:Fa\u00e7ade Maison Ghazaleh Alep.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The main entrance to the Maison Ghazaleh]]\n\nSignificant changes were made to Beit Ghazaleh during the nineteenth century. Notably, rooms were added on the top of the North wing (dated 1880 by an inscription). A new Southern entrance to the impasse ''Chtamm\u00e2'' was built, dated 1304/1887. These major redevelopments were inspired by the appearance of consular apartments in the Aleppo urban [[caravanserai]]s<ref>For further information please see the entry for the [[Al-Madina Souq]] of Aleppo</ref> and by the architecture of embassies in the capital [[Istanbul]].\n\n== Loss, looting and destruction ==\n[[File:Beit Ghazaleh Survey September 2017.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Beit Ghazaleh survey photograph of November 2017]]\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, changes in the domestic lifestyle and the introduction of Western furniture ultimately led to aristocratic families abandoning houses such as Beit Ghazaleh. The transformation of the Ghazaleh House into a school was a factor for both its destruction and its preservation. While it allowed the preservation of the physical structure of the building, it also favoured the \"disappearance\" of a great deal of its decoration.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perspectivia.net/publikationen/bts1/12/duda_innenarchitektur#pdf-pane|title=Innenarchitektur syrischer Stadth\u00e4user des 16. bis 18.

This neighbourhood to the North of the old city of Aleppo developed since the late [[Mameluke]] period. This area became the Christian quarter of [[Al-Jdayde|Jdeideh]] which was organically clustered around its churches. Here lived the notables of Aleppo's Christian communities, notably the [[Armenians in Syria|Armenians]] who specialised in trade with India and Persia.<ref name=\":1\" />\n \nThe \u0120azaleh House was built in front of two large Muslim [[waqf]]s \u2014 created in 1583-90 and 1653 \u2014 and together they form the monumental heart of a lively mixed Christian-Muslim neighbourhood.<ref>See Jdayde's [[Waqf of Ibshir Mustafa Pasha Complex|Waqf of Ibshir Mustafa Pasha]] for further information.</ref> Unique for its size and decor, Beit Ghazaleh embodies the wealth and power of the Christian community in 17th century Aleppo. The decorative panels of Beit Ghazaleh do not include human figure representations; made by local craftsmen, the panels display many painted inscriptions presenting a mix of popular sayings, mystic poetry<ref>Their authors were either Muslim or Christian.</ref> and biblical psalms. This diversity of sources underlines the rich Arab culture and the [[eclecticism]] typical of Aleppo urban ''\u00e9lites''.\n\n== A palace built around many courtyards ==\n\n[[File:Beit Gazaleh RCh 2014 Ground Floor.jpg|thumb|150px|The six courtyards of Beit Ghazaleh (RC Heritage)]]\n\nThroughout the centuries, the [[mansion]]\u2019s footprint expanded or contracted according to changing needs and fortunes. However, it always maintained a main central [[courtyard]] of 250m<sup>2</sup>. At its apex, the house covered an area of approximately 1,600m<sup>2</sup>, with 570m<sup>2</sup> occupied by six courtyards. The actual size of the complex is practically invisible from the outside.\n\nThe present entrance was opened in the 19th century on the main street on the house\u2019s East side. This entrance leads to the principal courtyard, the focal centre and the main thoroughfare to the rest of the house. [[Polychrome]] marble tiles, forming a \"carpet\" in front of the ''iwan'', precede the great [[fountain]] in the courtyard, with its games of water, stone basins and cascades.  The fine wall decorations in the courtyard are said to have been carved by the Armenian sculptor Khachadur Bali a member of the [[Balyan family|Balyan]] family of Ottoman court architects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asor-syrianheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ASOR-CHI-Weekly-Report-107-108r2.pdf|title=ASOR CHI Weekly Report 107|last=Michael D.

This line divides the courtyard's paving, basin and garden into a precise geometry. The rest of the space is organized according to the needs of the household and the shape of the plot without concern for symmetry.\n\nAll around the main courtyard, windows and doors punctuate the facades. Above these openings, the relative intricacy of the low relief decor surrounding them establishes the hierarchy of the rooms with the ''[[iwan]]'' at its summit. The stone decor of the ''iwan'' facade and of its annexes likely dates from mid-17th century. The painted wooden panels of the ''[[qubba]]''<ref>This Arabic term generally designates a dome which may indicate a funereal function. In the local arab architecture of the Near East (Syria) an ''[[iwan]]'' is almost always built between two ''quabba'' (qubbatayn) the access to which is generally regulated by the ''iwan''  and therefore are like \"alcoves\" (ai-qubba). They can be covered by a cupola or a wood ceiling.</ref> and the surviving panels of the ''iwan'' are likely dated from the same period. The ''iwan'', first meant to provide comfort from the summer heat,<ref>The ''[[iwan]]'' is rather an airy space for the cool early hours of summer days or sunny periods during the winter and are open to the north in Syria.</ref>  is thus the \"centre\" of the house and plays an essential symbolic role representing the power of the master of Beit Ghazaleh.\n\n== Rooms around the central courtyard ==\n\n[[File:Palazzo ghazaleh 3 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|One of the interiors of the Ghazaleh House]]\n\nThe five rectangular rooms accessible from the courtyard were once decorated with woodwork that has now almost entirely disappeared. The sixth room to the West is a vast T-shaped ''qa'a'',<ref>In domestic arab architecture (notably in Syria and Egypt), this term designates a principal room, by its dimensions, the richness of its decor and its relative importance in the building.  This room is generally multifunctional and often centrally located and remarkable by the extent of its architecture.</ref> indicative of wealth and power.\n\n== The North facade ==\n\n[[File:2 Beit Gazaleh RCh 2010 DSC 1740.jpg|thumb|150px|right|North facade of the \u0120azaleh House]]\n\nOpposite the ''[[iwan]]'', the North fa\u00e7ade dates from the end of the 17th century. It is remarkable for its lavish decor, unique in Aleppo. In the centre, the ''[[ablaq]]''<ref>[[Polychrome]] elements presented in horizontal bands</ref>  emphasizes the strict symmetry of the facade, while the interior spaces do not follow the same organization. According to an inscription, the large room in the East Wing dates from 1691. Its rich interior decoration, partially refurbished in the 19th century, includes four distinct sets of inscriptions:\n* [[Psalm 91]]<ref>Often quoted to express confidence in God the protector</ref> of the Bible on the ceiling cornice;\n* Popular sayings on the cornice of the wooden panelling;\n* The fifteen [[Transom (architectural)|transom]] panels above the openings reproduce a poem by [[Abu Al-Fath Al-Busti|Ab\u00fb al-Fath al-Bust\u00ee]]<ref>Notable Arabian poet. See this [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-islamica/abu-al-fath-al-busti-COM_0060%20 reference] for further information</ref>  addressing the themes of the condemnation of excess and unnecessary, reflections on human relationships, the need for God's help, and the need to be in control of one's body and improve one's heart and mind;\n* The inscriptions above the niches on the North side reproduce the verses of [[al-Mutanabbi]] on honour, wisdom and ignorance.\n\n== The floors ==\n\n[[File:Beitghazale10708242.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Ghazaleh House floors prior to renovation]]\n\nThe floor of the ''iwan'', and of some other rooms, has retained its old split-level organization. The spaces where you stand and circulate, the corridors and the ''ataba-s'',<ref>The term gives the idea of entrance, of transitions and of the edge of a room and its rather specific Syrian use (''durqa\u2019a'' in Egypt).  The ''atabe'' is mainly characterised by the low level of its floor close to that of the exterior of the room and about forty centimetres lower than that of the room.  One can stand upright and deposit ones shoes before getting installed on the ground at the upper part of the room.</ref> are roughly at the same level as the courtyard. The rest of each room, covered with mats and rugs, is about 50 centimetres higher. The line of sight and the height of cushions determine the height of the sills and windows and thus the internal and external organization of the facades.\n\n== The hammam ==\n\n[[File:Beit Gazaleh RCh 2006 Hammam.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Ghazaleh House hammam interior]]\n\nThe [[Turkish bath|hammam]] steam bath in the northwest corner is comparable to a public bath, but presents a simplified plan because the vast '[[qa'a|q\u00e2\u2018a]]' served as a dressing room and resting space before and after bathing.\n\nKitchens and other service quarters, stables, granaries and warehouses for provisions were likely situated to the North-east and South of the house, accessible from the alleys that surround the plot to the house's North and the South.\n\n== The West wing (the Q\u00e2\u2018a) ==\n\n[[File:Palazzo ghazaleh 3 2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The grand q\u00e2\u2018a of Beit Ghazaleh]]\n\nThe southwest corner of the courtyard, and the West wing, was completely rebuilt in 1737. It includes three key elements: a very large rectangular room with a fireplace, a large '[[Qa'a (room)|q\u00e2\u2018a]]' and a hammam. The T-shaped 'q\u00e2\u2018a' includes three ''iwan-s'' with wooden ceilings framing a ''ataba'' with a small octagonal basin in the centre, covered with a dome. The fourth facade of the ''ataba'' opens towards the central courtyard. Its interior decor includes stone tiles with geometric patterns and wooden panels painted with cups and fruit bouquets in vases.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'q\u00e2\u2018a' has two sets of inscriptions. The poem calligraphy on transoms (in praise of the Master of the House) begins with a discourse on wine. It ends with a dedication and the name of Jirjis along with a date of 1737. Inscriptions on the ceilings offer praise to the Virgin and include a poem of love typical of [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic texts.\n\n== The 19th century additions ==\n[[File:Fa\u00e7ade Maison Ghazaleh Alep.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The main entrance to the Maison Ghazaleh]]\n\nSignificant changes were made to Beit Ghazaleh during the nineteenth century. Notably, rooms were added on the top of the North wing (dated 1880 by an inscription). A new Southern entrance to the impasse ''Chtamm\u00e2'' was built, dated 1304/1887. These major redevelopments were inspired by the appearance of consular apartments in the Aleppo urban [[caravanserai]]s<ref>For further information please see the entry for the [[Al-Madina Souq]] of Aleppo</ref> and by the architecture of embassies in the capital [[Istanbul]].\n\n== Loss, looting and destruction ==\n[[File:Beit Ghazaleh Survey September 2017.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Beit Ghazaleh survey photograph of November 2017]]\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, changes in the domestic lifestyle and the introduction of Western furniture ultimately led to aristocratic families abandoning houses such as Beit Ghazaleh. The transformation of the Ghazaleh House into a school was a factor for both its destruction and its preservation. While it allowed the preservation of the physical structure of the building, it also favoured the \"disappearance\" of a great deal of its decoration.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perspectivia.net/publikationen/bts1/12/duda_innenarchitektur#pdf-pane|title=Innenarchitektur syrischer Stadth\u00e4user des 16. bis 18.

However, the constitution prohibits then-President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] from appointing anyone two months before the presidential election up to the end of her term. This caused a suit to be brought to the Supreme Court, in which the high tribunal ruled on March 17, 2010, that the ban on appointments does not cover the judiciary. The court ruled on the case with finality on April 20, 2010, with nine justices concurring, one dissenting and two dismissing the petition for being premature. Chief Justice Puno and [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justices]] Corona and [[Antonio Carpio]] abstained from ruling on the case. The court then ordered the [[Judicial and Bar Council]] (JBC) to proceed with its nomination process and subsequently submit its shortlist of nominees for the Chief Justice to Arroyo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mb.com.ph/articles/253753/sc-upholds-ruling-allowing-arroyo-appoint-next-chief-justice |title=SC affirms ruling on next Chief Justice |first=Jeamma |last=Sabate |work=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2012-01-12 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715155714/http://mb.com.ph/articles/253753/sc-upholds-ruling-allowing-arroyo-appoint-next-chief-justice |archive-date=2012-07-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCorona was appointed Chief Justice on May 12, 2010.

Senator [[Francis Escudero]] asked prosecutor [[Niel Tupas, Jr.]] who wrote the complaints; Tupas answered that it was a collaboration. Escudero said that he was confused since each article must correspond to a singular act, and asked that both prosecution and defense submit a legal memorandum on the matter.\n\nThe impeachment court excused [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] (BIR) commissioner Kim Henares as she was not able to bring Corona's tax documents. The prosecution then presented [[Quezon City]] acting register of deeds Carlo Alcantara. Alcantata testified that Corona sold his Burgundy property to his daughter Carla Corona-Castillo. Defense counsel Serafin Cuevas told the court that he would cross-examine Alcantara on the next trial day as he would study Alcantara's submitted documents.

Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]], who has been absent at the trial up to this point, asked both the prosecution and the defense how many witness will they present for the entire trial. When Tupas could not give an answer, Santiago scolded the prosecution, saying that they should \"not waste the time of this court.\" Cuevas stated that they have 15 witnesses and over 20 documents to present.<ref name=\"Interaksyon January 24\">{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/22720/day-5-ends-early-5-things-that-happened |title=Day 5 ends early, 5 things that happened |author1=Lira Dalangin-Fernandez |author2=Abigail Kwok |author3=Karl John C.

Enrile was so offended he offered to resign \"if somebody cannot accept his rulings.\" Tupas said \"We just want flexibility to listen to the witnesses.\" Senator [[Manuel Villar]] said that while he believes Enrile was handling the trial well, he can't please everyone. Enrile then approved Santiago's motion asking both the prosecution and defense the exact number of witnesses they will present. Santiago also said that the court should be more liberal in accepting evidence, after what had happened in the impeachment trial of [[Joseph Estrada]] where they prevented the opening of the second envelope.<ref name=\"Interaksyon January 24\"/>\n\n====January 25====\nEnrile announced that the court will allow presentation of evidence for paragraphs 2.2 (nondisclosure of SALN) and 2.3 (non-inclusion of properties in the SALN), but not for paragraph 2.4 (alleged ill-gotten wealth) of Article II. The court also allowed the subpoena of the income tax returns of the Corona couple. The prosecution presented BIR Commissioner Kim Henares as their witness although Enrile asked how her testimony will be relevant to the case. In the end, she was allowed to testify although any statement on Corona's ill-gotten wealth will be disallowed. Santiago scolded both the prosecution and defense for long debates.<ref name=\"Rappler January 25\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/80-special-coverage/1105-coronatrial-day-6 |title=#CoronaTrial: Day 6 |first=KD |last=Suarez |work=Rappler |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-04-07}}</ref>\n\nPrivate prosecutor Arthur Lim began his direct examination of Henares. The prosecution presented an \"alpha list\", a document submitted by a company listing its employees, salary, and tax withheld. Enrile allowed the presentation of the Supreme Court's alpha list. Henares stated that the Supreme Court had not kept an alpha list from 2002 to 2005 and gave a testimony on Corona's income and taxes based on the court alpha list from 2006 and 2010 as well as on Corona not having an income tax return. Henares was allowed to present Cristina Corona's income tax return. She testified that Mrs. Corona was a one-time taxpayer for a property transaction on September 9, 2003. Mrs. Corona purchased the property worth 11 million pesos although she had no recorded income that year.<ref name=\"Rappler January 25\"/>\n\nLim asked if Mrs. Corona was in other alpha lists. The defense objected but Enrile allowed Henares to answer. She testified that Mrs. Corona was in the alpha list of the [[Camp John Hay]] Management Corporation where she was the CEO and president. The prosecution presented documents from alleged Corona properties in Taguig, Makati, and Quezon City.<ref name=\"Rappler January 25\"/>\n\n====January 26====\nSenator Santiago asked the prosecution on what provisions of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act are they charging Corona with. Arthur Lim replied that they are accusing Corona of violating paragraphs (c), (e), and (f) of Section 3 of the law. Santiago answered that these provisions were irrelevant in Article II, since it accuses Corona of not disclosing his SALN. She said that the more appropriate law should have been the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees which requires submission of SALN.<ref name=\"GMA January 26\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/245873/news/specialreports/day-7-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate |title=Day 7: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2012-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe court prohibited all parties to release documents that were merely \"marked\" as evidence, and cautioned the discussion of the contents of documents. This comes as the income tax returns of the Coronas were brandished on television and on the internet. Senator Escudero asked the court to only cover Corona's acts as chief justice since documents are dated even prior to him becoming one. Enrile replied that the Senate will decide on this on a caucus.<ref name=\"GMA January 26\"/>\n\nThe prosecution continued their direct examination on Henares. She said that the BIR found out that Corona's daughter, Ma. Carla Corona-Castillo, was able to buy an 18 million-peso property from her mother Cristina despite only having a monthly taxable income of 8,478 pesos. Lim asked Henares about the McKinley Hill property in Taguig; she replied that another Corona daughter, Ma. Charina, bought the property from [[Megaworld Corporation]]. Henares added that Charina never filed an income tax return, and was a one-time taxpayer, for the McKinley Hill transaction. On the cross-examination, Cuevas asked Henares if the Secretary of Finance told her \"durugin mo na si Corona (crush Corona, if possible).\" Replies replied \"No.\" Senator Arroyo said that the subsequent investigation of the BIR and the impeachment trial can be \"twin moves\" against the Coronas.<ref name=\"GMA January 26\"/>\n\nThe senators asked more questions on Henares. Pangilinan questioned if the BIR overlooked other income sources from the Coronas. She replied that the BIR exhausted all efforts, including alpha lists. Cayetano asked if there were any discrepancies with Corona's returns from his SALN; Henares answered that Corona failed to fill up the acquisition cost column, and that Corona included some properties on the next year's SALN instead of the year it was purchased. Henares also said that Corona only had one source of income.<ref name=\"GMA January 26\"/>\n\nSeveral senators also cautioned the spokespersons when discussing the merits of the case outside the court. Enrile said \"they may discuss the procedure but not the content.\"<ref name=\"GMA January 26\"/>\n\n====January 30====\nThe Senate Secretary, acting as the clerk of court of the Senate sitting as an impeachment court, read the resolution prohibiting the presentation of evidence not related to Corona or to his family, as well as the court's decision not to allow presentation of evidence about Corona's ill-gotten wealth.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/246260/news/specialreports/day-8-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate |title=Day 8: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref>\n\nEnrile then allowed the prosecutors' motion to present witnesses and evidence on Article III instead of Article I and VII, which was earlier agreed upon. Enrile also allowed the presentation in the articles in the following order: Articles II, III, I, VII, IV, V and VI. Tupas also clarified that they won't present 100 witnesses as earlier reported.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\"/>\n\nThe prosecution presented [[Megaworld Corporation]] financial director Giovanni Ng as their witness; he produced the contract to sell on Corona's Bellagio penthouse worth 14 million pesos, and the deed of absolute sale of McKinley Hills property to Charina Corona, which was not disclosed in Corona's 2009 SALN. Ng was not able to answer how much was the price of the Bellagio penthouse; private prosecutor Joseph Joemar Perez moved to subpoena Megaworld's senior vice president for marketing on the next hearing. Senator [[Aquilino Pimentel III]] asked Perez on why the prosecution was focusing on the cost of the properties, he answered that Ng told them that Corona's 40% discount worth 40 million pesos fell under Article III.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\"/>\n\nWhen asked by Senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] if Megaworld routinely sells their properties with a discount, Ng said that the company usually gives a 15% discount to buyers who pay on shorter terms; Corona was given a bigger discount since the property needed repairs. Ng, answering a question from Senator [[Franklin Drilon]], said that Charina Corona received a 2.3 million peso discount on the McKinley Hill property. The Chief Justice asked the company to put the property under his daughter's name.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\"/>\n\nPrivate prosecutor Jose Antonio Hernandez next presented Aniceto Visnar, Jr., formerly of the [[Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation]]. Visnar told the court that the Corona couple fully paid a 9.1 million peso condominium unit in Bonifacio Ridge in 2005, contrary, as prosecutors say, to Corona's SALN where it states that he bought the aforementioned property in 2004 worth 2.3 million pesos. In the cross-examination, defense lawyer Ramon Esguerra said that a notice of acceptance for the Bonifacio Ridge property did not exist, and that Bisnar should be unfamiliar with the property and whether or not Corona's wife sourced the money used to pay for the unit from a loan.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\"/>\n\n====January 31====\nNoli Hernandez, senior vice president of Megaworld, testified that the Bellagio tower purchased by the Corona couple received a steep reduction in its price after a typhoon struck the property while it is being constructed; Megaworld reduced the price from P24 million to P19.6 million. The senators asked the connection between Corona's purchase of the property, and Article II of the articles of impeachment; prosecutor Elpidio Barzaga replied that the Corona's purchase of the property was not included in his SALN. Senator [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a III]] asked Hernandez to produce proof of the damage, while Senator [[Francis Pangilinan]] asked Hernandez to submit to the Senate the engineer's report.<ref name=\"GMA January 31\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/246368/news/specialreports/day-9-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate |title=Day 9: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\n===February===\n====February 1====\n[[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) Director Benito Cataran testified on Corona's P11 million loan from his wife's Basa-Guidote Enterprises, Inc.

Cataran said that the SEC revoked BGEI's articles of incorporation and considered the company as dissolved in 2003. after it did not file general information sheets to the SEC from 1991 to 1997. Enrile countered that the corporation can't be considered as dissolved as it still has to undergo liquidation, and that the SEC can't dissolve corporations; its own stockholders or the government can do that. The senators commented that corporations that are suspended by the SEC can still lend money, and can still be sued.<ref name=\"February 1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/246508/news/specialreports/day-10-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate |title=Day 10: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\n[[Ayala Land]] assistant vice president Nerissa Josef testified on the Corona family's purchase of property at the Columns condominium in [[Makati]]. She said that the Coronas paid three installments within one year, in 2004. The prosecution noted that Corona, who only included the property in his 2010 SALN, should have included it starting from his 2004 SALN, on the year when the deed of absolute sale was issued. However, the defense countered that the Coronas refused the property due to defects, and that the Coronas only started possessing the property in 2008.<ref name=\"February 1\"/>\n\n====February 2====\nCarlo Alcantara and Sedfrey Garcia were cross examined; the former was asked about the Coronas' properties in [[Quezon City]], while the latter on their properties in [[Marikina]]. The prosecution and defense then argued on whether wrong entries in SALN constituted betrayal of public trust, with Tupas quoting [[Joaquin Bernas]], saying that \"betrayal of public trust\" was a \"catch-all phrase\" covering offenses that may not even amount to crimes.<ref name=\"February 2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/80-special-coverage/1269-coronatrial-day-11 |title=#CoronaTrial: Day 11 |first=KD |last=Suarez |work=Rappler.com |date=2012-02-02 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\nThe senators asked the prosecution on how many properties the Coronas really have. The prosecution said that the list given to them by the Land Registration Authority had 45 items, but they were not bound to abide by those. Senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] asked on the prosecution's release of the list to the media, but the prosecution said they did not.<ref name=\"February 2\"/>\n\nBurgundy Realty Corporation Vice President Gregg Gregonia testified that the Coronas had bought a condominium unit and a parking lot at One Burgundy Plaza in [[Quezon City]] in October 2000. Upon query upon the purpose of Gregonia's testimony, the prosecution said that Corona did not timely disclose the property on SALN.<ref name=\"February 2\"/>\n\n====February 6====\nEnrile, despite objections from the defense, allowed [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] (BIR) commissioner Kim Henares to testify. Henares produced the income tax returns of Constantino T. Castillo III, Corona's son-in-law to his daughter Carla. The prosecution explained the connection with Castillo's tax returns and the case, saying that the Castillo couple did not have the financial resources to buy the property for P18 million from the Corona couple. Henares also said that the BIR was in the process of investigating Corona. The defense asked her if Corona can correct the SALNs as per civil service rules; she said that Corona can't, since they were under oath, and that filing SALNs would've been useless. The prosecution asked Henares on Corona's under-declarations in his SALNs as compared to his tax returns; she enumerated properties that were not listed, and discrepancies in net worth.<ref name=\"February 6\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/80-special-coverage/1334-coronatrial-day-12 |title=#CoronaTrial: Day 12 |first=KD |last=Suarez |work=Rappler.com |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Senate then issued a subpoena on Corona's bank records, ordering the managers of [[Philippine Savings Bank]] (PSBank)'s Katipunan branch and [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] (BPI) Ayala branch to testify on February 8. The Senate based their subpoenas from documents submitted by the prosecution. Senator [[Francis Escudero]] asked where did these come from, as possession of these documents was a violation of the Bank Secrecy Law; House prosecutor Reynaldo Umali said that a \"small lady\" handed the documents to him. Majority leader [[Tito Sotto]] ordered the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms to review the CCTV to identify the \"small lady\".<ref name=\"February 6\"/>\n\n====February 7====\nThe prosecution proceeded to present the third article of impeachment: Corona's alleged \"flip-flopping\" on Supreme Court cases. The prosecution first presented Roberto Anduiza, president of the Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), which had sued [[Philippine Airlines]] for laying off its members while on strike. Anduiza said that Corona participated from the deliberations even if Supreme Court spokesperson Midas Marquez earlier said that the Chief Justice was recusing. Anduiza told the court that FASAP originally won the case at the National Labor Relations Commission, but Philippine Airlines elevated the case up to the Supreme Court. In 2008, the court ordered Philippine Airlines to reinstate crew members who were laid off. However, in 2011, the court reversed its ruling after Philippine Airlines lawyer Estelito Mendoza wrote to Corona. Anduiza said that while Corona recused in 2008, he was not among those who did not participate in the 2011 deliberations.<ref name=\"February 7\">{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/141355/pal-union-leader-testifies-vs-corona |title=PAL union leader testifies vs Corona |author1=Michael Lim Ubac |author2=TJ Bugornia |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\nSenator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] asked House prosecutor [[Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as]] on why he did not sign the impeachment complaint; Fari\u00f1as replied that he was a \"slow reader\", and that the 188 representatives who signed were \"speed readers\", and that his signature was no longer needed.

In a separate petition, Corona asked for the recusal of Associate Justices [[Maria Lourdes Sereno]] and [[Antonio Carpio]], who had been publicly against Corona, and a special raffle on the case. Corona, on his first petition, also asked the court to prohibit the implementation of the Senate's subpoena to the bank managers, and to prevent them from testifying and submitting documents; he also asked to stop the presentation of evidence pertaining to paragraphs 2.3 and 2.4 on the article alleging his ill-gotten wealth, and that to declare the impeachment complaint null and void ''[[ab initio]]'', and that to make permanent the previous temporary restraining order.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/142077/corona-asks-sc-to-stop-impeachment-trial-bank-subpoenas |title=Corona asks SC to stop impeachment trial, bank subpoenas |first=Jerome |last=Aning |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\n[[Philippine Savings Bank|PSBank]] also petitioned the Supreme Court to prevent them from testifying as it is against the Foreign Currency Deposits Act to publicize bank accounts on foreign currencies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2012/02/08/corona-psbank-ask-sc-stop-presentation-bank-records-204949 |title=Corona, PSBank ask SC to stop presentation of bank records |first=Virgil |last=Lopez |work=SunStar Manila |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\nAt the start of session, Senator [[TG Guingona]] said that the Senate, as an impeachment court, has the sole power to try impeachment cases, and that the Supreme Court should not interfere with the impeachment trial.

Enrile rules that since there is no temporary restraining order, the Senate can proceed. The prosecution presents PSBank president Pascual Garcia III, with private prosecutor Demetrio Custodio stating the purpose of illustrating that Corona owns ten accounts. Garcia only brought peso accounts; he argues that if he exposes any dollar accounts, it will also expose him and his bank to criminal liability. After a discussion, Enrile orders Custodio to submit a letter detailing the reasons why he should not be cited for [[Contempt of Congress|contempt]], and ordered him to return the next day.<ref name=\"February 8\"/>\n\nThe Senate then reads the decision on issuing subpoenas to Supreme Court justices asked by the prosecution.

Answering another question from Estrada, Tiongson said that the allegedly fake bank documents may have been retrieved from other sources. Tiongson, upon query from Senator [[Franklin Drilon]], said that while the bank documents used PSBank's standard form, some entries have been altered. Enrile then ordered PSBank President Pascual Garcia III to bring PSBank's original copies of the bank records, but only covering details that are not covered by the restraining order.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/248156/news/specialreports/day-18-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate  |title=Day 18: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |work=GMA News Online |date=2010-02-14 |accessdate=2012-05-29}}</ref>\n\n====February 16====\nPSBank president Pascual Garcia III testified that information derived from the bank documents submitted by the prosecution as \"authentic\", although some of the information are different.

She said that Banal went to the PSBank branch carrying the documents and he asked for her guidance; Banal explained that he went to the bank to ask for assistance on what \"$700K\" meant.

Garcia said that in order form to follow the Anti-Money Laundering Act, they should label accounts from people such as politicians and government appointees in high positions; this caused them to classify Corona's account under \"PEP\" or politically-exposed person.<ref name=\"February 20\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/02/20/12/psbank-amlc-audited-corona-accounts |title=PSBank: AMLC audited Corona accounts |first=Ira |last=Pedrasa |work=ABS-CBNnews.com |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2012-05-29}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Senator [[Teofisto Guingona III]] said that the AMLC denied having audited Corona's account. Garcia then said that the AMLC specialist just checked if the accounts were properly labeled, and did not check on the balances. Senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] still maintained that he believes that the prosecution-submitted bank record was authentic, alleging that the AMLC photocopied one of the signature cards.<ref name=\"February 20\"/>\n\nAnnabelle Tiongson returned to the witness stand and told the court how Representative Jorge Banal approached her; she was shocked that Banal possessed what resembled the bank's security cards. She then arranged to check if the original documents were still in the vault. Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] noted that whoever got possession of the bank records must explain how he/she could have gotten hold of them.<ref name=\"February 20\"/>\n\n====February 21====\n[[Bank of the Philippine Islands|BPI]] submitted evidence to the Senate pertaining to Corona's bank records worth 12 million pesos as of 2010.

De Lima ignored the restraining order issued by the Supreme Court and ordered Arroyo to be blocked at the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]. The defense argued that the Supreme Court decision was not solely an action of Corona, as there were other seven other justices who concurred with him.<ref name=\"February 22\"/>\n\n====February 23====\nEnrile ordered the court to disregard portions of de Lima's testimony, retaining only the portion of de Lima's narration of Sereno's dissent.

They then had a direct examination on Emma Abanador, the Office of the Vice President's administrative officer. This is for establishing that Corona had already established ties with Arroyo even when she was serving as Vice President, and prior his appointment to the Supreme Court. The final prosecution witness was [[ABS-CBN]] cameraman Edmond Losalla who authenticated the raw videos of the Supreme Court's November 15, 2011 press conference that allowed the Arroyos to leave the country, and an interview to Arroyo lawyer [[Ferdinand Topacio]]. The defense argued that Losalia's testimony was irrelevant to the case.<ref name=\"February 27\"/>\n\n====February 28====\nThe [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] held their Grand Evangelical Mission at [[Rizal Park]], causing massive traffic jams. This also caused some of the defense lawyers to be tardy at the trial; the Senate allowed the trial to start at a later time in order for the entire defense team to be present.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/02/28/12/inc-prayer-rally-delays-corona-trial |title=INC prayer rally delays Corona trial |work=ABS-CBNnews.com |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}</ref> Later, the Supreme Court issued an order preventing its employees from testifying at the impeachment trial, saying that it is not waving its judicial privilege.

House prosecutor [[Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as]] later successfully asked the Senate to remove the word \"gago\" from the records. Tupas then said that they would no longer pursue the testimony of Justice [[Maria Lourdes Sereno]], and they would rest the case with reservation. When Senator [[Francis Escudero]] asked Tupas on whether the dropping of the articles of impeachment constitutes an amendment of the complaint, and whether the 188 signatories were consulted, Tupas said that there was no consultation, although they told the Speaker [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] about it. The defense said that they will still present evidence on the five dropped articles, and ask the Senate to acquit Corona on those. Enrile gave the prosection until March 2 to submit a formal offer to drop those five articles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/249905/news/specialreports/day-26-corona-trial-highlights-prosecution-lawyer-cited-for-contempt |title=Day 26 Corona trial highlights: Prosecution lawyer cited for contempt |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}</ref>\n\nSenator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] asked who was the prosecutor who had covered his ears while Santiago was scolding them; it was identified as private prosecutor [[Vitaliano Aguirre II]] (he would become Justice Secretary four years later). When asked for the reason, Aguirre said that, for the first time forty years, it was the first time he saw a judge lecture the prosecution in court. The Senate later cited Aguirre for contempt, and House prosecutor Fari\u00f1as apologized in behalf of the prosecution.

Tiangco testified that the impeachment complaint was meant to \"control or scare\" the Supreme Court. He narrated that Speaker [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]], in a caucus on December 12, said that Corona should be impeached due to his closeness with Representative Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

The La Vista property, which cost 18 million pesos, was transferred by the Corona couple to their daughter Maria Clara. Alcantara also provided other transfers of the Corona couple's properties in Quezon City, which cost a combined 25.5 million pesos, to Maria Clara's husband.

The senators then chastised the prosecution panel and Diaz. When asked on how this happened, Diaz replied that the list was \"computer-generated\". Tupas denied that the prosecution misled the public, saying \"We have every reason to believe the authenticity of these documents.\" Diaz, upon further questions from [[Loren Legarda]], admitted that the LRA also included in the search the names of Corona's wife and children; that's how the LRA came up with a list of 45 properties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/164761/prosecution-aquino-classmate-grilled |title=Prosecution, Aquino classmate grilled |author1=Michael Lim Ubac |author2=TJ Burgonio |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\n====March 21====\nThe prosecution maintains that Corona owns 21 of the 45 properties submitted by the LRA; the prosecution included in the 21 properties the properties that are named under the Corona children but were allegedly actually owned by Corona.

Corona added that there are people acting in a conspiracy to remove him from office: those who want to prevent the distribution of [[Hacienda Luisita]], a [[hacienda]] owned by the family of President Aquino, to its farmer-beneficiaries, a vice presidential candidate who lost the [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010 vice presidential election]], and an Associate Justice who wants to succeed him as Chief Justice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/128947/chief-justice-corona-there-is-no-turning-back |title=Chief Justice Corona: There is no turning back |first=Matikas |last=Santos |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-01-16 |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref>\n\nThe trial started at 2:10 p.m, with Senate President Ponce Enrile, the presiding officer, calling the Senate to order. Two senators, [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] and [[Loren Legarda]], were absent on the first day. Niel Tupas led the public prosecutors in presenting themselves, followed by the private prosecutors, who stated that they are under the complete control of the public prosecutors. Corona's defense also presented themselves, with defense chief Serafin Cuevas presenting Corona at the gallery, and entered a plea of not guilty on behalf of the defendant.<ref name=\"day1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/244760/news/specialreports/day-1-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate?ref=latest |title=Day 1: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |first=Marlon Anthony R. |last=Tonson |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-01-16 |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref>\n\nMajority floor leader [[Tito Sotto]] moved to tackle the defense's motion for a preliminary hearing. The defense argued that impeachment complaint was \"fatally defective\" as there was a defect in the verification of the 188 signatures. The presiding officer prohibited Tupas' request allowing private prosecutor Mario Bautista to argue in behalf of the prosecution. Tupas instead was the one who argued for the prosecution, saying that the impeachment complaint was passed according to the rules of the House of Representatives.<ref name=\"day1\"/>\n\nSotto then moved to tackle a motion filed by private lawyer Fernando Perito to cite the prosecution for indirect contempt on their press conference stating that Corona had ill-gotten wealth. The presiding officer also dismissed the request, stating that Perido is not a party to the case. The president officer then requested all parties to refrain from issuing statements relating to the case outside of the impeachment court.<ref name=\"day1\"/>\n\n====January 17====\nThe Senate threw out a motion to [[subpoena]] Chief Justice Corona, his wife and family by a vote of 14\u20136. Initially, the request was decided upon Senate President Ponce Enrile as presiding officer but was contested by Senate Minority Leader [[Alan Peter Cayetano]] citing that there was a need to compel them to testify over allegations that the properties were placed under the names to ill-gotten wealth. Enrile, however said that such a request will forfeit the right of [[self-incrimination]] and giving evidence by under duress.\nMeanwhile, the motion of the defense to deny the appearance of private prosecutors of the prosecution was denied, thereby the prosecution's privilege to retain the use of private prosecutors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/129943/senate-won%E2%80%99t-call-corona-kin |title=Senate won\u2019t call Corona kin - CJ side scores on 2nd round |first=Christian V. |last=Esguerra |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2012-01-18}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Senate approved subpoenas to the clerk of the Supreme Court Enriqueta Esguerra-Vidal and the register of deeds and land assessors in the cities of [[Makati]], [[Marikina]], [[Pasay]], [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Quezon City]] and [[Taguig]], where the alleged properties of Corona are found.

Five petitions, headed by former [[Misamis Oriental]] Governor Homobono Adaza were consolidated by the court and required the Senate to comment on the petitions within ten days. Supreme Court spokesperson Jose Midas Marquez said that the court could issue an order at any time and or call for oral arguments. He furthers on that the matter is with the Senate and says the process is ongoing. The petitions were filed due to the alleged railroading of the impeachment complaint against the Chief Justice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/129671/sc-averts-crisis-issues-no-tro-on-corona-trial |title=SC averts crisis, issues no TRO on Corona trial |first=Philip C. |last=Tubeza |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2012-01-18}}</ref>\n\n====January 18====\nSupreme Court clerk of court Enriqueta Esguerra-Vidal, turned over copies of the statements of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALNs) of Chief Justice Corona from the years 2002 to 2010 to the Senate. This was after the constant compelling of senator-judges and the prosecutors. Esguerra-Vidal insisted that she be given permission to release the said documents citing a Supreme Court ruling dated on May 2, 1989; that prohibits \"deceptive requests for information\" with regard to the release of SALNs of the judiciary. Senate President Ponce Enrile told that she had to comply with the said subpoena and give the said documents to the Senate. Supreme Court spokesperson Jose Midas Marquez would later say that the clerk was not in any legal hurdle as Corona authorized the release of the documents.<ref name=\"Yamsuan\">{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/130453/round-3-of-corona-trial-to-prosecution |title=SC clerk of court turns over Corona SALNs |first=Cathy C. |last=Yamsuan |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-01-19 |accessdate=2012-01-25}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Marianito Dimaandal, head director of the Malaca\u00f1ang Records Office testified and said that SALNs of Chief Justice Corona from 1992 to 2010 exist.

Senator [[Francis Escudero]] asked prosecutor [[Niel Tupas, Jr.]] who wrote the complaints; Tupas answered that it was a collaboration. Escudero said that he was confused since each article must correspond to a singular act, and asked that both prosecution and defense submit a legal memorandum on the matter.\n\nThe impeachment court excused [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] (BIR) commissioner Kim Henares as she was not able to bring Corona's tax documents. The prosecution then presented [[Quezon City]] acting register of deeds Carlo Alcantara. Alcantata testified that Corona sold his Burgundy property to his daughter Carla Corona-Castillo. Defense counsel Serafin Cuevas told the court that he would cross-examine Alcantara on the next trial day as he would study Alcantara's submitted documents. The prosecution then presented [[Marikina]] Register of Deeds Sedfrey Garcia but he was told to return on the next trial day.<ref name=\"GMA News January 19\"/>\n\n====January 24====\nWhile the defense submitted its memorandum regarding Article II, the prosecution failed to submit theirs before the trial began; Presiding Officer [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] ordered the prosecution to pass it before the trial starts on the next day. Senator [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]], who has been absent at the trial up to this point, asked both the prosecution and the defense how many witness will they present for the entire trial. When Tupas could not give an answer, Santiago scolded the prosecution, saying that they should \"not waste the time of this court.\" Cuevas stated that they have 15 witnesses and over 20 documents to present.<ref name=\"Interaksyon January 24\">{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/22720/day-5-ends-early-5-things-that-happened |title=Day 5 ends early, 5 things that happened |author1=Lira Dalangin-Fernandez |author2=Abigail Kwok |author3=Karl John C.

Enrile was so offended he offered to resign \"if somebody cannot accept his rulings.\" Tupas said \"We just want flexibility to listen to the witnesses.\" Senator [[Manuel Villar]] said that while he believes Enrile was handling the trial well, he can't please everyone. Enrile then approved Santiago's motion asking both the prosecution and defense the exact number of witnesses they will present. Santiago also said that the court should be more liberal in accepting evidence, after what had happened in the impeachment trial of [[Joseph Estrada]] where they prevented the opening of the second envelope.<ref name=\"Interaksyon January 24\"/>\n\n====January 25====\nEnrile announced that the court will allow presentation of evidence for paragraphs 2.2 (nondisclosure of SALN) and 2.3 (non-inclusion of properties in the SALN), but not for paragraph 2.4 (alleged ill-gotten wealth) of Article II. The court also allowed the subpoena of the income tax returns of the Corona couple. The prosecution presented BIR Commissioner Kim Henares as their witness although Enrile asked how her testimony will be relevant to the case. In the end, she was allowed to testify although any statement on Corona's ill-gotten wealth will be disallowed. Santiago scolded both the prosecution and defense for long debates.<ref name=\"Rappler January 25\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/80-special-coverage/1105-coronatrial-day-6 |title=#CoronaTrial: Day 6 |first=KD |last=Suarez |work=Rappler |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-04-07}}</ref>\n\nPrivate prosecutor Arthur Lim began his direct examination of Henares. The prosecution presented an \"alpha list\", a document submitted by a company listing its employees, salary, and tax withheld. Enrile allowed the presentation of the Supreme Court's alpha list. Henares stated that the Supreme Court had not kept an alpha list from 2002 to 2005 and gave a testimony on Corona's income and taxes based on the court alpha list from 2006 and 2010 as well as on Corona not having an income tax return. Henares was allowed to present Cristina Corona's income tax return. She testified that Mrs. Corona was a one-time taxpayer for a property transaction on September 9, 2003. Mrs. Corona purchased the property worth 11 million pesos although she had no recorded income that year.<ref name=\"Rappler January 25\"/>\n\nLim asked if Mrs. Corona was in other alpha lists. The defense objected but Enrile allowed Henares to answer. She testified that Mrs. Corona was in the alpha list of the [[Camp John Hay]] Management Corporation where she was the CEO and president. The prosecution presented documents from alleged Corona properties in Taguig, Makati, and Quezon City.<ref name=\"Rappler January 25\"/>\n\n====January 26====\nSenator Santiago asked the prosecution on what provisions of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act are they charging Corona with. Arthur Lim replied that they are accusing Corona of violating paragraphs (c), (e), and (f) of Section 3 of the law. Santiago answered that these provisions were irrelevant in Article II, since it accuses Corona of not disclosing his SALN. She said that the more appropriate law should have been the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees which requires submission of SALN.<ref name=\"GMA January 26\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/245873/news/specialreports/day-7-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate |title=Day 7: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-01-26 |accessdate=2012-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe court prohibited all parties to release documents that were merely \"marked\" as evidence, and cautioned the discussion of the contents of documents. This comes as the income tax returns of the Coronas were brandished on television and on the internet. Senator Escudero asked the court to only cover Corona's acts as chief justice since documents are dated even prior to him becoming one. Enrile replied that the Senate will decide on this on a caucus.<ref name=\"GMA January 26\"/>\n\nThe prosecution continued their direct examination on Henares. She said that the BIR found out that Corona's daughter, Ma. Carla Corona-Castillo, was able to buy an 18 million-peso property from her mother Cristina despite only having a monthly taxable income of 8,478 pesos. Lim asked Henares about the McKinley Hill property in Taguig; she replied that another Corona daughter, Ma. Charina, bought the property from [[Megaworld Corporation]]. Henares added that Charina never filed an income tax return, and was a one-time taxpayer, for the McKinley Hill transaction. On the cross-examination, Cuevas asked Henares if the Secretary of Finance told her \"durugin mo na si Corona (crush Corona, if possible).\" Replies replied \"No.\" Senator Arroyo said that the subsequent investigation of the BIR and the impeachment trial can be \"twin moves\" against the Coronas.<ref name=\"GMA January 26\"/>\n\nThe senators asked more questions on Henares. Pangilinan questioned if the BIR overlooked other income sources from the Coronas. She replied that the BIR exhausted all efforts, including alpha lists. Cayetano asked if there were any discrepancies with Corona's returns from his SALN; Henares answered that Corona failed to fill up the acquisition cost column, and that Corona included some properties on the next year's SALN instead of the year it was purchased. Henares also said that Corona only had one source of income.<ref name=\"GMA January 26\"/>\n\nSeveral senators also cautioned the spokespersons when discussing the merits of the case outside the court. Enrile said \"they may discuss the procedure but not the content.\"<ref name=\"GMA January 26\"/>\n\n====January 30====\nThe Senate Secretary, acting as the clerk of court of the Senate sitting as an impeachment court, read the resolution prohibiting the presentation of evidence not related to Corona or to his family, as well as the court's decision not to allow presentation of evidence about Corona's ill-gotten wealth.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/246260/news/specialreports/day-8-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate |title=Day 8: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref>\n\nEnrile then allowed the prosecutors' motion to present witnesses and evidence on Article III instead of Article I and VII, which was earlier agreed upon. Enrile also allowed the presentation in the articles in the following order: Articles II, III, I, VII, IV, V and VI. Tupas also clarified that they won't present 100 witnesses as earlier reported.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\"/>\n\nThe prosecution presented [[Megaworld Corporation]] financial director Giovanni Ng as their witness; he produced the contract to sell on Corona's Bellagio penthouse worth 14 million pesos, and the deed of absolute sale of McKinley Hills property to Charina Corona, which was not disclosed in Corona's 2009 SALN. Ng was not able to answer how much was the price of the Bellagio penthouse; private prosecutor Joseph Joemar Perez moved to subpoena Megaworld's senior vice president for marketing on the next hearing. Senator [[Aquilino Pimentel III]] asked Perez on why the prosecution was focusing on the cost of the properties, he answered that Ng told them that Corona's 40% discount worth 40 million pesos fell under Article III.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\"/>\n\nWhen asked by Senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] if Megaworld routinely sells their properties with a discount, Ng said that the company usually gives a 15% discount to buyers who pay on shorter terms; Corona was given a bigger discount since the property needed repairs. Ng, answering a question from Senator [[Franklin Drilon]], said that Charina Corona received a 2.3 million peso discount on the McKinley Hill property. The Chief Justice asked the company to put the property under his daughter's name.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\"/>\n\nPrivate prosecutor Jose Antonio Hernandez next presented Aniceto Visnar, Jr., formerly of the [[Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation]]. Visnar told the court that the Corona couple fully paid a 9.1 million peso condominium unit in Bonifacio Ridge in 2005, contrary, as prosecutors say, to Corona's SALN where it states that he bought the aforementioned property in 2004 worth 2.3 million pesos. In the cross-examination, defense lawyer Ramon Esguerra said that a notice of acceptance for the Bonifacio Ridge property did not exist, and that Bisnar should be unfamiliar with the property and whether or not Corona's wife sourced the money used to pay for the unit from a loan.<ref name=\"GMA January 27\"/>\n\n====January 31====\nNoli Hernandez, senior vice president of Megaworld, testified that the Bellagio tower purchased by the Corona couple received a steep reduction in its price after a typhoon struck the property while it is being constructed; Megaworld reduced the price from P24 million to P19.6 million. The senators asked the connection between Corona's purchase of the property, and Article II of the articles of impeachment; prosecutor Elpidio Barzaga replied that the Corona's purchase of the property was not included in his SALN. Senator [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a III]] asked Hernandez to produce proof of the damage, while Senator [[Francis Pangilinan]] asked Hernandez to submit to the Senate the engineer's report.<ref name=\"GMA January 31\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/246368/news/specialreports/day-9-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate |title=Day 9: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\n===February===\n====February 1====\n[[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) Director Benito Cataran testified on Corona's P11 million loan from his wife's Basa-Guidote Enterprises, Inc.

Cataran said that the SEC revoked BGEI's articles of incorporation and considered the company as dissolved in 2003. after it did not file general information sheets to the SEC from 1991 to 1997. Enrile countered that the corporation can't be considered as dissolved as it still has to undergo liquidation, and that the SEC can't dissolve corporations; its own stockholders or the government can do that. The senators commented that corporations that are suspended by the SEC can still lend money, and can still be sued.<ref name=\"February 1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/246508/news/specialreports/day-10-highlights-of-corona-impeachment-trial-at-the-senate |title=Day 10: Highlights of Corona impeachment trial at the Senate |work=GMA News Online |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\n[[Ayala Land]] assistant vice president Nerissa Josef testified on the Corona family's purchase of property at the Columns condominium in [[Makati]]. She said that the Coronas paid three installments within one year, in 2004. The prosecution noted that Corona, who only included the property in his 2010 SALN, should have included it starting from his 2004 SALN, on the year when the deed of absolute sale was issued. However, the defense countered that the Coronas refused the property due to defects, and that the Coronas only started possessing the property in 2008.<ref name=\"February 1\"/>\n\n====February 2====\nCarlo Alcantara and Sedfrey Garcia were cross examined; the former was asked about the Coronas' properties in [[Quezon City]], while the latter on their properties in [[Marikina]]. The prosecution and defense then argued on whether wrong entries in SALN constituted betrayal of public trust, with Tupas quoting [[Joaquin Bernas]], saying that \"betrayal of public trust\" was a \"catch-all phrase\" covering offenses that may not even amount to crimes.<ref name=\"February 2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/80-special-coverage/1269-coronatrial-day-11 |title=#CoronaTrial: Day 11 |first=KD |last=Suarez |work=Rappler.com |date=2012-02-02 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\nThe senators asked the prosecution on how many properties the Coronas really have. The prosecution said that the list given to them by the Land Registration Authority had 45 items, but they were not bound to abide by those. Senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] asked on the prosecution's release of the list to the media, but the prosecution said they did not.<ref name=\"February 2\"/>\n\nBurgundy Realty Corporation Vice President Gregg Gregonia testified that the Coronas had bought a condominium unit and a parking lot at One Burgundy Plaza in [[Quezon City]] in October 2000. Upon query upon the purpose of Gregonia's testimony, the prosecution said that Corona did not timely disclose the property on SALN.<ref name=\"February 2\"/>\n\n====February 6====\nEnrile, despite objections from the defense, allowed [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|Bureau of Internal Revenue]] (BIR) commissioner Kim Henares to testify. Henares produced the income tax returns of Constantino T. Castillo III, Corona's son-in-law to his daughter Carla. The prosecution explained the connection with Castillo's tax returns and the case, saying that the Castillo couple did not have the financial resources to buy the property for P18 million from the Corona couple. Henares also said that the BIR was in the process of investigating Corona. The defense asked her if Corona can correct the SALNs as per civil service rules; she said that Corona can't, since they were under oath, and that filing SALNs would've been useless. The prosecution asked Henares on Corona's under-declarations in his SALNs as compared to his tax returns; she enumerated properties that were not listed, and discrepancies in net worth.<ref name=\"February 6\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/80-special-coverage/1334-coronatrial-day-12 |title=#CoronaTrial: Day 12 |first=KD |last=Suarez |work=Rappler.com |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Senate then issued a subpoena on Corona's bank records, ordering the managers of [[Philippine Savings Bank]] (PSBank)'s Katipunan branch and [[Bank of the Philippine Islands]] (BPI) Ayala branch to testify on February 8. The Senate based their subpoenas from documents submitted by the prosecution. Senator [[Francis Escudero]] asked where did these come from, as possession of these documents was a violation of the Bank Secrecy Law; House prosecutor Reynaldo Umali said that a \"small lady\" handed the documents to him. Majority leader [[Tito Sotto]] ordered the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms to review the CCTV to identify the \"small lady\".<ref name=\"February 6\"/>\n\n====February 7====\nThe prosecution proceeded to present the third article of impeachment: Corona's alleged \"flip-flopping\" on Supreme Court cases. The prosecution first presented Roberto Anduiza, president of the Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), which had sued [[Philippine Airlines]] for laying off its members while on strike. Anduiza said that Corona participated from the deliberations even if Supreme Court spokesperson Midas Marquez earlier said that the Chief Justice was recusing. Anduiza told the court that FASAP originally won the case at the National Labor Relations Commission, but Philippine Airlines elevated the case up to the Supreme Court. In 2008, the court ordered Philippine Airlines to reinstate crew members who were laid off. However, in 2011, the court reversed its ruling after Philippine Airlines lawyer Estelito Mendoza wrote to Corona. Anduiza said that while Corona recused in 2008, he was not among those who did not participate in the 2011 deliberations.<ref name=\"February 7\">{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/141355/pal-union-leader-testifies-vs-corona |title=PAL union leader testifies vs Corona |author1=Michael Lim Ubac |author2=TJ Bugornia |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\nSenator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] asked House prosecutor [[Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as]] on why he did not sign the impeachment complaint; Fari\u00f1as replied that he was a \"slow reader\", and that the 188 representatives who signed were \"speed readers\", and that his signature was no longer needed.

In a separate petition, Corona asked for the recusal of Associate Justices [[Maria Lourdes Sereno]] and [[Antonio Carpio]], who had been publicly against Corona, and a special raffle on the case. Corona, on his first petition, also asked the court to prohibit the implementation of the Senate's subpoena to the bank managers, and to prevent them from testifying and submitting documents; he also asked to stop the presentation of evidence pertaining to paragraphs 2.3 and 2.4 on the article alleging his ill-gotten wealth, and that to declare the impeachment complaint null and void ''[[ab initio]]'', and that to make permanent the previous temporary restraining order.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/142077/corona-asks-sc-to-stop-impeachment-trial-bank-subpoenas |title=Corona asks SC to stop impeachment trial, bank subpoenas |first=Jerome |last=Aning |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\n[[Philippine Savings Bank|PSBank]] also petitioned the Supreme Court to prevent them from testifying as it is against the Foreign Currency Deposits Act to publicize bank accounts on foreign currencies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2012/02/08/corona-psbank-ask-sc-stop-presentation-bank-records-204949 |title=Corona, PSBank ask SC to stop presentation of bank records |first=Virgil |last=Lopez |work=SunStar Manila |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\nAt the start of session, Senator [[TG Guingona]] said that the Senate, as an impeachment court, has the sole power to try impeachment cases, and that the Supreme Court should not interfere with the impeachment trial.

Enrile rules that since there is no temporary restraining order, the Senate can proceed. The prosecution presents PSBank president Pascual Garcia III, with private prosecutor Demetrio Custodio stating the purpose of illustrating that Corona owns ten accounts. Garcia only brought peso accounts; he argues that if he exposes any dollar accounts, it will also expose him and his bank to criminal liability.

Answering another question from Estrada, Tiongson said that the allegedly fake bank documents may have been retrieved from other sources. Tiongson, upon query from Senator [[Franklin Drilon]], said that while the bank documents used PSBank's standard form, some entries have been altered.

They then had a direct examination on Emma Abanador, the Office of the Vice President's administrative officer. This is for establishing that Corona had already established ties with Arroyo even when she was serving as Vice President, and prior his appointment to the Supreme Court. The final prosecution witness was [[ABS-CBN]] cameraman Edmond Losalla who authenticated the raw videos of the Supreme Court's November 15, 2011 press conference that allowed the Arroyos to leave the country, and an interview to Arroyo lawyer [[Ferdinand Topacio]].

House prosecutor [[Rodolfo Fari\u00f1as]] later successfully asked the Senate to remove the word \"gago\" from the records.

The La Vista property, which cost 18 million pesos, was transferred by the Corona couple to their daughter Maria Clara. Alcantara also provided other transfers of the Corona couple's properties in Quezon City, which cost a combined 25.5 million pesos, to Maria Clara's husband.

However, Diaz later said most of the properties on the list either no longer belonged to the Corona couple, or were never registered under the couple's names. The senators then chastised the prosecution panel and Diaz. When asked on how this happened, Diaz replied that the list was \"computer-generated\". Tupas denied that the prosecution misled the public, saying \"We have every reason to believe the authenticity of these documents.\" Diaz, upon further questions from [[Loren Legarda]], admitted that the LRA also included in the search the names of Corona's wife and children; that's how the LRA came up with a list of 45 properties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/164761/prosecution-aquino-classmate-grilled |title=Prosecution, Aquino classmate grilled |author1=Michael Lim Ubac |author2=TJ Burgonio |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\n====March 21====\nThe prosecution maintains that Corona owns 21 of the 45 properties submitted by the LRA; the prosecution included in the 21 properties the properties that are named under the Corona children but were allegedly actually owned by Corona.

[[Jinggoy Estrada]] then asked Diaz if he was willingly aiding the prosecution or simply made a mistake; Diaz replied \"I won't accept that I'm in cahoots with prosecution. I also can't readily accept I made a mistake.\" When [[Bongbong Marcos]] asked Diaz on why he made the list, he said he was following the prosecution's orders.

[[Lito Atienza]], the former [[mayor of Manila]], was the defense's next witness. The former mayor recalled the transaction involving a piece of property between the city government and Basa-Guidote Enterprises, Inc. (BGEI), the defense says Mrs. Corona was authorized to act in lieu of BGEI. Atienza testified that the sale, which cost the city 34,703,800 pesos, was legal.
