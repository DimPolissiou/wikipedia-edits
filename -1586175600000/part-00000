The detaining authority passes the order of detention on subjective satisfaction\u2026 To prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous power the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed and meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards, however technical, is, in our opinion, mandatory and vital.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rekha vs State Of T.Nadu |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192877/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Lack of SOPs ====\n\nAn RTI application to the J&K Home Department filed by members of the J&K RTI Movement, reveled that the State Government of J&K has not made any Rules or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under PSA, during the four decades of its existence. <ref name=\"SOP\">{{cite web |title=NO RULES, SOPS FOR ORDERING PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS UNDER J&K PSA |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/no-rules-sops-for-ordering-preventive-detentions-under-jk-psa |website=HRI |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nEvery year the detaining authorities have been issuing hundreds and at times thousands of detention orders without any SOPs to guide them except the reports and dossiers prepared by the J&K Police.<ref name=\"SOP\"/>\n\n\n==== Failure to Scrutinize Evidence ====\n\nIn an interview to Amnesty International, a former District Magistrate said that the Magistrates do not have dedicated assistance available, which could verify and seriously examine the police version, thus the District Magistrate as to necessarily rely on the reports filed by the police. Thus reducing their role to mere rubber stamps.<ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\nAmnesty India observed a common flaw in the detention orders where the detaining authorities reproduced word-for-word the dossier given by the police which contained the allegations against the person detained.<ref name=\"AI India\"/> <br>\nMany such detention orders have been quashed by the High Court, for example in May 2017, a detention was quashed by the High Court, stating among other reasons: \u201cPerusal of grounds of detention would show that it is a verbatim copy of Dossier of Senior Superintendent of Police submitted by him to the Concerned Magistrate.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=Bashir Ahmad Mir vs State Of J&K |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/15456862/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n\n\n=== Role of Advisory Boards  ===\n\nSince the PSA does not make any provision for judicial review or any appeal process to detainees, under Section 14 of the PSA<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>, a non- judicial body, Advisory Board is set up to review detention orders and determine whether there is sufficient cause for detention. The Advisory Board examines the case only in the initial stages of the detention. There is no provision in the PSA to appeal against the decision of the Advisory Board.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/> \n\n==== Appointment  ====\n\nAdvisory Board consists of two members and a chairperson, which are appointed by the government. Prior to the Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018<ref name=\"Ord\"/>, the members of the Advisory Board were appointed by the Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\n\nBut the ordinance<ref name=\"Ord\">{{cite web |title=Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018 |url=http://jklaw.nic.in/pdf/preanative%20decation%20.pdf |website=JK Law Department |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>, changed the manner in which the members of the Advisory Board were selected, now the members \u2013 provided they were not sitting judges \u2013 would be appointed by the government on the recommendations of a 3-person committee made up of senior state bureaucrats.<ref name=\"Ord\"/> The ordinance removes the mandatory requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice of the J&K High Court. Thus enhancing the role that the executive play and reducing the independence of the Advisory Board. <ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\n\n\n==== Functioning ====\n\nThe Advisory Board is required to review the grounds of detention and the representation, if any, by the person detained.

The detaining authority passes the order of detention on subjective satisfaction\u2026 To prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous power the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed and meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards, however technical, is, in our opinion, mandatory and vital.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rekha vs State Of T.Nadu |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192877/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Lack of SOPs ====\n\nAn RTI application to the J&K Home Department filed by members of the J&K RTI Movement, reveled that the State Government of J&K has not made any Rules or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under PSA, during the four decades of its existence. <ref name=\"SOP\">{{cite web |title=NO RULES, SOPS FOR ORDERING PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS UNDER J&K PSA |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/no-rules-sops-for-ordering-preventive-detentions-under-jk-psa |website=HRI |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nEvery year the detaining authorities have been issuing hundreds and at times thousands of detention orders without any SOPs to guide them except the reports and dossiers prepared by the J&K Police.<ref name=\"SOP\"/>\n\n\n==== Failure to Scrutinize Evidence ====\n\nIn an interview to Amnesty International, a former District Magistrate said that the Magistrates do not have dedicated assistance available, which could verify and seriously examine the police version, thus the District Magistrate as to necessarily rely on the reports filed by the police. Thus reducing their role to mere rubber stamps.<ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\nAmnesty India observed a common flaw in the detention orders where the detaining authorities reproduced word-for-word the dossier given by the police which contained the allegations against the person detained.<ref name=\"AI India\"/> <br>\nMany such detention orders have been quashed by the High Court, for example in May 2017, a detention was quashed by the High Court, stating among other reasons: \u201cPerusal of grounds of detention would show that it is a verbatim copy of Dossier of Senior Superintendent of Police submitted by him to the Concerned Magistrate.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=Bashir Ahmad Mir vs State Of J&K |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/15456862/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n\n\n=== Role of Advisory Boards  ===\n\nSince the PSA does not make any provision for judicial review or any appeal process to detainees, under Section 14 of the PSA<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>, a non- judicial body, Advisory Board is set up to review detention orders and determine whether there is sufficient cause for detention. The Advisory Board examines the case only in the initial stages of the detention. There is no provision in the PSA to appeal against the decision of the Advisory Board.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/> \n\n==== Appointment  ====\n\nAdvisory Board consists of two members and a chairperson, which are appointed by the government. Prior to the Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018<ref name=\"Ord\"/>, the members of the Advisory Board were appointed by the Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\n\nBut the ordinance<ref name=\"Ord\">{{cite web |title=Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018 |url=http://jklaw.nic.in/pdf/preanative%20decation%20.pdf |website=JK Law Department |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>, changed the manner in which the members of the Advisory Board were selected, now the members \u2013 provided they were not sitting judges \u2013 would be appointed by the government on the recommendations of a 3-person committee made up of senior state bureaucrats.<ref name=\"Ord\"/> The ordinance removes the mandatory requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice of the J&K High Court. Thus enhancing the role that the executive play and reducing the independence of the Advisory Board. <ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\n\n\n==== Functioning ====\n\nThe Advisory Board is required to review the grounds of detention and the representation, if any, by the person detained. Anyone detained under PSA is not entitled to legal counsel. <ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\nThe board is known for almost always upholding the  detention orders passed by executive officials.

The term \"Rozvi\" refers to their legacy as a warrior nation known as the plunderers.\n\n==History==\nIn 1683, Portuguese militia tried to take control of the gold trade in the interior of Africa by invading the Rozvi empire. The Rozvi, armed with the traditional spears and shields, were able to successfully defeat these attacks and maintain their control of the gold mines until their empire collapsed.

After Dombo's death, his successor adopted the title Mambo. The term \"Rozvi\" refers to their legacy as a warrior nation known as the plunderers.\n\n==History==\nIn 1683, Portuguese militia tried to take control of the gold trade in the interior of Africa by invading the Rozvi empire. The Rozvi, armed with the traditional spears and shields, were able to successfully defeat these attacks and maintain their control of the gold mines until their empire collapsed. The Rozvi were led by [[Changamire Dombo]], and his son Kambgun Dombo<ref>Isichei, Elizabeth Allo, ''A History of African Societies to 1870'' Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0521455992}} page 435</ref> whose power was based in [[Kingdom of Butua|Butua]] in the southwest of Africa.
