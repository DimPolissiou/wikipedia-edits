Clarkson and Caroline Hodges Persell, pg. 43</ref>\n\nThe school attracted many members of [[Boston Brahmin]] and [[Ward McAllister|New York Knickerbocker]] families.<ref>St. Mark's School, A Centennial History (Hall, Stinehour Press, Lunenberg, VT, 1967</ref>\n\n===Arrival of William Greenough Thayer===\nThe school faced initial challenges, including financial difficulties and the instability resulting from employing four different headmasters in its first seventeen years of existence, followed by the appointment of William E. Peck in 1882.  Peck was often in conflict with the trustees, until 1894, when he resigned and founded [[Pomfret School]], taking a number of students and teachers with him.  It wasn't until the appointment of Headmaster [[William Greenough Thayer]] (who had taught for five years at slightly younger athletic archrival [[Groton School]]) in 1894 that St. Mark's began to experience stability.  Thayer led the school until 1930. News of his pending retirement was reported by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' in 1929.<ref>Time Magazine, \"Twill\" December 2, 1929</ref>\n\nThayer's knack for attracting socially-well-connected families proved durable.  His admissions policy, modeled on that of English [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public Schools]], prioritized admissions on the basis of when one's parents had \u201cput one's name down\u201d.  In practice this led over time to a school dominated by sons of alumni. Girls were not admitted until 1978.\n\nSt. Mark's social standing did not pass unnoticed in wider America.  [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], in his 1920 novel \u201c[[This Side of Paradise]]\u201d, identified St. Mark's as a school which \u201c...recruited from Boston and the Knickerbocker families of New York.\u201d <ref>F. Scott Fitzgerald, This Side of Paradise, (New York, Scribners, 1920)</ref>\n\n[[Sports]] were emphasized.  In the early years masters played with boys on the same teams, and the traditional football rivalry with Groton was slowly expanded to include the English game of \u201c[[fives]]\u201d, [[baseball]], and other sports.\n\n===Parkman period===\nWith Thayer's retirement in 1930, Headmaster Francis Parkman was chosen to lead the school. Parkman brought the noted poet [[Richard Eberhart]] to the school as an English teacher from 1933 to 1941, and [[W. H. Auden]] for a brief appointment in 1939. Auden described St. Mark's to a friend as a school that \"sets out to be a sort of American [[Eton College|Eton]]\u201d. Auden was reportedly struck by the \u201cdimness of the boys and the reverence of America for the average.\u201d<ref>[http://www.audensociety.org ''The Newsletter of the W. H.

Auden Society|first=Edward Mendelson, webmaster|last=audensociety.org|date=|website=www.AudenSociety.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> Eberhart briefly memorializes Auden's time at St. Mark's with his poem \u201cTo W. H. Auden on his Fiftieth Birthday\u201d, in which he mentions the school in passing.\n\nParkman left the school in 1942 \u2013 to enlist in the army \u2013 and never returned, although he remained active in independent school policy all his life, eventually rising to the presidency of the [[National Association of Independent Schools]] in Boston.\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] changed the campus.  In 1942 Parkman was replaced by William Brewster, an Episcopal clergyman who remained only until 1947. Brewster's democratizing tendencies were abetted by exigencies of the war effort.  The school was forced to cope with labor shortages that forced students to work in dormitories and in the dining hall. The maids and domestic help vanished with the war's labor shortage and never returned.\n\n===Twentieth-century elitism===\nHeadmaster Brewster disliked the [[List of traditional gentlemen's clubs in the United States|clubby]] atmosphere of the school, reforming admission policies during his brief tenure.  Famously hearing one alumnus describe St. Mark's as the best club he had ever joined, Brewster subsequently fought to make admissions merit-based, and expanded financial assistance.  His successors continued this battle. The school began to focus more on academic as opposed to social merits, and by the late fifties was admitting only about one applicant out of five.\n\nIn 1948, Headmaster William Wyatt Barber, Jr. assumed leadership of St. Mark's.  Teaching Ancient Greek and coaching hockey, Headmaster Barber emphasized character building.  Under Mr. Barber, the school offered scholarships to students from military or moderate income families.\n\n===Challenge of modernization===\nIn 1968, Edward T. \"Ned\" Hall became Headmaster. Beginning in the early 1970s, St. Mark's relaxed many traditional, formal requirements of school life.  St. Mark's reduced the number of required chapel services from six days per week to five.  St. Mark's reduced the number of sit down meals.  The School introduced a \"December Week\" of alternative course offerings, and experiments in co-education.  Headmaster Hall announced his resignation at the beginning of the 1973\u201374 school year, effective the following July.\n\nIn 1974, the trustees hired Rev. Robert R. \"Red\" Hansel, a former chaplain at [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]]. Hansel's four-year tenure was controversial. Changes under Rev. Hansel, like coeducation, were arduous.  In 1972 girls initially attended the newly established Southborough School, funded largely by St. Mark's. In 1977 the Southborough girls' school was dissolved. St. Mark's absorbed many of its students and faculty.\n\n==Academics==\n[[Image:St. Mark's from Street.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Age Quod Agis]]\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the most popular college destinations were Northeastern (12), Georgetown (11), Hamilton (11), Boston College (10), and Lehigh (10).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/college-counseling/college-matriculation/index.aspx|title=Matriculation List - St. Mark's School|author=|date=|website=www.StMarksSchool.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSt. Mark's has an average SAT score of 1360.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niche.com/k12/st-marks-school-southborough-ma/academics/|title=St. Mark's School Test Scores and Academics|author=|date=|website=www.niche.com|access-date=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref>. The revised curriculum eliminated Advanced Placement classes and installed Advanced classes, courses unique to St. Mark's which, depending on the course itself, may or may not align with the College Board's Advanced Placement classes.\n\n==Programs==\n\nSt. Mark's offers several unique programs to its students and others affiliated with the school. The programs are as follows:\n* Lion Term <ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.stmarksschool.org/lionterm/|title=Lion Term|author=|date=|website=blogs.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* St. Mark's Saturdays <ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.stmarksschool.org/saturdays/|title= St. Mark's Saturdays|author=|date=|website=blogs.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* Gray Colloquium <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/signature-programming/gray-colloquium/gray-colloquium-details|title=Gray Colloquium Speakers|author=|date=|website=www.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* LEO: Official Academic Journal <ref>{{cite web|url=https://smleo.com|title= LEO <<The official academic journal of St. Mark's>>|author=|date=|website=smleo.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* STEM Fellowship <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/signature-programming/stem-fellowship|title=STEM Fellowship|author=|date=|website=www.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* Global Citizenship <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/global-citizenship|title=Global Citizenship - St. Mark's School|author=|date=|website=blogs.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* Career Day <ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.stmarksschool.org/smcareerday/|title=St. Mark's School Career Day|author=|date=|website=blogs.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\nNotable in the Thayer vision was the cloister-style construction of the school, with interconnected buildings forming an architectural ensemble in which the entire school was essentially under one roof, in many cases with dorms on the upper floors of the buildings and classrooms and other academic halls in the lower floors. Because of this, the school touts the \"school under one roof\" concept as a unique strength, though more recent buildings no longer fit that criterion.  \n\nThe school as it appeared in the early 1950s is portrayed under the name \"St. Bart's\" in the novel ''[[Pnin]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], whose son [[Dmitri Nabokov|Dmitri]] attended the school. Some interior shots of St. Mark's can be seen in the film ''[[School Ties]]'' (1992), which was filmed at [[Middlesex School]] and St. Mark's.\n\n==Athletics==\nSt. Mark's has historically been strong at ice hockey, and a number of its alumni have gone on to careers in the [[National Hockey League]].  The boys' ice hockey team won NEPSAC Championships in 1992, 2015, 2016; ISL Eberhart Division Championships in 1976, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2015, and 2020; ISL Championships in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000; and Private School League Championships in 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stmarksschool.org/athletics/team-pages/team-details/~athletics-team-id/139|title=Team Details - St. Mark's School|author=|date=|website=www.StMarksSchool.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, St. Mark's boys' cross-country was the New England Division IV Champion, while the girls' cross-country team was the runner-up in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/06/ma/Nov11_NEPSTA_set2.shtml|title=Cool Running :: NEPSTA Division IV Cross-Country Championships Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/07/ct/Nov10_2007NE_set4.shtml|title=Cool Running :: 2007 NEPSTA Division 4 Cross-Country Championships Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref> After finishing second in the New Englands in 2008, 2009, and 2010, St. Mark's boys' cross-country had an undefeated season in 2011 and went on to win the ISL Championships and New England Division II Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/11/ma/Nov4_2011IS_set5.shtml|title=Cool Running :: 2011 ISL XC CHAMPIONSHIPS Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/11/ma/Nov12_2011NE_set4.shtml|title=Cool Running :: 2011 NEPSTA Division II Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref> St. Mark's boys' cross-country replicated this feat in 2013, capturing the ISL and New England Championships.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/13/ma/Nov1_2013IS_set3.shtml|title=Cool Running {{!}} 2013 ISL XC CHAMPIONSHIPS Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/13/ct/Nov9_NEPSTA_set4.shtml|title=Cool Running {{!}} NEPSTA Division II Cross Country Championships Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref>\n\nSt. Mark's has played the [[Groton School]] since 1886, making it one of the [[List of high school football rivalries more than 100 years old|oldest athletic rivalries]] in the United States.\n\nSt. Mark's has educated a few [[Olympic games|Olympic]] athletes, including [[Truxtun Hare]] in track and field, Suzanne King in cross-country skiing, Scott Young in ice hockey,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11778|title=Legends of Hockey -- NHL Player Search -- Player -- Scott Young|author=|date=|website=www.HHOF.com|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> Greg Brown in ice hockey,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabreslegends.com/brown_g_bio.html|title=SabresLegends.com|author=|date=|website=SabresLegends.com|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> and Chris Sahs in rowing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/sa/chris-sahs-1.html|title=Chris Sahs Bio, Stats, and Results|website=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe girls' field hockey team has a history of winning the New England Championships.

Auden on his Fiftieth Birthday\u201d, in which he mentions the school in passing.\n\nParkman left the school in 1942 \u2013 to enlist in the army \u2013 and never returned, although he remained active in independent school policy all his life, eventually rising to the presidency of the [[National Association of Independent Schools]] in Boston.\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] changed the campus.  In 1942 Parkman was replaced by William Brewster, an Episcopal clergyman who remained only until 1947. Brewster's democratizing tendencies were abetted by exigencies of the war effort.  The school was forced to cope with labor shortages that forced students to work in dormitories and in the dining hall. The maids and domestic help vanished with the war's labor shortage and never returned.\n\n===Twentieth-century elitism===\nHeadmaster Brewster disliked the [[List of traditional gentlemen's clubs in the United States|clubby]] atmosphere of the school, reforming admission policies during his brief tenure.  Famously hearing one alumnus describe St. Mark's as the best club he had ever joined, Brewster subsequently fought to make admissions merit-based, and expanded financial assistance.  His successors continued this battle. The school began to focus more on academic as opposed to social merits, and by the late fifties was admitting only about one applicant out of five.\n\nIn 1948, Headmaster William Wyatt Barber, Jr. assumed leadership of St. Mark's.  Teaching Ancient Greek and coaching hockey, Headmaster Barber emphasized character building.  Under Mr. Barber, the school offered scholarships to students from military or moderate income families.\n\n===Challenge of modernization===\nIn 1968, Edward T. \"Ned\" Hall became Headmaster. Beginning in the early 1970s, St. Mark's relaxed many traditional, formal requirements of school life.  St. Mark's reduced the number of required chapel services from six days per week to five.  St. Mark's reduced the number of sit down meals.  The School introduced a \"December Week\" of alternative course offerings, and experiments in co-education.  Headmaster Hall announced his resignation at the beginning of the 1973\u201374 school year, effective the following July.\n\nIn 1974, the trustees hired Rev. Robert R. \"Red\" Hansel, a former chaplain at [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]]. Hansel's four-year tenure was controversial. Changes under Rev. Hansel, like coeducation, were arduous.  In 1972 girls initially attended the newly established Southborough School, funded largely by St. Mark's. In 1977 the Southborough girls' school was dissolved. St. Mark's absorbed many of its students and faculty.\n\n==Academics==\n[[Image:St. Mark's from Street.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Age Quod Agis]]\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the most popular college destinations were Northeastern (12), Georgetown (11), Hamilton (11), Boston College (10), and Lehigh (10).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/college-counseling/college-matriculation/index.aspx|title=Matriculation List - St. Mark's School|author=|date=|website=www.StMarksSchool.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSt. Mark's has an average SAT score of 1360.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niche.com/k12/st-marks-school-southborough-ma/academics/|title=St. Mark's School Test Scores and Academics|author=|date=|website=www.niche.com|access-date=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref>. The revised curriculum eliminated Advanced Placement classes and installed Advanced classes, courses unique to St. Mark's which, depending on the course itself, may or may not align with the College Board's Advanced Placement classes.\n\n==Programs==\n\nSt. Mark's offers several unique programs to its students and others affiliated with the school. The programs are as follows:\n* Lion Term <ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.stmarksschool.org/lionterm/|title=Lion Term|author=|date=|website=blogs.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* St. Mark's Saturdays <ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.stmarksschool.org/saturdays/|title= St. Mark's Saturdays|author=|date=|website=blogs.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* Gray Colloquium <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/signature-programming/gray-colloquium/gray-colloquium-details|title=Gray Colloquium Speakers|author=|date=|website=www.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* LEO: Official Academic Journal <ref>{{cite web|url=https://smleo.com|title= LEO <<The official academic journal of St. Mark's>>|author=|date=|website=smleo.com|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* STEM Fellowship <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/signature-programming/stem-fellowship|title=STEM Fellowship|author=|date=|website=www.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* Global Citizenship <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/global-citizenship|title=Global Citizenship - St. Mark's School|author=|date=|website=blogs.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n* Career Day <ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.stmarksschool.org/smcareerday/|title=St. Mark's School Career Day|author=|date=|website=blogs.stmarksschool.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\nNotable in the Thayer vision was the cloister-style construction of the school, with interconnected buildings forming an architectural ensemble in which the entire school was essentially under one roof, in many cases with dorms on the upper floors of the buildings and classrooms and other academic halls in the lower floors. Because of this, the school touts the \"school under one roof\" concept as a unique strength, though more recent buildings no longer fit that criterion.  \n\nThe school as it appeared in the early 1950s is portrayed under the name \"St. Bart's\" in the novel ''[[Pnin]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], whose son [[Dmitri Nabokov|Dmitri]] attended the school. Some interior shots of St. Mark's can be seen in the film ''[[School Ties]]'' (1992), which was filmed at [[Middlesex School]] and St. Mark's.\n\n==Athletics==\nSt. Mark's has historically been strong at ice hockey, and a number of its alumni have gone on to careers in the [[National Hockey League]].  The boys' ice hockey team won NEPSAC Championships in 1992, 2015, 2016; ISL Eberhard Division Championships in 1976, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2015; ISL Championships in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000; and Private School League Championships in 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stmarksschool.org/athletics/team-pages/team-details/~athletics-team-id/139|title=Team Details - St. Mark's School|author=|date=|website=www.StMarksSchool.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, St. Mark's boys' cross-country was the New England Division IV Champion, while the girls' cross-country team was the runner-up in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/06/ma/Nov11_NEPSTA_set2.shtml|title=Cool Running :: NEPSTA Division IV Cross-Country Championships Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/07/ct/Nov10_2007NE_set4.shtml|title=Cool Running :: 2007 NEPSTA Division 4 Cross-Country Championships Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref> After finishing second in the New Englands in 2008, 2009, and 2010, St. Mark's boys' cross-country had an undefeated season in 2011 and went on to win the ISL Championships and New England Division II Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/11/ma/Nov4_2011IS_set5.shtml|title=Cool Running :: 2011 ISL XC CHAMPIONSHIPS Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/11/ma/Nov12_2011NE_set4.shtml|title=Cool Running :: 2011 NEPSTA Division II Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref> St. Mark's boys' cross-country replicated this feat in 2013, capturing the ISL and New England Championships.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/13/ma/Nov1_2013IS_set3.shtml|title=Cool Running {{!}} 2013 ISL XC CHAMPIONSHIPS Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolrunning.com/results/13/ct/Nov9_NEPSTA_set4.shtml|title=Cool Running {{!}} NEPSTA Division II Cross Country Championships Race Results|last=gstate|website=www.coolrunning.com|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref>\n\nSt. Mark's has played the [[Groton School]] since 1886, making it one of the [[List of high school football rivalries more than 100 years old|oldest athletic rivalries]] in the United States.\n\nSt. Mark's has educated a few [[Olympic games|Olympic]] athletes, including [[Truxtun Hare]] in track and field, Suzanne King in cross-country skiing, Scott Young in ice hockey,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11778|title=Legends of Hockey -- NHL Player Search -- Player -- Scott Young|author=|date=|website=www.HHOF.com|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> Greg Brown in ice hockey,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabreslegends.com/brown_g_bio.html|title=SabresLegends.com|author=|date=|website=SabresLegends.com|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> and Chris Sahs in rowing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/sa/chris-sahs-1.html|title=Chris Sahs Bio, Stats, and Results|website=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe girls' field hockey team has a history of winning the New England Championships.
