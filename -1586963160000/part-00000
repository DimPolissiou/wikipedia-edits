It was jointly produced by [[Karan Johar]], Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta under the [[Dharma Productions]] banner with [[Zee Studios]]. A remake of the [[Marathi language]] film ''[[Sairat]]'' (2016) by [[Nagraj Manjule]], the film stars [[Ishaan Khatter]] and debutant [[Janhvi Kapoor]]<!--do not add wikilink to Janhvi Kapoor, it will redirect to this same page-->, with [[Ashutosh Rana]], Ankit Bisht, Shridhar Watsar, Kshitij Kumar and [[Aishwarya Narkar]] in supporting roles.\n\nJohar had announced the production of ''Dhadak'' in November 2017 which marked the screen debut of Janhvi Kapoor, daughter of [[Sridevi]] and [[Boney Kapoor]]. [[Principal photography]] and it commenced in December 2017 while it was completed in April 2018. The soundtrack was composed by [[Ajay-Atul]] with lyrics written by [[Amitabh Bhattacharya]] and background score composed by John Stewart Eduri. The film was distributed internationally by Zee Studios.\n\n''Dhadak'', which was originally scheduled to release on 6 July 2018, was postponed and had its worldwide theatrical release on 20 July 2018. It received negative reviews from film critics for glossing over the subject of [[caste]]-based discrimination, which was present in [[Sairat]], and for being a poor remake of the original, although Khatter's and Kapoor's performances were praised. ''Dhadak'' emerged as a commercial success, grossing over {{INRConvert|110.11|c}} worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nMadhukar \"Madhu\" Bhagla ([[Ishaan Khatter]]), a young college student hailing from a [[middle class]] family, wins a [[competitive eating]]  contest and receives his prize from Parthavi Singh Rathore (Janhvi Kapoor), a rich girl from a political family who also happens to be studying in the same college as Madhu. His friend Purshottam (Shridhar Watsar) later finds Parthavi bathing in a lake and informs Madhu of the same. Madhu impresses Parthavi but incurs a minor injury meanwhile. The two begin to have feelings for each other.\n\nMadhu goes back to his family [[restaurant]] where his father makes him promise to stay away from Parthavi since she hails from a powerful, affluent upper-caste family. Madhu ignores Parthavi at college, but she later confronts him for ignoring her. The two admit their love for each other and begin meeting secretly. Madhu asks Parthavi for a kiss, but she dares him to come to her brother Roop's birthday party. They share a kiss at the party, but are discovered by Parthavi's father, Ratan Singh Rathore ([[Ashutosh Rana]]). Roop and Ratan thrash Madhu and his friends but later are told by Inspector Shekhawat (Vishwanath Chatterjee) to calm down and wait for the election results before any severe action.\n\nOnce the elections are over, Madhu and his friends are arrested on charges pressed by Ratan, who wins. Parthavi pleads to Ratan to release Madhu and his friends. In an ensuing scuffle, she manages to get hold of a gun and threatens to shoot herself if Madhu is not freed. Madhu runs up to her and together, they elope. With the police on their trail, Madhu and Parthavi board a train to Mumbai, where Madhu contacts his maternal uncle and the two travel to Nagpur.\n\nMadhu's uncle advises them to go to Kolkata for the time being. In Kolkata, they rent a small room for living; Madhu starts working in a roadside restaurant after learning [[Bengali language|Bengali]] while Parthavi finds work at a call centre. One day, Madhu goes to her office to gift her a new phone bought from his hard-earned money. Madhu sees Parthavi with her manager and thinks that she is cheating on him. Heartbroken, he returns home. After Parthavi returns home, they argue severely; Madhu slaps Parthavi in the heat of the moment. Parthavi begins to doubt why she came with Madhu. Parthavi is briefly missing, but Madhu finds her in her office and realizes how much he loves her. He asks for her hand in marriage and they marry.\n\nSoon, Parthavi becomes pregnant and they have a son, Aditya \"Adi\" Bhagla. During the [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] for their new house, Parthavi's brother and his gang arrive with many gifts for her family, hinting at reconciliation. However, Madhu is not convinced and asks Parthavi to stay back, but she brushes it off in excitement. Parthavi leaves her son at home with Madhu and steps out of the house. As she is walking towards her house, Madhu and Aditya are thrown from the balcony abruptly, with her brother overlooking them.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ishaan Khattar]] as Madhukar \"Madhu\" Bhagla\n* [[Janhvi Kapoor]] as Parthavi Madhukar Bhagla / Parthavi Singh Rathore ( Madhu's Wife) <!--Note that Janhvi Kapoor redirects to this page - do not add wikilink-->\n* [[Ashutosh Rana]] as Ratan Singh Rathore, Parthavi's father\n* Ankit Bisht as Gokul, Madhukar's friend<ref name=\"A\" />\n* [[Shridhar Watsar]] as Purshottam, Madhukar's friend<ref name=\"A\">{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/reel/886432/shashank-khaitan-on-making-dhadak-its-the-most-sincere-and-honest-tribute-to-sairat-possible |title=Shashank Khaitan on making \u2018Dhadak\u2019: \u2018It\u2019s the most sincere and honest tribute to Sairat possible\u2019 |publisher=Scroll.in}}</ref>\n* Kshitij Kumar as Niranjan\n* [[Aishwarya Narkar]] as Madhukar's mother\n* [[Aditya Kumar]] as Devi Lal\n* [[Kharaj Mukherjee]] as Sachin Bhowmick a.k.a.

The music video of the track was released on 19 June 2018, and features Janhvi Kapoor and [[Ishaan Khatter]]. Composer [[Ajay-Atul|Ajay]] said, \u201cWhen we first heard the narration of ''Sairat'', we knew that it was going to be an epic love story. So, while composing the music of the film that thought remained at the core. \"Dhadak Hai Na\" is a completely new composition, but it was made with the same thought of creating something epic. Like ''Sairat'', the music of ''Dhadak'' has the quality of being cinematic and dramatic. It's made on an international soundscape and when listeners hear the theme song, I think they will feel the depth and the scale of composition\".

It was jointly produced by [[Karan Johar]], Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta under the [[Dharma Productions]] banner with [[Zee Studios]]. A remake of the [[Marathi language]] film ''[[Sairat]]'' (2016) by [[Nagraj Manjule]], the film stars [[Ishaan Khatter]] and debutant [[Janhvi Kapoor]]<!--do not add wikilink to Janhvi Kapoor, it will redirect to this same page-->, with [[Ashutosh Rana]], Ankit Bisht, Shridhar Watsar, Kshitij Kumar and [[Aishwarya Narkar]] in supporting roles.\n\nJohar had announced the production of ''Dhadak'' in November 2017 which marked the screen debut of Janhvi Kapoor, daughter of [[Sridevi]] and [[Boney Kapoor]]. [[Principal photography]] and it commenced in December 2017 while it was completed in April 2018. The soundtrack was composed by [[Ajay-Atul]] with lyrics written by [[Amitabh Bhattacharya]] and background score composed by John Stewart Eduri. The film was distributed internationally by Zee Studios.\n\n''Dhadak'', which was originally scheduled to release on 6 July 2018, was postponed and had its worldwide theatrical release on 20 July 2018. It received negative reviews from film critics for glossing over the subject of [[caste]]-based discrimination, which was present in [[Sairat]], and for being a poor remake of the original, although Khatter's and Kapoor's performances were praised. ''Dhadak'' emerged as a commercial success, grossing over {{INRConvert|110.11|c}} worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nMadhukar \"Madhu\" Bhagla ([[Ishaan Khatter]]), a young college student hailing from a [[middle class]] family, wins a [[competitive eating]]  contest and receives his prize from Parthavi Singh Rathore (Janhvi Kapoor), a rich girl from a political family who also happens to be studying in the same college as Madhu. His friend Purshottam (Shridhar Watsar) later finds Parthavi bathing in a lake and informs Madhu of the same. Madhu impresses Parthavi but incurs a minor injury meanwhile. The two begin to have feelings for each other.\n\nMadhu goes back to his family [[restaurant]] where his father makes him promise to stay away from Parthavi since she hails from a powerful, affluent upper-caste family. Madhu ignores Parthavi at college, but she later confronts him for ignoring her. The two admit their love for each other and begin meeting secretly. Madhu asks Parthavi for a kiss, but she dares him to come to her brother Roop's birthday party. They share a kiss at the party, but are discovered by Parthavi's father, Ratan Singh Rathore ([[Ashutosh Rana]]). Roop and Ratan thrash Madhu and his friends but later are told by Inspector Shekhawat (Vishwanath Chatterjee) to calm down and wait for the election results before any severe action.\n\nOnce the elections are over, Madhu and his friends are arrested on charges pressed by Ratan, who wins. Parthavi pleads to Ratan to release Madhu and his friends. In an ensuing scuffle, she manages to get hold of a gun and threatens to shoot herself if Madhu is not freed. Madhu runs up to her and together, they elope. With the police on their trail, Madhu and Parthavi board a train to Mumbai, where Madhu contacts his maternal uncle and the two travel to Nagpur.\n\nMadhu's uncle advises them to go to Kolkata for the time being. In Kolkata, they rent a small room for living; Madhu starts working in a roadside restaurant after learning [[Bengali language|Bengali]] while Parthavi finds work at a call centre. One day, Madhu goes to her office to gift her a new phone bought from his hard-earned money. Madhu sees Parthavi with her manager and thinks that she is cheating on him. Heartbroken, he returns home. After Parthavi returns home, they argue severely; Madhu slaps Parthavi in the heat of the moment. Parthavi begins to doubt why she came with Madhu. Parthavi is briefly missing, but Madhu finds her in her office and realizes how much he loves her. He asks for her hand in marriage and they marry.\n\nSoon, Parthavi becomes pregnant and they have a son, Aditya \"Adi\" Bhagla. During the [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] for their new house, Parthavi's brother and his gang arrive with many gifts for her family, hinting at reconciliation. However, Madhu is not convinced and asks Parthavi to stay back, but she brushes it off in excitement. Parthavi leaves her son at home with Madhu and steps out of the house. As she is walking towards her house, Madhu and Aditya are thrown from the balcony abruptly, with her brother overlooking them.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ishaan Khattar]] as Madhukar \"Madhu\" Bhagla\n* [[Janhvi Kapoor]] as Parthavi Singh Rathore/Parthavi Madhukar Bhagla <!--Note that Janhvi Kapoor redirects to this page - do not add wikilink-->\n* [[Ashutosh Rana]] as Ratan Singh Rathore, Parthavi's father\n* Ankit Bisht as Gokul, Madhukar's friend<ref name=\"A\" />\n* [[Shridhar Watsar]] as Purshottam, Madhukar's friend<ref name=\"A\">{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/reel/886432/shashank-khaitan-on-making-dhadak-its-the-most-sincere-and-honest-tribute-to-sairat-possible |title=Shashank Khaitan on making \u2018Dhadak\u2019: \u2018It\u2019s the most sincere and honest tribute to Sairat possible\u2019 |publisher=Scroll.in}}</ref>\n* Kshitij Kumar as Niranjan\n* [[Aishwarya Narkar]] as Madhukar's mother\n* [[Aditya Kumar]] as Devi Lal\n* [[Kharaj Mukherjee]] as Sachin Bhowmick a.k.a.

She has choreographed dance routines for more than a hundred songs in over 80 Hindi films, winning six [[Filmfare Awards]] for [[Filmfare Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] and the [[National Film Award for Best Choreography]]. In addition, she has worked on international projects, such as ''[[Marigold: An Adventure in India]]'', ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]'', ''[[Bombay Dreams]]'' and the Chinese films ''[[Perhaps Love (2005 film)|Perhaps Love]]'' and ''[[Kung Fu Yoga]]'', earning [[Tony Award]] and [[Golden Horse Award]] nominations. She has since become a film director as well, with a [[Filmfare Best Director Award]] nomination for her directorial debut ''[[Main Hoon Na]]''.\n\n==Early life and career==\nFarah Khan was born on 9 January 1965. Her father, Kamran Khan, is a stuntman-turned-filmmaker. Her mother, Menaka Irani, is the sister of former child actors [[Honey Irani]] and [[Daisy Irani (actress)|Daisy Irani]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Sajid Khan {{!}} Directors {{!}} Koimoi| author =| work = koimoi.com| date = 28 April 2016| accessdate = 2016-04-30| url = http://www.koimoi.com/director/sajid-khan/}}</ref> Farah is thus a first cousin of film personalities [[Farhan Akhtar]] and [[Zoya Akhtar]] (children of Honey Irani). She has one brother, [[Sajid Khan (director)|Sajid Khan]], who is a comedian, actor and film director.\n\nWhile Farah's father is a Muslim, her mother is a [[Zorastrianism|Zorastrian]] belonging to the [[Irani (India)|Irani]] ([[Parsi]]) community.<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/inner-spaces-farah-khan-latest-chant-is-mom-shanti-mom-1125923 Farah Khan latest chant is 'Mom Shanti MOM']</ref> Their marriage broke up when Farah was still a toddler. One reason for this was religion; another was the shortage of money. Kamran Khan had initially been very successful and prosperous, so much so that, when his sister-in-law [[Honey Irani]] married a poverty-stricken poet named [[Javed Akhtar]], the newly-weds turned to Kamran for help and he gave them an apartment to live in free of rent. However, Kamran then began losing money badly as his film ventures flopped; his marriage collapsed at the same time. Farah, therefore, saw very little of her father while growing up. Since neither parent had any money left, Farah and Sajid were shuttled between different homes.<ref name=Tele/>\n\nFarah Khan married [[Shirish Kunder]], the editor of her film ''[[Main Hoon Na]]'',<ref>{{cite web|first=Ronjita |last=Kulkarni |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/aug/12spec.htm |title=Meet the man Farah Khan will marry |publisher=Rediff.com |date=12 August 2004 |accessdate=17 November 2008}}</ref> on 9 December 2004. They have since worked together on each other's films, such as ''[[Jaan-E-Mann]]'', ''[[Om Shanti Om]]'', and ''[[Tees Maar Khan (2010 film)|Tees Maar Khan]]''. Khan gave birth to triplets in 2008; one son and two daughters.\n\n==Career==\n\nFarah Khan was studying sociology in [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St. Xavier's College, Bombay]] when [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"Thriller\" was telecast. She was so inspired, that although she hadn't danced before that, it soon became her vocation. She learned to dance basically on her own, and set up a dance group.<ref name=Tele>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1071007/asp/7days/story_8405201.asp |title=T\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate |work=The Telegraph|date=7 October 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2010 |location=Calcutta, India}}</ref>\nWhen the choreographer   [[Saroj Khan]] walked out of the film ''[[Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar]]'', Khan took over. This was followed by many more songs. She met actor [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] on the set of ''[[Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa]]'' and the two have since become good friends and started working together.\n\nFarah Khan's work in ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]'', ''[[Bombay Dreams]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (2004 film)|Vanity Fair]]'' was nominated for a 2004 [[Tony Award]] as [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreographer]], along with collaborator Anthony van Laast, for ''Bombay Dreams''. She has won the [[Filmfare Best Choreography Award]] six times. Khan then went on to direct her first film ''[[Main Hoon Na]]'' Starring Shah Rukh Khan which was produced by [[Red Chillies Entertainment]].

She has choreographed dance routines for more than a hundred songs in over 80 Hindi films, winning six [[Filmfare Awards]] for [[Filmfare Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] and the [[National Film Award for Best Choreography]]. In addition, she has worked on international projects, such as ''[[Marigold: An Adventure in India]]'', ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]'', ''[[Bombay Dreams]]'' and the Chinese films ''[[Perhaps Love (2005 film)|Perhaps Love]]'' and ''[[Kung Fu Yoga]]'', earning [[Tony Award]] and [[Golden Horse Award]] nominations. She has since become a film director as well, with a [[Filmfare Best Director Award]] nomination for her directorial debut ''[[Main Hoon Na]]''.\n\n==Early life and career==\nFarah Khan was born on 9 January 1965. Her father, Kamran Khan, is a stuntman-turned-filmmaker. Her mother, Menaka Irani, is the sister of former child actors [[Honey Irani]] and [[Daisy Irani (actress)|Daisy Irani]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Sajid Khan {{!}} Directors {{!}} Koimoi| author =| work = koimoi.com| date = 28 April 2016| accessdate = 2016-04-30| url = http://www.koimoi.com/director/sajid-khan/}}</ref> Farah is thus a first cousin of film personalities [[Farhan Akhtar]] and [[Zoya Akhtar]] (children of Honey Irani). She has one brother, [[Sajid Khan (director)|Sajid Khan]], who is a comedian, actor and film director.\n\nWhile Farah's father is a Muslim, her mother is a [[Zorastrianism|Zorastrian]] belonging to the [[Irani (India)|Irani]] ([[Parsi]]) community.<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/inner-spaces-farah-khan-latest-chant-is-mom-shanti-mom-1125923 Farah Khan latest chant is 'Mom Shanti MOM']</ref> Their marriage broke up when Farah was still a toddler. One reason for this was religion; another was the shortage of money. Kamran Khan had initially been very successful and prosperous, so much so that, when his sister-in-law [[Honey Irani]] married a poverty-stricken poet named [[Javed Akhtar]], the newly-weds turned to Kamran for help and he gave them an apartment to live in free of rent. However, Kamran then began losing money badly as his film ventures flopped; his marriage collapsed at the same time. Farah, therefore, saw very little of her father while growing up. Since neither parent had any money left, Farah and Sajid were shuttled between different homes.<ref name=Tele/>\n\nFarah Khan married [[Shirish Kunder]], the editor of her film ''[[Main Hoon Na]]'',<ref>{{cite web|first=Ronjita |last=Kulkarni |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/aug/12spec.htm |title=Meet the man Farah Khan will marry |publisher=Rediff.com |date=12 August 2004 |accessdate=17 November 2008}}</ref> on 9 December 2004. They have since worked together on each other's films, such as ''[[Jaan-E-Mann]]'', ''[[Om Shanti Om]]'', and ''[[Tees Maar Khan (2010 film)|Tees Maar Khan]]''. Khan gave birth to triplets in 2008; one son and two daughters.\n\n==Career==\n\nFarah Khan was studying sociology in [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St. Xavier's College, Bombay]] when [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"Thriller\" was telecast. She was so inspired, that although she hadn't danced before that, it soon became her vocation. She learned to dance basically on her own, and set up a dance group.<ref name=Tele>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1071007/asp/7days/story_8405201.asp |title=T\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate |work=The Telegraph|date=7 October 2007 |accessdate=5 May 2010 |location=Calcutta, India}}</ref>\nWhen the choreographer   [[Saroj Khan]] walked out of the film ''[[Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar]]'', Khan took over. This was followed by many more songs. She met actor [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]] on the set of ''[[Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa]]'' and the two have since become good friends and started working together.\n\nFarah Khan's work in ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]'', ''[[Bombay Dreams]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (2004 film)|Vanity Fair]]'' was nominated for a 2004 [[Tony Award]] as [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreographer]], along with collaborator Anthony van Laast, for ''Bombay Dreams''. She has won the [[Filmfare Best Choreography Award]] six times. Khan then went on to direct her first film ''[[Main Hoon Na]]'' Starring Shah Rukh Khan which was produced by [[Red Chillies Entertainment]].
