Nearly all of the roads along the bikeway are paved and leave enough room to comfortably ride in a bike lane. The only exception is on the [[Sagamore Bridge]] where you must walk your bicycle due to state safety regulations.\n\nIt passes near many state parks south of Boston, including [[Blue Hills Reservation]], [[Ames Nowell State Park]], [[Pilgrim Memorial State Park]], [[Myles Standish State Forest]], [[Scusset Beach State Reservation]], [[Nickerson State Park]], and [[Cape Cod National Seashore]]\n\nTurn by turn directions are given for the three major sections of the bikeway: Greater Boston, Metro South & SE Mass, and Cape Cod. These directions are given as if you are riding from Boston to Cape Cod. These directions are also easy to follow if traveling northbound. For alternate routes for better flow, read the notes sections where there is an easier way to ride the route as given by the state of Massachusetts.\n\n==Boston Area==\n\nThe first 13 miles of the bikeway begin along the banks of the Charles River near Boston University. The route passes by the school over [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachuetts|US 20]] and follows its way into the Fenway neighborhood. The bikeway follows down the Riverway bike paths, passing the Longwood Medical Area, down to the [[Emerald Necklace]]. The route intersects at [[Massachusetts Route 9| Route 9]] and continues down the Jamaciaway. The bikeway has a short congruency with the Arborway before exiting at Centre Street. Going southward, the bikeway flows from Centre Street to VFW Parkway. You must then exit to West Roxbury Parkway at the rotary and pass by the Bellevue MBTA station. Going northward, the bikeway passes by the Bellevue stop and merges onto Centre Street. The route continues down the West Roxbury Parkway, Enneking Parkway, and Turtle Pond Parkway before turning onto the Neponset Valley Parkway, which runs through the Readville section of the city. The bikeway exits onto Blue Hill Avenue onto [[Massachusetts Route 138|Route 138]] and the route makes its way past the [[Blue Hills Reservation]] and [[Interstate 93 in Massachusetts|I-93]] into Canton.\n\n{{jcttop\n|state = MA\n|location_ref = <ref name=\"RouteLog\">{{cite web|url=https://gis.massdot.state.ma.us/mrla/|title=MassDOT Route Log Application|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n|length_ref = <ref name=\"RouteLog\"/>\n|old_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/service-details/major-highway-routes-and-exits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015140309/https://www.mass.gov/service-details/major-highway-routes-and-exits|title=Major highway routes and exits|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|archivedate=October 15, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n|exit_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newmassexits.com/MassDOT_Documents/Project_Documents/Route_6.pdf |title=Route 6 Renumbering|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|date=December 5, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Suffolk\n|cspan=4\n|location=Boston\n|lspan=4\n|mile=0.0\n|road= Dr. Paul Dudley White Bike Path\n|notes= northern end of route (use Sibler Way pedestrian bridge to start route on Sibler Way)\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=incomplete\n|mile= 0.2\n|road= Cummington Mall\n|notes= turn right, follow one way to Babbit St., then turn left onto St. Mary's St. (southbound only)\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=0.6\n|road= Park Drive\n|notes= turn left and follow to Riverway (to use this route to Charles River, use Carlton St. to Bay State Rd., then use Back St. to pedestrian bridge)\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=1.0\n|road= [[Emerald Necklace]]\n|notes= follow down marked bike paths (enters [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]])\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county= Norfolk\n|cspan=1\n|location=Brookline\n|lspan=1\n|mile=2.0\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|9}}\n|notes= continue down Emerald Necklace to Arborway traffic circle (re-entering [[Boston]])\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Suffolk\n|cspan=5\n|location=Boston\n|lspan=5\n|mile=3.8\n|road= Arborway\n|notes= use Arborway to first traffic circle, use 1st exit onto Centre St.\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=5.2\n|road= VFW Parkway\n|notes= use to next traffic circle, take 2nd exit onto W.Roxbury Pkwy.

The route moves on traveling past the Blue Hills on [[Massachusetts Route 138|MA 138]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]]. The route continues into [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] and then turns down Randolph St. which becomes Canton St. in [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]]. The route has a concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 28|MA 28]] into [[Avon, Massachusetts|Avon]], where the route exits onto E. High St. heading towards Boundary St. and eventually N. Quincy St. in [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]]. The route intersects [[Massachusetts Route 123|MA 123]] and [[Massachusetts Route 27|MA 27]] before continuing straight to the access road to Massasoit Community College. At the end of the access road, the route turns left onto Thatcher St and continuing as Elm St. in [[East Bridgewater, Massachusetts|East Bridgewater]]. The route then turns onto Central St. and intersects at [[Massachusetts Route 18|MA 18]] as it continues towards its next turns at Chestnut St., Bridge St. and Crescent St. The route follows down Washington St. until its next turn onto Pond St. which leads into [[Halifax, Massachusetts|Halifax]]. The route then turns onto Elm St. and continues to Pine St. where the route turns east on [[Massachusetts Route 106|MA 106]] for a short while and then turns onto Carver St. which eventually turns into South St. then turns onto Franklin St. continuing into [[Plympton, Massachusetts|Plympton]]. The route travels down Center St. towards [[Massachusetts Route 58|MA 58]] where the route is joined going south into the town center before turning onto Mayflower St. The route continues on Colchester Rd. and Brook St. before becoming Elm St. in [[Kingston, Massachusetts|Kingston]]. The route joins [[Massachusetts Route 80|MA 80]] for 4 miles heading down into [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]]. The road turns onto Carver St. and continues on that road past the big intersection (use the right most lane) before turning onto Summer St. towards historic downtown. The route turns onto [[Massachusetts Route 3A|MA 3A]] for a 1/2 mile before exiting onto South St. and eventually becoming Long Pond Rd. The route passes under [[Massachusetts Route 3|MA 3]] and continues down towards the Myles Standish State Forest and Plymouth South H.S. before merging left onto Hedges Pond Rd. where the road will re-meet Route 3A and continue away straight onto State Rd. towards the Sagamore Bridge in [[Bourne, Massachusetts|Bourne]].\n\nAlong the route in Bourne, you must use the Sagamore Bridge to cross in between mainland Massachusetts and Cape Cod. Access to the bridge is available by going straight on Canal Street just past the Sagamore Park and Ride lot on the right and on the other side in the Christmas Tree Shops parking lot via Adams Street. As you cross the bridge, it is important that you WALK your bicycle. There is no protective fencing or guard rail on the sidewalk on the bridge between yourself and busy [[U.S. Route 6 in Massachusetts|US 6]] next to you. Be extremely cautious and do not attempt to cross the bridge if the weather is bad or it is too windy. There is no shuttle service to help you cross. As soon as you reach the end of the sidewalk on both sides, you may resume riding.\n\n{{jcttop\n|state = MA\n|location_ref = <ref name=\"RouteLog\">{{cite web|url=https://gis.massdot.state.ma.us/mrla/|title=MassDOT Route Log Application|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n|length_ref = <ref name=\"RouteLog\"/>\n|old_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/service-details/major-highway-routes-and-exits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015140309/https://www.mass.gov/service-details/major-highway-routes-and-exits|title=Major highway routes and exits|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|archivedate=October 15, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n|exit_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newmassexits.com/MassDOT_Documents/Project_Documents/Route_6.pdf |title=Route 6 Renumbering|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|date=December 5, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Norfolk\n|cspan=4\n|location=Canton\n|lspan=2\n|mile=13.4\n|road={{jct|state=MA|I|93|US|1}}\n|notes= exit 2 on [[I 93 (MA)|I-93]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=15.0\n|road= Randolph St. \n|notes= southern end of concurrency with [[MA 138]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Randolph\n|lspan=1\n|type=concur\n|mile=18.4\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|28}}\n|notes= northern end of concurrency with [[MA 28]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Avon\n|lspan=1\n|type=concur\n|mile=22.2\n|road= E.

The route turns onto [[MA 130]] heading into [[Sandwich, Massachusetts|Sandwich]]. The route passes under [[US 6]] and then turns onto Service Rd. passing [[MA 149]] continuing into [[Barnstable, Massachuetts|Barnstable]]. The route joins [[MA 132]] for a short concurrency before turning onto Phinney's Ln. as it will rejoin [[MA 6A]]. The route continues into [[Yarmouth, Massachusetts|Yarmouth]] and  [[Dennis, Massachusetts|Dennis]], before turning onto Sentucket Road and Mayfair Road. the route then joins the Cape Cod Rail Trail through the towns of [[Harwich, Massachusetts|Harwich]], [[Brewster, Massachusetts|Brewster]], [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]], [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]], and [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts|Wellfleet]]. The bikeway then makes it's way around [[US 6 (MA)|US 6]] through side streets in [[Truro, Massachusetts|Truro]]. The bikeway finally comes to an end down Commercial Street [[MA 6A]] in downtown [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]]. \n\nFrom Dennis to Welfleet, the route travels along the [[Cape Cod Rail Trail]] for its 25.5 mile length. The road then returns to regular back roads for the remainder of the ride either going towards Boston or Provincetown. The route is also congruent with the [[East Coast Greenway]] spur from [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. To continue on the East Coast Greenway or return to Boston from Provincetown, ferry service from MacMillan Pier in downtown where the route ends is available.

Few of the original signs survive today, however, and new signs were erected in the summer of 2018.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.masspaths.net/bikeways/ccbw/ | title=MassPaths: the Section-by-section maps of the Claire Salstonstall Bikeway}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://ridewithgps.com/routes/276482 | title=RideWithGPS: Cambridge to Provincetown}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/bitstream/handle/2452/4188/1978acts0463.txt | title=Act designating the Boston to Cape Cod Bikeway as the Claire Saltonstall Bikeway}}</ref>\n\n{{Infobox road\n|state=MA\n|direction_a=North\n|direction_b=South\n|terminus_a={{jct|state=MA|MA|2}} in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]\n|junction={{plainlist|\n*{{jct|state=MA|US|20}} in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]\n*{{jct|state=MA|I|93|US|1}} in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]]\n*{{jct|state=MA|MA|28}} in [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]]\n*{{jct|state=MA|MA|80}} in [[Kingston, Massachusetts|Kingston]] / [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]]\n*{{jct|state=MA|MA|3A}} in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]]\n*{{jct|state=MA|US|6}} in [[Bourne, Massachusetts|Bourne]]\n*{{jct|state=MA|MA|6A}} in [[Sandwich, Massachusetts|Sandwich]] / [[Barnstable, Massachusetts|Barnstable]] / [[Truro, Massachusetts|Truro]]\n*{{jct|state=MA|MA|132}} in [[Barnstable, Massachusetts|Barnstable]]\n}}\n|terminus_b={{jct|state=MA|MA|6A}} in [[Provincetown]]\n|counties=[[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]], [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk]], [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable]]\n}}\n\n==Route Description==\n\nThis back road bikeway follows various state parkways, highways, and town roads and bike paths. Nearly all of the roads along the bikeway are paved and leave enough room to comfortably ride in a bike lane. The only exception is on the [[Sagamore Bridge]] where you must walk your bicycle due to state safety regulations.\n\nIt passes near many state parks south of Boston, including [[Blue Hills Reservation]], [[Ames Nowell State Park]], [[Pilgrim Memorial State Park]], [[Myles Standish State Forest]], [[Scusset Beach State Reservation]], [[Nickerson State Park]], and [[Cape Cod National Seashore]]\n\nTurn by turn directions are given for the three major sections of the bikeway: Greater Boston, Metro South & SE Mass, and Cape Cod. These directions are given as if you are riding from Boston to Cape Cod. These directions are also easy to follow if traveling northbound. For alternate routes for better flow, read the notes sections where there is an easier way to ride the route as given by the state of Massachusetts.\n\n==Boston Area==\n\nThe first 13 miles of the bikeway begin along the banks of the Charles River near Boston University. The route passes by the school over [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachuetts|US 20]] and follows its way into the Fenway neighborhood. The bikeway follows down the Riverway bike paths, passing the Longwood Medical Area, down to the [[Emerald Necklace]]. The route intersects at [[Massachusetts Route 9| Route 9]] and continues down the Jamaciaway. The bikeway has a short congruency with the Arborway before exiting at Centre Street. Going southward, the bikeway flows from Centre Street to VFW Parkway. You must then exit to West Roxbury Parkway at the rotary and pass by the Bellevue MBTA station. Going northward, the bikeway passes by the Bellevue stop and merges onto Centre Street. The route continues down the West Roxbury Parkway, Enneking Parkway, and Turtle Pond Parkway before turning onto the Neponset Valley Parkway, which runs through the Readville section of the city. The bikeway exits onto Blue Hill Avenue onto [[Massachusetts Route 138|Route 138]] and the route makes its way past the [[Blue Hills Reservation]] and [[Interstate 93 in Massachusetts|I-93]] into Canton.\n\n{{jcttop\n|state = MA\n|location_ref = <ref name=\"RouteLog\">{{cite web|url=https://gis.massdot.state.ma.us/mrla/|title=MassDOT Route Log Application|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n|length_ref = <ref name=\"RouteLog\"/>\n|old_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/service-details/major-highway-routes-and-exits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015140309/https://www.mass.gov/service-details/major-highway-routes-and-exits|title=Major highway routes and exits|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|archivedate=October 15, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n|exit_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newmassexits.com/MassDOT_Documents/Project_Documents/Route_6.pdf |title=Route 6 Renumbering|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|date=December 5, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Suffolk\n|cspan=4\n|location=Boston\n|lspan=4\n|mile=0.0\n|road= Dr. Paul Dudley White Bike Path\n|notes= northern end of route (use Sibler Way pedestrian bridge to start route on Sibler Way)\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=incomplete\n|mile= 0.2\n|road= Cummington Mall\n|notes= turn right, follow one way to Babbit St., then turn left onto St. Mary's St. (southbound only)\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=0.6\n|road= Park Drive\n|notes= turn left and follow to Riverway (to use this route to Charles River, use Carlton St. to Bay State Rd., then use Back St. to pedestrian bridge)\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=1.0\n|road= [[Emerald Necklace]]\n|notes= follow down marked bike paths (enters [[Brookline]])\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county= Norfolk\n|cspan=1\n|location=Brookline\n|lspan=1\n|mile=2.0\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|9}}\n|notes= continue down Emerald Necklace to Arborway traffic circle (re-entering [[Boston]])\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Suffolk\n|cspan=5\n|location=Boston\n|lspan=5\n|mile=3.8\n|road= Arborway\n|notes= use Arborway to first traffic circle, use 1st exit onto Centre St.\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=5.2\n|road= VFW Parkway\n|notes= use to next traffic circle, take 2nd exit onto W.Roxbury Pkwy.

The route moves on traveling past the Blue Hills on [[Massachusetts Route 138|MA 138]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]]. The route continues into [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] and then turns down Randolph St. which becomes Canton St. in [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]]. The route has a concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 28|MA 28]] into [[Avon, Massachusetts|Avon]], where the route exits onto E. High St. heading towards Boundary St. and eventually N. Quincy St. in [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]]. The route intersects [[Massachusetts Route 123|MA 123]] and [[Massachusetts Route 27|MA 27]] before continuing straight to the access road to Massasoit Community College. At the end of the access road, the route turns left onto Thatcher St and continuing as Elm St. in [[East Bridgewater, Massachusetts|East Bridgewater]]. The route then turns onto Central St. and intersects at [[Massachusetts Route 18|MA 18]] as it continues towards its next turns at Chestnut St., Bridge St. and Crescent St. The route follows down Washington St. until its next turn onto Pond St. which leads into [[Halifax, Massachusetts|Halifax]]. The route then turns onto Elm St. and continues to Pine St. where the route turns east on [[Massachusetts Route 106|MA 106]] for a short while and then turns onto Carver St. which eventually turns into South St. then turns onto Franklin St. continuing into [[Plympton, Massachusetts|Plympton]]. The route travels down Center St. towards [[Massachusetts Route 58|MA 58]] where the route is joined going south into the town center before turning onto Mayflower St. The route continues on Colchester Rd. and Brook St. before becoming Elm St. in [[Kingston, Massachusetts|Kingston]]. The route joins [[Massachusetts Route 80|MA 80]] for 4 miles heading down into [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]]. The road turns onto Carver St. and continues on that road past the big intersection (use the right most lane) before turning onto Summer St. towards historic downtown. The route turns onto [[Massachusetts Route 3A|MA 3A]] for a 1/2 mile before exiting onto South St. and eventually becoming Long Pond Rd. The route passes under [[Massachusetts Route 3|MA 3]] and continues down towards the Myles Standish State Forest and Plymouth South H.S. before merging left onto Hedges Pond Rd. where the road will re-meet Route 3A and continue away straight onto State Rd. towards the Sagamore Bridge in [[Bourne, Massachusetts|Bourne]].\n\nAlong the route in Bourne, you must use the Sagamore Bridge to cross in between mainland Massachusetts and Cape Cod. Access to the bridge is available by going straight on Canal Street just past the Sagamore Park and Ride lot on the right and on the other side in the Christmas Tree Shops parking lot via Adams Street. As you cross the bridge, it is important that you WALK your bicycle. There is no protective fencing or guard rail on the sidewalk on the bridge between yourself and busy [[U.S. Route 6 in Massachusetts|US 6]] next to you. Be extremely cautious and do not attempt to cross the bridge if the weather is bad or it is too windy. There is no shuttle service to help you cross. As soon as you reach the end of the sidewalk on both sides, you may resume riding.\n\n{{jcttop\n|state = MA\n|location_ref = <ref name=\"RouteLog\">{{cite web|url=https://gis.massdot.state.ma.us/mrla/|title=MassDOT Route Log Application|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n|length_ref = <ref name=\"RouteLog\"/>\n|old_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/service-details/major-highway-routes-and-exits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015140309/https://www.mass.gov/service-details/major-highway-routes-and-exits|title=Major highway routes and exits|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|archivedate=October 15, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n|exit_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newmassexits.com/MassDOT_Documents/Project_Documents/Route_6.pdf |title=Route 6 Renumbering|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|date=December 5, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Norfolk\n|cspan=4\n|location=Canton\n|lspan=2\n|mile=13.4\n|road={{jct|state=MA|I|93|US|1}}\n|notes= exit 2 on [[I 93 (MA)|I-93]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=15.0\n|road= Randolph St. \n|notes= southern end of concurrency with [[MA 138]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Randolph\n|lspan=1\n|type=concur\n|mile=18.4\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|28}}\n|notes= northern end of concurrency with [[MA 28]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Avon\n|lspan=1\n|type=concur\n|mile=22.2\n|road= E.

Starting in Bourne coming off the Sagamore Bridge onto Adams St. and Sandwich St. which will eventually become [[MA 6A]]. The route turns onto [[MA 130]] heading into [[Sandwich, Massachusetts|Sandwich]]. The route passes under [[US 6]] and then turns onto Service Rd. passing [[MA 149]] continuing into [[Barnstable, Massachuetts|Barnstable]].

The route continues into [[Yarmouth, Massachusetts|Yarmouth]] and  [[Dennis, Massachusetts|Dennis]], before turning onto Sentucket Road and Mayfair Road. the route then joins the Cape Cod Rail Trail through the towns of [[Harwich, Massachusetts|Harwich]], [[Brewster, Massachusetts|Brewster]], [[Orleans, Massachusetts|Orleans]], [[Eastham, Massachusetts|Eastham]], and [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts|Wellfleet]]. The bikeway then makes it's way around [[US 6 (MA)|US 6]] through side streets in [[Truro, Massachusetts|Truro]]. The bikeway finally comes to an end down Commercial Street [[MA 6A]] in downtown [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]]. \n\nFrom Dennis to Welfleet, the route travels along the [[Cape Cod Rail Trail]] for its 25.5 mile length. The road then returns to regular back roads for the remainder of the ride either going towards Boston or Provincetown. The route is also congruent with the [[East Coast Greenway]] spur from [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. To continue on the East Coast Greenway or return to Boston from Provincetown, ferry service from MacMillan Pier in downtown where the route ends is available.

After his tenure with the group ended, George decided to start his own band and enlisted bassist Mikey Craig, drummer Jon Moss, and finally guitarist Roy Hay joined the group.\n\nRealizing they had an Irish gay man as the lead singer, a black Briton on bass, a blond Englishman on guitar and keyboards, and a Jewish drummer, they eventually decided to name the group Culture Club. The group recorded demos, which were paid for by [[EMI]] Records, but the label was unimpressed and decided not to sign the group. [[Virgin Records]] heard the demos and signed the group in the UK, releasing their albums in Europe, while [[Epic Records]] released their albums in the United States and much of the rest of the world since Virgin did not have a US presence at the time. George began sporting a look inspired by [[Siouxsie Sioux]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe band released two singles in May and June 1982, \"White Boy\" and \"I'm Afraid of Me\", though both failed to chart.<ref name=\"Cohen (1984) 76\">{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Scott |title=Boy George |url=http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&tbo=1&q=cohen+%22culture+club%22+%22White+Boy%22+%22I%27m+Afraid+of+Me%22&btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&hl=en&tbo=1&tbs=bks:1&q=Scott+Cohen+1984++%22Culture+Club%22+%22White+Boy%22+%22I%27m+Afraid+of+Me%22&aq=&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&psj=1&fp=f989debfaff70b96 |publisher=Berkley Books |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-425-07639-2 |page=76 |accessdate=28 October 2010 }}</ref> In August the single \"Mystery Boy\" was released in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} In September of that year, the group released their third single, \"[[Do You Really Want to Hurt Me]]\", a reggae-influenced number, which became one of their biggest hits.<ref name=\"Cohen (1984) 76\"/> The song went to No.&nbsp;1 in the UK in late 1982 and became an international smash, peaking at No.&nbsp;1 in twenty-three countries (No.&nbsp;2 in the US), and the top ten in several more countries.\n\nThe band's 1982 debut on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' created [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] headlines, which focused on George's [[androgynous]] style of dress and sexual ambiguity. Magazines began to feature George prominently on their covers. [[Pete Burns]], lead singer of the new wave band [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]], would later claim he was the first to wear braids, big hats, and colourful costumes, but George would cut back with a sharp-tongued remark, \"It's not who did it first, it's who did it better.\"\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Kissing to Be Clever]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;5, US No.&nbsp;14) was released in October 1982, and the follow-up single, \"[[Time (Clock of the Heart)]]\", became another Top 10 hit in the US (Number 2) and UK (Number 3). \"[[I'll Tumble 4 Ya]]\" also became a Top Ten hit in the US (Number 9) and in Canada.

The first single, \"[[Church of the Poison Mind]]\", featuring backing vocalist [[Helen Terry]], reached the UK and US Top 10. The second single, \"[[Karma Chameleon]]\", gave the band their biggest hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;1 in the UK (the band's second chart-topper there), where it became the best selling single of 1983 and has sold 1.5&nbsp;million copies there to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/daft-punks-get-lucky-becomes-one-of-the-uks-biggest-selling-singles-of-all-time-2315/|title=UK Official Charts Company (Top Selling Singles of All-Time)|website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> It also peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in the US for three consecutive weeks, and would ultimately hit No.&nbsp;1 in 30 countries, thus becoming one of the top twenty best-selling singles of the 1980s sold up seven million copies worldwide, with one of the most iconic images of Boy George on the cover shot by photographer [[David Levine (photographer)|David Levine]].\n\nThe album ''Colour by Numbers'' would spawn more hits including \"[[Miss Me Blind]]\" (#5 US), \"[[It's a Miracle (Culture Club song)|It's a Miracle]]\" (#4 UK, No. 13 US), and \"[[Victims (song)|Victims]]\" (#3 UK), and sold four million copies in the US and another five million worldwide at its time of release. The album gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group in music history to have an album certified diamond in Canada (for sales of one million copies in that country). The band also won the 1984 [[Brit Award]] for Best Group and the [[Grammy Award]] for Best New Artist, where George gave a speech via satellite stating, \"Thanks America, you've got style, you've got taste, and you know a good drag queen when you see one.\"\n\nThe group's back-up singer, [[Helen Terry]], began work on her solo album, for which George and Hay wrote the song \"Love Lies Lost\". The pair also wrote \"Passing Friend\" for the [[The Beach Boys (album)|Beach Boys' album]]. Culture Club wrote two songs for the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Electric Dreams (film)|Electric Dreams]]''. George and Hay wrote \"The Dream\" and \"Love Is Love\", with the latter being released as a single in Canada and Japan, the E.P \"Love is Love\" became a major hit in Japan. George also collaborated on the song \"Electric Dreams\", sung by [[P. P. Arnold]]. The song was written with [[Phil Pickett]] (former member of the 1970s band [[Sailor (band)|Sailor]]) who had also co-written \"Karma Chameleon\" and frequently played keyboards for the group.\n\nDespite Culture Club's commercial success, there were significant pressures within the band. George was using drugs with money from his new-found fame. George and Moss were also romantically involved with each other, which was unknown to the public and the media at the time. Their relationship lasted for over four years and was often turbulent, with alleged physical and verbal abuse from both sides. Their constant arguments and the pressure to hide the relationship from the public started to take its toll on the band.\n\n===''Waking Up with the House on Fire'', ''From Luxury to Heartache'' and decline: 1984\u20131986===\nIn 1984, the group released their third album ''[[Waking Up with the House on Fire]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;2, US No.&nbsp;26) which sold 2.8&nbsp;million copies worldwide. Although certified platinum in both the UK and the US, it was a commercial and critical disappointment compared to their first two albums. The album contained the hit single \"The War Song\", which reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK, and Top 20 in the US. Other singles like \"Mistake No.&nbsp;3\" (US No.&nbsp;33) and \"The Medal Song\" (UK No.&nbsp;32) would become modest hits. George later stated he felt the album experienced a lukewarm reception because of half-hearted material he felt they released due to pressure from Virgin and Epic to have a quick follow-up to ''Colour by Numbers''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} According to him, the band had just come off an exhausting world tour in 1984, and as a result the fatigue ended up coming off on the album.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nAt the end of 1984, Boy George was recruited by [[Bob Geldof]] to join the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] recording, consisting of mostly internationally known UK and Irish recording stars. George was in New York City for an appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' when Geldof called him, but managed to catch the final [[Concorde]] of the day to London and was the last singer to record a lead vocal track for the song \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\". The song would become the biggest selling single of all-time in the UK and a huge international hit, raising millions for famine victims in several African nations, particularly Ethiopia.\n\nDue to all the heartache from the break-up of his relationship with Moss, and all the ensuing tension with rest of the band, George turned to (something then very much out of character for George) relief in drugs. Consequently, he soon developed a self-destructive drug [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], which in merely four months escalated from [[marijuana]] to heroin. By 1986, George had become seriously [[Substance use disorder|addicted]]; without Moss by his side, his zest for the band was greatly diminished. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  The recording of their fourth studio album, 1986's ''[[From Luxury to Heartache]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;10, US No.&nbsp;32) dragged on for so long that producer [[Arif Mardin]] had to abandon the sessions due to prior commitments and leave it to engineer Lew Hahn to finish the sessions. Songs on the album such as \"Gusto Blusto\" and \"Reasons\" took days for the addicted singer to finish.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Nevertheless, the first single \"[[Move Away]]\" became a hit, peaking at UK No.&nbsp;7 and US No.&nbsp;12 and appeared the album would return the group back to its previous success. But by the time of the release of the second single \"God Thank You Woman\", news of George's drug addiction began to circulate in British and American [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]], and the second single stalled on its way up the charts, failing to make a big impact.\n\nGeorge and Moss also no longer wanted to be around each other due to the constant relationship battles, and coupled with George's addiction, a forthcoming American tour had to be cancelled.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} ''From Luxury to Heartache'' began to fade from the charts as well, and the album ultimately sold less than one million copies worldwide at the time of release. By the summer of 1986, George finally admitted that he was indeed addicted to drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/boy-george-comes-clean-and-tries-to-come-back-after-heroin-addiction-and-his-pals-drug-deaths-vol-28-no-8/|title=Boy George Comes Clean\u2014and Tries to Come Back\u2014After Heroin Addiction and His Pals' Drug Deaths|website=PEOPLE.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> In July of that year, he was arrested by the British police for possession of heroin. The band broke up and George pursued a solo career, having several European hits and a couple of US Top 40 hits, though George would continue to struggle with his drug addiction for several years.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Reunions===\n====1989====\nThe band first tried to reunite in 1989, after many requests from Tony Gordon, the group's former manager and George's manager at that time. George agreed to try some songs with the band again, resulting in recording sessions and producing more than a dozen songs that remain unreleased. George, however, was more excited about his future projects like his record label, More Protein, and his new [[acid house]] project [[Jesus Loves You (band)|Jesus Loves You]]. The proposed reunion ended up being cancelled.\n\n====1998\u20132000, 2002====\nIn 1998, George and Moss put their differences aside and the band reunited to do a reunion tour, kicking off with a performance on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''.<ref name=\"LAT (1998)\"/> George said about the reunion, \"Culture Club's reunion couldn't have come at a better time for rock\", adding that, \"It's a nostalgia trip, there's no way of avoiding that.\"<ref name=\"LAT (1998)\">{{cite news |title=Culture Club Reunites, but It May Be Just Nostalgic Fling |first=Roger |last=Catlin |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=12 August 1998 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/32812009.html?dids=32812009:32812009&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+12,+1998&author=ROGER+CATLIN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Culture+Club+Reunites,+but+It+May+Be+Just+Nostalgic+Fling;+Pop+music:+Lead+singer+Boy+George+says+regrouped+'80s+band+members+are+putting+aside+differences,+at+least+while+on+tour.&pqatl=google |accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref> The tour was a major success.

[[Alison Moyet]] was to have been a special guest on the tour.\n\nThe band travelled to Spain for a two-week recording session. 18 new tracks were completed for a new album produced by [[Youth (producer)|Youth]]. The new album, entitled ''Tribes'', was scheduled for release in early 2015 on the band's own label Different Man Music (via [[Kobalt Label Services]]). At the end of that year the album still hadn't materialised.\n\nOn 19 July 2014, the band were among the line-up for a two-hour concert in [[Edinburgh Castle]], ahead of the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in [[Glasgow]]. Hay did not perform with the band because he was in recovery after having knee surgery. The band played two songs, \"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\" and \"Karma Chameleon\".\n\nIn mid-November 2014, two days before the start of their 21-date US and UK tour, Culture Club announced they had to cancel the tour due to George suffering from a serious throat condition.

After his tenure with the group ended, George decided to start his own band and enlisted bassist Mikey Craig, drummer Jon Moss, and finally guitarist Roy Hay joined the group.\n\nRealizing they had an Irish gay man as the lead singer, a black Briton on bass, a blond Englishman on guitar and keyboards, and a Jewish drummer, they eventually decided to name the group Culture Club. The group recorded demos, which were paid for by [[EMI]] Records, but the label was unimpressed and decided not to sign the group. [[Virgin Records]] heard the demos and signed the group in the UK, releasing their albums in Europe, while [[Epic Records]] released their albums in the United States and much of the rest of the world since Virgin did not have a US presence at the time. George began sporting a look inspired by [[Siouxsie Sioux]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe band released two singles in May and June 1982, \"White Boy\" and \"I'm Afraid of Me\", though both failed to chart.<ref name=\"Cohen (1984) 76\">{{cite book |last=Cohen |first=Scott |title=Boy George |url=http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&tbo=1&q=cohen+%22culture+club%22+%22White+Boy%22+%22I%27m+Afraid+of+Me%22&btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&hl=en&tbo=1&tbs=bks:1&q=Scott+Cohen+1984++%22Culture+Club%22+%22White+Boy%22+%22I%27m+Afraid+of+Me%22&aq=&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&psj=1&fp=f989debfaff70b96 |publisher=Berkley Books |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-425-07639-2 |page=76 |accessdate=28 October 2010 }}</ref> In August the single \"Mystery Boy\" was released in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} In September of that year, the group released their third single, \"[[Do You Really Want to Hurt Me]]\", a reggae-influenced number, which became one of their biggest hits.<ref name=\"Cohen (1984) 76\"/> The song went to No.&nbsp;1 in the UK in late 1982 and became an international smash, peaking at No.&nbsp;1 in twenty-three countries (No.&nbsp;2 in the US), and the top ten in several more countries.\n\nThe band's 1982 debut on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' created [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] headlines, which focused on George's [[androgynous]] style of dress and sexual ambiguity. Magazines began to feature George prominently on their covers. [[Pete Burns]], lead singer of the new wave band [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]], would later claim he was the first to wear braids, big hats, and colourful costumes, but George would cut back with a sharp-tongued remark, \"It's not who did it first, it's who did it better.\"\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Kissing to Be Clever]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;5, US No.&nbsp;14) was released in October 1982, and the follow-up single, \"[[Time (Clock of the Heart)]]\", became another Top 10 hit in the US (Number 2) and UK (Number 3). \"[[I'll Tumble 4 Ya]]\" also became a Top Ten hit in the US (Number 9) and in Canada.

The first single, \"[[Church of the Poison Mind]]\", featuring backing vocalist [[Helen Terry]], reached the UK and US Top 10. The second single, \"[[Karma Chameleon]]\", gave the band their biggest hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;1 in the UK (the band's second chart-topper there), where it became the best selling single of 1983 and has sold 1.5&nbsp;million copies there to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/daft-punks-get-lucky-becomes-one-of-the-uks-biggest-selling-singles-of-all-time-2315/|title=UK Official Charts Company (Top Selling Singles of All-Time)|website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref> It also peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in the US for three consecutive weeks, and would ultimately hit No.&nbsp;1 in 30 countries, thus becoming one of the top twenty best-selling singles of the 1980s sold up seven million copies worldwide, with one of the most iconic images of Boy George on the cover shot by photographer [[David Levine (photographer)|David Levine]].\n\nThe album ''Colour by Numbers'' would spawn more hits including \"[[Miss Me Blind]]\" (#5 US), \"[[It's a Miracle (Culture Club song)|It's a Miracle]]\" (#4 UK, No. 13 US), and \"[[Victims (song)|Victims]]\" (#3 UK), and sold four million copies in the US and another five million worldwide at its time of release. The album gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group in music history to have an album certified diamond in Canada (for sales of one million copies in that country). The band also won the 1984 [[Brit Award]] for Best Group and the [[Grammy Award]] for Best New Artist, where George gave a speech via satellite stating, \"Thanks America, you've got style, you've got taste, and you know a good drag queen when you see one.\"\n\nThe group's back-up singer, [[Helen Terry]], began work on her solo album, for which George and Hay wrote the song \"Love Lies Lost\". The pair also wrote \"Passing Friend\" for the [[The Beach Boys (album)|Beach Boys' album]]. Culture Club wrote two songs for the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Electric Dreams (film)|Electric Dreams]]''. George and Hay wrote \"The Dream\" and \"Love Is Love\", with the latter being released as a single in Canada and Japan, the E.P \"Love is Love\" became a major hit in Japan. George also collaborated on the song \"Electric Dreams\", sung by [[P. P. Arnold]]. The song was written with [[Phil Pickett]] (former member of the 1970s band [[Sailor (band)|Sailor]]) who had also co-written \"Karma Chameleon\" and frequently played keyboards for the group.\n\nDespite Culture Club's commercial success, there were significant pressures within the band. George was using drugs with money from his new-found fame. George and Moss were also romantically involved with each other, which was unknown to the public and the media at the time. Their relationship lasted for over four years and was often turbulent, with alleged physical and verbal abuse from both sides. Their constant arguments and the pressure to hide the relationship from the public started to take its toll on the band.\n\n===''Waking Up with the House on Fire'', ''From Luxury to Heartache'' and decline: 1984\u20131986===\nIn 1984, the group released their third album ''[[Waking Up with the House on Fire]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;2, US No.&nbsp;26) which sold 2.8&nbsp;million copies worldwide. Although certified platinum in both the UK and the US, it was a commercial and critical disappointment compared to their first two albums. The album contained the hit single \"The War Song\", which reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK, and Top 20 in the US. Other singles like \"Mistake No.&nbsp;3\" (US No.&nbsp;33) and \"The Medal Song\" (UK No.&nbsp;32) would become modest hits. George later stated he felt the album experienced a lukewarm reception because of half-hearted material he felt they released due to pressure from Virgin and Epic to have a quick follow-up to ''Colour by Numbers''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} According to him, the band had just come off an exhausting world tour in 1984, and as a result the fatigue ended up coming off on the album.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nAt the end of 1984, Boy George was recruited by [[Bob Geldof]] to join the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] recording, consisting of mostly internationally known UK and Irish recording stars. George was in New York City for an appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' when Geldof called him, but managed to catch the final [[Concorde]] of the day to London and was the last singer to record a lead vocal track for the song \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\". The song would become the biggest selling single of all-time in the UK and a huge international hit, raising millions for famine victims in several African nations, particularly Ethiopia.\n\nDue to all the heartache from the break-up of his relationship with Moss, and all the ensuing tension with rest of the band, George turned to (something then very much out of character for George) relief in drugs. Consequently, he soon developed a self-destructive drug [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], which in merely four months escalated from [[marijuana]] to heroin. By 1986, George had become seriously [[Substance use disorder|addicted]]; without Moss by his side, his zest for the band was greatly diminished. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  The recording of their fourth studio album, 1986's ''[[From Luxury to Heartache]]'' (UK No.&nbsp;10, US No.&nbsp;32) dragged on for so long that producer [[Arif Mardin]] had to abandon the sessions due to prior commitments and leave it to engineer Lew Hahn to finish the sessions. Songs on the album such as \"Gusto Blusto\" and \"Reasons\" took days for the addicted singer to finish.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Nevertheless, the first single \"[[Move Away]]\" became a hit, peaking at UK No.&nbsp;7 and US No.&nbsp;12 and appeared the album would return the group back to its previous success. But by the time of the release of the second single \"God Thank You Woman\", news of George's drug addiction began to circulate in British and American [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]], and the second single stalled on its way up the charts, failing to make a big impact.\n\nGeorge and Moss also no longer wanted to be around each other due to the constant relationship battles, and coupled with George's addiction, a forthcoming American tour had to be cancelled.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} ''From Luxury to Heartache'' began to fade from the charts as well, and the album ultimately sold less than one million copies worldwide at the time of release. By the summer of 1986, George finally admitted that he was indeed addicted to drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/boy-george-comes-clean-and-tries-to-come-back-after-heroin-addiction-and-his-pals-drug-deaths-vol-28-no-8/|title=Boy George Comes Clean\u2014and Tries to Come Back\u2014After Heroin Addiction and His Pals' Drug Deaths|website=PEOPLE.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref> In July of that year, he was arrested by the British police for possession of heroin. The band broke up and George pursued a solo career, having several European hits and a couple of US Top 40 hits, though George would continue to struggle with his drug addiction for several years.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Reunions===\n====1989====\nThe band first tried to reunite in 1989, after many requests from Tony Gordon, the group's former manager and George's manager at that time. George agreed to try some songs with the band again, resulting in recording sessions and producing more than a dozen songs that remain unreleased. George, however, was more excited about his future projects like his record label, More Protein, and his new [[acid house]] project [[Jesus Loves You (band)|Jesus Loves You]]. The proposed reunion ended up being cancelled.\n\n====1998\u20132000, 2002====\nIn 1998, George and Moss put their differences aside and the band reunited to do a reunion tour, kicking off with a performance on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''.<ref name=\"LAT (1998)\"/> George said about the reunion, \"Culture Club's reunion couldn't have come at a better time for rock\", adding that, \"It's a nostalgia trip, there's no way of avoiding that.\"<ref name=\"LAT (1998)\">{{cite news |title=Culture Club Reunites, but It May Be Just Nostalgic Fling |first=Roger |last=Catlin |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=12 August 1998 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/32812009.html?dids=32812009:32812009&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+12,+1998&author=ROGER+CATLIN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Culture+Club+Reunites,+but+It+May+Be+Just+Nostalgic+Fling;+Pop+music:+Lead+singer+Boy+George+says+regrouped+'80s+band+members+are+putting+aside+differences,+at+least+while+on+tour.&pqatl=google |accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref> The tour was a major success.

Early that year, the band's record company placed an ad for a lead singer to \"...take part in a 2007 World Tour and TV Series.\" The new singer, Sam Butcher was selected because of his own personality, \"not a Boy George lookalike.\" After watching a video on MySpace, George described the singer who replaced him as \"terrible\" and \"dreadful\".

A new picture of the four members was also posted on the band's official website, along with the list of the 11 UK concert dates. [[Alison Moyet]] was to have been a special guest on the tour.\n\nThe band travelled to Spain for a two-week recording session. 18 new tracks were completed for a new album produced by [[Youth (producer)|Youth]]. The new album, entitled ''Tribes'', was scheduled for release in early 2015 on the band's own label Different Man Music (via [[Kobalt Label Services]]). At the end of that year the album still hadn't materialised.\n\nOn 19 July 2014, the band were among the line-up for a two-hour concert in [[Edinburgh Castle]], ahead of the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in [[Glasgow]]. Hay did not perform with the band because he was in recovery after having knee surgery. The band played two songs, \"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\" and \"Karma Chameleon\".\n\nIn mid-November 2014, two days before the start of their 21-date US and UK tour, Culture Club announced they had to cancel the tour due to George suffering from a serious throat condition.

This term is generally considered derogatory in Urdu and the word Khwaja Sara is used instead. Another such term is ''khasuaa'' (\u0916\u0938\u0941\u0906) or ''khusaraa'' (\u0916\u0941\u0938\u0930\u093e). In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], hijra is called ''\u09b9\u09bf\u099c\u09a1\u09bc\u09be'', ''hijra'', ''hijla'', ''hijre'', ''hizra'', or ''hizre''.\n\nA number of terms across the culturally and linguistically diverse [[Indian subcontinent]] represent similar sex or gender categories. While these are rough [[synonym]]s, they may be better understood as separate identities due to regional cultural differences. In [[Odia language|Odia]], a hijra is referred to as ''hinjida'', ''hinjda'' or ''napunsaka'', in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''napunsakudu'' ({{lang|te|\u0c28\u0c2a\u0c41\u0c02\u0c38\u0c15\u0c41\u0c21\u0c41}}), ''kojja'' ({{lang|te|\u0c15\u0c4a\u0c1c\u0c4d\u0c1c}}) or ''maada'' ({{lang|te|\u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c21}}), in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''thiru nangai'' (mister woman), ''ali'', ''aravanni'', ''aravani'' or ''aruvani'', in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] as ''khusra'' or ''jankha'', in [[Kannada]] as ''mangalamukhi'' (\u0cae\u0c82\u0c97\u0cb3\u0cae\u0cc1\u0c96\u0cbf) or ''chhakka'' (\u0c9a\u0c95\u0ccd\u0c95), in [[sindhi language|Sindhi]] as ''khadra'', and in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] as ''pavaiyaa'' (\u0aaa\u0abe\u0ab5\u0ac8\u0aaf\u0abe).\n\nIn North India, the goddess [[Bahuchara Mata]] is worshipped by ''Pavaiyaa'' (\u0aaa\u0abe\u0ab5\u0ac8\u0aaf\u0abe). In South India, the goddess [[Renuka]] is believed to have the power to change one's sex. Male devotees in female clothing are known as ''Jogappa''. They perform similar roles to hijra, such as dancing and singing at birth ceremonies and weddings.{{sfn|Bradford|1983|pp=307\u201322}}\n\nThe word ''[[Kothi (Cult)|kothi]]'' (or ''koti'') is common across India, similar to the [[Kathoey]] of Thailand, although kothis are often distinguished from hijras. Kothis are regarded as feminine men or boys who take a feminine role in sex with men, but do not live in the kind of [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] that hijras usually live in. Additionally, not all kothis have undergone initiation rites or the body modification steps to become a hijra.{{sfn|Reddy|Nanda|1997|pp=275-282}} Local equivalents include ''durani'' ([[Kolkata]]), ''menaka'' ([[Cochin]]),<ref name=\"Naz\">Naz Foundation International, Briefing Paper 3: Developing community-based sexual health services for males who have sex with males in South Asia.

While kothis are usually distinguished from hijras as a separate gender identity, they often dress as women and act in a feminine manner in public spaces, even using feminine language to refer to themselves and each other. The usual partners of hijras and kothis are men who consider themselves heterosexual as they are the ones who penetrate.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.rhcatalyst.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Programs_STI_Prevention_Bangladesh In Their Own Words: The Formulation of Sexual and Reproductive Health Behaviour Among Young Men in Bangladesh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007132618/http://www.rhcatalyst.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Programs_STI_Prevention_Bangladesh |date=7 October 2006 }}, Shivananda Khan, Sharful Islam Khan and Paula E.

They are usually devotees of the mother goddess [[Bahuchara Mata]], [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]], or both.\n\n===Bahuchara Mata===\n\n[[Bahuchara Mata]] is a Hindu goddess with two unrelated stories both associated with transgender behavior. One story is that she appeared in the avatar of a princess who castrated her husband because he would run in the woods and act like a woman rather than have sex with her. Another story is that a man tried to rape her, so she cursed him with impotence. When the man begged her forgiveness to have the curse removed, she relented only after he agreed to run in the woods and act like a woman.

Soon Rama notices this, and gathers them to tell them not to mourn, and that all the \"men and women\" of his kingdom should return to their places in Ayodhya. Rama then leaves and has adventures for 14 years. When he returns to Ayodhya, he finds that the hijras, being neither men nor women, have not moved from the place where he gave his speech. Impressed with their devotion, Rama grants hijras the boon to confer blessings on people during auspicious inaugural occasions like childbirth and weddings.

In South India, hijras claim Iravan as their progenitor and call themselves \"aravanis\".<ref name=\"Frontline2021\" />\n\nEach year in [[Tamil Nadu]], during April and May, ''hijras'' celebrate an eighteen-day religious festival. The aravani temple is located in the village [[Koovagam]] in the Ulundurpet [[taluk]] in [[Villupuram]] district, and is devoted to the deity Koothandavar, who is identified with Aravan. During the festival, the aravanis reenact a story of the wedding of Lord [[Krishna]] and Lord Aravan, followed by Aravan's subsequent sacrifice. They then mourn Aravan's death through ritualistic dances and by breaking their [[bangle]]s. An annual beauty pageant is also held, as well as various health and HIV or AIDS seminars. ''Hijras'' from all over the country travel to this festival.

It concerns a patriarch, Hakim, who is a misogynist, a domestic abuser, a bigot and a zealot who forces religion on his family. They face financial difficulties due to Hakim wanting a son. He rejects his transgender daughter, Saifi, as he wanted an heir and she identifies as a girl. Saifi is deeply loved by the rest of her family. As she grows up, men want to take advantage of her and she does not understand at first. However, her oldest sister intervenes and teaches Saifi about what kind of touching is inappropriate. As Saifi grows older, she is not allowed to leave the house. She finds her sister's dresses compelling and tries them on, revealing her gender identity. A neighbour played by famous South Asian singer [[Atif Aslam]], who is in love with one of the sisters, gets Saifi a job at a place where they paint trucks, with the blessing of Saifi's sisters and mother. Saifi dresses like a boy; however, other boys sense her lack of self-esteem and eventually gang-rape her. She is saved when another transgender person, played by Almas Bobby (a transgender actor), finds her and takes her home. Hakim overhears Saifi telling her mother and Zainab what happened.

This term is generally considered derogatory in Urdu and the word Khwaja Sara is used instead. Another such term is ''khasuaa'' (\u0916\u0938\u0941\u0906) or ''khusaraa'' (\u0916\u0941\u0938\u0930\u093e). In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], hijra is called ''\u09b9\u09bf\u099c\u09a1\u09bc\u09be'', ''hijra'', ''hijla'', ''hijre'', ''hizra'', or ''hizre''.\n\nA number of terms across the culturally and linguistically diverse [[Indian subcontinent]] represent similar sex or gender categories. While these are rough [[synonym]]s, they may be better understood as separate identities due to regional cultural differences. In [[Odia language|Odia]], a hijra is referred to as ''hinjida'', ''hinjda'' or ''napunsaka'', in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''napunsakudu'' ({{lang|te|\u0c28\u0c2a\u0c41\u0c02\u0c38\u0c15\u0c41\u0c21\u0c41}}), ''kojja'' ({{lang|te|\u0c15\u0c4a\u0c1c\u0c4d\u0c1c}}) or ''maada'' ({{lang|te|\u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c21}}), in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''thiru nangai'' (mister woman), ''ali'', ''aravanni'', ''aravani'' or ''aruvani'', in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] as ''khusra'' or ''jankha'', in [[Kannada]] as ''mangalamukhi'' (\u0cae\u0c82\u0c97\u0cb3\u0cae\u0cc1\u0c96\u0cbf) or ''chhakka'' (\u0c9a\u0c95\u0ccd\u0c95), in [[sindhi language|Sindhi]] as ''khadra'', and in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] as ''pavaiyaa'' (\u0aaa\u0abe\u0ab5\u0ac8\u0aaf\u0abe).\n\nIn North India, the goddess [[Bahuchara Mata]] is worshipped by ''Pavaiyaa'' (\u0aaa\u0abe\u0ab5\u0ac8\u0aaf\u0abe). In South India, the goddess [[Renuka]] is believed to have the power to change one's sex. Male devotees in female clothing are known as ''Jogappa''. They perform similar roles to hijra, such as dancing and singing at birth ceremonies and weddings.{{sfn|Bradford|1983|pp=307\u201322}}\n\nThe word ''[[Kothi (Cult)|kothi]]'' (or ''koti'') is common across India, similar to the [[Kathoey]] of Thailand, although kothis are often distinguished from hijras. Kothis are regarded as feminine men or boys who take a feminine role in sex with men, but do not live in the kind of [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] that hijras usually live in. Additionally, not all kothis have undergone initiation rites or the body modification steps to become a hijra.{{sfn|Reddy|Nanda|1997|pp=275-282}} Local equivalents include ''durani'' ([[Kolkata]]), ''menaka'' ([[Cochin]]),<ref name=\"Naz\">Naz Foundation International, Briefing Paper 3: Developing community-based sexual health services for males who have sex with males in South Asia.

While kothis are usually distinguished from hijras as a separate gender identity, they often dress as women and act in a feminine manner in public spaces, even using feminine language to refer to themselves and each other.

They are usually devotees of the mother goddess [[Bahuchara Mata]], [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]], or both.\n\n===Bahuchara Mata===\n\n[[Bahuchara Mata]] is a Hindu goddess with two unrelated stories both associated with transgender behavior. One story is that she appeared in the avatar of a princess who castrated her husband because he would run in the woods and act like a woman rather than have sex with her. Another story is that a man tried to rape her, so she cursed him with impotence. When the man begged her forgiveness to have the curse removed, she relented only after he agreed to run in the woods and act like a woman. The primary temple to this goddess is located in [[Gujarat]]<ref name=\"Frontline2504\">{{harvnb|Venkat|2008}}</ref> and it is a place of pilgrimage for hijras, who see Bahuchara Mata as a patroness.\n\n===Lord Shiva===\n\nOne of the forms of Lord Shiva is a merging with [[Parvati]] where together they are [[Ardhanari]], a god that is half Shiva and half Parvati. Ardhanari has special significance as a patron of hijras, who identify with the gender ambiguity.<ref name=\"Frontline2504\" />\n\n===In the ''Ramayana''===\n\nIn some versions of the ''[[Ramayana]]'',<ref name=\"Bockrath2003\">\"Many, if not most, translations of Valmiki's Ramayana do not contain this reference.\" Joseph T.

Soon Rama notices this, and gathers them to tell them not to mourn, and that all the \"men and women\" of his kingdom should return to their places in Ayodhya. Rama then leaves and has adventures for 14 years. When he returns to Ayodhya, he finds that the hijras, being neither men nor women, have not moved from the place where he gave his speech. Impressed with their devotion, Rama grants hijras the boon to confer blessings on people during auspicious inaugural occasions like childbirth and weddings. This boon is the origin of ''badhai'' in which hijras sing, dance, and give blessings.<ref name=\"Frontline2021\">{{harvnb|Narrain|2006}}</ref>\n\n===In the ''Mahabharata''===\n[[File:Kuvagam Kuttantavar.jpg|thumb|Kuttantavar festival in [[Koovagam]] ]]\n''[[Mahabharata]]'' includes an episode in which Arjuna, a hero of the epic, is sent into an exile. There he assumes an identity of a eunuch-transvestite and performs rituals during weddings and childbirths that are now performed by hijras.<ref name=\"Sadhin\" />\n\nIn the Mahabharata, before the [[Kurukshetra War]], [[Iravan]] offers his lifeblood to [[Kali|goddess Kali]] to ensure the victory of the [[Pandavas]], and Kali agrees to grant him power. On the night before the battle, Iravan expresses a desire to get married before he dies. No woman was willing to marry a man doomed to die in a few hours, so Lord [[Krishna]] ( as [[Mohini]] ) marries him. In South India, hijras claim Iravan as their progenitor and call themselves \"aravanis\".<ref name=\"Frontline2021\" />\n\nEach year in [[Tamil Nadu]], during April and May, ''hijras'' celebrate an eighteen-day religious festival. The aravani temple is located in the village [[Koovagam]] in the Ulundurpet [[taluk]] in [[Villupuram]] district, and is devoted to the deity Koothandavar, who is identified with Aravan. During the festival, the aravanis reenact a story of the wedding of Lord [[Krishna]] and Lord Aravan, followed by Aravan's subsequent sacrifice. They then mourn Aravan's death through ritualistic dances and by breaking their [[bangle]]s. An annual beauty pageant is also held, as well as various health and HIV or AIDS seminars. ''Hijras'' from all over the country travel to this festival. A personal experience of the hijras in this festival is shown in the [[BBC Three]] documentary ''India's Ladyboys'' and also in the [[National Geographic Channel]] television series ''[[Taboo (2002 TV series)|Taboo]]''.\n\n===In Islam===\n\nThere is evidence that Indian hijras identifying as Muslim also incorporate aspects of Hinduism. Still, despite this [[syncretism]], Gayatri Reddy notes that a hijra does not practice Islam differently from other Muslims and argues that their syncretism does not make them any less Muslim.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Reddy, Gayatri.|title=With respect to sex : negotiating hijra identity in South India|date=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-70754-9|location=Chicago|oclc=655225261}}</ref> Reddy also documents an example of how this syncretism manifests: in [[Hyderabad]], India, a group of Muslim converts were circumcised, something seen as the quintessential marker of male Muslim identity.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Hijras, 'AIDS Cosmopolitanism' and the Politics of Care in Hyderabad|last=Reddy|first=Gayatri|date=2008|doi=10.1037/e618052011-025}}</ref>\n\n== In films and literature ==\n\n===India===\n\n''Hijras'' have been portrayed on screen in [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]] since its inception, historically as [[comic relief]]. A notable turning point occurred in 1974 when real ''hijras'' appeared during a song-and-dance sequence in ''[[Kunwara Baap (1974 film)|Kunwaara Baap]]'' (\"The Unmarried Father\"). There are also ''hijras'' in the Hindi movie ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'' (1977) who accompany one of the heroes, Akbar ([[Rishi Kapoor]]), in a song entitled \"''Tayyab Ali Pyar Ka Dushman''\" (\"Tayyab Ali, the Enemy of Love\"). One of the first sympathetic ''hijra'' portrayals was in Mani Ratnam's [[Bombay (film)|''Bombay'']] (1995). 1997's ''[[Tamanna (1997 film)|Tamanna]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205445/|title=Tamanna (1998)|author=Kron-3|date=13 April 1998|work=IMDb|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref> starred male actor [[Paresh Rawal]] in a central role as \"Tiku\", a ''hijra'' who raises a young orphan. [[Pooja Bhatt]] produced and also starred in the movie, with her father [[Mahesh Bhatt]] co-writing and directing. Deepa Mehta's ''[[Water (2005 film)|Water]]'' features the ''hijra'' character \"Gulabi\" (played by [[Raghubir Yadav]]), who has taken to introducing the downtrodden, outcast widows of [[Varanasi]] to prostitution. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the film generated much controversy. There is a brief appearance of ''hijras'' in the 2004 [[Gurinder Chadha]] film ''[[Bride & Prejudice]]'', singing to a bride-to-be in the marketplace.\n\nThe 1997 Hindi film ''[[Darmiyaan: In Between]]'', directed & co-written by [[Kalpana Lajmi]], is based on the subject of ''hijras'', with a fictitious story of an actress bearing a son that turns out to be neuter.\n\nIn the 2000 Tamil film ''[[Appu (2000 film)|Appu]]'', directed by [[Vasanth]] and a remake of the Hindi film ''Sadak'', the antagonist is a brothel-owning ''hijra'' played by [[Prakash Raj]]. (In ''Sadak'', the brothel-owning character was played by [[Sadashiv Amrapurkar]] under the name \"Maharani\".)\n\n''[[Jogwa]]'', a 2009 Marathi film, depicts the story of a man forced to be ''hijra'' under certain circumstances. The movie has received several accolades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wogma.com/article/jogwa-societal-grime-with-aesthetic-beauty|title=Jogwa: societal grime with aesthetic beauty|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Soorma Bhopali]]'', [[Jagdeep]] encounters a troupe of ''hijra'' on his arrival in Bombay. The leader of this pack is also played by [[Jagdeep]] himself.\n\nIn [[Anil Kapoor]]'s ''[[Nayak: The Real Hero|Nayak]]'', [[Johnny Lever]], who plays the role of the hero's assistant, gets beaten up by hijras, when he is caught calling them \"hijra\" (he is in habit of calling almost everyone who bothers him by this pejorative and no one cares much, except this once ironically, as the addressees are literally what he is calling them.)\n\nOne of the main characters in [[Khushwant Singh]]'s novel ''[[Delhi: A Novel|Delhi]]'', Bhagmati, is a ''hijra''. She makes a living as a semi-prostitute and is wanted in the diplomatic circles of the city.\n\n[[Vijay TV]]'s ''[[Ippadikku Rose]]'', a Tamil show conducted by postgraduate educated transgender woman Rose, is a very successful running program that discusses various issues faced by youth in Tamil Nadu, where she also gives her own experiences.\n\nIn addition to numerous other themes, the 2008 movie ''[[Welcome to Sajjanpur]]'' by [[Shyam Benegal]] explores the role of ''hijras'' in Indian society.\n===Malayalam===\nIn the [[Malayalam]] movie ''[[Ardhanaari]]'', released on 23 November 2012, director Santhosh Sowparnika tries to depict the life of a transgender person.

It portrays eloquently how they, too, are not far away from human emotions and feelings and their world is not much different from the heterosexual community.

He rejects his transgender daughter, Saifi, as he wanted an heir and she identifies as a girl. Saifi is deeply loved by the rest of her family. As she grows up, men want to take advantage of her and she does not understand at first. However, her oldest sister intervenes and teaches Saifi about what kind of touching is inappropriate. As Saifi grows older, she is not allowed to leave the house. She finds her sister's dresses compelling and tries them on, revealing her gender identity. A neighbour played by famous South Asian singer [[Atif Aslam]], who is in love with one of the sisters, gets Saifi a job at a place where they paint trucks, with the blessing of Saifi's sisters and mother. Saifi dresses like a boy; however, other boys sense her lack of self-esteem and eventually gang-rape her.
