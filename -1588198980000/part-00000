In 1966 [[Metro Cammell|Metropolitan-Cammell]] absorbed the railway rolling stock business of Cravens. In 1967 the remaining rolling stock business switched to making shipping containers under the name Cravens Homalloy.

Difficult trading lead to the closure of the Osborne Street site in 1920.\n\n==Products==\nDuring the 1880s London's ''The Times'' newspaper made regular reports on the state of trade throughout England and Scotland.

They also constructed coaches for many railway companies around the world. As well as surface running stock they also built vehicles for underground railways and especially noted are the [[London Underground A60 Stock]]. With modernisation the company adapted to build [[diesel multiple units]] and [[electric multiple units]] for [[British Railways]]. \nOne of its last orders, in 1963, was of 55 mainline carriages, broadly similar to the [[British Railways]] Mark 1 design, for the Irish railway company [[C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann]].\nAnother of the orders received and completed before the absorption by Metro Cammell was a royal train for [[Peru]].\n\n===Second World War===\nCraven's made airframe components and maintained supply of road and rail vehicles for the Admiralty and Ministry of Supply including: limbers, gun shields, gun mountings, gun turrets, rocket ammunition racks, ammunition boxes, and components for armoured vehicles.\n\n===Asbestos sound insulation===\nMany employees in the railway industry in general developed  diseases related to [[asbestos]],  used during the locomotive and carriage building process.

The crane was being restored by the Craven Crane Group, although it is listed in a roster of preserved railway and tramway equipment as having been transferred to Steam Inc ownership in 2009. It is at present under overhaul, having last operated in the late 1980s. Two of Craven's Class 105 diesel multiple unit cars, numbers 51485 and 56121 are now owned by and have been restored to \"as new\" condition by the [[East Lancashire Railway]].<ref>http://www.elrdiesel.info/fleet-dmu.php#class105</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Office block on Greg Street - geograph.org.uk - 1331999.jpg|The former general and drawing office of Craven Brothers in 1999\nImage:Craven Brothers Lathe.jpg|1907 Craven Brothers builders photo of a lathe.\nImage:Craven Brothers Firebox Drilling Machine.jpg|Craven Brothers catalogue illustration of a steam locomotive firebox drilling machine.\nImage:Craven Brothers 25 Ton Breakdown Crane.jpg|Craven Brothers catalogue illustration of a 25 Ton railway breakdown crane.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[British Rail Class 105]]\n* [[British Rail Class 112]]\n* [[British Rail Class 311]]\n* [[Coaching Stock of Ireland]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book| author=Brownlie, John.S.| title=Railway Steam Cranes| publisher=John S.

He is the editor of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine, a columnist for the ''[[New York Post]]'', the author of several books on politics, and a former [[speechwriter]] for [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].\n\n==Life and career==\nPodhoretz was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in New York City, the son of conservative journalists [[Norman Podhoretz]] and [[Midge Decter]]; he is his mother's youngest child of four, and his father's youngest child of two. His parents were both divorced, against Jewish dictates. He grew up on the [[Upper West Side]] in New York City. He attended [[Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School]] and he received a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1982. In 1986, he became a five-time champion on the game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]''.\n\nPodhoretz served as [[speechwriter]] to former U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] as well as former President [[George H.W. Bush]]. He also served in the capacity of special assistant to White House [[Drug Czar]] [[William Bennett]]. He was co-founder as well of the [[White House Writers Group]], a corporate speechwriting and public-relations firm in Washington, D.C.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatertalent.com/speakers/speakers.php?speakerid=432 |title=John Podhoretz |publisher=Greater Talent Network |accessdate=April 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029031306/http://www.greatertalent.com/speakers/speakers.php?speakerid=432 |archivedate=October 29, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nPodhoretz was a consultant for the popular television series ''[[The West Wing]]'', including the controversial episode \"[[Gaza (The West Wing)|Gaza]]\" in season five, first broadcast on May 12, 2004.<ref>{{IMDb name|id=1885020|name=John Podhoretz|accessdate=April 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\nPodhoretz has contributed to a number of conservative publications, including ''[[National Review]]'' and the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'', where he is a movie critic and was the magazine's deputy editor. He was also a consulting editor at [[ReganBooks]], a former imprint of [[HarperCollins]]. Podhoretz has a regular column at the ''[[New York Post]]''. He has also appeared on television as a political commentator, on [[Fox News]], [[CNN]]'s ''Reliable Sources'', MSNBC, and ''[[The McLaughlin Group]]'' (in the chair usually occupied by conservative [[Tony Blankley]]), among other places. He has also worked at ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'', the ''[[Washington Times]]'', ''[[Insight on the News]]'', and ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''. Podhoretz was a contributor to The Corner, a group blog run by ''National Review''.\n\nAt ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', one staff member said, Podhoretz's \"arrogance and egotism had a psychological effect people can't quite believe.\" At ''[[The Washington Times]]'' a colleague reported, he was \"permanently frozen in juvenalia.\" Glenn Garvin, the Central American bureau chief of the ''Miami Herald'', once said that at the ''Times'', Podhoretz \"constantly complained that his brilliance wasn't appreciated.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/1968/index1.html|title=Oedipus & Podhoretz|website=NYMag.com}}</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 2009, Podhoretz became editor of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', succeeding [[Neal Kozodoy]], who had been editor since 1995, when Norman Podhoretz retired. Kozodoy is currently Editor-at-Large.\n\n===Political commentary===\n\n====George W. Bush====\nPodhoretz was a steadfast supporter of U.S. president [[George W. Bush]], and his 2004 book ''Bush Country'' called Bush \"the first great leader of the 21st century\". He was apparently serious about that, a sign Podhoretz is not playing with a full deck.  When some conservatives denounced Bush's immigration plan, Podhoretz wrote that Bush's \"efforts on behalf of conservative causes\u2014from faith-based policies to stem-cell research to a strict-constructionist judiciary to entitlement reform and massive tax cuts\u2014have all fallen down the memory hole\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NGJkMWM2MmExZDZkYTI2MmFmNTZiODQ3MjNjNmQwYzA= |title=The Inability to Stomach Disagreement |magazine=National Review Online |author=John Podhoretz |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=September 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806092940/http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NGJkMWM2MmExZDZkYTI2MmFmNTZiODQ3MjNjNmQwYzA%3D |archivedate=August 6, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n====Israel====\nPodhoretz is emphatic in his defense of [[Israel]] in its conflicts with its [[Arab]] neighbors. When pundit [[Pat Buchanan]] called Israel's actions in the [[2006 Lebanon War]] \"un-Christian\", Podhoretz wrote: \"You want to know what [[anti-Semitism]] is?

That's anti-Semitism.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjU4OTZkMDUzYWJjNGYwNmVmYTFkNDlmYmY1NjY5ZGE= |title=You Want to Know What Anti-Semitism Is? |date=July 21, 2006 |author=John Podhoretz |magazine=National Review Online |accessdate=September 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822103825/http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjU4OTZkMDUzYWJjNGYwNmVmYTFkNDlmYmY1NjY5ZGE%3D |archivedate=August 22, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n====Iraq War====\nPodhoretz has supported the [[Iraq War]] from its inception until the present.  He has learned nothing from a war that killed millions, and that even its most vociferous supporters now admit was, to put it politely, a quagmire. In his book, ''Bush Country'', he wrote, \"The natural terrorist hunger to acquire WMDs, and Saddam Hussein's desire to humiliate the United States, combined to make Iraq a new kind of threat to America and the world.\" In a July 25, 2006 column for the ''New York Post'' that discussed the Israel-Lebanon conflict, Podhoretz advocated a more Machiavellian policy in Iraq, writing: \"What if the tactical mistake we made in Iraq was that we didn't kill enough Sunnis in the early going to intimidate them and make them so afraid of us they would go along with anything? Wasn't the survival of Sunni men between the ages of 15 and 35 the reason there was an insurgency and the basic cause of the sectarian violence now?\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/1083003321.html?dids=1083003321:1083003321&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jul+25%2C+2006&author=John+Podhoretz&pub=New+York+Post&edition=&startpage=029&desc=TOO+NICE+TO+WIN%3F+ISRAEL%27S+DILEMMA |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715210444/http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/1083003321.html?dids=1083003321:1083003321&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jul+25,+2006&author=John+Podhoretz&pub=New+York+Post&edition=&startpage=029&desc=TOO+NICE+TO+WIN%3F+ISRAEL'S+DILEMMA |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 15, 2012 |title=Too Nice to Win?

He was also a consulting editor at [[ReganBooks]], a former imprint of [[HarperCollins]]. Podhoretz has a regular column at the ''[[New York Post]]''. He has also appeared on television as a political commentator, on [[Fox News]], [[CNN]]'s ''Reliable Sources'', MSNBC, and ''[[The McLaughlin Group]]'' (in the chair usually occupied by conservative [[Tony Blankley]]), among other places. He has also worked at ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'', the ''[[Washington Times]]'', ''[[Insight on the News]]'', and ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.

Bush]], and his 2004 book ''Bush Country'' called Bush \"the first great leader of the 21st century\". When some conservatives denounced Bush's immigration plan, Podhoretz wrote that Bush's \"efforts on behalf of conservative causes\u2014from faith-based policies to stem-cell research to a strict-constructionist judiciary to entitlement reform and massive tax cuts\u2014have all fallen down the memory hole\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NGJkMWM2MmExZDZkYTI2MmFmNTZiODQ3MjNjNmQwYzA= |title=The Inability to Stomach Disagreement |magazine=National Review Online |author=John Podhoretz |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=September 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806092940/http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NGJkMWM2MmExZDZkYTI2MmFmNTZiODQ3MjNjNmQwYzA%3D |archivedate=August 6, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n====Israel====\nPodhoretz is emphatic in his defense of [[Israel]] in its conflicts with its [[Arab]] neighbors.

In his book, ''Bush Country'', he wrote, \"The natural terrorist hunger to acquire WMDs, and Saddam Hussein's desire to humiliate the United States, combined to make Iraq a new kind of threat to America and the world.\" In a July 25, 2006 column for the ''New York Post'' that discussed the Israel-Lebanon conflict, Podhoretz advocated a more Machiavellian policy in Iraq, writing: \"What if the tactical mistake we made in Iraq was that we didn't kill enough Sunnis in the early going to intimidate them and make them so afraid of us they would go along with anything?

Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the [[Bronze Age]]: [[Ammon]], [[Moab]] and [[Edom]]. Later rulers include the [[Nabataean Kingdom]], the [[Roman Empire]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] against the Ottomans in 1916 during [[World War I]], the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire was partitioned]] by Britain and France. The [[Emirate of Transjordan]] was [[Establishment of the Emirate of Transjordan|established in 1921]] by the [[Hashemite]], then [[Emir]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]], and the emirate became a British [[protectorate]]. In 1946, Jordan became an independent state officially known as the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan'', but was renamed in 1949 to the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan'' after the country [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|captured]] the [[West Bank]] during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in [[Six-Day War|1967]]. Jordan renounced its claim to the territory in [[Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank|1988]], and became one of two Arab states to sign a [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty|peace treaty]] with [[Israel]] in 1994.<ref name=\"HKJ\"/> Jordan is a founding member of the [[Arab League]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Co-operation]].

Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the [[Bronze Age]]: [[Ammon]], [[Moab]] and [[Edom]]. Later rulers include the [[Nabataean Kingdom]], the [[Roman Empire]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] against the Ottomans in 1916 during [[World War I]], the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire was partitioned]] by Britain and France. The [[Emirate of Transjordan]] was [[Establishment of the Emirate of Transjordan|established in 1921]] by the [[Hashemite]], then [[Emir]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]], and the emirate became a British [[protectorate]]. In 1946, Jordan became an independent state officially known as the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan'', but was renamed in 1949 to the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan'' after the country [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|captured]] the [[West Bank]] during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in [[Six-Day War|1967]].

The group's third studio album, ''[[Beautiful Death (Slaves album)|Beautiful Death]]'' was released on February 16, 2018. An acoustic EP called \"Revision\" was released on January 18, 2019.\n\nThe following Thursday, January 24, 2019, in a message posted on the band's official Twitter account, Slaves announced that they had removed Jonny Craig from the band.\n\nThe message stated, in part, \u201cWe all have struggles in our daily life, but for some, those struggles are personally and physically dangerous. It is no secret that Jonny has battled with addiction in his personal life, sometimes those battles are won, and most recently lost. It's also unfair for a band to rely on someone who just can't rely on themselves. Addiction is a disease, and we hope Jonny gets the help that he needs. Unfortunately, Jonny chose his addiction over the band a left them high & dry while checking in for their international flight while he boarded a plane back home.\u201d <ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.twitter.com/SLAVESOFFICIAL/status/1088408995474358272|title=Twitter|website=mobile.twitter.com|accessdate=February 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview, Craig proceeded to describe himself as an atheist with a Christian background especially in music. He states that all of his music is soulful and has some kind of meaning mainly because his music career began as a child singing gospel music with his church/school.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8EXHNhd234 |title=Exclusive Interview: JONNY CRAIG |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref> Jonny Craig gives all credit for his musical talent to his grandmother (Ruth Lyons) who he says, \"taught me everything I know about music, she was super Christian, super gospel. Her husband was a preacher. She taught me everything I know about music and despite the fact that I may not believe in her beliefs, I believe in what she taught me.\"<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nCraig is inspired by [[soul music]], mainly the artists [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Boyz II Men]], and [[Craig David]]. He has also mentioned [[Motown]] acts and the band [[Mewithoutyou]] as influences.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fuckyeahjonnycraig.tumblr.com/post/205199287/to-say-jonny-craig-has-been-busy-would-be-an |title=fuck yeah, jonny craig |website=Fuckyeahjonnycraig.tumblr.com |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}</ref> Craig has performed live covers of the songs \"[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]\" by [[Justin Timberlake]], \"[[Fuck You (Cee Lo Green song)|Fuck You]]\" by [[Cee Lo Green]]\n\n''Hollywood Music Magazine'' stated of Craig, \"The guy's a legend and if you've yet to hear him sing you have been missing out.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodmusicmagazine.com/whoshot/albumreviews/jonny-craig-album-review/ |title=Jonny Craig \"Album Review\" |publisher=Hollywood Music Magazine |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn a 2013 acoustic set with music magazine ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', Johnny Craig explained the story behind his single \"Children of Divorce.\" Craig said his then girlfriend had become pregnant, and after an admission by Craig months later that he didn't love her, she left. He said he never heard from her again and was unable to see his child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/acoustic_story_jonny_craig_children_of_divorce/|title=Acoustic Story: Jonny Craig, \"Children Of Divorce\"|date=2013-05-22|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref>\n\n===Internet scam and drug-related issues===\nIn February 2011, several of Craig's fans accused him of being involved in an internet scam. According to the alleged victims, Craig would claim to be selling a used [[MacBook]] through his Twitter account. After accepting an online payment on average between [[USD|US$]]600 and $800 for the product from at least 16 individuals, Craig was reported to have discontinued communication with the buyers, and no MacBooks were ever distributed. He initially denied the accusations and claimed that his Twitter had been hacked and he had no involvement.<ref name=\"meb-breaking-story\"/> However, the following week it was announced that Craig had dropped off his current tour in Emarosa with Chiodos to enter [[drug detoxification|detox]] in order to treat his ongoing battles with [[heroin addiction]]. Rise Records and the Artery Foundation assumed financial responsibility for the internet scam and intend to reimburse anyone who had been victimized. [[Tilian Pearson]], formerly of [[Tides of Man]], substituted for Craig during his absence from [[Emarosa]].<ref name=\"altpress-rehab\"/> A public apology was issued after his detox treatment was completed on March 8, 2011.<ref name=\"altpress-apology\"/>\n\nIn October 2011, Craig was jailed for two counts of possession of narcotics, two counts of possession of drug paraphernalia, and one count of [[failure to appear]] on a felony charge with bail set at US$15,000. As a result of this incident, Dance Gavin Dance cancelled their upcoming tour and went on hiatus.<ref name=\"altpress-narcoticscharges\"/><ref name=\"noisecreep-arrested\"/> Craig was released from jail a few weeks later and was scheduled to enter a court-ordered rehabilitation facility. His follow-up hearing was scheduled for April 30, 2012.<ref name=\"altpress-jailrelease\"/> Dance Gavin Dance went on with their tour as planned but without Craig. He completed a 30-day court-ordered detox and was released March 30, 2012. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn April 2, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2014/04/02/news/jonny-craig-slaves-etc-fends-off-new-drug-use-accusations |title=Jonny Craig (Slaves, Etc.)

Craig addressed the issue in a now-deleted video where he took a drug test on screen. He is quoted saying, \"just woke up to a nice surprise from the ex. So I'm headed right down to the office to prove to you guys without a doubt I'm not using and that those videos are old.

So I'm headed right down to the office to prove to you guys without a doubt I'm not using and that those videos are old. She's crossed a line and needs to get it through her head that this isn't the way you deal with someone not loving you anymore. So let's go!

He defined the thought process, and how it reaches the status of conviction or concepts. He discussed the internal working of thoughts, convictions, and concepts in shaping the ''Nafs'' (emotions and sentiments), delving into the internal workings of how people reach conclusions, and the psychology behind the process derives itself from Taqiuddin al-Nabhani's roots in non-Ascetic legalistic Sufism from his first teacher and maternal grandfather Ismail al-Nabhani.\n\nAl-Nabhani's definitions of thought have been used in the study of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and information processing research discussed in the Addison-Wesley published book \"Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine (Systems Programming Series)\" and used in [https://www.lsbu.ac.uk London South Bank University]'s information systems department.\n\nAfter many philosophical discussions on the nature of thoughts and emotions, Nabhani concludes that the only way to bring about change is through discussion, refutation, and revival of the relevant thoughts and emotions. It is from this philosophical basis that he argued that force does not work to change peoples' ideas. He also argued that a decline in Muslims' mental, emotional and conceptual lives led to the decline of Muslim culture and the eventual destruction of the Caliphate. He believed the first major step in the decline of Muslim culture was confusion about and conflict with new foreign ideas, mainly Greek, Persian & eastern philosophy.\n\nHe argued that the Islamic world did not know how to tackle and contextualize these ideas because they became insular and complacent instead of preserving Islamic thought and philosophy and keeping it relevant to a world in flux. The heavy emphasis on pinpointing, defining and changing peoples thoughts, convictions<ref>{{Citation|title=Conviction|date=2020-02-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conviction&oldid=939735990|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>, or emotions via stronger thoughts, diagnosis, and refutation of the process an individual uses to reach their particular 'incorrect' view, is the method of Hizb ut-Tahrir's argumentation on almost every issue.\n\n===Faith vs. rational belief===\nNabhani claimed that Islam is founded on rational belief and not blind faith, being very similar to Ghazali's Kalam Argument. However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after ''Aqeeda'' (belief) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the 'mind' of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (not that of the [[Mu'tazili]]), but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni in his book<ref>{{Citation|title=Al-Juwayni|date=2020-02-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Juwayni&oldid=941173543|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>, contrary to the common western notion of rationalism. He tried to outline materialist arguments and axioms to prove that one unlimited creator of the universe, God ([[Allah]]) can be proven by rational deduction. He believed that the dependency of, and limited physical nature of every tangible thing within human perception point ultimately to an unlimited creator that is beyond need and dependency, an Absolute Infinite.\n\n==Books==\n*''Saving Palestine'' - 1950<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html Sheikh Muhammad Taqiuddin al-Nabhani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819200236/http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html |date=2010-08-19 }}, [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].</ref>\n*''The Message of the Arabs'' - 1950\n*''The System for Society'' - 1950\n*''The Ruling System in Islam'' - 1953\n*''[[The Economic System In Islam]]'' - 1953\n*''The Social System in Islam'' -1953\n*''The Party Structure'' -1953\n*''The Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic State'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic Personality'' (in three volumes) - 1960\n*''Political Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1969\n*''Political View of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1972\n*''Introduction to the Constitution or the Reasons That Make it Obligatory'' - 1963\n*''The Khilafah'' - 1967\n*''Presence of Mind'' - 1976\n*''A Burning Call to the Muslims from Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1965\n*''Thinking'' - 1973\n*''The Jurisprudence of Prayer''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n |magazine    = Al-Waie Magazine\n |issue       = 234-235\n |date        = August\u2013September 2006\n |language    = Arabic\n |title       = \u0628\u0632\u0648\u063a \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649: \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\n |url         = http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209002225/http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |archivedate = 2015-02-09\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n |title       = An-Nabhani: Palestinian Intellectual\n |work        = [[Islamic Da'wah Foundation Malaysia]]\n |url         = http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219055210/http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |archivedate = 2010-12-19\n}}\n* {{Citation |last=Watt|first=Montgomery|title=The Faith and Practice of Al-Ghazali (Translation of al-Munqid min al-Dalal)|year=2004|place=Oxford|publisher=OneWorld Publications}}\n* {{Citation |last=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=The System of Islam Nidham al-Islam|year=2002|publication-place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Thought al-Tafkeer|year=2004|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Islamic Personality al-Shaksiyyah al-Islamiyyah|year=2005|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nabhani, Taqiuddin}}\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Arab people in British Palestine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian Islamists]]\n[[Category:Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir]]\n[[Category:Al-Azhar University alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n'''Kamal al-Din al-Nabhani''' (January 3, 1929 \u2013 December 31, 2006) was one of the founders of the [[Islamist]] political party [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and was the son of Sheikh [[Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani]].\n\n== Early life ==\nKamal al-Din al-Nabhani was born on January 3, 1929, in [[Beirut, Lebanon]].\n\n== Thought ==\n\n=== Philosophy and theology ===\nIn his books 'Thought' and 'System of Islam 2' (based on the work of his father [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]]), Nabhani placed heavy emphasis on discussing modes and models of the psychology behind human thought and its concepts.

He believed the first major step in the decline of Muslim culture was confusion about and conflict with new foreign ideas, mainly Greek, Persian & eastern philosophy.\n\nHe argued that the Islamic world did not know how to tackle and contextualize these ideas because they became insular and complacent instead of preserving Islamic thought and philosophy and keeping it relevant to a world in flux. The heavy emphasis on pinpointing, defining and changing peoples thoughts, convictions<ref>{{Citation|title=Conviction|date=2020-02-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conviction&oldid=939735990|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>, or emotions via stronger thoughts, diagnosis, and refutation of the process an individual uses to reach their particular 'incorrect' view, is the method of Hizb ut-Tahrir's argumentation on almost every issue.\n\n===Faith vs. rational belief===\nNabhani claimed that Islam is founded on rational belief and not blind faith, being very similar to Ghazali's Kalam Argument. However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after ''Aqeeda'' (belief) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the 'mind' of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (not that of the [[Mu'tazili]]), but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni in his book<ref>{{Citation|title=Al-Juwayni|date=2020-02-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Juwayni&oldid=941173543|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>, contrary to the common western notion of rationalism. He tried to outline materialist arguments and axioms to prove that one unlimited creator of the universe, God ([[Allah]]) can be proven by rational deduction. He believed that the dependency of, and limited physical nature of every tangible thing within human perception point ultimately to an unlimited creator that is beyond need and dependency, an Absolute Infinite.\n\n==Books==\n*''Saving Palestine'' - 1950<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html Sheikh Muhammad Taqiuddin al-Nabhani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819200236/http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html |date=2010-08-19 }}, [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].</ref>\n*''The Message of the Arabs'' - 1950\n*''The System for Society'' - 1950\n*''The Ruling System in Islam'' - 1953\n*''[[The Economic System In Islam]]'' - 1953\n*''The Social System in Islam'' -1953\n*''The Party Structure'' -1953\n*''The Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic State'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic Personality'' (in three volumes) - 1960\n*''Political Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1969\n*''Political View of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1972\n*''Introduction to the Constitution or the Reasons That Make it Obligatory'' - 1963\n*''The Khilafah'' - 1967\n*''Presence of Mind'' - 1976\n*''A Burning Call to the Muslims from Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1965\n*''Thinking'' - 1973\n*''The Jurisprudence of Prayer''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n |magazine    = Al-Waie Magazine\n |issue       = 234-235\n |date        = August\u2013September 2006\n |language    = Arabic\n |title       = \u0628\u0632\u0648\u063a \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649: \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\n |url         = http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209002225/http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |archivedate = 2015-02-09\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n |title       = An-Nabhani: Palestinian Intellectual\n |work        = [[Islamic Da'wah Foundation Malaysia]]\n |url         = http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219055210/http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |archivedate = 2010-12-19\n}}\n* {{Citation |last=Watt|first=Montgomery|title=The Faith and Practice of Al-Ghazali (Translation of al-Munqid min al-Dalal)|year=2004|place=Oxford|publisher=OneWorld Publications}}\n* {{Citation |last=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=The System of Islam Nidham al-Islam|year=2002|publication-place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Thought al-Tafkeer|year=2004|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Islamic Personality al-Shaksiyyah al-Islamiyyah|year=2005|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nabhani, Taqiuddin}}\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Arab people in British Palestine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian Islamists]]\n[[Category:Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir]]\n[[Category:Al-Azhar University alumni]]\n", "name_user": "Azan Numberdar", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal_al-Din_al-Nabhani"}
