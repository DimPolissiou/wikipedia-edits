Because of this tendency, they decline to prosecute nearly a quarter of all cases. For those that go to trial, Japanese prosecutors hold a conviction record of about 98%.

In the battle, [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and the Royalists defeated a Parliamentarian army commanded by [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]]. \n\n==Background==\nAfter his victory at the [[First Battle of Middlewich]] on 13 March 1643, Parliamentarian General Brereton dominated and controlled much of Cheshire County. With his headquarters at Nantwich, Brereton and the Parliamentarians ruled the eastern and central portions of the county, approximately two-thirds of the region. The Royalists held the western portions of the county including the River Dee Valley and the important port city and stronghold of [[Chester]].<ref>Gaunt, p. 8.</ref>. In the summer of 1643, Brereton began to conduct military operations with the objective of capturing Chester and taking complete control of Cheshire.<ref>Gaunt, pp. 19-24.</ref> In late October, Parliamentarian troops under the command of Brereton and Sir Thomas Myddleton raided Wales and temporarily isolated Chester.<ref>Barratt, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe Royalists soon became concerned about the Parliamentarian activities and in the fall of 1643, [[Charles I of England |King Charles]] took steps to regain control of Cheshire for the Royalists. First, in October King Charles rearranged military commands, appointed John Byron [[Baron Byron]], and gave him command of all Royalist forces in Cheshire and Lancashire. Then in November, King Charles supplemented the Royalist forces in Cheshire by bringing home part of the English and Welsh armies that had been sent in 1641-1642 to Ireland to deal with the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|Irish Catholic Rebellion]].<ref>Gaunt, p. 20.</ref> Given a new command and responsibility, Lord Byron planned to capture the Parliamentarian headquarters at Nantwich, clear the enemy from Cheshire, and then address Lancashire.<ref name=Barratt18 >Barratt, p. 18.</ref>\n\n==Byron\u2019s Cheshire campaign==\nOn 12 December, Lord Byron set out from Chester with 4,000 foot and 1,000 horse and began a brutal campaign roaming Cheshire; easily sweeping aside Parliamentarian forces; and capturing numerous strongholds.<ref name=Barratt18/>\n\nBefore Lord Byron caught up with Brereton at Middleton on 26 December, his most notable incursions in Cheshire included the capture of the formidable Beeston Castle through distraction and treachery on 13 December and the massacre of 12 civilians including the schoolmaster at Bartholmley on 23 December.<ref>Gaunt, pp. 20-22.</ref>\n\n==The Battle at Middlewich==\nOn Christmas while Lord Byron and his Royalist forces were bivouacked at Sandbach Heath, Royalist sympathizers from Middlewich informed him that Brereton's Cheshire Parliamentary force was deployed in and around Middlewich. Also at that time, Brereton's spies reported to him of a skirmish with Royalist troops at Sandbach.<ref name=Fletcher >Fletcher.</ref>\n\nUpon receiving information about each other's positions, both military leaders mobilized their forces for battle. Lord Byron readied his troops and prepared to march the seven kilometers to Middlewich and attack on 26 December. Brereton joined his troops with a 1,500 man Parliamentary force commanded by Colonel [[Alexander Rigby]] and deployed the Parliamentary forces along Booth Lane with muskets and pike men in the hedges and the ditches; the cannons in the middle of the lane; and the cavalry flanked on either side.<ref name=Fletcher/>\n\nAfter the fighting commenced on 26 December it resulted in a hard fought hand-to-hand battle that initially lasted one hour. Even though Lord Byron had superiority in numbers he found that he could not break through the Parliamentarian\u2019s defenses. Lord Byron then changed tactics and attacked by means of a cavalry charge followed by an infantry charge under the command of Colonel Richard Gibson. This second mass attack reversed Brereton's fortunes causing his men to fall back, scatter, and seek refuge in houses and the church.<ref name=Fletcher/>\n\nWhen the Parliamentarians scattered, the battle was over. In the lane were 200 dead Parliamentarians along with a great many wounded.<ref name=Fletcher/><ref>Wallace, p. 35.</ref> Recognizing that there was little chance of turning the tide of battle, Brereton organized a hasty retreat leading the remainder of the Parliamentarian troops northwest to the safety of Manchester.<ref>Barratt, p. 19.</ref>   \n\n==Aftermath==\nThe town of Middleton was left to attend to the wounded and bury the dead. A large portion of town suffered battle damage including agricultural fields, houses, shops and the church. Food stores were depleted and valuables stolen. Shortly afterward as the town struggled to recover, the populace was struck by an second occurrence of the plague.<ref name=Fletcher/>\n\nIn Cheshire without Brereton\u2019s army in the field, Lord Byron moved quickly to wipe out the remaining Parliamentarians. In late December and the early weeks of the new year, Lord Byron captured the Parliamentarian strongholds of Northwich, Crewe-house, Doddington-hall and Acton-church.<ref name=Fletcher/><ref>Ormerod, p. 205.</ref>\n\nLord Byron then set his objective to the conquest of Parliamentarian headquarters at Nantwich and attacked on 18 January 1644.<ref name=Fletcher/><ref>Barratt, p. 20.</ref> Nantwich, however, was well fortified and well-armed with a garrison of 1,500 Parliamentarians. Lord Byron attacked but was repelled with considerable loss. Undaunted, Lord Byron isolated Nantwich and began a siege which would continue until Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]] defeated him and relieved the Parliamentarians at the [[Battle of Nantwich]] on 25 January 1644.<ref>Barratt, pp. 19-20.</ref>\n\nIn retrospect, the Royalist victories in Cheshire in December 1643 including the victory at Middlewich were only temporary. Fairfax\u2019s victory at Nantwich at the end of January ultimately thwarted King Charles\u2019 plan to control Cheshire, leaving the Parliamentarians once again largely in control of the county.\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::{{cite book |last1=Barratt |first1=John |title=The Battle of Marston Moor 1644 |date=2008 |publisher=The History Press |location=Port Stroud|isbn=978-0-7524-2694-5}}\n::{{cite web |title=Middlewich in the Civil War |url=https://www.middlewich-heritage.org.uk/civil-war/ |website=Middlewich Heritage Trust |publisher=Middlewich Heritage Trust |editor1-last=Fletcher |editor1-first=Kerry |accessdate=17 April 2020 |date=2020}}\n::{{cite journal |last1=Gaunt |first1=Professor Peter |title=Four Churches and a River: The Civil War in Cheshire |journal=Cromwelliana |date=2008 |issue=Series 2 Number 5 |page=19-28 |url=http://www.olivercromwell.org/Cromwelliana_Archive/2008.pdf |accessdate=17 April 2020}}\n::{{cite book |last1=Ormerod |first1=George |title=The History of the County Palatine and City of Chester - Volume 1 |date=1819 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofcountyp00orme/page/n9/mode/2up|publisher=Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, and Jones |location=London}}\n::{{cite book |last1=Wallace |first1=David C. |title=Twenty-Two Turbulent Years 1639 - 1661 |date=2013 |publisher=Fast-Print Publishing |location=Great Brirain |isbn=9781780356600 |page=35}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Second Battle Of Middlewich}}\n[[Category:Middlewich]]\n[[Category:1643 in England|Middlewich]]\n[[Category:Battles of the English Civil Wars|Middlewich, First, 1642]]\n[[Category:History of Cheshire|Middlewich]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1643]]\n[[Category:17th century in Cheshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{coord|53.193|-2.445|display=title|region:GB_scale:10000}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Second Battle of Middlewich\n| partof      = the [[First English Civil War]]\n| date        = 26 December 1643\n| place       = [[Middlewich]], England\n| result      = Royalist victory\n| combatant1  = {{flagicon image|Royal Standard of England (1603\u20131689).svg|size=22px}} [[Cavalier|Royalists]]\n| combatant2  = [[File:Flag_of_England.svg|22px]] [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]\n| commander1  = [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron| Lord Byron]]<br>Richard Gibson\n| commander2  = [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]]<br>[[Alexander Rigby]]\n}}\n\n{{Campaignbox First English Civil War|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Location map many | Cheshire | relief=yes | width=305\n| caption= Cheshire County and Middlewich \n| lat1_deg = 53.19\n| lon1_deg = -2.89\n| position1=top\n| label1   = Chester\n| lat2_deg = 53.192\n| lon2_deg = -2.443\n| label2   = Middlewich\n| lat3_deg = 53.067\n| lon3_deg = -2.522\n| label3   = Nantwich\n| lat5_deg = 53.1277\n| lon5_deg = -2.6913\n|position5 = top\n| label5   = Beeston Castle\n| lat6_deg = 53.259\n| lon6_deg = -2.518\n| label6   = Northwich\n| lat7_deg = 53.099\n| lon7_deg = -2.44\n| label7   = Crewe\n| lat8_deg = 53.027\n| lon8_deg = -2.438\n| label8   = Doddington\n| lat9_deg = 53.073117\n| lon9_deg = -2.548588\n| position9 = left\n| label9   = Acton-church\n| lat10_deg = 53.479444\n| lon10_deg = -2.245278\n| label10   = Manchester\n}}\n\nThe '''Second Battle of Middlewich''' was a battle of the [[First English Civil War]] that took place on 26 December 1643 in [[Cheshire]] County.

(Schr\u00f6dinger)|What is Life?]]'' by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]]-laureate [[physicist]] [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] stimulated further research in the field. In his book, Schr\u00f6dinger originally stated that life feeds on negative entropy, or [[negentropy]] as it is sometimes called, but in a later edition corrected himself in response to complaints and stated that the true source is [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. More recent work has restricted the discussion to [[Gibbs free energy]] because biological processes on Earth normally occur at a constant temperature and pressure, such as in the atmosphere or at the bottom of the ocean, but not across both over short periods of time for individual organisms.\n\nIdeas about the relationship between entropy and living organisms have inspired hypotheses and speculations in many contexts, including [[psychology]], [[information theory]], the [[origin of life]], and the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]].\n\n==Early views==\nIn 1863, [[Rudolf Clausius]] published his noted memoir ''On the Concentration of Rays of Heat and Light, and on the Limits of Its Action'', wherein he outlined a preliminary relationship, based on his own work and that of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]], between living processes and his newly developed concept of entropy.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Building on this, one of the first to speculate on a possible thermodynamic perspective of organic [[evolution]] was the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. In 1875, building on the works of Clausius and Kelvin, Boltzmann reasoned:\n\n{{quote|The general struggle for existence of animate beings is not a struggle for raw materials \u2013 these, for organisms, are air, water and soil, all abundantly available \u2013 nor for energy which exists in plenty in any body in the form of heat, but a ''struggle for [negative] entropy'', which becomes available through the transition of energy from the ''hot sun'' to the ''cold earth''.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Boltzmann | first = Ludwig  | title = The second law of thermodynamics (Theoretical physics and philosophical problems)| publisher = Springer-Verlag New York, LLC | year = 1974 | isbn = 978-90-277-0250-0}}</ref>}}\n<!--Anyone know what this image is supposed to be illustrating?-->\n<!--[[File:Solar-gradient.jpg|650px|center|thumb|The [[solar system]] from a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic systems]] perspective.]]-->\n\nIn 1876, American civil engineer [[Richard Sears McCulloh]], in his ''Treatise on the Mechanical Theory of Heat and its Application to the Steam-Engine'', which was an early thermodynamics textbook, states, after speaking about the laws of the physical world, that \"there are none that are established on a firmer basis than the two general propositions of [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] and [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]]; which constitute the fundamental laws of our subject.\" McCulloh then goes on to show that these two laws may be combined in a single expression as follows:\n\n::<math> S = \\int { dQ \\over \\tau } </math>\n\nwhere\n\n::<math> S = </math> entropy\n::<math> dQ = </math> a differential amount of [[heat]] passed into a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic system]]\n::<math> \\tau = </math> [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]\n\nMcCulloh then declares that the applications of these two laws, i.e. what are currently known as the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]], are innumerable:\n\n{{quote|When we reflect how generally physical phenomena are connected with thermal changes and relations, it at once becomes obvious that there are few, if any, branches of [[natural science]] which are not more or less dependent upon the great truths under consideration.

His first example is [[physiology]], wherein he states that \u201cthe body of an animal, not less than a steamer, or a locomotive, is truly a [[heat engine]], and the consumption of food in the one is precisely analogous to the burning of fuel in the other; in both, the [[chemical reaction|chemical process]] is the same: that called [[combustion]].\u201d He then incorporates a discussion of [[Antoine Lavoisier]]\u2019s theory of respiration with cycles of digestion, excretion, and perspiration, but then contradicts Lavoisier with recent findings, such as internal heat generated by [[friction]], according to the new [[theory of heat]], which, according to McCulloh, states that the \u201cheat of the body generally and uniformly is diffused instead of being concentrated in the chest\u201d. McCulloh then gives an example of the second law, where he states that friction, especially in the smaller blood vessels, must develop heat. Undoubtedly, some fraction of the heat generated by animals is produced in this way. He then asks: \u201cbut whence the expenditure of energy causing that friction, and which must be itself accounted for?\"\n\nTo answer this question he turns to the mechanical theory of heat and goes on to loosely outline how the heart is what he calls a \u201cforce-pump\u201d, which receives blood and sends it to every part of the body, as discovered by [[William Harvey]], and which \u201cacts like the piston of an engine and is dependent upon and consequently due to the cycle of nutrition and excretion which sustains physical or organic life.\u201d It is likely that McCulloh modeled parts of this argument on that of the famous [[Carnot cycle]]. In conclusion, he summarizes his first and second law argument as such:\n\n{{quote|Everything physical being subject to the [[conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]], it follows that no physiological action can take place except with expenditure of energy derived from food; also, that an animal performing [[mechanical work]] must from the same quantity of food generate less heat than one abstaining from exertion, the difference being precisely the [[Mechanical equivalent of heat|heat equivalent]] of that of work.<ref name=\"McCulloch1876\"/>{{Rp|p. 270}}}}\n\n==Negative entropy==\nIn the 1944 book ''[[What is Life? (Schr\u00f6dinger)|What is Life?]]'', Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]], who in 1933 had won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], theorized that life \u2013 contrary to the general tendency dictated by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which states that the entropy of an isolated system tends to increase \u2013 decreases or keeps constant its entropy by feeding on negative entropy.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Schr\u00f6dinger | first = Erwin  | title = What is Life \u2013 the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1944 | isbn = 978-0-521-42708-1| title-link = What is Life \u2013 the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell  }}</ref> The problem of organization in living systems increasing despite the second law is known as the Schr\u00f6dinger paradox.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schneider|first1=Eric D.|last2=Sagan|first2=Dorion|title=Into the Cool: Energy Flow Thermodynamics and Life|year=2005|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, United States|pages=15}}</ref> In his note to Chapter 6 of ''What is Life?'', however, Schr\u00f6dinger remarks on his usage of the term negative entropy:\n\n{{quote|Let me say first, that if I had been catering for them [physicists] alone I should have let the discussion turn on ''[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]'' instead. It is the more familiar notion in this context. But this highly technical term seemed linguistically too near to ''[[energy]]'' for making the average reader alive to the contrast between the two things.}}\n\nThis, Schr\u00f6dinger argues, is what differentiates life from other forms of the organization of [[matter]]. In this direction, although life's dynamics may be argued to go against the tendency of the second law, life does not in any way conflict with or invalidate this law, because the principle that entropy can only increase or remain constant applies only to a [[closed system]] which is adiabatically isolated, meaning no heat can enter or leave, and the physical and chemical processes which make life possible do not occur in adiabatic isolation, i.e. living systems are open systems. Whenever a system can exchange either heat or matter with its environment, an entropy decrease of that system is entirely compatible with the second law.<ref name=\"Denbigh\">The common justification for this argument, for example, according to renowned chemical engineer Kenneth Denbigh in his 1955 book ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', is that \"living organisms are [[open system (systems theory)|open]] to their environment and can build up at the expense of foodstuffs which they take in and degrade.\"</ref> \n\nSchr\u00f6dinger asked the question: \"How does the living organism avoid decay?\" The obvious answer is: \"By eating, drinking, breathing and (in the case of plants) assimilating.\" While energy from nutrients is necessary to sustain an organism's order, Schr\u00f6dinger also presciently postulated the existence of other molecules equally necessary for creating the order observed in living organisms: \"An organism's astonishing gift of concentrating a stream of order on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos \u2013 of drinking orderliness from a suitable environment \u2013 seems to be connected with the presence of the aperiodic solids...\" We now know that this \"aperiodic\" crystal is [[DNA]], and that its irregular arrangement is a form of information. \"The DNA in the cell nucleus contains the master copy of the software, in duplicate. This software seems to control by specifying an algorithm, or set of instructions, for creating and maintaining the entire organism containing the cell.\"<ref>Nelson, P. (2004).

Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-4372-8}}</ref>\n\nDNA and other macromolecules determine an organism's life cycle: birth, growth, maturity, decline, and death. Nutrition is necessary but not sufficient to account for growth in size, as [[genetics]] is the governing factor. At some point, virtually all organisms normally decline and die even while remaining in environments that contain sufficient nutrients to sustain life. The controlling factor must be internal and not nutrients or sunlight acting as causal exogenous variables. Organisms inherit the ability to create unique and complex biological structures; it is unlikely for those capabilities to be reinvented or to be taught to each generation. Therefore, DNA must be operative as the prime cause in this characteristic as well. Applying Boltzmann's perspective of the second law, the change of state from a more probable, less ordered, and higher entropy arrangement to one of less probability, more order, and lower entropy (as is seen in biological ordering) calls for a function like that known of DNA. DNA's apparent information-processing function provides a resolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger paradox posed by life and the entropy requirement of the second law.<ref>Peterson, Jacob. \"Understanding the Thermodynamics of Biological Order\".

The Gibbs free energy is given by:\n\n::<math> \\Delta G \\equiv \\Delta H-T \\, \\Delta S </math>\n\nwhere\n\n::<math> G = </math> Gibbs free energy\n::<math> H = </math> [[enthalpy]] passed into a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic system]]\n::<math> T = </math> [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]\n::<math> S = </math> entropy\n\nThe minimization of the Gibbs free energy is a form of the [[principle of minimum energy]], which follows from the [[entropy maximization principle]] for closed systems. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy equation, in modified form, can be utilized for [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] when [[chemical potential]] terms are included in the energy balance equation. In a popular 1982 textbook, ''Principles of Biochemistry'', noted American biochemist [[Albert L. Lehninger|Albert Lehninger]] argued that the order produced within cells as they grow and divide is more than compensated for by the disorder they create in their surroundings in the course of growth and division. In short, according to Lehninger, \"Living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as heat and entropy.\"<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lehninger | first = Albert | title = Principles of Biochemistry, 2nd Ed. | publisher = Worth Publishers | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-87901-711-8 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879017118 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, according to the chemist [[John Scales Avery|John Avery]], from his 2003 book ''Information Theory and Evolution'', we find a presentation in which the phenomenon of life, including its origin and evolution, as well as human cultural evolution, has its basis in the background of [[thermodynamics]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[information theory]].

The second law of thermodynamics can be written as an equation of motion to describe evolution, showing how natural selection and the principle of least action can be connected by expressing natural selection in terms of chemical thermodynamics. In this view, evolution explores possible paths to level differences in energy densities and so increase entropy most rapidly. Thus, an organism serves as an energy transfer mechanism, and beneficial mutations allow successive organisms to transfer more energy within their environment.<ref name=\"evo2lot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news137679868.html|title=Evolution as Described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics|author=Lisa Zyga|date=11 August 2008|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0178 |title=Natural selection for least action |author1=Kaila, V.

The problem is discussed within the context of [[abiogenesis]], implying gradual pre-Darwinian chemical evolution. In 1924, [[Alexander Oparin]] suggested that sufficient energy for generating early lifeforms from non-living molecules was provided in a \"primordial soup\". The Belgian scientist [[Ilya Prigogine]] was awarded with a Nobel Prize in 1977 for an analysis in this area. A related topic is the probability that life would emerge, which has been discussed in several studies, for example by [[Russell Doolittle]].<ref>Russell Doolittle, \"The Probability and Origin of Life\" in ''Scientists Confront Creationism'' (1984) Ed.

As entropy allows the quantification of the degree of disorder in a system, any envisioned lifeform must have a higher degree of order than its immediate supporting environment. These authors showed that by using fractal mathematics analysis alone, they could readily quantify the degree of structural complexity difference (and thus entropy) of living processes as distinct entities separate from their similar abiotic surroundings. This approach may allow the future detection of unknown forms of life both in the Solar System and on recently discovered exoplanets based on nothing more than entropy differentials of complementary datasets (morphology, coloration, temperature, pH, isotopic composition, etc.).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vega-Mart\u00ednez|first=Cristian|last2=Azua-Bustos|first2=Armando|date=2013|title=The potential for detecting 'life as we don't know it' by fractal complexity analysis|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=314\u2013320|doi=10.1017/S1473550413000177|issn=1475-3006}}</ref>\n\n==Entropy in psychology==\nThe notion of entropy as disorder has been transferred from thermodynamics to [[psychology]] by Polish [[psychiatrist]] [[Antoni K\u0119pi\u0144ski]], who admitted being inspired by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.<ref name=\"kepinski1972c\">{{cite book|last1=K\u0119pi\u0144ski|first1=Antoni|title=Rhythm of life (in Polish)|date=1972|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|location=Krak\u00f3w}}</ref> In his theoretical framework devised to explain [[mental disorder]]s (the [[information metabolism]] theory), the difference between living organisms and other systems was explained as the ability to maintain order.

In his book, Schr\u00f6dinger originally stated that life feeds on negative entropy, or [[negentropy]] as it is sometimes called, but in a later edition corrected himself in response to complaints and stated that the true source is [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. More recent work has restricted the discussion to [[Gibbs free energy]] because biological processes on Earth normally occur at a constant temperature and pressure, such as in the atmosphere or at the bottom of the ocean, but not across both over short periods of time for individual organisms.\n\nIdeas about the relationship between entropy and living organisms have inspired hypotheses and speculations in many contexts, including [[psychology]], [[information theory]], the [[origin of life]], and the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]].\n\n==Early views==\nIn 1863, [[Rudolf Clausius]] published his noted memoir ''On the Concentration of Rays of Heat and Light, and on the Limits of Its Action'', wherein he outlined a preliminary relationship, based on his own work and that of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]], between living processes and his newly developed concept of entropy.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Building on this, one of the first to speculate on a possible thermodynamic perspective of organic [[evolution]] was the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. In 1875, building on the works of Clausius and Kelvin, Boltzmann reasoned:\n\n{{quote|The general struggle for existence of animate beings is not a struggle for raw materials \u2013 these, for organisms, are air, water and soil, all abundantly available \u2013 nor for energy which exists in plenty in any body in the form of heat, but a ''struggle for [negative] entropy'', which becomes available through the transition of energy from the ''hot sun'' to the ''cold earth''.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Boltzmann | first = Ludwig  | title = The second law of thermodynamics (Theoretical physics and philosophical problems)| publisher = Springer-Verlag New York, LLC | year = 1974 | isbn = 978-90-277-0250-0}}</ref>}}\n<!--Anyone know what this image is supposed to be illustrating?-->\n<!--[[File:Solar-gradient.jpg|650px|center|thumb|The [[solar system]] from a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic systems]] perspective.]]-->\n\nIn 1876, American civil engineer [[Richard Sears McCulloh]], in his ''Treatise on the Mechanical Theory of Heat and its Application to the Steam-Engine'', which was an early thermodynamics textbook, states, after speaking about the laws of the physical world, that \"there are none that are established on a firmer basis than the two general propositions of [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] and [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]]; which constitute the fundamental laws of our subject.\" McCulloh then goes on to show that these two laws may be combined in a single expression as follows:\n\n::<math> S = \\int { dQ \\over \\tau } </math>\n\nwhere\n\n::<math> S = </math> entropy\n::<math> dQ = </math> a differential amount of [[heat]] passed into a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic system]]\n::<math> \\tau = </math> [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]\n\nMcCulloh then declares that the applications of these two laws, i.e. what are currently known as the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]], are innumerable:\n\n{{quote|When we reflect how generally physical phenomena are connected with thermal changes and relations, it at once becomes obvious that there are few, if any, branches of [[natural science]] which are not more or less dependent upon the great truths under consideration. Nor should it, therefore, be a matter of surprise that already, in the short space of time, not yet one generation, elapsed since the [[Theory of heat|mechanical theory of heat]] has been freely adopted, whole branches of physical science have been revolutionized by it.<ref name=\"McCulloch1876\">{{cite book|last=McCulloch|first=Richard Sears|title=Treatise on the mechanical theory of heat and its applications to the steam-engine, etc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96AAAAAAMAAJ|location=New York|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|year=1876}}</ref>{{Rp|p. 267}}}}\n\nMcCulloh gives a few of what he calls the \u201cmore interesting examples\u201d of the application of these laws in extent and utility. His first example is [[physiology]], wherein he states that \u201cthe body of an animal, not less than a steamer, or a locomotive, is truly a [[heat engine]], and the consumption of food in the one is precisely analogous to the burning of fuel in the other; in both, the [[chemical reaction|chemical process]] is the same: that called [[combustion]].\u201d He then incorporates a discussion of [[Antoine Lavoisier]]\u2019s theory of respiration with cycles of digestion, excretion, and perspiration, but then contradicts Lavoisier with recent findings, such as internal heat generated by [[friction]], according to the new [[theory of heat]], which, according to McCulloh, states that the \u201cheat of the body generally and uniformly is diffused instead of being concentrated in the chest\u201d. McCulloh then gives an example of the second law, where he states that friction, especially in the smaller blood vessels, must develop heat. Undoubtedly, some fraction of the heat generated by animals is produced in this way. He then asks: \u201cbut whence the expenditure of energy causing that friction, and which must be itself accounted for?\"\n\nTo answer this question he turns to the mechanical theory of heat and goes on to loosely outline how the heart is what he calls a \u201cforce-pump\u201d, which receives blood and sends it to every part of the body, as discovered by [[William Harvey]], and which \u201cacts like the piston of an engine and is dependent upon and consequently due to the cycle of nutrition and excretion which sustains physical or organic life.\u201d It is likely that McCulloh modeled parts of this argument on that of the famous [[Carnot cycle]]. In conclusion, he summarizes his first and second law argument as such:\n\n{{quote|Everything physical being subject to the [[conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]], it follows that no physiological action can take place except with expenditure of energy derived from food; also, that an animal performing [[mechanical work]] must from the same quantity of food generate less heat than one abstaining from exertion, the difference being precisely the [[Mechanical equivalent of heat|heat equivalent]] of that of work.<ref name=\"McCulloch1876\"/>{{Rp|p. 270}}}}\n\n==Negative entropy==\nIn the 1944 book ''[[What is Life? (Schr\u00f6dinger)|What is Life?]]'', Austrian physicist [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]], who in 1933 had won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], theorized that life \u2013 contrary to the general tendency dictated by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which states that the entropy of an isolated system tends to increase \u2013 decreases or keeps constant its entropy by feeding on negative entropy.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Schr\u00f6dinger | first = Erwin  | title = What is Life \u2013 the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1944 | isbn = 978-0-521-42708-1| title-link = What is Life \u2013 the Physical Aspect of the Living Cell  }}</ref> The problem of organization in living systems increasing despite the second law is known as the Schr\u00f6dinger paradox.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schneider|first1=Eric D.|last2=Sagan|first2=Dorion|title=Into the Cool: Energy Flow Thermodynamics and Life|year=2005|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, United States|pages=15}}</ref> In his note to Chapter 6 of ''What is Life?'', however, Schr\u00f6dinger remarks on his usage of the term negative entropy:\n\n{{quote|Let me say first, that if I had been catering for them [physicists] alone I should have let the discussion turn on ''[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]'' instead. It is the more familiar notion in this context. But this highly technical term seemed linguistically too near to ''[[energy]]'' for making the average reader alive to the contrast between the two things.}}\n\nThis, Schr\u00f6dinger argues, is what differentiates life from other forms of the organization of [[matter]]. In this direction, although life's dynamics may be argued to go against the tendency of the second law, life does not in any way conflict with or invalidate this law, because the principle that entropy can only increase or remain constant applies only to a [[closed system]] which is adiabatically isolated, meaning no heat can enter or leave, and the physical and chemical processes which make life possible do not occur in adiabatic isolation, i.e. living systems are open systems. Whenever a system can exchange either heat or matter with its environment, an entropy decrease of that system is entirely compatible with the second law.<ref name=\"Denbigh\">The common justification for this argument, for example, according to renowned chemical engineer Kenneth Denbigh in his 1955 book ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', is that \"living organisms are [[open system (systems theory)|open]] to their environment and can build up at the expense of foodstuffs which they take in and degrade.\"</ref> \n\nSchr\u00f6dinger asked the question: \"How does the living organism avoid decay?\" The obvious answer is: \"By eating, drinking, breathing and (in the case of plants) assimilating.\" While energy from nutrients is necessary to sustain an organism's order, Schr\u00f6dinger also presciently postulated the existence of other molecules equally necessary for creating the order observed in living organisms: \"An organism's astonishing gift of concentrating a stream of order on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos \u2013 of drinking orderliness from a suitable environment \u2013 seems to be connected with the presence of the aperiodic solids...\" We now know that this \"aperiodic\" crystal is [[DNA]], and that its irregular arrangement is a form of information. \"The DNA in the cell nucleus contains the master copy of the software, in duplicate. This software seems to control by specifying an algorithm, or set of instructions, for creating and maintaining the entire organism containing the cell.\"<ref>Nelson, P. (2004). ''Biological Physics, Energy, Information, Life''. W.H. Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-4372-8}}</ref>\n\nDNA and other macromolecules determine an organism's life cycle: birth, growth, maturity, decline, and death. Nutrition is necessary but not sufficient to account for growth in size, as [[genetics]] is the governing factor. At some point, virtually all organisms normally decline and die even while remaining in environments that contain sufficient nutrients to sustain life. The controlling factor must be internal and not nutrients or sunlight acting as causal exogenous variables. Organisms inherit the ability to create unique and complex biological structures; it is unlikely for those capabilities to be reinvented or to be taught to each generation. Therefore, DNA must be operative as the prime cause in this characteristic as well. Applying Boltzmann's perspective of the second law, the change of state from a more probable, less ordered, and higher entropy arrangement to one of less probability, more order, and lower entropy (as is seen in biological ordering) calls for a function like that known of DNA. DNA's apparent information-processing function provides a resolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger paradox posed by life and the entropy requirement of the second law.<ref>Peterson, Jacob. \"Understanding the Thermodynamics of Biological Order\".

The Gibbs free energy is given by:\n\n::<math> \\Delta G \\equiv \\Delta H-T \\, \\Delta S </math>\n\nwhere\n\n::<math> G = </math> Gibbs free energy\n::<math> H = </math> [[enthalpy]] passed into a [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic system]]\n::<math> T = </math> [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]\n::<math> S = </math> entropy\n\nThe minimization of the Gibbs free energy is a form of the [[principle of minimum energy]], which follows from the [[entropy maximization principle]] for closed systems. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy equation, in modified form, can be utilized for [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] when [[chemical potential]] terms are included in the energy balance equation. In a popular 1982 textbook, ''Principles of Biochemistry'', noted American biochemist [[Albert L. Lehninger|Albert Lehninger]] argued that the order produced within cells as they grow and divide is more than compensated for by the disorder they create in their surroundings in the course of growth and division. In short, according to Lehninger, \"Living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as heat and entropy.\"<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lehninger | first = Albert | title = Principles of Biochemistry, 2nd Ed. | publisher = Worth Publishers | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-87901-711-8 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879017118 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, according to the chemist [[John Scales Avery|John Avery]], from his 2003 book ''Information Theory and Evolution'', we find a presentation in which the phenomenon of life, including its origin and evolution, as well as human cultural evolution, has its basis in the background of [[thermodynamics]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[information theory]]. The (apparent) paradox between the second law of thermodynamics and the high degree of order and complexity produced by living systems, according to Avery, has its resolution \"in the information content of the Gibbs free energy that enters the biosphere from outside sources.\"<ref>{{Cite book| last = Avery | first = John  | title = Information Theory and Evolution | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-981-238-399-0}}</ref> Assuming evolution drives organisms towards higher information content, it is postulated by [[Gregory Chaitin]] that life has properties of high mutual information<ref>{{Cite article| last = Chaitin | first = Gregory  | title = Towards a mathematical definition of Life | publisher = MIT press | pages = 477-498 | year = 1979 | url = http://home.thep.lu.se/~henrik/mnxa09/Chaitin1979.pdf}}</ref>, and by Tamvakis that life can be quantified using information density metrics, a generalisation of the concept of [[Biodiversity]]. <ref>{{Cite article| last = Tamvakis | first = Ioannis  | title = Quantifying life | publisher = ResearchGate | year = 2018 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336878361_Quantifying_Life}}</ref>\n\nIn a study titled \"Natural selection for least action\" published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society A.'', Ville Kaila and Arto Annila of the [[University of Helsinki]] describe how the process of [[natural selection]] responsible for such local increase in order may be mathematically derived directly from the expression of the second law equation for connected non-equilibrium open systems. The second law of thermodynamics can be written as an equation of motion to describe evolution, showing how natural selection and the principle of least action can be connected by expressing natural selection in terms of chemical thermodynamics. In this view, evolution explores possible paths to level differences in energy densities and so increase entropy most rapidly. Thus, an organism serves as an energy transfer mechanism, and beneficial mutations allow successive organisms to transfer more energy within their environment.<ref name=\"evo2lot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news137679868.html|title=Evolution as Described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics|author=Lisa Zyga|date=11 August 2008|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.2008.0178 |title=Natural selection for least action |author1=Kaila, V.

The problem is discussed within the context of [[abiogenesis]], implying gradual pre-Darwinian chemical evolution. In 1924, [[Alexander Oparin]] suggested that sufficient energy for generating early lifeforms from non-living molecules was provided in a \"primordial soup\". The Belgian scientist [[Ilya Prigogine]] was awarded with a Nobel Prize in 1977 for an analysis in this area. A related topic is the probability that life would emerge, which has been discussed in several studies, for example by [[Russell Doolittle]].<ref>Russell Doolittle, \"The Probability and Origin of Life\" in ''Scientists Confront Creationism'' (1984) Ed.

As entropy allows the quantification of the degree of disorder in a system, any envisioned lifeform must have a higher degree of order than its immediate supporting environment. These authors showed that by using fractal mathematics analysis alone, they could readily quantify the degree of structural complexity difference (and thus entropy) of living processes as distinct entities separate from their similar abiotic surroundings. This approach may allow the future detection of unknown forms of life both in the Solar System and on recently discovered exoplanets based on nothing more than entropy differentials of complementary datasets (morphology, coloration, temperature, pH, isotopic composition, etc.).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vega-Mart\u00ednez|first=Cristian|last2=Azua-Bustos|first2=Armando|date=2013|title=The potential for detecting 'life as we don't know it' by fractal complexity analysis|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=314\u2013320|doi=10.1017/S1473550413000177|issn=1475-3006}}</ref>\n\n==Entropy in psychology==\nThe notion of entropy as disorder has been transferred from thermodynamics to [[psychology]] by Polish [[psychiatrist]] [[Antoni K\u0119pi\u0144ski]], who admitted being inspired by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.<ref name=\"kepinski1972c\">{{cite book|last1=K\u0119pi\u0144ski|first1=Antoni|title=Rhythm of life (in Polish)|date=1972|publisher=Wydawnictwo Literackie|location=Krak\u00f3w}}</ref> In his theoretical framework devised to explain [[mental disorder]]s (the [[information metabolism]] theory), the difference between living organisms and other systems was explained as the ability to maintain order.

The reaction requires [[NADH]] and is catalyzed by [[aldose reductase]]. Glucose reduction is the first step of the [[polyol pathway]] of [[glucose metabolism]], and is implicated in multiple diabetic complications.\n\n:[[File:Net reaction of glucose reduction reaction.png|center|left]]\n\nThe mechanism involves a [[tyrosine]] residue in the active site of aldehyde reductase. The hydrogen atom on NADH is transferred to the electrophilic aldehyde carbon atom; electrons on the aldehyde carbon-oxygen double bond are transferred to the oxygen that abstracts the proton on tyrosine side chain to form the hydroxyl group. The role of aldehyde reductase tyrosine phenol group is to serve as a general acid to provide proton to the reduced aldehyde oxygen on glucose.\n\n:[[File:Mechanism of glucose reduction reaction.png|center|left]]Glucose reduction is not the major [[glucose metabolism]] pathway in a normal human body, where the [[Blood sugar|glucose level]] is in the normal range. However, in diabetic patients whose blood glucose level is high, up to 1/3 of their glucose could go through the glucose reduction pathway. This will consume NADH and eventually leads to cell damage.\n:Sorbitol also may be synthesized through a catalytic hydrogenation of d-glucose to form d-sorbitol.<ref>SRINIVASAN, K.; GUNDEKARI, S.

The hydrogen atom on NADH is transferred to the electrophilic aldehyde carbon atom; electrons on the aldehyde carbon-oxygen double bond are transferred to the oxygen that abstracts the proton on tyrosine side chain to form the hydroxyl group. The role of aldehyde reductase tyrosine phenol group is to serve as a general acid to provide proton to the reduced aldehyde oxygen on glucose.\n\n:[[File:Mechanism of glucose reduction reaction.png|center|left]]Glucose reduction is not the major [[glucose metabolism]] pathway in a normal human body, where the [[Blood sugar|glucose level]] is in the normal range.
