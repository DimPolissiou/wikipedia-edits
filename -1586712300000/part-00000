Founded in [[Die\u00dfen am Ammersee|Die\u00dfen]] in the 1930s by [[Otto Sch\u00f6nstein|Otto Wilhelm Sch\u00f6nstein]] (1891\u20131958), Raumbild produced 6x13cm photographic [[stereoview|stereo pairs]] designed to be used with the proprietary fold-out [[stereoscope|\"Photoplastikon\"]] viewer produced for the company, some of which featured [[ZEISS|Zeiss]] Jena lenses. Quickly aligning itself with the propaganda arm of the [[NSDAP]], Raumbild moved around several times before settling in Munich in 1939.<ref>https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/fotografen/schoenstein.html</ref> After the defeat of Germany in the [[WW2|Second World War]], Raumbild changed directions in terms of content, while still focusing on subjects relevant to [[German nationalism|German identity]].

After the [[WW2|Second World War]], Sch\u00f6nstein was tried and released for his complicity in [[Nazi]] propaganda; he lived in relative obscurity, publishing new 6x13cm [[stereoview]] sets under pseudonyms until his death in 1958.<ref>https://graphicarts.princeton.edu/2013/08/30/1008/</ref>\n\n== Establishment, early efforts, and association with Nazism ==\n\nSch\u00f6nstein incorporated Raumbild on 14 January 1935.<ref>https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte.html</ref> Although his first publishing efforts were failures due to negative reviews from [[Art of the Third Reich|Reichsstelle zur Forderung des deutschen Schrifttums]], his later work with Raumbild throughout the mid-1930s and through the mid 1940s was very popular in Germany. The country was swept up in [[nationalism|nationalistic]] fervor; Sch\u00f6nstein would capitalize on this in his works after changing his focus from travel photography to Germanic subjects. He quickly came to the attention of the [[Nazi Party]], and his company became a ''de facto'' photographic arm of the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]] of the Party. This association led to unprecedented access for Sch\u00f6nstein and his employees and collaborators, beginning with the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in which he collaborated with [[Leni Riefenstahl]]. The resulting book & stereograph collection, ''Die Olympischen Spiele'', was a commercial success, at which point [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]], [[Adolf Hitler]]'s personal photographer, became a silent partner with a 50% stake in Raumbild for a 5,000 [[Reichsmark|RM]] initial investment and a 10,000 RM loan.<ref>https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte1.html</ref> Hoffmann became the official photographer, while Sch\u00f6nstein \u2013 regarded as an inferior lensman \u2013 curated and produced the various sets released by the company. This partnership cemented a longstanding relationship between Raumbild and the Third Reich which lasted until the end of the Second World War, although production of new materials ceased in 1942 as the war efforts made continuing photography difficult.\n\n== Postwar activities ==\n\nAfter the war, Raumbild stopped producing materials related to the [[NSDAP]]. During [[denazification]], which continued until 1953, Sch\u00f6nstein continued to create photographs and photographic sets; after a 6-month probationary period in 1946 related to his collusion with the Third Reich, Raumbild resumed production.<ref>http://www.stereoskopie.com/Raumbildbaende/Otto_Schonstein/body_otto_schonstein.html</ref> Sch\u00f6nstein produced sets with the intention of selling to American occupying forces; this provided the bulk of his income for the remainder of his life.<ref>https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte5.html</ref> In 1951, most of Sch\u00f6nstein's assets were seized as a judgement against his actions during the War; nevertheless, he would produce one of his final major works through Raumbild, covering the 1952 Olympics. During this period, Raumbild was primarily publishing the works of other photographers, primarily in color, and the subject matter ranged from landscapes to architecture to nudes. In early 1958, Raumbild was declared defunct, and Sch\u00f6nstein would have to sell; the company passed to Siegfried Brandm\u00fcller, a former employee of Sch\u00f6nstein's who would run the company for the next 27 years. The 23-year-old Brandm\u00fcller kept Sch\u00f6nstein on as an employee, which greatly embarrassed the former Raumbild giant; he would die just six months later. After a few initial successes by Brandm\u00fcller, Raumbild went dormant for a long time, although a number of attempts were made to re-launch the company; all of these failed.<ref>https://www.dhm.de/archiv/magazine/schoenstein/texte/geschichte6.html</ref> Raumbild folded for good in the mid-1980s.

The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via [[nuclear fission]] and  [[nuclear fusion]]).\n\nThe heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into [[mechanical energy]] via a [[heat engine]]. Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, [[cooking]], or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with [[combustion]]. Fuels are also used in the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of [[organism]]s in a process known as [[cellular respiration]], where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. [[Hydrocarbon]]s and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.\n\nFuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release [[electrical energy]] (such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[capacitor]]s) or mechanical energy (such as [[flywheel]]s, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).\n\n==History==\nThe first known use of fuel was the combustion habala by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' nearly two million years ago.<ref>{{cite book| title = Origin of Humankind | author = [[Richard Leakey|Leakey, Richard]] | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=75-cwH1905QC&pg=PR9&dq=%22first+use+of+Fire%22 | year = 1994 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | isbn = 978-0-465-03135-1}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Throughout most of human history only fuels derived from plants or animal fat were used by humans.

First, by their physical properties, as a solid, liquid or gas. Secondly, on the basis of their occurrence: ''primary (natural fuel)'' and ''secondary (artificial fuel)''. Thus, a general classification of chemical fuels is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ General types of chemical fuels\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Primary (natural)\n! scope=\"col\" | Secondary (artificial)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Solid fuel]]s\n| [[wood]], [[coal]], [[peat]], [[Feces|dung]], etc. || [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[charcoal]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Liquid fuel]]s\n| [[petroleum]] || [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[coal tar]], [[naphtha]], [[ethanol]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Gaseous fuel]]s\n| [[natural gas]] ||[[hydrogen]], [[propane]], [[methane]], [[coal gas]], [[water gas]], [[blast furnace]] gas, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] oven gas, [[CNG]]\n|}\n<!--either needs expansion or deletion<gallery>\nFile:Charcoal.jpg|[[Charcoal]]\nFile:Saterland peat digging by hand 1963.jpg|[[Peat]] digging by hand in [[Saterland]], 1963\n</gallery>-->\n\n===Solid fuel===\n{{main|Solid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Coal is an important solid fuel]]\n\nSolid fuel refers to various types of [[solid]] material that are used as fuel to produce [[energy]] and provide [[heating]], usually released through [[combustion]]. Solid fuels include [[wood]] , [[charcoal]], [[peat]], [[coal]], [[hexamine fuel tablet]]s, and pellets made from wood (see [[wood pellets]]), [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]] and other [[cereal|grains]]. [[Solid-fuel rocket]] technology also uses solid fuel (see [[Rocket fuel#Solid propellants|solid propellants]]). Solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to [[making fire|create fire]]. Coal was the fuel source which enabled the [[industrial revolution]], from firing [[furnace]]s, to running [[steam engine]]s. Wood was also extensively used to run [[steam locomotive]]s. Both peat and coal are still used in [[electricity generation]] today.\nThe use of some solid fuels (e.g. coal) is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas, due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions. The use of other solid fuels as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves. In some areas, [[anthracite|smokeless coal]] is often the only solid fuel used. In Ireland, peat [[briquette]]s are used as smokeless fuel. They are also used to start a coal fire.\n\n===Liquid fuels===\n{{main|Liquid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Benzinepomp002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A [[gasoline station]]]]\n\nLiquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create [[mechanical energy]], usually producing [[kinetic energy]]. They must also take the shape of their container; the fumes of liquid fuels are flammable, not the fluids.\n\nMost liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the [[fossil fuels|fossilized remains]] of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust. However, there are several types, such as [[hydrogen fuel]] (for [[automotive]] uses), [[ethanol]], [[jet fuel]] and [[bio-diesel]], which are all categorized as liquid fuels. [[Emulsified fuel]]s of oil in water, such as [[orimulsion]], have been developed as a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.\n\nSome common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport and can be handled easily. They are also relatively easy to use for all engineering applications and in home use. Fuels like [[kerosene]] are rationed in some countries, for example in government-subsidized shops in India for home use.\n\nConventional [[diesel fuel|diesel]] is similar to [[gasoline]] in that it is a mixture of [[aliphatic hydrocarbon]]s extracted from [[petroleum]]. Kerosene is used in [[kerosene lamp]]s and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. [[Natural gas]], composed chiefly of [[methane]], can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures (regardless of pressure), which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications. [[LP gas]] is a mixture of [[propane]] and [[butane]], both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles. Propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.\n\n===Fuel gas===\n{{main|Fuel gas}}\n\n[[File:Propane tank 20lb.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 20-pound ({{nowrap|9.1 kg}}) propane cylinder]]\n\nFuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that are [[gas]]eous under ordinary conditions. Many fuel gases are composed of [[hydrocarbons]] (such as [[methane]] or [[propane]]), [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or mixtures thereof. Such gases are sources of potential [[heat energy]] or [[light energy]] that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption. Fuel gas is contrasted with [[liquid fuels]] and from [[solid fuel]]s, though some fuel gases are [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]] for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature can be advantageous, avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it can also be dangerous. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading to the risk of a [[gas explosion]]. For this reason, [[odorizer]]s are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell. The most common type of fuel gas in current use is [[natural gas]].\n\n===Biofuels===\n{{main|Biofuel}}\n\n[[Biofuel]] can be broadly defined  as solid, liquid, or gas fuel consisting of, or derived from [[biomass]]. Biomass can also be used directly for heating or power\u2014known as ''biomass fuel''. Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.g. plants. Many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture.\n\nPerhaps the earliest fuel  employed by humans is wood. Evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at [[Swartkrans]], South Africa. It is unknown which hominid species first used fire, as both ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and an early species of ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' were present at the sites.<ref>{{Cite news\n | last=Rincon | first=Paul | date=22 March 2004\n | title=Bones hint at first use of fire | publisher=[[BBC News]]\n | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3557077.stm\n | accessdate=2007-09-11 }}</ref> As a fuel, wood has remained in use up until the present day, although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources.

A global movement toward the generation of [[renewable energy]] is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion [[tonnes]] (21.3 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title=US Department of Energy on greenhouse gases|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>  Carbon dioxide is one of the [[greenhouse gas]]es that enhances [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]], causing the [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] of the Earth to rise in response, which [[Scientific opinion on climate change|the vast majority of climate scientists]] agree will cause major [[Effects of global warming|adverse effects]].\nFuels are a source of energy.\n\n===Energy===\nThe amount of energy from different types of fuel depends on the [[stoichiometric ratio]], the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion of fuel, and its [[specific energy]], the energy per unit mass.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ [[Energy capacity|Energy capacities]] of common types of fuel\n|-\n!

Technically speaking, all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energy,{{dubious|date=October 2016}} but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress. Nuclear fuel is a material that can be 'burned' by [[nuclear fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] to derive [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. ''Nuclear fuel'' can refer to the fuel itself, or to physical objects (for example bundles composed of '''fuel rods''') composed of the fuel material, mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.\n\nMost nuclear fuels contain heavy [[fissile]] elements that are capable of nuclear fission.  When these fuels are struck by neutrons, they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart.  This makes possible a self-sustaining [[chain reaction]] that releases energy with a controlled rate in a [[nuclear reactor]] or with a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a [[nuclear weapon]].\n\nThe most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[uranium-235]] (<sup>235</sup>U) and [[Pu-239|plutonium-239]] (<sup>239</sup>Pu). The actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of nuclear fuel together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. Not all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission.  [[Plutonium-238]] and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by [[radioactive decay]] in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s and other types of [[atomic battery|atomic batteries]]. Also, light [[nuclide]]s such as [[tritium]] (<sup>3</sup>H) can be used as fuel for [[nuclear fusion]].\nNuclear fuel has the highest [[energy density]] of all practical fuel sources.\n\n===Fission===\n\n[[File:Nuclear fuel pellets.jpeg|thumb|[[Nuclear fuel]] pellets are used to release nuclear energy]]\n\nThe most common type of nuclear fuel used by humans is heavy [[fissile]] elements that can be made to undergo [[nuclear fission]] [[chain reaction]]s in a  [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]]; ''nuclear fuel'' can refer to the material or to physical objects (for example fuel bundles composed of [[fuel rod]]s) composed of the fuel material, perhaps mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.  The most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] and [[Pu-239|<sup>239</sup>Pu]], and the actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of these elements together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], which is important for its relevance to [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\n===Fusion===\nFuels that produce energy by the process of [[nuclear fusion]] are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for [[star]]s. Fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as [[hydrogen]] which will combine easily. Energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma, and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge. This process is called fusion and it can give out energy.\n\nIn stars that undergo nuclear fusion, fuel consists of [[atomic nuclei]] that can release energy by the absorption of a [[proton]] or [[neutron]]. In most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen, which can combine to form [[helium]] through the [[proton-proton chain reaction]] or by the [[CNO cycle]]. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements, although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy. Once [[iron-56]] or [[isotopes of nickel|nickel-56]] nuclei are produced, no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies. The elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused. Therefore, fusion stops and the star dies. In attempts by humans, fusion is only carried out with hydrogen (isotope of 2 and 3) to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy. Electric confinement ([[ITER]]), [[inertial confinement]](heating by laser) and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used. .<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last = Fewell | first = M.

The fuels that are easiest to burn cleanly are typically liquids and gases. Thus, liquids meet the requirements of being both energy-dense and clean-burning. In addition, liquids (and gases) can be pumped, which means handling is easily mechanized, and thus less laborious.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alcohol fuel]]\n* [[Alternative fuels]]\n* [[Ammonia]]\n* [[Battery (electricity)]]\n* [[Bitumen-based fuel]]\n* [[Biofuels]]\n* [[Compressed natural gas]]\n* [[Cryogenic fuel]]\n* [[Emulsified fuel]]\n* [[Fuel card]]\n* [[Fuel cell]]\n* [[Fuel container]]\n* [[Fuel management systems]]\n* [[Fuel oil]]\n* [[Fuel poverty]]\n* [[Filling station]]\n* [[Hydrogen economy]]\n* [[Hydrogen fuel]]\n* [[Hypergolic fuel]]\n* [[Liquid fuels]]\n* [[List of energy topics]]\n* [[Marine fuel management]]\n* [[Propellant]]\n* [[Recycled fuel]]\n* [[Solid fuel]]\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book| title = Chemistry 1 | author = Ratcliff, Brian| publisher = Cambridge University press | year= 2000 | isbn = 978-0-521-78778-9|display-authors=etal}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Fuels}}\n* {{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/environment/co2/9994/en.pdf |title=Directive 1999/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of 13 December 1999, relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars }}&nbsp;{{small|(140&nbsp;KB)}}.\n* [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980L1268:EN:NOT Council Directive 80/1268/EEC Fuel consumption of motor vehicles].\n{{Motor fuel}}\n{{Firelighting}}\n{{Energy footer}}\n{{Fire}}\n{{Portal bar|Agriculture|Ecology|Energy|Clothing}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Fuels| ]]\n[[Category:Energy development]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Material that stores energy later extracted by use of oxidizer, catalyst, or tool, but which is not conserved}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[File:Buying fuelwood.jpeg|thumb|[[Wood]] is one of the first fuels used by [[human]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sgphv2ydAHwC&pg=PA69&dq=wood+one+of+the+first+fuels+used+by+humans#v=onepage&q=wood%20one%20of%20the%20first%20fuels%20used%20by%20humans&f=false|title=Chemistry of Fossil Fuels and Biofuels|last=Schobert|first=Harold|year=2013|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521114004|language=en}}</ref>]]\n\nA '''fuel''' is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases  energy as heat energy or to be used for [[work (physics)|work]].

Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, [[cooking]], or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that comes with [[combustion]]. Fuels are also used in the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of [[organism]]s in a process known as [[cellular respiration]], where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy. [[Hydrocarbon]]s and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized.\n\nFuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release [[electrical energy]] (such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[capacitor]]s) or mechanical energy (such as [[flywheel]]s, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir).\n\n==History==\nThe first known use of fuel was the combustion of wood or sticks by ''[[Homo erectus]]'' nearly two million years ago.<ref>{{cite book| title = Origin of Humankind | author = [[Richard Leakey|Leakey, Richard]] | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=75-cwH1905QC&pg=PR9&dq=%22first+use+of+Fire%22 | year = 1994 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | isbn = 978-0-465-03135-1}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Throughout most of human history only fuels derived from plants or animal fat were used by humans.

First, by their physical properties, as a solid, liquid or gas. Secondly, on the basis of their occurrence: ''primary (natural fuel)'' and ''secondary (artificial fuel)''. Thus, a general classification of chemical fuels is:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ General types of chemical fuels\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Primary (natural)\n! scope=\"col\" | Secondary (artificial)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Solid fuel]]s\n| [[wood]], [[coal]], [[peat]], [[Feces|dung]], etc. || [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[charcoal]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Liquid fuel]]s\n| [[petroleum]] || [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[coal tar]], [[naphtha]], [[ethanol]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[[Gaseous fuel]]s\n| [[natural gas]] ||[[hydrogen]], [[propane]], [[methane]], [[coal gas]], [[water gas]], [[blast furnace]] gas, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] oven gas, [[CNG]]\n|}\n<!--either needs expansion or deletion<gallery>\nFile:Charcoal.jpg|[[Charcoal]]\nFile:Saterland peat digging by hand 1963.jpg|[[Peat]] digging by hand in [[Saterland]], 1963\n</gallery>-->\n\n===Solid fuel===\n{{main|Solid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Coal is an important solid fuel]]\n\nSolid fuel refers to various types of [[solid]] material that are used as fuel to produce [[energy]] and provide [[heating]], usually released through [[combustion]]. Solid fuels include [[wood]] , [[charcoal]], [[peat]], [[coal]], [[hexamine fuel tablet]]s, and pellets made from wood (see [[wood pellets]]), [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rye]] and other [[cereal|grains]]. [[Solid-fuel rocket]] technology also uses solid fuel (see [[Rocket fuel#Solid propellants|solid propellants]]). Solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to [[making fire|create fire]]. Coal was the fuel source which enabled the [[industrial revolution]], from firing [[furnace]]s, to running [[steam engine]]s. Wood was also extensively used to run [[steam locomotive]]s. Both peat and coal are still used in [[electricity generation]] today.\nThe use of some solid fuels (e.g. coal) is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas, due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions. The use of other solid fuels as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves. In some areas, [[anthracite|smokeless coal]] is often the only solid fuel used. In Ireland, peat [[briquette]]s are used as smokeless fuel. They are also used to start a coal fire.\n\n===Liquid fuels===\n{{main|Liquid fuel}}\n\n[[File:Benzinepomp002.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A [[gasoline station]]]]\n\nLiquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create [[mechanical energy]], usually producing [[kinetic energy]]. They must also take the shape of their container; the fumes of liquid fuels are flammable, not the fluids.\n\nMost liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the [[fossil fuels|fossilized remains]] of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure inside the Earth's crust. However, there are several types, such as [[hydrogen fuel]] (for [[automotive]] uses), [[ethanol]], [[jet fuel]] and [[bio-diesel]], which are all categorized as liquid fuels. [[Emulsified fuel]]s of oil in water, such as [[orimulsion]], have been developed as a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.\n\nSome common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport and can be handled easily. They are also relatively easy to use for all engineering applications and in home use. Fuels like [[kerosene]] are rationed in some countries, for example in government-subsidized shops in India for home use.\n\nConventional [[diesel fuel|diesel]] is similar to [[gasoline]] in that it is a mixture of [[aliphatic hydrocarbon]]s extracted from [[petroleum]]. Kerosene is used in [[kerosene lamp]]s and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. [[Natural gas]], composed chiefly of [[methane]], can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures (regardless of pressure), which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications. [[LP gas]] is a mixture of [[propane]] and [[butane]], both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles. Propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.\n\n===Fuel gas===\n{{main|Fuel gas}}\n\n[[File:Propane tank 20lb.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 20-pound ({{nowrap|9.1 kg}}) propane cylinder]]\n\nFuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that are [[gas]]eous under ordinary conditions. Many fuel gases are composed of [[hydrocarbons]] (such as [[methane]] or [[propane]]), [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or mixtures thereof. Such gases are sources of potential [[heat energy]] or [[light energy]] that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption. Fuel gas is contrasted with [[liquid fuels]] and from [[solid fuel]]s, though some fuel gases are [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefied]] for storage or transport. While their gaseous nature can be advantageous, avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels, it can also be dangerous. It is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas, leading to the risk of a [[gas explosion]]. For this reason, [[odorizer]]s are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell. The most common type of fuel gas in current use is [[natural gas]].\n\n===Biofuels===\n{{main|Biofuel}}\n\n[[Biofuel]] can be broadly defined  as solid, liquid, or gas fuel consisting of, or derived from [[biomass]]. Biomass can also be used directly for heating or power\u2014known as ''biomass fuel''. Biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly e.g. plants. Many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture.\n\nPerhaps the earliest fuel  employed by humans is wood. Evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at [[Swartkrans]], South Africa. It is unknown which hominid species first used fire, as both ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and an early species of ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' were present at the sites.<ref>{{Cite news\n | last=Rincon | first=Paul | date=22 March 2004\n | title=Bones hint at first use of fire | publisher=[[BBC News]]\n | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3557077.stm\n | accessdate=2007-09-11 }}</ref> As a fuel, wood has remained in use up until the present day, although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources.

A global movement toward the generation of [[renewable energy]] is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion [[tonnes]] (21.3 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title=US Department of Energy on greenhouse gases|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>  Carbon dioxide is one of the [[greenhouse gas]]es that enhances [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]], causing the [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] of the Earth to rise in response, which [[Scientific opinion on climate change|the vast majority of climate scientists]] agree will cause major [[Effects of global warming|adverse effects]].\nFuels are a source of energy.\n\n===Energy===\nThe amount of energy from different types of fuel depends on the [[stoichiometric ratio]], the chemically correct air and fuel ratio to ensure complete combustion of fuel, and its [[specific energy]], the energy per unit mass.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ [[Energy capacity|Energy capacities]] of common types of fuel\n|-\n!

Technically speaking, all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energy,{{dubious|date=October 2016}} but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress. Nuclear fuel is a material that can be 'burned' by [[nuclear fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] to derive [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. ''Nuclear fuel'' can refer to the fuel itself, or to physical objects (for example bundles composed of '''fuel rods''') composed of the fuel material, mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.\n\nMost nuclear fuels contain heavy [[fissile]] elements that are capable of nuclear fission.  When these fuels are struck by neutrons, they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart.  This makes possible a self-sustaining [[chain reaction]] that releases energy with a controlled rate in a [[nuclear reactor]] or with a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a [[nuclear weapon]].\n\nThe most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[uranium-235]] (<sup>235</sup>U) and [[Pu-239|plutonium-239]] (<sup>239</sup>Pu). The actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of nuclear fuel together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. Not all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission.  [[Plutonium-238]] and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by [[radioactive decay]] in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s and other types of [[atomic battery|atomic batteries]]. Also, light [[nuclide]]s such as [[tritium]] (<sup>3</sup>H) can be used as fuel for [[nuclear fusion]].\nNuclear fuel has the highest [[energy density]] of all practical fuel sources.\n\n===Fission===\n\n[[File:Nuclear fuel pellets.jpeg|thumb|[[Nuclear fuel]] pellets are used to release nuclear energy]]\n\nThe most common type of nuclear fuel used by humans is heavy [[fissile]] elements that can be made to undergo [[nuclear fission]] [[chain reaction]]s in a  [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]]; ''nuclear fuel'' can refer to the material or to physical objects (for example fuel bundles composed of [[fuel rod]]s) composed of the fuel material, perhaps mixed with structural, [[neutron moderator|neutron moderating]], or neutron reflecting materials.  The most common fissile nuclear fuels are [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] and [[Pu-239|<sup>239</sup>Pu]], and the actions of mining, refining, purifying, using, and ultimately disposing of these elements together make up the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], which is important for its relevance to [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\n===Fusion===\nFuels that produce energy by the process of [[nuclear fusion]] are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for [[star]]s. Fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as [[hydrogen]] which will combine easily. Energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma, and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge. This process is called fusion and it can give out energy.\n\nIn stars that undergo nuclear fusion, fuel consists of [[atomic nuclei]] that can release energy by the absorption of a [[proton]] or [[neutron]]. In most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen, which can combine to form [[helium]] through the [[proton-proton chain reaction]] or by the [[CNO cycle]]. When the hydrogen fuel is exhausted, nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements, although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy. Once [[iron-56]] or [[isotopes of nickel|nickel-56]] nuclei are produced, no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies. The elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused. Therefore, fusion stops and the star dies. In attempts by humans, fusion is only carried out with hydrogen (isotope of 2 and 3) to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy. Electric confinement ([[ITER]]), [[inertial confinement]](heating by laser) and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used. .<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last = Fewell | first = M.

According to the report UC Global's owner David Morales had provided the CIA with audio and video of meetings Assange held with his lawyers and colleagues. Morales also arranged for the US to have direct access to the stream from video cameras installed in the embassy at the beginning of December 2017. The evidence is part of a secret investigation by Spain's High Court, the [[Audiencia Nacional]], into Morales and his relationship with US intelligence. The investigation was precipitated by a complaint by Assange that accused UC Global of violating his privacy and client-attorney privileges as well as committing misappropriation, bribery and money laundering.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Irujo |first1=Jose Maria |title=Spanish security company spied on Julian Assange in London for the United States |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/09/25/inenglish/1569384196_652151.html |accessdate=30 September 2019 |publisher=El Pais |date=26 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nMorales was arrested in September on charges involving violations of privacy and client-attorney privileges, as well as misappropriation, bribery, money laundering and criminal possession of weapons.

On 25 September, Spanish Judge Jos\u00e9 de la Mata sent British authorities a [[European Investigation Order]] (EIO) asking for permission to question Assange by videoconference as a witness in the case against Morales. The United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA), which is in charge of processing and responding to EIOs in the UK, provisionally denied De la Mata's request to question Assange, raised a number of objections to the request, and asked for more details. De la Mata responded to UKCA's objections on 14 October by stating that Assange was the victim who had filed the complaint and that unlawful disclosure of secrets and bribery are also crimes in the UK. He said that the crimes were partially committed on Spanish territory because the microphones used to spy on Assange were bought in Spain, and the information obtained was sent and uploaded to servers at UC Global S.

The evidence is part of a secret investigation by Spain's High Court, the [[Audiencia Nacional]], into Morales and his relationship with US intelligence.

De la Mata responded to UKCA's objections on 14 October by stating that Assange was the victim who had filed the complaint and that unlawful disclosure of secrets and bribery are also crimes in the UK.

In her youth she learned folksongs in the traditional way (orally, from her family and members of her community); and in adulthood she became a successful modern folksinger, promulgating songs in public through concerts and recordings.  She was called by some the \"Mother of Folk\".\n\n==Out of Kentucky==\nJean Ritchie was born to Abigail (n\u00e9e Hall) and Balis W. Ritchie of [[Viper, Kentucky|Viper]], an unincorporated community in [[Perry County, Kentucky|Perry County]] in the Cumberland Mountains of south eastern [[Kentucky]].<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> The Ritchies of Perry County were one of the two \"great ballad-singing families\" of Kentucky celebrated among folk song scholars (the other was the Combs family of adjacent [[Knott County, Kentucky|Knott County]], whose repertoire formed the basis of the first scholarly work on the British ballads in America, a doctoral thesis by Professor Josiah Combs of [[Berea College]] for the Sorbonne University published in Paris in 1925.)<ref>[[Alan Lomax]], foreword to Jean Ritchie, ''Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians as Sung by Jean Ritchie'', forewords by Alan Lomax and Ron Pen (University of Kentucky Press, 2nd edition, 1997). p. 1. The book by Combs, who was a specialist in the dulcimer, was translated into English as a monograph by [[D. K. Wilgus]] in 1967 as ''Folk-Songs of the Southern United States (Folk-Songs Du Midi Des Etats-Unis), Publications of the American Folklore Society, Bibliographical and Special Series, Vol. 19'' (University of Texas).</ref> In 1917, the folk music collector [[Cecil Sharp]] collected songs from Jean's older sisters Una and May. Many of the Ritchies attended the [[Hindman Settlement School]], a folk school, where people were encouraged to cherish their own backgrounds and where Sharp also found many of his songs. Jean's father Balis had printed up a book of old songs entitled ''Lovers' Melodies'',<ref>Charles Wolfe and Jean Ritchie, foreword to new edition of Jean Ritchie, ''Jean Ritchie's Swapping Song Book'' with photographs by George Pickow (University of Kentucky Press, [1952] 2000), p. 1.</ref> and music making was an important activity in the Ritchie home.\n\nRitchie's forebears had fought in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in 1776 before settling in Kentucky, and most of them later fought on the Confederate Side in the Civil War. Her grandfather Justice Austin Ritchie was 2nd Lieutenant of Company C of the 13th Kentucky Confederate Cavalry. [[Alan Lomax]] wrote that:<blockquote>They were quiet, thoughtful folks, who went in for ballads, big families and educating their children. Jean's grandmother was a prime mover in the Old Regular Baptist Church, and all the traditional hymn tunes came from her. Jean's Uncle Jason was a lawyer, who remembers the big ballads like \"Lord Barnard.\" Jean's father taught school, printed a newspaper, fitted specs, farmed and sent ten of his fourteen children to college.<ref>Lomax, foreword to Jean Ritchie, ''Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians'', p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs the youngest of 14 siblings,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> Ritchie was one of ten girls who slept in one room of the farming family's farm house. She was quick to memorize songs and, with Chalmers and Velma McDaniels, performed at local dances and at county fairs, where they  repeatedly won blue ribbons in [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]], the county seat. She recalled that when the family acquired a radio in the late 1940s they discovered that what they had been singing was [[hillbilly music]], a word they had never heard before.\n\nRitchie graduated from high school in Viper and enrolled in Cumberland Junior College (now a four-year [[University of the Cumberlands]]) in [[Williamsburg, Kentucky]], and from there graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a B.A. in [[social work]] from the [[University of Kentucky]], in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] in 1946.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> At college she participated in the [[glee club]] and [[choir]] and learned to play [[piano]].<ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/jean-ritchie/biography Biography of Jean Ritchie], music.yahoo.com; accessed January 9, 2014.</ref> During World War II, she taught in elementary school. After graduating she got a job as a social worker at the [[Henry Street Settlement]], where she taught music to children. There she befriended Alan Lomax, who recorded her extensively for the [[Library of Congress]]. She joined the New York folksong scene and met [[Lead Belly]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Oscar Brand]].

The Brooklyn-born Pickow, who had studied painting at [[Cooper Union]] and made training films for the Navy in [[World War II]], had a long career as a professional photographer and filmmaker. His career also included an extensive documentation of his wife's work and his photographs illustrated many of her books. Pickow and Ritchie met in 1948 at a square dance at the [[Henry Street Settlement]]. The following day, Pickow invited her to accompany him on a photo shoot at the [[Fulton Fish Market]]. \"The result \u2014 Ms. Ritchie perched on the hood of a truck, holding a rather large lobster \u2014 was published in a trucking-industry magazine.\"<ref name=nytobitpickow>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/arts/design/19pickow.html\n| first = Margalit \n| last = Fox\n| title = George Pickow, Artist Who Chronicled Musical Life, Is Dead at 88\n| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n| date = 18 December 2010}}</ref> They married in 1950 and had two sons, Peter and Jon. In 1952, Pickow accompanied his wife on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]] to collect folk songs in Britain and Ireland. When Alan Lomax, then working out of London for the [[BBC]], and his collaborator [[Peter Douglas Kennedy|Peter Kennedy]] of the [[English Folk Dance and Song Society]], decided to document the unique [['Obby 'Oss festival|May Eve and May Day Festivals]] at [[Padstow]] in [[Cornwall]], they selected Pickow to be their cameraman. The result was the 16-minute color film ''Oss Oss Wee Oss'' (1953). In 1961, Pickow and Lomax collaborated on a short film documentary about the [[Greenwich Village]] folk revival scene intended to be shown on the BBC. This never happened, however, and ten years later Alan's daughter [[Anna Lomax Wood]], edited the surviving scraps and fragments in her father's office into a short film, ''Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass''. In addition to Ritchie, ''Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass'' features what one reviewer called \"killer footage\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p08253.htm|title=FAME Review: Ballads, Blues, & Bluegrass - A Film by Alan Lomax (DVD)|website=Acousticmusic.com|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref> of performances by [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Guy Carawan]], [[Willie Dixon]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Peter La Farge]], [[Ernie Marrs]], [[The New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Memphis Slim]], and the first known footage of a very young [[Doc Watson]].

The latter instrument is also called the \"mountain dulcimer\" and is distinct from the [[hammer dulcimer]]; it is an intimate indoor instrument with a soft, ethereal sound. Her father had played the Appalachian dulcimer but forbade his children to touch it. At the age of four or five, however, Ritchie defied this prohibition and picked out \"[[Go Tell Aunt Rhody]]\".\n\nBy 1949, Ritchie's playing of the Appalachian dulcimer had become a hallmark of her style. After her husband made one for her as a present, the couple decided there might be a potential market for them. Pickow's uncle, Morris Pickow, set up an instrument workshop for them under the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] in [[Brooklyn]]. At first they were shipped to New York in an unfinished state by Ritchie's Kentucky relative, Jethro Amburgey, then the woodworking instructor at the Hindman Settlement School. George did the finishing and Jean did the tuning and soon they had sold 300 dulcimers. Later they manufactured them themselves from start to finish, Today there are dulcimers for sale at most folk festivals. Because fans kept asking her \"Which album has the most dulcimer?\", she finally recorded an album called ''The Most Dulcimer'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=The most dulcimer [sound recording]|url=https://lccn.loc.gov/87752816|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==The Fulbright expedition==\nJean Ritchie was awarded a [[Fulbright scholarship]] to trace the links between American ballads and the songs from Britain and Ireland.

Jean's father Balis had printed up a book of old songs entitled ''Lovers' Melodies'',<ref>Charles Wolfe and Jean Ritchie, foreword to new edition of Jean Ritchie, ''Jean Ritchie's Swapping Song Book'' with photographs by George Pickow (University of Kentucky Press, [1952] 2000), p. 1.</ref> and music making was an important activity in the Ritchie home.\n\nRitchie's forebears had fought in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] in 1776 before settling in Kentucky, and most of them later fought on the Confederate Side in the Civil War. Her grandfather Justice Austin Ritchie was 2nd Lieutenant of Company C of the 13th Kentucky Confederate Cavalry. [[Alan Lomax]] wrote that:<blockquote>They were quiet, thoughtful folks, who went in for ballads, big families and educating their children. Jean's grandmother was a prime mover in the Old Regular Baptist Church, and all the traditional hymn tunes came from her. Jean's Uncle Jason was a lawyer, who remembers the big ballads like \"Lord Barnard.\" Jean's father taught school, printed a newspaper, fitted specs, farmed and sent ten of his fourteen children to college.<ref>Lomax, foreword to Jean Ritchie, ''Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians'', p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs the youngest of 14 siblings,<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> Ritchie was one of ten girls who slept in one room of the farming family's farm house.

She recalled that when the family acquired a radio in the late 1940s they discovered that what they had been singing was [[hillbilly music]], a word they had never heard before.\n\nRitchie graduated from high school in Viper and enrolled in Cumberland Junior College (now a four-year [[University of the Cumberlands]]) in [[Williamsburg, Kentucky]], and from there graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a B.A. in [[social work]] from the [[University of Kentucky]], in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] in 1946.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/> At college she participated in the [[glee club]] and [[choir]] and learned to play [[piano]].<ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/jean-ritchie/biography Biography of Jean Ritchie], music.yahoo.com; accessed January 9, 2014.</ref> During World War II, she taught in elementary school.

The result was the 16-minute color film ''Oss Oss Wee Oss'' (1953). In 1961, Pickow and Lomax collaborated on a short film documentary about the [[Greenwich Village]] folk revival scene intended to be shown on the BBC. This never happened, however, and ten years later Alan's daughter [[Anna Lomax Wood]], edited the surviving scraps and fragments in her father's office into a short film, ''Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass''. In addition to Ritchie, ''Ballads, Blues, and Bluegrass'' features what one reviewer called \"killer footage\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p08253.htm|title=FAME Review: Ballads, Blues, & Bluegrass - A Film by Alan Lomax (DVD)|website=Acousticmusic.com|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref> of performances by [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Guy Carawan]], [[Willie Dixon]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Peter La Farge]], [[Ernie Marrs]], [[The New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Memphis Slim]], and the first known footage of a very young [[Doc Watson]].

The latter instrument is also called the \"mountain dulcimer\" and is distinct from the [[hammer dulcimer]]; it is an intimate indoor instrument with a soft, ethereal sound. Her father had played the Appalachian dulcimer but forbade his children to touch it. At the age of four or five, however, Ritchie defied this prohibition and picked out \"[[Go Tell Aunt Rhody]]\".\n\nBy 1949, Ritchie's playing of the Appalachian dulcimer had become a hallmark of her style. After her husband made one for her as a present, the couple decided there might be a potential market for them. Pickow's uncle, Morris Pickow, set up an instrument workshop for them under the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] in [[Brooklyn]]. At first they were shipped to New York in an unfinished state by Ritchie's Kentucky relative, Jethro Amburgey, then the woodworking instructor at the Hindman Settlement School. George did the finishing and Jean did the tuning and soon they had sold 300 dulcimers. Later they manufactured them themselves from start to finish, Today there are dulcimers for sale at most folk festivals. Because fans kept asking her \"Which album has the most dulcimer?\", she finally recorded an album called ''The Most Dulcimer'' in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=The most dulcimer [sound recording]|url=https://lccn.loc.gov/87752816|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==The Fulbright expedition==\nJean Ritchie was awarded a [[Fulbright scholarship]] to trace the links between American ballads and the songs from Britain and Ireland. As a song-collector, she began by setting down the 300 songs that she already knew from her mother's knee. Ritchie spent 18 months tape recording and interviewing singers.<ref name=\"CD\">{{cite web|url=http://clancybrothersandtommymakem.com/fa_1954_field_trip.htm |title=Field Trip: Festival-Anthology recordings |accessdate=2013-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232716/http://clancybrothersandtommymakem.com/fa_1954_field_trip.htm |archivedate=2013-12-30 }}</ref> Pickow accompanied her, photographing [[Seamus Ennis]], [[Leo Rowsome]], [[Sarah Makem]] and other musicians.

As well as work songs and ballads, Ritchie knew hymns from the \"[[Old Regular Baptist]]\" church she attended in [[Jeff, Kentucky]]. These were sung as \"lining out\" songs, in a lingering soulful way. One of the songs they sang was \"[[Amazing Grace]]\". She wrote some songs, including \"Black Waters\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=59577&messages=21#951952 |title=Lyr Req: Black Waters (Jean Ritchie) |website=Mudcat.org |date=2009-04-24 |accessdate=2015-11-01}}</ref> one on the effects of strip mining in Kentucky.

[[Judy Collins]] recorded some of Ritchie's traditional songs, \"Tender Ladies\" and \"Pretty Saro\", and also used a photograph by George Pickow on the front of her album \"Golden Apples of the Sun\" (1962). Ritchie's 50th anniversary album was ''Mountain Born'' (1995), which features her two sons, Peter and Jonathan Pickow. In 1954 Ritchie and George Pickow released some of their UK recordings under the name ''Field Trip''. It was re-issued in 2001 on the Greenhays label. It has recordings by Elizabeth Cronin, Seamus Ennis, and others, side by side with Ritchie family versions of the same songs.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn 1996 the Ritchie Pickow Photographic Archive was acquired by the James Hardiman Library, [[National University of Ireland, Galway]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nJean Ritchie performed at such venues as [[Carnegie Hall]] and at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Her album, ''None But One'', was awarded the Rolling Stone Critics Award in 1977.

Despite SIUE dominating the shooting 16\u20138, Tech's Brad Vorv found himself free and lofted a 25' shot past Kent Kobernus in the 97th minute, giving the Hokies the \"golden goal\" victory.<ref>[http://www.hokiesports.com/msoccer/recaps/20140829aaa.html Hokies open season with 1-0 OT win over SIUE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a day dominated by the heat, with the game punctuated with several water breaks, SIUE and Tulsa missed numerous scoring opportunities, especially on set pieces. The Cougars scored first, with Scheipeter passing up a contested shot to hit Volesky, who faced the open net. A Cougars turnover started the action that led to the Golden Hurricane's Neil putting in a shot from a difficult angle to tie the game. Despite the two sides taking 35 shots (Tulsa leading 23\u201312), the game was mainly a defensive struggle, remaining tied at one goal apiece through regulation and the first extra time period. Cougar goalkeeper Kobernus made his eighth save on another shot by Neil, but when he failed to corral the ball, Barrett put the rebound into the net to give Tulsa the double-overtime \"golden goal\" win.<ref>[http://www.tulsahurricane.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/083114aaa.html Tulsa's Barrett Scores in 101st Minute for Double-Overtime Win - Tulsa Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nPlaying a mid-week game at Memphis, the Cougars dominated early play, with Volesky scoring off a pass from Garet Christianson. As play went on, SIUE seemed to grow complacent and careless, passing beyond intended teammates, directly at defenders, or to no one in particular. As such play continued, the Tigers gained confidence and took control in the last ten minutes of the first half.  Memphis remained in control through the second half, with Khulfan scoring on a breakaway and the Tigers outshooting the Cougars 8\u22124 for the half. SIUE seemed to be back in control in their third extra time game in three matches. They outshot the Tigers 4\u20130 in the first overtime period and took the first shot of the second OT. But Ledbetter then drew his second yellow card and was ejected. Memphis, a man up, immediately applied the pressure and scored only 23 seconds after the red card, giving the Cougars their third \"golden goal\" loss in three games.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gotigersgo.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/090314aab.html |title=Men's Soccer Defeats SIU-Edwardsville in Home Opener - GOTIGERSGO.COM - The Official Website of the University of Memphis Tigers<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2014-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904135256/http://www.gotigersgo.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/090314aab.html |archive-date=2014-09-04 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nHosting undefeated Butler in the first-ever meeting between the two programs, the Cougars set a school record with four consecutive extra time games for the first time in the program's 48-year history. SIUE dominated play in the first half, with Volesky scoring on a pass in the box from Hackett. On Butler's only first half threat, Kendall-Moulin fouled the Bulldog's Goldsmith in the box, with Postlewait scoring on the penalty kick. Butler came out on the offensive to start the second half, taking the first three shots, but the Cougars took charge again, yet were unable to get anything past the Bulldog's goalkeeper. In the first extra period, an SIUE player was fouled amidst a crowd directly in front of the goal mouth; the Cougar's best winning chance of the young season went astray as Volesky's penalty kick bounced off the post and away. The two sides traded possessions, with both defenses turning aside repeated attacks through the second extra time period, and the game ended with SIUE getting its first point of the season on a frustrating draw.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://butlersports.com/sports/m-soccer/2014-15/releases/20140907bbrcv9 |title=Butler, SIUE Play To 1-1 Draw - Butler<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2014-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911091016/http://butlersports.com/sports/m-soccer/2014-15/releases/20140907bbrcv9 |archive-date=2014-09-11 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nIn a mid-week road game, the Cougars once more dominated early play, and Volesky scored his fourth goal in five games off a pass from Garet Christianson. The 'Roos had managed only a couple of long-distance shots before an uncharacteristic turnover by Polster left his SIUE teammates out of position, and UMKC scored an easy tying shot on a rebound of a missed first shot. Sloppy passing and an inability to either score on set pieces or cleanly clear the ball from the defensive end have continued to be a problem at odds with SIUE's strong soccer tradition. Repeated failures to clear set up a second UMKC goal, putting the Cougars into a position of trailing in the score during regulation time for the first time this season. Repeated failures to score on corner kick after corner kick and a Polster penalty kick that was saved by the 'Roos' goalkeeper, McGaughey, left the Cougars with one more loss.<ref>[http://www.umkckangaroos.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&ATCLID=209644603&DB_OEM_ID=18300 'Roos Come From Behind in Home Opening Victory Over SIUE - UMKC Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nTrying for a change in results, the Cougars resorted to changing from single-color uniforms to face DePaul at Korte Stadium. One thing that did change was the early game dominance by SIUE, who surrendered the first goal for the first time since the season opener, when Hunter's rocket of a pass hit Megally just outside the six yard box for an easy shot past a diving Kobernus. The Blue Demons outshot the Cougars in the first half, but SIUE picked up the action after halftime. In the sixtieth minute, Bilyeu fired a pass to a wide-open Ellis, who lofted a chip shot over the DePaul keeper to even the score. Both defenses repeatedly turned aside their opponent, and the match went into extra time for the fifth time in the Cougars' six games. SIUE escaped disaster when the defense held against a free kick from just outside the six yard box after Kobernus fouled by picking up a ball a Cougar had kicked to him, and the first extra period ended with the score still at 1\u20131. The Cougars stepped up the pressure further in the second overtime period, but DePaul's keeper and defense withstood the onslaught, and the game ended a draw, SIUE's second.<ref>[http://www.depaulbluedemons.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/091314aaa.html Megally's Early Goal Leads to 1-1 Double OT Tie at SIU-Edwardsville - DePaul University Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOpening a two-game road trip against ranked Pac-12 teams in California, the Cougars once again scored first against #24 Stanford, with Volesky tapping a loose ball to Polster in the box. Twenty minutes later, the Cardinal's Morris went to the post, drawing Kobernus to him, then tapped a pass to Glover for the tying goal. Stanford was the dominant team in the first half, outshooting the Cougars and taking several corners to the Cougars' none. On a corner kick, the Cardinal's Skundrich fired into the box to the head of Vincent, who scored the go-ahead goal. In the second half, The Cougars outplayed the Cardinal early and late, while Stanford had the better of the middle, but neither side was able to get a shot past the other's keeper, and the home team picked up the win in a game that was much closer than the two teams' records might indicate.<ref>[http://www.gostanford.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30600&ATCLID=209665040 Stanford Battles Back - GoStanford.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon in Berkeley, the Cougars played another closely contested match at the home of a ranked opponent, the #15 California Golden Bears, Cal scored first when Bonomo intercepted a pass in SIUE's defensive end, putting him one-on-one with Kobernus, and he scored in the 17th minute. Only four and a half minutes later, Hallisey passed to Carrera-Garcia and kept going, with Carrera-Garcia completing the give-and-go back to Hallisey and putting the Golden Bears up 2-0. SIUE had an opportunity to close the gap when the Cal goalkeeper committed a foul inside the box, but  Volesky's shot was off the crossbar, and his rebound attempt was wide. The Cougars once again outshot their opponent only to have the other side's goalkeeper make repeated saves, but in the 77th minute, Polster played the ball in to Volesky, who tallied his fifth goal of the season. In another match that was tighter than the opponents' records show, SIUE came out on the short end and head into the MVC schedule while still in search of their first victory.<ref>[http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30100&ATCLID=209667851 No. 15 Cal Wins Its Fifth Consecutive Match, Beats SIUE 2-1 - California Golden Bears - University of California Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOpening the MVC season on a Monday night in Evansville, the Cougars managed to accomplish three things they had not done since the preseason---keep a clean sheet, score more than one goal, and win a game. As has often been the case, SIUE dominated play, outshooting the Purple Aces 8 to 3 in the first half and 7 to 3 in the second, with only 2 of Evansville's shots being on goal and both of those saved by Kobernus. The Cougars got on the scoreboard when Volesky was taken down in the box by the Aces' keeper in the 33rd minute; Garet Christianson put the penalty kick into the open left side of the net. In the second half, briefly Evansville put on a strong showing that resulted in four consecutive corner kicks, but the SIUE defense held off the assault. In the 73rd minute, Polster found a loose ball near the top of the 18 yard box and buried it in the right side of the net to double the lead. The Cougars kept trying for additional scoring, but Evansville's keeper held firm, and SIUE had to be satisfied with the 2\u20130 victory.<ref>[http://www.gopurpleaces.com/news/2014/9/29/MSOC_0929140751.aspx Evansville Athletics - Men's Soccer drops MVC season opener 2-0 to SIUE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn front of a huge Homecoming crowd at Korte Stadium, the Cougars recorded their second consecutive two-goal shutout win. SIUE's defense held off Bradley's MVC-leading offense while the offense outshot the Braves 11\u20136. After the Cougars had been 0\u2013for\u2013the\u2013season on set plays, in the 18th minute, Kendall-Moulin tapped a corner to Bilyeu who tapped it right back to Kendal-Moulinn, whose crossing pass found Volesky's head for the first goal. Eighteen minutes later, inside the eighteen yard box, Volesky passed to Hoguet, who had just entered the game and fired blazing shot into the corner of the net on his first touch. Through the remainder of the game, the Cougars continued to press for additional scoring while their defense frustrated the Braves repeatedly. After two conference games, SIUE and Missouri State sit atop the MVC standings with 2\u20130\u20130 records.<ref>[http://www.bradleybraves.com//ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3400&ATCLID=209697513 SIUE Blanks Bradley Soccer, 2-0 - BRADLEYBRAVES.COM\u2014Official Web Site of Bradley University Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSIUE's third conference game was in Conway, Arkansas, the home of the MVC's other associate member, Central Arkansas. Despite periods of poor passing, the Cougars managed to dominate another opponent, outshooting the Bears in the first half 7\u20131. UCA's keeper was able to stop all of the Cougars' shots on goal, and the teams went to the locker room tied at nil. The home team stepped up their intensity in the second half, and outshot the Cougars 8\u20133. But, in the 60th minute, Polster crossed to Danzy, who headed home his first goal of the season. Less than thirteen minutes, Houget hit a long pass to a breaking Garet Christianson; with the UCA keeper coming out, Christianson got to the ball first and nailed the goal from 25 yards out. The Bears got on the board in the 83rd minute when, on a free kick from just outside the box, a Cougar fouled in the box to set up a penalty kick. Kobernus saved on the PK but was unable to control the rebound that was tapped in by Moquete from 5 yards out. It took the Cougars only 36 seconds to go back up by two; the ball was smoothly played into the UCA end, Ellis crossed to Danzy, and the redshirt junior collected his second goal of the game. After the frustrating start of the season, SIUE has a three-game winning streak and sits alone atop the MVC standings.<ref>[http://ucasports.com/news/2014/10/11/MSOC_1011142758.aspx Central Arkansas Athletics - UCA MEN FALL TO SIUE 3-1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Cougars were inhospitable hosts to Drake and played a game of almost total dominance en route to a 4\u20130 shellacking. Five minutes into the game, Bilyeu took a pass from Kendall-Moullin and fired a high, looping shot from 35 yards out that sank into the top right corner of the net over the Bulldog keeper's reaching hands. On a corner kick in the 37th minute, Drake's keeper turned awy the ball, but Polster found the rebound 4 yards out and buried it, giving SIUE a two-goal lead. Four minutes later, Volesky took a long pass in the open, juked the keeper, then passed off to an even more open Christianson, who put the Cougars up 3\u20130 for the first time in the season. Drake managed to fire off two shots that were high and wide late in the half, and the home squad went to the locker room up by three after outshooting the Bulldogs 7\u20132. The domination continues in the second half as the Cougars outshot the visitors 8\u20130 while eight subs saw action. In the 59th minute, Volesky drove into the box, stumbled and fell, picked himself up, regained the ball, and scored his MVC leading seventh goal of the season. That goal gave SIUE, now 4\u20130\u20130 in MVC games, its widest margin of victory in a conference game since joining the league in 2010. The Cougar win, combined with the Missouri State draw at Loyola, extended their lead in the Valley standings to five points.<ref>[http://www.godrakebulldogs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPID=8125&DB_OEM_ID=15700&ATCLID=209724591 Bulldogs Fall At SIU Edwardsville, 4-0 - GoDrakeBulldogs.com\u2014Official Web site of Drake University Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a Wednesday night in DeKalb, the Cougars started strong but seemed to be continually out of sync without the presence of leading scorer, Christian Volesky. SIUE got off the first four shots of the game and outshot NIU 7\u20134 in the first half. In the eighth minute, Danzy found himself facing an open net but fired wide. In the 17th minute, Danzy went into the box as Christianson shot, but found himself decked by the Huskies' keeper, hustling out for the save. Danzy atoned for what had gone before when he found himself again facing an open goal, driving Ledbetter's pass from behind the defense into the net. Less than a minute and a half later though, it was the Huskies who forced the action, earning a corner kick that Hall drove in a high slicing arc that Kobernus was only able to get a hand on as it sailed into the net for an [[Olympic goal|\"olimpico\"]] goal to knot the score. The Cougars outshot the Huskies 5\u20134 in the second half, but only one SIUE shot was on goal, while not only were all of NIU's shots on goal, Kobernus was able to save only one. The SIUE defense turned back repeated NIU challenges only to see the front line give the ball right back to the home squad. The Huskies took advantage,  scoring three second half goals, and the final 4\u20131 score was the widest victory margin for a Cougars' opponent since SIUE returned to Division I in 2008.<ref>[http://www.niuhuskies.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/102214aaa.html Offense Explodes as Huskies Hammer SIUE - NIUHUSKIES.COM - The Northern Illinois Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a Tuesday night at Louisville's brand new, state-of-the-art stadium, the defenses were at the forefront of the action. The Cardinals outshot the Cougars, but most of their shoots were from long-distance and went high and/or wide. Both defenses repeatedly turned away everything that came at them, and the game turned into the Cougar's sixth overtime game of the season. At the end of 110 minutes of furious action, SIUE had played the  #22 ranked Cardinals to a 0\u20130 draw.<ref>[http://www.gocards.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/102814aaa.html No. 9 Cardinals Draw with SIU Edwardsville - GoCards.com | Official Website of University of Louisville Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a frigid Saturday night at Korte, the Cougars played the Missouri State Bears for possession of first place in the MVC. As expected, the defenses dominated the game, with both teams spending much time trying to maintain possession of the ball, then attacking and being turned aside. In the 24th minute, only seconds after making a solid save, Kobernus was caught out of position as the Bears' Roberts chipped a shot over him and into the net to give State the lead. As time ran down in the first  half, Volesky was fouled hard about 25 yards out. Bilyeu fired the free kick into the box, and Volesky headed in his league-leading eighth goal of the season to knot the score 1\u20131 with 0:11 on the clock. The second half was another defensive showcase, with both sides shutting out the other.  With regulation time ending tied at 1\u20131, the Cougars tied the school record for most overtime games in a season, with 7 for the third time in four years. Two ten-minute extra-time periods ended with the score still 1\u20131, SIUE still leading the MVC, while Missouri State dropped to third place.<ref>[http://www.missouristatebears.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/110114aaa.html MSU and SIUE Draw, Set Up Huge Final Men's Soccer Weekend - Missouri State University Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Cougars traveled to Charleston for a Tuesday afternoon game in the rain and mud at Eastern Illinois. SIUE dominated almost every facet of the game except goalkeeping. Outshooting the Panthers 18\u20138 and 12\u20136 on goal, the Cougars saw EIU's keeper, Novotny, make 8 saves while Kobernus saved only 3. The offense did get three shots past Eastern's keeper during regulation time, including 2 by junior Lane (only the 2nd and 3rd of his career), and, the score was tied at 3 after 90 minutes. In their school record eighth OT game of the year, the Cougars, playing several non-regulars, went into a second extra period before senior Bauman collected his first career goal and give SIUE their first road victory of the season.<ref>[http://www.eiupanthers.com/news/2014/11/4/MSOC_1104142416.aspx Eastern Illinois Panthers - Men's Soccer Falls In Double Overtime<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe last game of the regular season was at Loyola in Chicago on a Saturday night. Defense was once more the feature, with both sides repeatedly denying scoring chances by taking the ball away before the offenses could set up to shoot.  The Ramblers D was quite physical, resulting in 17 called fouls and 2 yellow cards along with many other plays that could have been called; SIUE was called for only 6 fouls, but Hoguet was booked for committing a hard foul after being twice taken down in the box without a foul being called. The Cougars outshot Loyola 6\u20132, but a Ramblers' counterattack in the 33rd minute caught Kobernus off the line, forcing him to come further out to challenge Bement, who then scored from 15 yards out. SIUE thought they had evened the score in the 89th minute; Bilyeu's shot rattled around in the net, and the Cougars were well into celebrating when the goal was waved off on an offside call made well after the play. With Missouri State defeating Evansville 1\u20130, SIUE dropped to second place in the final MVC standings and the #2 seed in the MVC tournament.<ref>[http://www.loyolaramblers.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/110814aaa.html Ramblers Prevail, 1-0, On Senior Night Over SIU-Edwardsville Loyola University Chicago Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe '''MVC Awards''' were announced at the banquet held on the evening between the tournament quarterfinals and semifinals.

Although SIUE mostly dominated possession and play (outshooting BU 27\u20137), Bradley took the lead in the 22nd minute when, on a counterattack, Lofgren headed in a near-perfect crossing pass. The Cougars kept pressing the action against the Braves' close-checking defense, and in the 78th minute, Bradley was called for a clearly seen shove in the box. Bilyeu buried the penalty kick to tie the match. In the 85th minute, Kendall-Moulin loosed a free kick from near mid-field that arrowed straight to Danzy, who slipped a shot past the diving keeper to give SIUE the lead. Although Bradley tried to press for a tying goal, the Cougar defense held firm, and earned a place in the tourney finals and a rematch with MVC regular season champion Missouri State.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mvc-sports.com/msoccer/news/2014-15/7663/msoc-championship-siue-2-bradley-1/#.VGbL0PnF-So |title=Missouri Valley Conference - MSOC Championship: SIUE 2, Bradley 1<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2014-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023706/http://www.mvc-sports.com/msoccer/news/2014-15/7663/msoc-championship-siue-2-bradley-1/#.VGbL0PnF-So |archive-date=2014-11-29 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nThe MVC Championship game saw the defenses of SIUE and Missouri State repeatedly stifle the other squad's best offensive efforts. The Cougars took more shots, 17\u20139, but the Bears had more shots on goal, 7\u20134. As in their first meeting, the two teams went into double-overtime (another new SIUE record\u2013 9th OT game of the year). In the 108th minute, on an [[ESPN]] Top 10 play, Kendall-Moullin drove a free kick to the left of the goal.

Dal Santo found himself in his first game action since the preseason when Kobernus was injured before the game began. In one more battle where two stalwart defenses repeatedly turned away determined offenses, the Wildcats took more shots, 16\u20139, but SIUE trailed only 7\u20138 in shots on goal, with both keepers making several solid saves. Following a corner kick, there was a wild flurry of action directly in front of the Cougar's goal in the 61st minute\u2014 with multiple Wildcats taking shots and several Cougars trying to clear the ball\u2014 lasting a good 10\u201315 seconds before  the ball went over the end line for a goal kick. In the 81st minute, Hackett drove into the left side of the Northwestern box; the Wildcats blocked his shot and tried to clear; Scheipeter located the loose ball and booted his first goal as a Cougar from five yards out to give SIUE the lead.

Despite SIUE dominating the shooting 16\u20138, Tech's Brad Vorv found himself free and lofted a 25' shot past Kent Kobernus in the 97th minute, giving the Hokies the \"golden goal\" victory.<ref>[http://www.hokiesports.com/msoccer/recaps/20140829aaa.html Hokies open season with 1-0 OT win over SIUE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a day dominated by the heat, with the game punctuated with several water breaks, SIUE and Tulsa missed numerous scoring opportunities, especially on set pieces. The Cougars scored first, with Scheipeter passing up a contested shot to hit Volesky, who faced the open net. A Cougars turnover started the action that led to the Golden Hurricane's Neil putting in a shot from a difficult angle to tie the game. Despite the two sides taking 35 shots (Tulsa leading 23\u201312), the game was mainly a defensive struggle, remaining tied at one goal apiece through regulation and the first extra time period. Cougar goalkeeper Kobernus made his eighth save on another shot by Neil, but when he failed to corral the ball, Barrett put the rebound into the net to give Tulsa the double-overtime \"golden goal\" win.<ref>[http://www.tulsahurricane.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/083114aaa.html Tulsa's Barrett Scores in 101st Minute for Double-Overtime Win - Tulsa Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nPlaying a mid-week game at Memphis, the Cougars dominated early play, with Volesky scoring off a pass from Garet Christianson. As play went on, SIUE seemed to grow complacent and careless, passing beyond intended teammates, directly at defenders, or to no one in particular. As such play continued, the Tigers gained confidence and took control in the last ten minutes of the first half.  Memphis remained in control through the second half, with Khulfan scoring on a breakaway and the Tigers outshooting the Cougars 8\u22124 for the half. SIUE seemed to be back in control in their third extra time game in three matches. They outshot the Tigers 4\u20130 in the first overtime period and took the first shot of the second OT. But Ledbetter then drew his second yellow card and was ejected. Memphis, a man up, immediately applied the pressure and scored only 23 seconds after the red card, giving the Cougars their third \"golden goal\" loss in three games.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gotigersgo.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/090314aab.html |title=Men's Soccer Defeats SIU-Edwardsville in Home Opener - GOTIGERSGO.COM - The Official Website of the University of Memphis Tigers<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2014-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904135256/http://www.gotigersgo.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/090314aab.html |archive-date=2014-09-04 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nHosting undefeated Butler in the first-ever meeting between the two programs, the Cougars set a school record with four consecutive extra time games for the first time in the program's 48-year history. SIUE dominated play in the first half, with Volesky scoring on a pass in the box from Hackett. On Butler's only first half threat, Kendall-Moulin fouled the Bulldog's Goldsmith in the box, with Postlewait scoring on the penalty kick. Butler came out on the offensive to start the second half, taking the first three shots, but the Cougars took charge again, yet were unable to get anything past the Bulldog's goalkeeper. In the first extra period, an SIUE player was fouled amidst a crowd directly in front of the goal mouth; the Cougar's best winning chance of the young season went astray as Volesky's penalty kick bounced off the post and away. The two sides traded possessions, with both defenses turning aside repeated attacks through the second extra time period, and the game ended with SIUE getting its first point of the season on a frustrating draw.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://butlersports.com/sports/m-soccer/2014-15/releases/20140907bbrcv9 |title=Butler, SIUE Play To 1-1 Draw - Butler<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2014-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911091016/http://butlersports.com/sports/m-soccer/2014-15/releases/20140907bbrcv9 |archive-date=2014-09-11 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nIn a mid-week road game, the Cougars once more dominated early play, and Volesky scored his fourth goal in five games off a pass from Garet Christianson. The 'Roos had managed only a couple of long-distance shots before an uncharacteristic turnover by Polster left his SIUE teammates out of position, and UMKC scored an easy tying shot on a rebound of a missed first shot. Sloppy passing and an inability to either score on set pieces or cleanly clear the ball from the defensive end have continued to be a problem at odds with SIUE's strong soccer tradition. Repeated failures to clear set up a second UMKC goal, putting the Cougars into a position of trailing in the score during regulation time for the first time this season. Repeated failures to score on corner kick after corner kick and a Polster penalty kick that was saved by the 'Roos' goalkeeper, McGaughey, left the Cougars with one more loss.<ref>[http://www.umkckangaroos.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&ATCLID=209644603&DB_OEM_ID=18300 'Roos Come From Behind in Home Opening Victory Over SIUE - UMKC Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nTrying for a change in results, the Cougars resorted to changing from single-color uniforms to face DePaul at Korte Stadium. One thing that did change was the early game dominance by SIUE, who surrendered the first goal for the first time since the season opener, when Hunter's rocket of a pass hit Megally just outside the six yard box for an easy shot past a diving Kobernus. The Blue Demons outshot the Cougars in the first half, but SIUE picked up the action after halftime. In the sixtieth minute, Bilyeu fired a pass to a wide-open Ellis, who lofted a chip shot over the DePaul keeper to even the score. Both defenses repeatedly turned aside their opponent, and the match went into extra time for the fifth time in the Cougars' six games. SIUE escaped disaster when the defense held against a free kick from just outside the six yard box after Kobernus fouled by picking up a ball a Cougar had kicked to him, and the first extra period ended with the score still at 1\u20131. The Cougars stepped up the pressure further in the second overtime period, but DePaul's keeper and defense withstood the onslaught, and the game ended a draw, SIUE's second.<ref>[http://www.depaulbluedemons.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/091314aaa.html Megally's Early Goal Leads to 1-1 Double OT Tie at SIU-Edwardsville - DePaul University Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOpening a two-game road trip against ranked Pac-12 teams in California, the Cougars once again scored first against #24 Stanford, with Volesky tapping a loose ball to Polster in the box. Twenty minutes later, the Cardinal's Morris went to the post, drawing Kobernus to him, then tapped a pass to Glover for the tying goal. Stanford was the dominant team in the first half, outshooting the Cougars and taking several corners to the Cougars' none. On a corner kick, the Cardinal's Skundrich fired into the box to the head of Vincent, who scored the go-ahead goal. In the second half, The Cougars outplayed the Cardinal early and late, while Stanford had the better of the middle, but neither side was able to get a shot past the other's keeper, and the home team picked up the win in a game that was much closer than the two teams' records might indicate.<ref>[http://www.gostanford.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30600&ATCLID=209665040 Stanford Battles Back - GoStanford.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon in Berkeley, the Cougars played another closely contested match at the home of a ranked opponent, the #15 California Golden Bears, Cal scored first when Bonomo intercepted a pass in SIUE's defensive end, putting him one-on-one with Kobernus, and he scored in the 17th minute. Only four and a half minutes later, Hallisey passed to Carrera-Garcia and kept going, with Carrera-Garcia completing the give-and-go back to Hallisey and putting the Golden Bears up 2-0. SIUE had an opportunity to close the gap when the Cal goalkeeper committed a foul inside the box, but  Volesky's shot was off the crossbar, and his rebound attempt was wide. The Cougars once again outshot their opponent only to have the other side's goalkeeper make repeated saves, but in the 77th minute, Polster played the ball in to Volesky, who tallied his fifth goal of the season. In another match that was tighter than the opponents' records show, SIUE came out on the short end and head into the MVC schedule while still in search of their first victory.<ref>[http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30100&ATCLID=209667851 No. 15 Cal Wins Its Fifth Consecutive Match, Beats SIUE 2-1 - California Golden Bears - University of California Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOpening the MVC season on a Monday night in Evansville, the Cougars managed to accomplish three things they had not done since the preseason---keep a clean sheet, score more than one goal, and win a game. As has often been the case, SIUE dominated play, outshooting the Purple Aces 8 to 3 in the first half and 7 to 3 in the second, with only 2 of Evansville's shots being on goal and both of those saved by Kobernus. The Cougars got on the scoreboard when Volesky was taken down in the box by the Aces' keeper in the 33rd minute; Garet Christianson put the penalty kick into the open left side of the net. In the second half, briefly Evansville put on a strong showing that resulted in four consecutive corner kicks, but the SIUE defense held off the assault. In the 73rd minute, Polster found a loose ball near the top of the 18 yard box and buried it in the right side of the net to double the lead. The Cougars kept trying for additional scoring, but Evansville's keeper held firm, and SIUE had to be satisfied with the 2\u20130 victory.<ref>[http://www.gopurpleaces.com/news/2014/9/29/MSOC_0929140751.aspx Evansville Athletics - Men's Soccer drops MVC season opener 2-0 to SIUE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn front of a huge Homecoming crowd at Korte Stadium, the Cougars recorded their second consecutive two-goal shutout win. SIUE's defense held off Bradley's MVC-leading offense while the offense outshot the Braves 11\u20136. After the Cougars had been 0\u2013for\u2013the\u2013season on set plays, in the 18th minute, Kendall-Moulin tapped a corner to Bilyeu who tapped it right back to Kendal-Moulinn, whose crossing pass found Volesky's head for the first goal. Eighteen minutes later, inside the eighteen yard box, Volesky passed to Hoguet, who had just entered the game and fired blazing shot into the corner of the net on his first touch. Through the remainder of the game, the Cougars continued to press for additional scoring while their defense frustrated the Braves repeatedly. After two conference games, SIUE and Missouri State sit atop the MVC standings with 2\u20130\u20130 records.<ref>[http://www.bradleybraves.com//ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3400&ATCLID=209697513 SIUE Blanks Bradley Soccer, 2-0 - BRADLEYBRAVES.COM\u2014Official Web Site of Bradley University Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSIUE's third conference game was in Conway, Arkansas, the home of the MVC's other associate member, Central Arkansas. Despite periods of poor passing, the Cougars managed to dominate another opponent, outshooting the Bears in the first half 7\u20131. UCA's keeper was able to stop all of the Cougars' shots on goal, and the teams went to the locker room tied at nil. The home team stepped up their intensity in the second half, and outshot the Cougars 8\u20133. But, in the 60th minute, Polster crossed to Danzy, who headed home his first goal of the season. Less than thirteen minutes, Houget hit a long pass to a breaking Garet Christianson; with the UCA keeper coming out, Christianson got to the ball first and nailed the goal from 25 yards out. The Bears got on the board in the 83rd minute when, on a free kick from just outside the box, a Cougar fouled in the box to set up a penalty kick. Kobernus saved on the PK but was unable to control the rebound that was tapped in by Moquete from 5 yards out. It took the Cougars only 36 seconds to go back up by two; the ball was smoothly played into the UCA end, Ellis crossed to Danzy, and the redshirt junior collected his second goal of the game. After the frustrating start of the season, SIUE has a three-game winning streak and sits alone atop the MVC standings.<ref>[http://ucasports.com/news/2014/10/11/MSOC_1011142758.aspx Central Arkansas Athletics - UCA MEN FALL TO SIUE 3-1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Cougars were inhospitable hosts to Drake and played a game of almost total dominance en route to a 4\u20130 shellacking. Five minutes into the game, Bilyeu took a pass from Kendall-Moullin and fired a high, looping shot from 35 yards out that sank into the top right corner of the net over the Bulldog keeper's reaching hands. On a corner kick in the 37th minute, Drake's keeper turned awy the ball, but Polster found the rebound 4 yards out and buried it, giving SIUE a two-goal lead. Four minutes later, Volesky took a long pass in the open, juked the keeper, then passed off to an even more open Christianson, who put the Cougars up 3\u20130 for the first time in the season. Drake managed to fire off two shots that were high and wide late in the half, and the home squad went to the locker room up by three after outshooting the Bulldogs 7\u20132. The domination continues in the second half as the Cougars outshot the visitors 8\u20130 while eight subs saw action. In the 59th minute, Volesky drove into the box, stumbled and fell, picked himself up, regained the ball, and scored his MVC leading seventh goal of the season. That goal gave SIUE, now 4\u20130\u20130 in MVC games, its widest margin of victory in a conference game since joining the league in 2010. The Cougar win, combined with the Missouri State draw at Loyola, extended their lead in the Valley standings to five points.<ref>[http://www.godrakebulldogs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPID=8125&DB_OEM_ID=15700&ATCLID=209724591 Bulldogs Fall At SIU Edwardsville, 4-0 - GoDrakeBulldogs.com\u2014Official Web site of Drake University Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a Wednesday night in DeKalb, the Cougars started strong but seemed to be continually out of sync without the presence of leading scorer, Christian Volesky. SIUE got off the first four shots of the game and outshot NIU 7\u20134 in the first half. In the eighth minute, Danzy found himself facing an open net but fired wide. In the 17th minute, Danzy went into the box as Christianson shot, but found himself decked by the Huskies' keeper, hustling out for the save. Danzy atoned for what had gone before when he found himself again facing an open goal, driving Ledbetter's pass from behind the defense into the net. Less than a minute and a half later though, it was the Huskies who forced the action, earning a corner kick that Hall drove in a high slicing arc that Kobernus was only able to get a hand on as it sailed into the net for an [[Olympic goal|\"olimpico\"]] goal to knot the score. The Cougars outshot the Huskies 5\u20134 in the second half, but only one SIUE shot was on goal, while not only were all of NIU's shots on goal, Kobernus was able to save only one. The SIUE defense turned back repeated NIU challenges only to see the front line give the ball right back to the home squad. The Huskies took advantage,  scoring three second half goals, and the final 4\u20131 score was the widest victory margin for a Cougars' opponent since SIUE returned to Division I in 2008.<ref>[http://www.niuhuskies.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/102214aaa.html Offense Explodes as Huskies Hammer SIUE - NIUHUSKIES.COM - The Northern Illinois Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a Tuesday night at Louisville's brand new, state-of-the-art stadium, the defenses were at the forefront of the action. The Cardinals outshot the Cougars, but most of their shoots were from long-distance and went high and/or wide. Both defenses repeatedly turned away everything that came at them, and the game turned into the Cougar's sixth overtime game of the season. At the end of 110 minutes of furious action, SIUE had played the  #22 ranked Cardinals to a 0\u20130 draw.<ref>[http://www.gocards.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/102814aaa.html No. 9 Cardinals Draw with SIU Edwardsville - GoCards.com | Official Website of University of Louisville Athletics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn a frigid Saturday night at Korte, the Cougars played the Missouri State Bears for possession of first place in the MVC. As expected, the defenses dominated the game, with both teams spending much time trying to maintain possession of the ball, then attacking and being turned aside. In the 24th minute, only seconds after making a solid save, Kobernus was caught out of position as the Bears' Roberts chipped a shot over him and into the net to give State the lead. As time ran down in the first  half, Volesky was fouled hard about 25 yards out. Bilyeu fired the free kick into the box, and Volesky headed in his league-leading eighth goal of the season to knot the score 1\u20131 with 0:11 on the clock. The second half was another defensive showcase, with both sides shutting out the other.  With regulation time ending tied at 1\u20131, the Cougars tied the school record for most overtime games in a season, with 7 for the third time in four years. Two ten-minute extra-time periods ended with the score still 1\u20131, SIUE still leading the MVC, while Missouri State dropped to third place.<ref>[http://www.missouristatebears.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/110114aaa.html MSU and SIUE Draw, Set Up Huge Final Men's Soccer Weekend - Missouri State University Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Cougars traveled to Charleston for a Tuesday afternoon game in the rain and mud at Eastern Illinois. SIUE dominated almost every facet of the game except goalkeeping. Outshooting the Panthers 18\u20138 and 12\u20136 on goal, the Cougars saw EIU's keeper, Novotny, make 8 saves while Kobernus saved only 3. The offense did get three shots past Eastern's keeper during regulation time, including 2 by junior Lane (only the 2nd and 3rd of his career), and, the score was tied at 3 after 90 minutes. In their school record eighth OT game of the year, the Cougars, playing several non-regulars, went into a second extra period before senior Bauman collected his first career goal and give SIUE their first road victory of the season.<ref>[http://www.eiupanthers.com/news/2014/11/4/MSOC_1104142416.aspx Eastern Illinois Panthers - Men's Soccer Falls In Double Overtime<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe last game of the regular season was at Loyola in Chicago on a Saturday night. Defense was once more the feature, with both sides repeatedly denying scoring chances by taking the ball away before the offenses could set up to shoot.  The Ramblers D was quite physical, resulting in 17 called fouls and 2 yellow cards along with many other plays that could have been called; SIUE was called for only 6 fouls, but Hoguet was booked for committing a hard foul after being twice taken down in the box without a foul being called. The Cougars outshot Loyola 6\u20132, but a Ramblers' counterattack in the 33rd minute caught Kobernus off the line, forcing him to come further out to challenge Bement, who then scored from 15 yards out. SIUE thought they had evened the score in the 89th minute; Bilyeu's shot rattled around in the net, and the Cougars were well into celebrating when the goal was waved off on an offside call made well after the play. With Missouri State defeating Evansville 1\u20130, SIUE dropped to second place in the final MVC standings and the #2 seed in the MVC tournament.<ref>[http://www.loyolaramblers.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/110814aaa.html Ramblers Prevail, 1-0, On Senior Night Over SIU-Edwardsville Loyola University Chicago Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe '''MVC Awards''' were announced at the banquet held on the evening between the tournament quarterfinals and semifinals.

Although SIUE mostly dominated possession and play (outshooting BU 27\u20137), Bradley took the lead in the 22nd minute when, on a counterattack, Lofgren headed in a near-perfect crossing pass. The Cougars kept pressing the action against the Braves' close-checking defense, and in the 78th minute, Bradley was called for a clearly seen shove in the box. Bilyeu buried the penalty kick to tie the match. In the 85th minute, Kendall-Moulin loosed a free kick from near mid-field that arrowed straight to Danzy, who slipped a shot past the diving keeper to give SIUE the lead. Although Bradley tried to press for a tying goal, the Cougar defense held firm, and earned a place in the tourney finals and a rematch with MVC regular season champion Missouri State.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mvc-sports.com/msoccer/news/2014-15/7663/msoc-championship-siue-2-bradley-1/#.VGbL0PnF-So |title=Missouri Valley Conference - MSOC Championship: SIUE 2, Bradley 1<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2014-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023706/http://www.mvc-sports.com/msoccer/news/2014-15/7663/msoc-championship-siue-2-bradley-1/#.VGbL0PnF-So |archive-date=2014-11-29 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nThe MVC Championship game saw the defenses of SIUE and Missouri State repeatedly stifle the other squad's best offensive efforts. The Cougars took more shots, 17\u20139, but the Bears had more shots on goal, 7\u20134. As in their first meeting, the two teams went into double-overtime (another new SIUE record\u2013 9th OT game of the year). In the 108th minute, on an [[ESPN]] Top 10 play, Kendall-Moullin drove a free kick to the left of the goal. Danzy leapt above the crowd and headed the ball into the right side of the net to give the Cougars their first MVC Tournament Championship and send SIUE to the [[NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship]] tournament for the first time since 1982.<ref name=\"MVC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mvc-sports.com/msoccer/news/2014-15/7668/siue-wins-first-ever-mens-soccer-championship/#.VGkjhvnF-So |title=Missouri Valley Conference - SIUE Win's First-Ever Men's Soccer Championship<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2014-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129033608/http://www.mvc-sports.com/msoccer/news/2014-15/7668/siue-wins-first-ever-mens-soccer-championship/#.VGkjhvnF-So |archive-date=2014-11-29 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the conference tournament, '''Jabari Danzy''' was named ''MVC Tournament MVP'' and was joined on the ''2014 MVC Men's Soccer All-Tournament Team'' by teammates '''Justin Bilyeu''', '''Kent Kobernus''', and '''Matt Polster'''.<ref name=\"MVC\"/>  For his efforts, '''Danzy''' was also named to the Team of the Week for both ''Top Drawer Soccer''<ref>[http://www.topdrawersoccer.com/college-soccer-articles/mens-team-of-the-week:-nov-10-16_aid35432 Men\u2019s Team of the Week: Nov. 10-16 | College Soccer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and ''College Soccer News''.<ref>[http://www.collegesoccernews.com/index.php/awards/team-of-the-week/708-college-soccer-news-national-team-of-the-week-week-ending-november-16-2015 College Soccer News National Team Of The Week - Week Ending November 16, 2015 - CollegeSoccerNews.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn Monday, November 17, the tournament brackets were announced.

Dal Santo found himself in his first game action since the preseason when Kobernus was injured before the game began. In one more battle where two stalwart defenses repeatedly turned away determined offenses, the WIldcats took more shots, 16\u20139, but SIUE trailed only 7\u20138 in shots on goal, with both keepers making several solid saves. Following a corner kick, there was a wild flurry of action directly in front of the Cougar's goal in the 61st minute\u2014 with multiple Wildcats taking shots and several Cougars trying to clear the ball\u2014 lasting a good 10\u201315 seconds before  the ball went over the end line for a goal kick. In the 81st minute, Hackett drove into the left side of the Northwestern box; the WIldcats blocked his shot and tried to clear; Scheipeter located the loose ball and booted his first goal as a Cougar from five yards out to give SIUE the lead. Over the last nine minutes, Northwestern pushed hard, even bringing their All-Big 10 keeper to midfield, but the Cougars' defense held firm for the victory and the right to return to California for a rematch with #18 California in the second round of the tournament.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nusports.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/112014aaa.html |title=Wildcats Fall 1-0 To SIUE In NCAA Tournament - NUSPORTS.COM - The Northwestern Official Athletic Site<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2014-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129042246/http://www.nusports.com/sports/m-soccer/recaps/112014aaa.html |archive-date=2014-11-29 |url-status=dead|df= }}</ref>\n\nIn the return trip to California, SIUE took three of the first four and the last three shots in the game, but Cal, the NCAA's top-scoring team, outshot them for the game, 18\u201311.

He is a charter member of the [[Warriors Three]], a trio of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] adventurers and supporting cast of ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n[[Tadanobu Asano]] portrayed the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Thor (movie)|Thor]]'' (2011), ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013), and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017).\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=June 2014}}\nHogun first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #119 (August, 1965), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nWriter [[Stan Lee]] envisioned him as sharing several traits with characters played by actor [[Charles Bronson]].<ref name=\"bronson\">Cooke, Jon B. (Editor); [[Thomas, Roy]] (Interviewer).

They were members of the supporting cast in Marvel's [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] comics and usually provided comic relief and side-adventures.\n\nHogun is not Aesir like most of the Asgardians. Also, his unnamed homeland was conquered long ago by [[Mogul of the Mystic Mountain]], who slew Hogun's forebears and laid waste to the land.<ref name=\"thor137\">''Thor'' #137 (February 1967)</ref> For a time he was apprenticed to the stone carvers. He joined with Volstagg and Fandral to judge a dare and formed a lifelong friendship. This dare, the \"petting\" of the Fenris wolf, led to a humiliating defeat for all three men. Afterwards, legends and tales would then stop referring to Hogun in cheerful terms and use dour, negative names.<ref>''Warriors Three'' #1-4 (2010-2011)</ref>\n\nHe is primarily characterized by his brusque, taciturn, and often short-tempered demeanor. He is the brooding pessimist of the group, as opposed to [[Volstagg]]'s irrepressible good humor and [[Fandral]]'s brash heroism. He is a fierce and unrelenting warrior, a collector of weaponry and often the voice of reason for the Warriors Three.\n\nHogun has been involved in a great many adventures and quests, as a member of the Warriors Three, as an ally of Thor, and on his own. When first seen, Hogun had joined the quest for the power that had cracked the Oversword of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref name=\"jim119\">''Journey into Mystery'' #119 (August 1965)</ref> Soon after that, he helped quell a mutiny led by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref name=\"jim122\">''Journey into Mystery'' #122 (November 1965)</ref> He then helped repel an attack of Flying Trolls in Thryheim.<ref name=\"jim124125\">''Journey into Mystery'' #124-125 (January - February 1966)</ref> With Thor, he helped defeat the forces of Harokin.<ref name=\"thor129131\">''Thor'' #129-131 (June - August 1966)</ref> With Thor, he then battled the dragon [[Fafnir (Marvel Comics)|Fafnir]].<ref name=\"thor134136\">''Thor'' #134-136 (November 1966 - January 1967)</ref> With Thor, he defeated the Mogul of the Mystic Mountain, who had destroyed Hogun's homeland so long ago.<ref name=\"thor137145\">''Thor'' #137-145 (February 1967 - October 1967)</ref> He helped defend Asgard from the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref name=\"thora2\">''Thor Annual'' #2 (September 1966)</ref> He encountered the [[Hulk]].<ref name=\"tta101\">''Tales to Astonish'' #101 (March 1968)</ref><ref name=\"ih102\">''Incredible Hulk'' #102 (April 1968)</ref>\n\nHogun helped defend Asgard against [[Mangog]].<ref name=\"thor155157\">''Thor'' #155-157 (August - October 1968)</ref> He encountered the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref name=\"ss4\">''Silver Surfer'' #4 (February 1969)</ref> With Thor, he battled the Thermal Man.<ref name=\"thor169170\">''Thor'' #169-170 (October - November 1969)</ref> He helped defend Asgard against [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref name=\"thor177\">''Thor'' #177 (June 1970)</ref> He helped Thor escape [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref name=\"thor180181\">''Thor'' #180-181 (September - October 1970)</ref> He became entranced by [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]] and was forced to battle Thor, [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], [[Sif (comics)|Sif]], and other Asgardians.

Hogun realizes the boys needed something more in order to grow and prosper in Asgard. He gave them portions of the Apples of Idunn, fruit that gave the gods long life and strength. Hogun and Fandral also convey to the boys that any child of Volstagg's is their child as well and will be watched out for.<ref>''Thor'' #374-376 (1987)</ref>\n\nHe was then sent to Earth to locate Thor, but suffered a concussion and dementia. He battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and was marked for death by [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]].<ref name=\"thor392393\">''Thor'' #392-393 (June - July 1988)</ref><ref name=\"thor395\">''Thor'' #395 (September 1988)</ref> Hogun learned the value of trickery and silliness over a mace blow in an adventure that saved a stricken groomsman and saved Asgard from certain doom.<ref name=\"mf36\">''Marvel Fanfare'' #34-36 (1987-1988)</ref> He helped to defend Asgard against the forces of Seth.<ref name=\"thor398400\">''Thor'' #398-400 (December 1988 - February 1989)</ref> His quest with Thor to seek Ulagg the Grand Enchanter was later recounted.<ref name=\"thor404406\">''Thor'' #404-406 (June - August 1989)</ref> He helped the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battle [[Blastaar]].<ref name=\"avengers310\">''Avengers'' #310 (November 1989)</ref> He was rescued from Flying Trolls by the New Mutants.<ref name=\"nm84\">''New Mutants'' #84 (December 1989)</ref> Hogun also helped battle [[Ymir (Marvel Comics)|Ymir]] and Surtur.<ref name=\"thor421426\">''Thor'' #421-426 (August - November 1990)</ref>\n\nIn 2005 a mini-series was published centering on Thor and his allies in the Warriors Three, called ''Thor: Blood Oath''. In it Thor and the Warriors Three are sent on a quest as penance for accidentally killing an enemy giant during a time of peace. Hogun heroically endures the assaults of the Egyptian god, Thoth, to shout three names at Thoth's temple to fulfill their quest. He was also the only member of the group able to dominate the bloodthirsty spirit of Chulain's spear, and prevent a murderous rampage. Although the group fails in their quest, through the use of each warrior's unique capabilities, the adventure eventually comes to a good end.\n\nHogun dies in [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] fairly early.<ref name=\"thorv282\">''Thor'' vol. 2, #82 (September 2004)</ref> Later, however, he is found alive and well, under the name Leo Kincaid, and was restored by Thor.<ref name=\"thorv34\">''Thor'' vol. 3, #4 (December 2007)</ref> He establishes a new life in Asgard. Hogun is one of the army of Asgardians and Earth based heroes who help protect it during the 'Siege' invasion; Norman Osborn had attacked with an army of Earth supervillains.<ref>''New Avengers'' #63 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nWhen Thor vanishes and Mjolnir chooses a female wielder, Hogun and Fandral quest throughout the known galaxy for the Odinson. This is especially important as Odin himself has become irrational. Volstagg chooses to stay behind, having taken on many duties, including the care of Thor's lady love [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], who has become ill.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #3 (January 2016)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHogun possesses the conventional superhuman abilities of an Asgardian male.\n\nHogun is superhumanly strong, his strength being somewhat greater than that of the average Asgardian. Hogun is also extremely long lived, though not immortal, and ages at a pace much slower than humans. The tissues of his body are also more resilient than those of a human, rendering him much more resistant to physical injury. If he is injured, his body is able to heal itself with superhuman speed and efficiency. Hogun's superior musculature and metabolism grants him superhuman levels of stamina. Like all Asgardians, Hogun's bone, skin and muscle are much denser than that of a human, which helps to contribute to his superhuman strength and durability.\n\nHogun is an excellent overall battlefield warrior, a superb hand-to-hand combatant and horseman. He is highly proficient in the use of all Asgardian weapons, and is a master of bludgeoning weapons, especially the mace. He is also sometimes armed with a sword.

They were members of the supporting cast in Marvel's [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] comics and usually provided comic relief and side-adventures.\n\nHogun is not Aesir like most of the Asgardians. Also, his unnamed homeland was conquered long ago by [[Mogul of the Mystic Mountain]], who slew Hogun's forebears and laid waste to the land.<ref name=\"thor137\">''Thor'' #137 (Feb. 1967)</ref> For a time he was apprenticed to the stone carvers. He joined with Volstagg and Fandral to judge a dare and formed a lifelong friendship. This dare, the \"petting\" of the Fenris wolf, led to a humiliating defeat for all three men. Afterwards, legends and tales would then stop referring to Hogun in cheerful terms and use dour, negative names.<ref>''Warriors Three'' #1-4 (2010-2011)</ref>\n\nHe is primarily characterized by his brusque, taciturn, and often short-tempered demeanor. He is the brooding pessimist of the group, as opposed to [[Volstagg]]'s irrepressible good humor and [[Fandral]]'s brash heroism. He is a fierce and unrelenting warrior, a collector of weaponry and often the voice of reason for the Warriors Three.\n\nHogun has been involved in a great many adventures and quests, as a member of the Warriors Three, as an ally of Thor, and on his own. When first seen, Hogun had joined the quest for the power that had cracked the Oversword of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref name=\"jim119\">''Journey into Mystery'' #119 (Aug. 1965)</ref> Soon after that, he helped quell a mutiny led by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref name=\"jim122\">''Journey into Mystery'' #122 (Nov. 1965)</ref> He then helped repel an attack of Flying Trolls in Thryheim.<ref name=\"jim124125\">''Journey into Mystery'' #124-125 (Jan. - Feb. 1966)</ref> With Thor, he helped defeat the forces of Harokin.<ref name=\"thor129131\">''Thor'' #129-131 (June - Aug. 1966)</ref> With Thor, he then battled the dragon [[Fafnir (Marvel Comics)|Fafnir]].<ref name=\"thor134136\">''Thor'' #134-136 (Nov. 1966 - Jan. 1967)</ref> With Thor, he defeated the Mogul of the Mystic Mountain, who had destroyed Hogun's homeland so long ago.<ref name=\"thor137145\">''Thor'' #137-145 (Feb. 1967 - Oct. 1967)</ref> He helped defend Asgard from the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref name=\"thora2\">''Thor Annual'' #2 (Sept. 1966)</ref> He encountered the [[Hulk]].<ref name=\"tta101\">''Tales to Astonish'' #101 (Mar. 1968)</ref><ref name=\"ih102\">''Incredible Hulk'' #102 (Apr. 1968)</ref>\n\nHogun helped defend Asgard against [[Mangog]].<ref name=\"thor155157\">''Thor'' #155-157 (Aug. - Oct. 1968)</ref> He encountered the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref name=\"ss4\">''Silver Surfer'' #4 (Feb. 1969)</ref> With Thor, he battled the Thermal Man.<ref name=\"thor169170\">''Thor'' #169-170 (Oct. - Nov. 1969)</ref> He helped defend Asgard against [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref name=\"thor177\">''Thor'' #177 (June 1970)</ref> He helped Thor escape [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref name=\"thor180181\">''Thor'' #180-181 (Sept. - Oct. 1970)</ref> He became entranced by [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]] and was forced to battle Thor, [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], [[Sif (comics)|Sif]], and other Asgardians.

In it Thor and the Warriors Three are sent on a quest as penance for accidentally killing an enemy giant during a time of peace. Hogun heroically endures the assaults of the Egyptian god, Thoth, to shout three names at Thoth's temple to fulfill their quest. He was also the only member of the group able to dominate the bloodthirsty spirit of Chulain's spear, and prevent a murderous rampage. Although the group fails in their quest, through the use of each warrior's unique capabilities, the adventure eventually comes to a good end.\n\nHogun dies in [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] fairly early.<ref name=\"thorv282\">''Thor'' vol. 2, #82 (Sept. 2004)</ref> Later, however, he is found alive and well, under the name Leo Kincaid, and was restored by Thor.<ref name=\"thorv34\">''Thor'' vol. 3, #4 (Dec. 2007)</ref> He establishes a new life in Asgard. Hogun is one of the army of Asgardians and Earth based heroes who help protect it during the 'Siege' invasion; Norman Osborn had attacked with an army of Earth supervillains.<ref>''New Avengers'' #63 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nWhen Thor vanishes and Mjolnir chooses a female wielder, Hogun and Fandral quest throughout the known galaxy for the Odinson. This is especially important as Odin himself has become irrational. Volstagg chooses to stay behind, having taken on many duties, including the care of Thor's lady love [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], who has become ill.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #3 (Jan. 2016)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHogun possesses the conventional superhuman abilities of an Asgardian male.\n\nHogun is superhumanly strong, his strength being somewhat greater than that of the average Asgardian. Hogun is also extremely long lived, though not immortal, and ages at a pace much slower than humans. The tissues of his body are also more resilient than those of a human, rendering him much more resistant to physical injury. If he is injured, his body is able to heal itself with superhuman speed and efficiency. Hogun's superior musculature and metabolism grants him superhuman levels of stamina. Like all Asgardians, Hogun's bone, skin and muscle are much denser than that of a human, which helps to contribute to his superhuman strength and durability.\n\nHogun is an excellent overall battlefield warrior, a superb hand-to-hand combatant and horseman. He is highly proficient in the use of all Asgardian weapons, and is a master of bludgeoning weapons, especially the mace. He is also sometimes armed with a sword. He has also demonstrated skill in the area of battlefield medicine and healing arts, though he makes no claim of being a healer of any real proficiency. He has also used the Elixir of Recovery, an Asgardian medical potion.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Earth X===\nIn the alternate ''[[Earth X]]'' reality, the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]]s were actually aliens that were manipulated by the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]s into believing they were the Gods of Norse myth.

look at how we interpret words and how easily we accept things not actually said.\"<ref name=\"Small\" /> Andrew Parker calls the short a \"witty blending of semantics and melodrama\": \"Not only a discussion about the use of metaphor in a literary and cinematic sense, Cockburn has also created a short that's dripping with visual metaphor in its own right, building to a sumptuous, layered film.\"<ref name=\"Parker\" /> In Sicinski's review, he suggests that calling it a \"theory film\" would risk relegating it to the \"circular file\", and then adds: \"Nevertheless, the film is so fitfully alive that we could probably count on it to crawl back out under its own power.\"<ref name=\"Sicinski\" />\n\nJamie Dunn calls the transition from what the film appears to be, \"a smug essay film splicing together scenes from a myriad of familiar works\" which makes \"some very spurious arguments about the nature of metaphor in cinema\", into \"an indie drama\", something \"wonderful\":<blockquote>Just when you think your eyes can't roll any further back into your head something wonderful happens, and we start to follow the woman, a septuagenarian professor, who's made

look at how we interpret words and how easily we accept things not actually said.\"<ref name=\"Small\" /> Andrew Parker calls the short a \"witty blending of semantics and melodrama\": \"Not only a discussion about the use of metaphor in a literary and cinematic sense, Cockburn has also created a short that's dripping with visual metaphor in its own right, building to a sumptuous, layered film.\"<ref name=\"Parker\" /> In Sicinski's review, he suggests that calling it a \"theory film\" would risk relegating it to the \"circular file\", and then adds: \"Nevertheless, the film is so fitfully alive that we could probably count on it to crawl back out under its own power.\"<ref name=\"Sicinski\" />\n\nJamie Dunn calls the transition from what the film appears to be, \"a smug essay film splicing together scenes from a myriad of familiar works\" which makes \"some very spurious arguments about the nature of metaphor in cinema\", into \"an indie drama\", something
