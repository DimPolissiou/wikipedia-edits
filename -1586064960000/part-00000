The fraternity has around 250 active and inactive chapters and colonies in the United States and has initiated more than 250,000 members.<ref name=joinato/> VMI Cadets are no longer associated with the fraternity. In 1885, the VMI Board of Visitors ruled that cadets could no longer join fraternities based on the belief that allegiance to a fraternal group undermined the cohesiveness of and loyalty to the Corps of Cadets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives/vmi-archives-faqs/vmi-history-and-records-faq/|title=VMI History and Records FAQ - VMI Archives - Virginia Military Institute|author=|date=|website=www.vmi.edu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlpha Tau Omega represents one-third of the [[Lexington Triad]], along with [[Kappa Alpha Order]] and [[Sigma Nu]]. The Fraternity does not have chapters or affiliations outside the United States. The fraternity's non-profit organization is The ATO Foundation, which provides scholarships to its members.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Virginia Military Institue.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Virginia Military Institute.|220px]]\n\nAlpha Tau Omega was founded at the [[Virginia Military Institute]] on September 11, 1865, by Otis Allan Glazebrook, [[Erskine Mayo Ross]], and Alfred Marshall. Glazebrook's plan was to use [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|Christian brotherly love]] as a way to help facilitate reconciliation between the North and South in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=Expansion>{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/Expansion.aspx|title=Alpha Tau Omega: Expansion|work=ato.org|access-date=2014-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529210701/http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/Expansion.aspx|archive-date=2014-05-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Glazebrook, Marshall and Ross, there are two others who are considered \"second founders\": [[Thomas Arkle Clark]], the first [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of education at the [[University of Illinois]] who served the national fraternity president for all or parts of four terms, and Joseph R. Anderson who was president during a membership crisis.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nPrevious Headquarters have been located in Champaign, Illinois. Currently the National Fraternity is located in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nAlpha Tau Omega is a member of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nicfraternity.org/member-fraternities/|title=Member Fraternities|website=North American Interfraternity Conference|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n\nAlpha Tau Omega has three publications, ''The Palm'', which is the fraternity's semi-annual general magazine; ''ATO Leader'', which is a bimonthly newsletter for chapter presidents and other organization leaders;<ref name=Expansion/> and ATO Roadshow, which is a website designed to highlight individual chapter accomplishments and combat negative perceptions of fraternities.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHAT IS ATO ROADSHOW|url=http://www.atoroadshow.org/what-is-ato-roadshow.aspx|accessdate=3 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607000233/http://www.atoroadshow.org/what-is-ato-roadshow.aspx|archive-date=2014-06-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Membership Programs==\n\nThe fraternity holds several retreats and training conferences: Altitude, Encounter, Valiant, President's Retreat, and Emerging Leaders Conference.\n\nAltitude is a rigorous leadership program designed to challenge ATO brothers physically, mentally and emotionally. The six-day adventure is spent backpacking the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains with the goal of peaking a 14,000 foot summit. Throughout the trip, truths involving leadership are reinforced. The week out West is designed to inspire men to lead their chapters more effectively.\n\nEncounter is a three-day retreat designed to allow brothers to explore or deepen their spiritual identity. Through the retreat, brothers will focus on Glazebrook's belief that unconditional love as exemplified by Jesus is a powerful and regenerating dynamic.\n\nValiant Leadership Training program guides nearly 100 members through values-based curriculum on how to lead with integrity. The intense programming places strong emphasis on basic components of effective leadership, communication, ethics, goal setting and teamwork.\n\nParticipants must be in good standing with their chapter in order to participate in Altitude, Encounter, and Valiant programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/leadershipdevelopment/Altitude.aspx|title=Alpha Tau Omega: Altitude|work=ato.org}}</ref>\n\nPresident's Retreat, held every January in Indianapolis, is geared to better ensure that every ATO chapter President is prepared to take on his role and responsibilities. The weekend conference is packed with general leadership and chapter management information as well as unique opportunities to address individual chapter issues and initiatives. The Conference has evolved over time to now incorporate every Chapter President, Vice President, and Membership Educator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/leadershipdevelopment/PresidentsRetreat.aspx|title=Alpha Tau Omega: Presidents Retreat|work=ato.org}}</ref>\n\nEmerging Leaders Conferences is held every year in more than 20 cities across the United States serving almost 3,000 undergraduate members. The day-long program is designed to reinforce ATO for a Lifetime and demonstrate the benefits of belonging to a strong National Fraternity. Emerging Leaders Conference is designed to help every brother appreciate the importance of enhancing and strengthening their chapter experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/leadershipdevelopment/EmergingLeadersConference.aspx|title=Alpha Tau Omega: Emerging Leaders Conference|work=ato.org}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these, [[LeaderShape]] was started in 1986 by the fraternity, and was exclusive to members until 1988. LeaderShape was spun off into its own organization which holds week-long leadership and networking retreats for college-age students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leadershape.org/about-history.aspx|title=About|work=leadershape.org}}</ref>\n\n==Foundation==\n\nIn 1935, Erskine Mayo Ross started the Alpha Tau Omega Foundation with a donation of $5,000. The foundation is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization that provides educational opportunities and scholarships for the members of Alpha Tau Omega. Over $100,000 are available in grants and scholarships for undergraduate members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.org/ATOFoundation.aspx|title=Alpha Tau Omega Foundation|work=ato.org}}</ref>\n\n== Richmond Property Group ==\nRichmond Property Group, RPG, is designed to offer full scale professional property management to preserve and protect the real estate assets of ATO.

Glazebrook's plan was to use [[Brotherly love (philosophy)|Christian brotherly love]] as a way to help facilitate reconciliation between the North and South in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=Expansion>{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/Expansion.aspx|title=Alpha Tau Omega: Expansion|work=ato.org|access-date=2014-05-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529210701/http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/Expansion.aspx|archive-date=2014-05-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Glazebrook, Marshall and Ross, there are two others who are considered \"second founders\": [[Thomas Arkle Clark]], the first [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of education at the [[University of Illinois]] who served the national fraternity president for all or parts of four terms, and Joseph R. Anderson who was president during a membership crisis.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nPrevious Headquarters have been located in Champaign, Illinois. Currently the National Fraternity is located in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nAlpha Tau Omega is a member of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nicfraternity.org/member-fraternities/|title=Member Fraternities|website=North American Interfraternity Conference|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n\nAlpha Tau Omega has three publications, ''The Palm'', which is the fraternity's semi-annual general magazine; ''ATO Leader'', which is a bimonthly newsletter for chapter presidents and other organization leaders;<ref name=Expansion/> and ATO Roadshow, which is a website designed to highlight individual chapter accomplishments and combat negative perceptions of fraternities.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHAT IS ATO ROADSHOW|url=http://www.atoroadshow.org/what-is-ato-roadshow.aspx|accessdate=3 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607000233/http://www.atoroadshow.org/what-is-ato-roadshow.aspx|archive-date=2014-06-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Membership Programs==\n\nThe fraternity holds several retreats and training conferences: Altitude, Encounter, Valiant, President's Retreat, and Emerging Leaders Conference.\n\nAltitude is a rigorous leadership program designed to challenge ATO brothers physically, mentally and emotionally. The six-day adventure is spent backpacking the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains with the goal of peaking a 14,000 foot summit. Throughout the trip, truths involving leadership are reinforced. The week out West is designed to inspire men to lead their chapters more effectively.\n\nEncounter is a three-day retreat designed to allow brothers to explore or deepen their spiritual identity. Through the retreat, brothers will focus on Glazebrook's belief that unconditional love as exemplified by Jesus is a powerful and regenerating dynamic.\n\nValiant Leadership Training program guides nearly 100 members through values-based curriculum on how to lead with integrity. The intense programming places strong emphasis on basic components of effective leadership, communication, ethics, goal setting and teamwork.\n\nParticipants must be in good standing with their chapter in order to participate in Altitude, Encounter, and Valiant programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/leadershipdevelopment/Altitude.aspx|title=Alpha Tau Omega: Altitude|work=ato.org}}</ref>\n\nPresident's Retreat, held every January in Indianapolis, is geared to better ensure that every ATO chapter President is prepared to take on his role and responsibilities. The weekend conference is packed with general leadership and chapter management information as well as unique opportunities to address individual chapter issues and initiatives. The Conference has evolved over time to now incorporate every Chapter President, Vice President, and Membership Educator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/leadershipdevelopment/PresidentsRetreat.aspx|title=Alpha Tau Omega: Presidents Retreat|work=ato.org}}</ref>\n\nEmerging Leaders Conferences is held every year in more than 20 cities across the United States serving almost 3,000 undergraduate members. The day-long program is designed to reinforce ATO for a Lifetime and demonstrate the benefits of belonging to a strong National Fraternity. Emerging Leaders Conference is designed to help every brother appreciate the importance of enhancing and strengthening their chapter experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.org/alphatauomega/leadershipdevelopment/EmergingLeadersConference.aspx|title=Alpha Tau Omega: Emerging Leaders Conference|work=ato.org}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these, [[LeaderShape]] was started in 1986 by the fraternity, and was exclusive to members until 1988.

The foundation is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization that provides educational opportunities and scholarships for the members of Alpha Tau Omega.

Amazon launched Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), originally called Digital Text Platform, to be used by authors and publishers, to independently publish their books directly to the [[Kindle Store]].\n\nAuthors can upload documents in several formats for delivery via [[Whispernet]] and charge between $0.99 and $200.00 for their works.<ref name=\"kindle-dtp\" /> These documents may be written in 34 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A9FDO0A3V0119 |title=Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing: Get help with self-publishing your book to Amazon's Kindle Store |publisher=Kdp.amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Amazon also added a [[paperback]] option, which uses [[print-on-demand]] technology with the goal of offering digital and print to self-publishers. Amazon has been promoting to its authors the capability of publishing both e-books and paperbacks through the same platform.\n\n== History ==\n\nKindle Direct Publishing (KDP) was in open [[beta testing]] in late 2007 and the platform was promoted to established authors by [[Email|e-mail]] and by advertisements at Amazon.com.<ref name=\"kindle-dtp\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/11/27/why-kindle-will-change-the-world.aspx |work=[[Motley Fool]] |title=Why Kindle Will Change the World |first=Rick Aristotle |last=Munarriz |date=November 27, 2007 |accessdate=November 27, 2007}}</ref> In a December 5, 2009 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos revealed that Amazon keeps 65% of the revenue from all e-book sales for the Kindle.<ref>{{Cite news  | last = Solomon  | first = Deborah | authorlink = Deborah Solomon  | title = Questions for Jeffrey P.

Theta Chi has initiated more than 191,000 members and currently has over 8,000 undergraduate members across North America.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding and early years at Norwich===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width = 130\n | image1 = Fredrick Norton Freeman.jpg\n | alt1 = Fredrick Norton Freeman\n | caption1 = Fredrick Norton Freeman\n | image2 = Arthur Chase.jpg\n | alt2 = Arthur Chase\n | caption2 = Arthur Chase\n}}\nTheta Chi was founded on April 10, 1856, at [[Norwich University]] in Norwich, Vermont, by two military cadets, [[Frederick Norton Freeman]] and [[Arthur Chase]]. A third man, Egbert Phelps, is considered to be the \"assistant founder\" for lending his help and advice to Freeman and Chase after transferring to Union College in 1854 (he was a member of the [[Chi Psi]] fraternity). The first initiates after the founders were [[Edward Bancroft Williston]] and Lorenzo Potter, both initiated on April 11, 1856.\n\nTheta Chi's early history is closely connected to the history of Norwich University. In 1866 a massive fire devastated the university, completely destroying the Old South Barracks, where the Fraternity had been founded. This disaster prompted the university to move from Norwich, Vermont to its present location in [[Northfield, Vermont]]. In 1873 the University nearly closed due to financial reasons, however brother Charles Dole, then serving as a professor at the University, met all of the University's financial obligations from his own pocket, saving the institution. During fall quarter in 1881, Norwich University was reduced to only 12 students and Theta Chi's membership was reduced to one undergraduate member, James M. Holland (1883). In November of that year, Phil S. Randall and Henry B. Hersey approached Holland and insisted that they be allowed to join Theta Chi; Holland agreed, thus saving the Fraternity from extinction.<ref>Chapman, George W. The Manual of Theta Chi. Ed. Dale A.

There were early efforts to expand Theta Chi to both [[Dartmouth College]] and [[Union College]] but because of the anti-expansion sentiment among members of the Alpha chapter and unstable conditions at the University, it remained a single entity for 46 years. However, on December 13, 1902 the Beta chapter was installed at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] after brother P.V. Perkins transferred there from Norwich and petitioned Alpha Chapter for a charter. A Grand Chapter was organized in 1908 to direct the fraternity and promote its growth. On April 14, 1942, [[Beta Kappa]] fraternity merged with Theta Chi (with the exception of the chapter at Georgia Tech which chose to become a chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha), bringing 16 undergraduate chapters and over 6,000 undergraduate and alumnus members into the ranks. Unlike other Fraternity mergers, Beta Kappa was completely absorbed into Theta Chi with no changes to the name or Ritual. The Foundation chapter was established in 1953 as a charity to provide educational scholarships and assistance. In 1965, the Zeta Gamma chapter was installed at the [[University of Alberta]] in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, making Theta Chi an international fraternity.\n\n==Ideals, traditions, and symbols==\n\n[[File:Old South Barracks.jpg|thumb|Old South Barracks]]\n\nThe Greek motto of Theta Chi is ''\u0398\u03b7\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b1 \u03a7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1'', which is translated as \"An Assisting Hand.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Leaders, Scholars and Teachers|url=https://www.thetachi.org/why-join|accessdate=April 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123044321/http://www.thetachi.org/why-join|archive-date=January 23, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Theta Chi's motto was secret from the founding in 1856 until the 1930s, at which time it was made public and incorporated into the fraternity's coat of arms.\n\nWhen Freeman and Chase founded Theta Chi in 1856 they very clearly spelled out the purpose of the Fraternity in the original Constitution. Article I stated that the objects of Theta Chi were to \"bind by closer bonds the members to each other and the mutual assistance of each of its members;\" \"the advancement and carrying out of any measures at the institution in which it shall be established which shall be of importance to its members,\" and \"the mutual benefit and improvement of all its members.\" The fraternity continues to guard certain secrets about membership.\n[[File:Theta-chi-original-emblem.png|thumb|Theta Chi's original coat of arms]]\nThe Fraternity's colors are military red and white.

Koe is a two-time World champion and four-time Canadian champion. He was the [[skip (curling)|skip]] of the Canadian men's team at the [[Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's tournament|2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[PyeongChang]].\n\nOriginally from [[Yellowknife]], [[Northwest Territories]], he now resides in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] and curls out of [[The Glencoe Club]]. He learned to curl at the age of six in [[Inuvik]], Northwest Territories.<ref>https://olympics.cbc.ca/news/article/canadian-olympic-skip-kevin-koe-father-was-shaped-his-residential-school-experience.html</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Junior career===\nKoe skipped the Northwest Territories/Yukon team at the [[1994 Canadian Junior Curling Championships]]. He led the team, which consisted of his brother [[Jamie Koe|Jamie]] at third, second [[Mark Whitehead (curler)|Mark Whitehead]] and lead [[Kevin Whitehead (curler)|Kevin Whitehead]] to an 8-3 round robin record, in a three-way tie for first. This gave them a direct spot into the final against Alberta's Colin Davison, to whom they lost 6-5 amidst a controversy involving a burnt rock.\n\n===Early men's career in Edmonton===\nKoe would later leave Yellowknife, to curl in the more competitive province of Alberta, settling in [[Edmonton]]. \n\nKoe's early career included skipping Team Alberta at the [[2000 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship]], with teammates [[Susan O'Connor]], [[Greg Northcott]] and [[Lawnie Goodfellow]]. He led the team to an 8-3 round robin record, and won both of their playoff games to claim the Canadian Mixed title. His early career on the [[World Curling Tour]] included winning the 1999 [[Dunlop Ford Cash Classic]] and the 2002 [[Pointoptical Curling Classic]]. \n\nFrom 2003 to 2006 he played third for [[John Morris (curler)|John Morris]], with whom Koe would win his first [[Grand Slam (curling)|Grand Slam]] event, the [[2004 Players' Championship]]. The team played in the [[2005 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], going 6-3 in the round robin, and losing in the semifinal. During this time, the team would also win the 2005 [[Meyers Norris Penny Charity Classic]]. In 2006, Koe left the Morris rink and formed his own team with [[Blake MacDonald]] throwing fourth stones, Koe skipping at third, [[Carter Rycroft]] at second and [[Nolan Thiessen]] at lead. In their first season together, Koe would win the 2006 [[Roaming Buffalo Classic]]. \n\nUp until 2010, Koe had little success in his attempts to win a provincial title on the men's stage, as he and his rink were in the shadows of fellow Edmontonian [[Kevin Martin (curler)|Kevin Martin]], widely considered to be one of the best curlers of all time. In 2007, he almost went to the [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]], but lost in the provincial finals to [[Kevin Martin (curler)|Kevin Martin]]. In both the 10th and 11th ends, his team's then-fourth player, [[Blake MacDonald]] (Koe skipped and threw third stones) had a draw to the eight-foot to win, but missed on both opportunities. The next season, the team would win the 2007 [[John Shea Insurance Canada Cup Qualifier]].\n\nTwo months after winning the [[Twin Anchors Invitational]], the team played in the [[2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], finishing the round robin with a 4-3 record, missing the playoffs. Later that season, Koe finally won a provincial championship, benefiting from an absent Martin who would be preparing for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. Koe went on to win the 2010 Brier, beating Ontario's [[Glenn Howard]] in the final. Koe's rink became the first team to come out of the 3 vs. 4 [[page playoff system|page playoff]] game to win the Brier, and he became the first rookie skip to win the Brier since [[Vic Peters]] in 1992. Koe finished with a 9-2 round robin record at the [[2010 Capital One World Men's Curling Championship]], finishing second behind Norway. However, in the playoffs, Koe beat Norway twice to claim his first world title.\n\nThe season following their World championship, the Koe rink would win three World Curling Tour events, the [[2010 Twin Anchors Invitational]], the [[Skookum WCT Cash Spiel]] and the [[2011 DEKALB Superspiel (March)|March 2011 DeKalb Superspiel]]. They would not repeat their World title however, as they would lose in the final of the [[2011 Boston Pizza Cup]] to Kevin Martin.\n\n===Move to Calgary (2011\u20132014)===\nKoe moved to Calgary in 2011. At the same time, his long-time fourth, [[Blake MacDonald]], retired, and was replaced by [[Pat Simmons (curler)|Pat Simmons]]. Koe returned to the Brier in 2012, for the second time in his career. In doing so, he broke an 18-year drought for the city of Calgary in winning the [[Boston Pizza Cup|Alberta provincial championship]], representing the city's Glencoe Club. He was helped by the fact that the Olympic champion Kevin Martin rink lost in the semifinal, avoiding a final match-up of province's top two ranked teams. At the [[2012 Tim Hortons Brier]], Koe led Team Alberta to an 8\u20133 record. In the playoffs he had to face off against his brother Jamie's team from the Northwest Territories in the 3 vs. 4 game, which he won. He then won the semifinal, before losing to Ontario (skipped by [[Glenn Howard]]) in the final. Also that season, Koe won the [[TSN Skins Game]] event, pocketing $43,900 for his team. \n\nKoe finally won his first Grand Slam title as a skip at the [[2012 The Masters Grand Slam of Curling|2012 Masters]]. After going 3\u20132 in the group stage, he led his team to three straight playoff wins to claim the title. Also that season, he won the [[2012 Canad Inns Prairie Classic]] and the [[2012 Cactus Pheasant Classic]]. The next season, Koe won another slam title at the [[2013 Canadian Open of Curling]], losing just one game in the process. The next month, Team Koe played in the [[2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], but finished with a 2\u20135 record, missing the playoffs. On the tour, the team won the [[2013 Prestige Hotels & Resorts Curling Classic]].\n\nKoe's rink won their second provincial title [[2014 Boston Pizza Cup|in 2014]], finally defeating Kevin Martin in the final. At the [[2014 Tim Hortons Brier|2014 Brier]] Koe's rink won their second Canadian championship, defeating [[John Morris (curler)|John Morris]]' British Columbia rink 10\u20135 in the final.<ref name=\"cbc 201403\">{{cite news|title=Brier: Alberta's Kevin Koe beats B.C.'s Morris for title|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/curling/brier-alberta-s-kevin-koe-beats-b-c-s-morris-for-title-1.2565954|accessdate=March 10, 2014|newspaper=CBC Sports|date=March 9, 2014|agency=The Canadian Press}}</ref> Koe's rink then went on to represent Canada at the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]]. After finishing the round robin in 2nd place with an 8-3 record, the team collapsed in the playoffs, losing all three of their games, including the bronze medal game, settling for fourth place.\n\n===A new team (2014-2018)===\nKoe's win at the 2014 Brier gave his team an automatic bye (as Team Canada) at the [[2015 Tim Hortons Brier]], following a rule change by the [[Canadian Curling Association]]. However, Koe announced that he was leaving his team to form a new team to prepare for the 2018 Olympics in South Korea<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=AJ2bBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT4&dq=kevin+koe+curling&ots=liKJhzRUhp&sig=iZgSafub6m8htcOUs3Fma77YATc#v=onepage&q=koe&f=false|title=Ice Gold: Canada's Curling Champions|last=Wyman|first=Ted|date=2014-10-01|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781770906457|language=en}}</ref>, leaving him ineligible to represent Team Canada at the 2015 Brier. Somewhat ironically, Koe's former teammates recruited 2014 runner-up Morris to skip Team Canada for the 2015 Brier. Koe's new team consisted of lead [[Ben Hebert]] and third [[Marc Kennedy]] who had previously played on the 2010 Olympic champion [[Kevin Martin (curler)|Kevin Martin]] rink and second [[Brent Laing]] from Ontario who had left the [[Glenn Howard]] rink. With his new team, Koe successfully repeated as Albertan champion in the [[2015 Boston Pizza Cup]], which qualified him to represent Alberta at the [[2015 Tim Hortons Brier]]. There, he led his new team to a 6-5 record, missing the playoffs. On the tour, his new team won the [[Direct Horizontal Drilling Fall Classic]] and the [[Karuizawa International Curling Championship]]. \n\nKoe and his new rink found more success in the 2015-16 season. The team began the season by winning the [[2015 GSOC Tour Challenge|inaugural GSOC Tour Challenge]] Grand Slam event. They would also win the [[2015 Canada Cup of Curling]] and would go on to win the [[2016 Boston Pizza Cup]], sending their team to that year's Brier. After going 8-3 at the [[2016 Tim Hortons Brier]], Koe and his foursome railed off three straight victories in the playoffs (again having to come out of the 3 vs. 4 game), defeating Newfoundland and Labrador's [[Brad Gushue]] in the final. The team would represent Canada at the [[2016 World Men's Curling Championship]], losing just one game en route to winning the gold medal. Koe led Canada to a 5-3 win over Denmark, skipped by [[Rasmus Stjerne]], in the final. On the tour, the team won the Direct Horizontal Drilling Fall Classic again and the [[Mercure Perth Masters]]. They would finish the season in first place on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit rankings and in the [[CTRS standings]]. \n\nKoe's win at the 2016 Brier qualified the team to represent Team Canada at the [[2017 Tim Hortons Brier]]. Koe again led his team to an 8-3 round robin record, and again had to fight through the 3 vs. 4 game and the semifinals in the playoffs to make it to the final, where he faced Brad Gushue in a re-match of the 2016 Brier. However, Gushue and his Newfoundland rink would win the re-match in front of a partisan home crowd. Earlier in the year, Koe would win the [[2017 Pinty's All-Star Curling Skins Game]], winning $71,000 for his team. On the tour, the team would win the [[AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic]] and the [[Red Deer Curling Classic]].\n\nLater in the year, Team Koe played in the [[2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], leading his team to a 7-1 round robin record, which put him in the final against Mike McEwen. Koe would get the better of McEwen, qualifying his rink to represent Canada at the [[Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Winter Olympics]], where the team placed fourth overall after losing the semi final match to Team Shuster of the United States and falling short in the bronze medal match versus Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2018/02/23/canada-shut-out-of-team-curling-medals-as-koe-loses-bronze-medal-game.html|title=Kevin Koe misses bronze, becomes first Canadian men\u2019s skip to miss medals {{!}} Toronto Star|work=thestar.com|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}</ref> On April 15th, 2018, Koe won the Player's Championship Grand Slam of Curling event with a 6-2 victory over Niklas Edin of Sweden.\n\nAfter the season, Kennedy and Laing left the team and were replaced with [[B. J. Neufeld]] and [[Colton Flasch]].\n\n===Post Olympics (2018-present)===\nKoe and his new team began the [[2018\u201319 curling season|2018\u201319 season]] by winning the first leg of the [[2018\u201319 Curling World Cup \u2013 First Leg|Curling World Cup]], defeating Norway's [[Steffen Walstad]] in the final. They also lost the final of the [[2018 Canada Cup]] to [[Brad Jacobs (curler)|Brad Jacobs]] 5\u20134. In provincial playdowns, the Koe rink lost two of their first three games at the [[2019 Boston Pizza Cup]], before winning five straight games to claim the Alberta championship. The team represented Alberta at the [[2019 Tim Hortons Brier]], and went undefeated in the entire tournament, winning the event by beating their provincial rivals, Team [[Brendan Bottcher]] who were the Wild Card entry. They went on to represent Canada at the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship]], finishing the round robin with a 9-3 record. They battled through the playoffs to play Team Sweden's [[Niklas Edin]] rink in the final, losing 7-2. In Grand Slam play, the team failed to win any slams, but did make it to three finals. Despite the lack of any event wins, their strong play was good enough to award them with the Pinty's Cup for the season's best Slam team.<ref>https://www.sportsnet.ca/curling/koe-reaches-players-championship-final-clinch-pintys-cup/</ref> The team ended the season in the [[2018\u201319 Curling World Cup \u2013 Grand Final|Grand Final]] of the Curling World Cup, where they beat the host Chinese team ([[Zou Qiang]]).\n\nTeam Koe started their [[2019\u201320 curling season|2019\u201320 season]] at the [[2019 AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic]] and lost in the quarterfinal to [[Brad Jacobs (curler)|Brad Jacobs]]. They lost the final of the [[Stu Sells Toronto Tankard]] to the Jacobs rink as well. In Grand Slam play, they made the semifinal of the [[2019 Tour Challenge|Tour Challenge]] and the quarterfinals of the [[2019 National|National]]. They missed the playoffs at both the [[2019 Masters (curling)|Masters]] and the [[2020 Canadian Open (curling)|Canadian Open]]. At the [[2019 Canada Cup|Canada Cup]], they finished the round robin with a 5\u20131, which qualified them for the final which they lost to [[John Epping]]. At the [[2020 Tim Hortons Brier]] they finished the championship pool with a 7\u20134 record, which was a four way tie for fourth. They faced Jacobs in the first round of tiebreakers where they lost 8\u20133 and were eliminated. It would be the team's last event of the season as both the [[Players' Championship]] and the [[Champions Cup (curling)|Champions Cup]] Grand Slam events were cancelled due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thegrandslamofcurling.com/gsoc-cancels-remaining-events-of-2019-20-season/|title=GSOC cancels remaining events of 2019\u201320 season|website=Grand Slam of Curling|publisher=Grand Slam of Curling|date=March 13, 2020|access-date=March 17, 2020}}</ref> On March 16, 2020, Team Koe announced they would be parting ways with second [[Colton Flasch]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/mlb/article/team-kevin-koe-part-ways-with-second-colton-flasch-1.1457706|title=Team Koe part ways with second Flasch|website=The Sports Network|author=Ryan Horne|date=March 16, 2020|access-date=March 17, 2020}}</ref> The following day, the team announced they would be adding [[John Morris (curler)|John Morris]] to the team as their new second.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/john-morris-joining-team-kevin-koe-playing-second-1.1458081|title=Morris joining Team Kevin Koe|website=The Sports Network|author=Ryan Horne|date=March 17, 2020|access-date=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHis brother, [[Jamie Koe]], has represented the Territories in four of the last five Briers, while his sister [[Kerry Galusha|Kerry]] has represented the Territories in five of the last six [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts]].

Koe is a two-time World champion and four-time Canadian champion. He was the [[skip (curling)|skip]] of the Canadian men's team at the [[Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's tournament|2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[PyeongChang]].\n\nOriginally from [[Yellowknife]], [[Northwest Territories]], he now resides in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] and curls out of [[The Glencoe Club]]. He learned to curl at the age of six in [[Inuvik]], Northwest Territories.<ref>https://olympics.cbc.ca/news/article/canadian-olympic-skip-kevin-koe-father-was-shaped-his-residential-school-experience.html</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Junior career===\nKoe skipped the Northwest Territories/Yukon team at the [[1994 Canadian Junior Curling Championships]]. He led the team, which consisted of his brother [[Jamie Koe|Jamie]] at third, second [[Mark Whitehead (curler)|Mark Whitehead]] and lead [[Kevin Whitehead (curler)|Kevin Whitehead]] to an 8-3 round robin record, in a three-way tie for first. This gave them a direct spot into the final against Alberta's Colin Davison, to whom they lost 6-5 amidst a controversy involving a burnt rock.\n\n===Early men's career in Edmonton===\nKoe would later leave Yellowknife, to curl in the more competitive province of Alberta, settling in [[Edmonton]]. \n\nKoe's early career included skipping Team Alberta at the [[2000 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship]], with teammates [[Susan O'Connor]], [[Greg Northcott]] and [[Lawnie Goodfellow]]. He led the team to an 8-3 round robin record, and won both of their playoff games to claim the Canadian Mixed title. His early career on the [[World Curling Tour]] included winning the 1999 [[Dunlop Ford Cash Classic]] and the 2002 [[Pointoptical Curling Classic]]. \n\nFrom 2003 to 2006 he played third for [[John Morris (curler)|John Morris]], with whom Koe would win his first [[Grand Slam (curling)|Grand Slam]] event, the [[2004 Players' Championship]]. The team played in the [[2005 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], going 6-3 in the round robin, and losing in the semifinal. During this time, the team would also win the 2005 [[Meyers Norris Penny Charity Classic]]. In 2006, Koe left the Morris rink and formed his own team with [[Blake MacDonald]] throwing fourth stones, Koe skipping at third, [[Carter Rycroft]] at second and [[Nolan Thiessen]] at lead. In their first season together, Koe would win the 2006 [[Roaming Buffalo Classic]]. \n\nUp until 2010, Koe had little success in his attempts to win a provincial title on the men's stage, as he and his rink were in the shadows of fellow Edmontonian [[Kevin Martin (curler)|Kevin Martin]], widely considered to be one of the best curlers of all time. In 2007, he almost went to the [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]], but lost in the provincial finals to [[Kevin Martin (curler)|Kevin Martin]]. In both the 10th and 11th ends, his team's then-fourth player, [[Blake MacDonald]] (Koe skipped and threw third stones) had a draw to the eight-foot to win, but missed on both opportunities. The next season, the team would win the 2007 [[John Shea Insurance Canada Cup Qualifier]].\n\nTwo months after winning the [[Twin Anchors Invitational]], the team played in the [[2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], finishing the round robin with a 4-3 record, missing the playoffs. Later that season, Koe finally won a provincial championship, benefiting from an absent Martin who would be preparing for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. Koe went on to win the 2010 Brier, beating Ontario's [[Glenn Howard]] in the final. Koe's rink became the first team to come out of the 3 vs. 4 [[page playoff system|page playoff]] game to win the Brier, and he became the first rookie skip to win the Brier since [[Vic Peters]] in 1992. Koe finished with a 9-2 round robin record at the [[2010 Capital One World Men's Curling Championship]], finishing second behind Norway. However, in the playoffs, Koe beat Norway twice to claim his first world title.\n\nThe season following their World championship, the Koe rink would win three World Curling Tour events, the [[2010 Twin Anchors Invitational]], the [[Skookum WCT Cash Spiel]] and the [[2011 DEKALB Superspiel (March)|March 2011 DeKalb Superspiel]]. They would not repeat their World title however, as they would lose in the final of the [[2011 Boston Pizza Cup]] to Kevin Martin.\n\n===Move to Calgary (2011\u20132014)===\nKoe moved to Calgary in 2011. At the same time, his long-time fourth, [[Blake MacDonald]], retired, and was replaced by [[Pat Simmons (curler)|Pat Simmons]]. Koe returned to the Brier in 2012, for the second time in his career. In doing so, he broke an 18-year drought for the city of Calgary in winning the [[Boston Pizza Cup|Alberta provincial championship]], representing the city's Glencoe Club. He was helped by the fact that the Olympic champion Kevin Martin rink lost in the semifinal, avoiding a final match-up of province's top two ranked teams. At the [[2012 Tim Hortons Brier]], Koe led Team Alberta to an 8\u20133 record. In the playoffs he had to face off against his brother Jamie's team from the Northwest Territories in the 3 vs. 4 game, which he won. He then won the semifinal, before losing to Ontario (skipped by [[Glenn Howard]]) in the final. Also that season, Koe won the [[TSN Skins Game]] event, pocketing $43,900 for his team. \n\nKoe finally won his first Grand Slam title as a skip at the [[2012 The Masters Grand Slam of Curling|2012 Masters]]. After going 3\u20132 in the group stage, he led his team to three straight playoff wins to claim the title. Also that season, he won the [[2012 Canad Inns Prairie Classic]] and the [[2012 Cactus Pheasant Classic]]. The next season, Koe won another slam title at the [[2013 Canadian Open of Curling]], losing just one game in the process. The next month, Team Koe played in the [[2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], but finished with a 2\u20135 record, missing the playoffs. On the tour, the team won the [[2013 Prestige Hotels & Resorts Curling Classic]].\n\nKoe's rink won their second provincial title [[2014 Boston Pizza Cup|in 2014]], finally defeating Kevin Martin in the final. At the [[2014 Tim Hortons Brier|2014 Brier]] Koe's rink won their second Canadian championship, defeating [[John Morris (curler)|John Morris]]' British Columbia rink 10\u20135 in the final.<ref name=\"cbc 201403\">{{cite news|title=Brier: Alberta's Kevin Koe beats B.C.'s Morris for title|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/curling/brier-alberta-s-kevin-koe-beats-b-c-s-morris-for-title-1.2565954|accessdate=March 10, 2014|newspaper=CBC Sports|date=March 9, 2014|agency=The Canadian Press}}</ref> Koe's rink then went on to represent Canada at the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]]. After finishing the round robin in 2nd place with an 8-3 record, the team collapsed in the playoffs, losing all three of their games, including the bronze medal game, settling for fourth place.\n\n===A new team (2014-2018)===\nKoe's win at the 2014 Brier gave his team an automatic bye (as Team Canada) at the [[2015 Tim Hortons Brier]], following a rule change by the [[Canadian Curling Association]]. However, Koe announced that he was leaving his team to form a new team to prepare for the 2018 Olympics in South Korea<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=AJ2bBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT4&dq=kevin+koe+curling&ots=liKJhzRUhp&sig=iZgSafub6m8htcOUs3Fma77YATc#v=onepage&q=koe&f=false|title=Ice Gold: Canada's Curling Champions|last=Wyman|first=Ted|date=2014-10-01|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781770906457|language=en}}</ref>, leaving him ineligible to represent Team Canada at the 2015 Brier. Somewhat ironically, Koe's former teammates recruited 2014 runner-up Morris to skip Team Canada for the 2015 Brier. Koe's new team consisted of lead [[Ben Hebert]] and third [[Marc Kennedy]] who had previously played on the 2010 Olympic champion [[Kevin Martin (curler)|Kevin Martin]] rink and second [[Brent Laing]] from Ontario who had left the [[Glenn Howard]] rink. With his new team, Koe successfully repeated as Albertan champion in the [[2015 Boston Pizza Cup]], which qualified him to represent Alberta at the [[2015 Tim Hortons Brier]]. There, he led his new team to a 6-5 record, missing the playoffs. On the tour, his new team won the [[Direct Horizontal Drilling Fall Classic]] and the [[Karuizawa International Curling Championship]]. \n\nKoe and his new rink found more success in the 2015-16 season. The team began the season by winning the [[2015 GSOC Tour Challenge|inaugural GSOC Tour Challenge]] Grand Slam event. They would also win the [[2015 Canada Cup of Curling]] and would go on to win the [[2016 Boston Pizza Cup]], sending their team to that year's Brier. After going 8-3 at the [[2016 Tim Hortons Brier]], Koe and his foursome railed off three straight victories in the playoffs (again having to come out of the 3 vs. 4 game), defeating Newfoundland and Labrador's [[Brad Gushue]] in the final. The team would represent Canada at the [[2016 World Men's Curling Championship]], losing just one game en route to winning the gold medal. Koe led Canada to a 5-3 win over Denmark, skipped by [[Rasmus Stjerne]], in the final. On the tour, the team won the Direct Horizontal Drilling Fall Classic again and the [[Mercure Perth Masters]]. They would finish the season in first place on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit rankings and in the [[CTRS standings]]. \n\nKoe's win at the 2016 Brier qualified the team to represent Team Canada at the [[2017 Tim Hortons Brier]]. Koe again led his team to an 8-3 round robin record, and again had to fight through the 3 vs. 4 game and the semifinals in the playoffs to make it to the final, where he faced Brad Gushue in a re-match of the 2016 Brier. However, Gushue and his Newfoundland rink would win the re-match in front of a partisan home crowd. Earlier in the year, Koe would win the [[2017 Pinty's All-Star Curling Skins Game]], winning $71,000 for his team. On the tour, the team would win the [[AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic]] and the [[Red Deer Curling Classic]].\n\nLater in the year, Team Koe played in the [[2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], leading his team to a 7-1 round robin record, which put him in the final against Mike McEwen. Koe would get the better of McEwen, qualifying his rink to represent Canada at the [[Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Winter Olympics]], where the team placed fourth overall after losing the semi final match to Team Shuster of the United States and falling short in the bronze medal match versus Switzerland<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2018/02/23/canada-shut-out-of-team-curling-medals-as-koe-loses-bronze-medal-game.html|title=Kevin Koe misses bronze, becomes first Canadian men\u2019s skip to miss medals {{!}} Toronto Star|work=thestar.com|access-date=2018-03-24|language=en}}</ref>. On April 15th, 2018, Koe won the Player's Championship Grand Slam of Curling event with a 6-2 victory over Niklas Edin of Sweden.\n\nAfter the season, Kennedy and Laing left the team and were replaced with [[B. J. Neufeld]] and [[Colton Flasch]].\n\n===Post Olympics (2018-present)===\nKoe and his new team began the [[2018\u201319 curling season|2018\u201319 season]] by winning the first leg of the [[2018\u201319 Curling World Cup \u2013 First Leg|Curling World Cup]], defeating Norway's [[Steffen Walstad]] in the final. They also lost the final of the [[2018 Canada Cup]] to [[Brad Jacobs (curler)|Brad Jacobs]] 5\u20134. In provincial playdowns, the Koe rink lost two of their first three games at the [[2019 Boston Pizza Cup]], before winning five straight games to claim the Alberta championship. The team represented Alberta at the [[2019 Tim Hortons Brier]], and went undefeated in the entire tournament, winning the event by beating their provincial rivals, Team [[Brendan Bottcher]] who were the Wild Card entry.
