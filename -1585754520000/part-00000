In the 19th century [[Wales|Welsh]] workers settled in the area to work in nearby collieries. A Welsh-speaking [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Non-conformist]] chapel ([[Calvinistic Methodists]]) was founded in Wood Lane, Huyton Quarry. Nearby [[Cronton#Cronton Colliery|Cronton Colliery]] finally ceased production in March 1984, shortly before the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)]]. Both Huyton and Roby have stations on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (another station, [[Huyton Quarry railway station|Huyton Quarry]], closed in 1958). The railway's construction was supervised by [[George Stephenson]] and, when it opened in 1830, it became the world's first regular passenger train service. On the day of the railway's official opening, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] alighted the train at [[Roby railway station|Roby station]].<ref>{{cite book |title= 'Huyton & Roby: A History of Two Townships'|last= King|first= Alan|year= 1984|publisher= Metro. Borough of Knowsley|location= Knowsley|isbn= 0-947739-01-7|page= 45}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the Second World War, Huyton suffered bombing from the [[Luftwaffe]] but the scale of destruction was much less than that experienced by Liverpool, [[Bootle]] and [[Birkenhead]]. Schoolchildren were not evacuated from Huyton, instead schools and homes were provided with [[air-raid shelter]]s.\n\nHuyton was also host to three wartime camps: an [[internment camp]], a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] and a base for American servicemen.\n\nThe internment camp appeared to have been one of the biggest in the country. Some internees were refugees from the [[Nazi]]s, including [[socialist]]s such as [[Kurt Hager]] and a large number of artists attacked for their \"degeneracy.\" Huyton internees included artists Martin Bloch, Hugo Dachinger, and Walter Nessler, dancer [[Kurt Jooss]], musicians, sociologist [[Norbert Elias]], anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] and composer [[Hans G\u00e1l]]. More than 40 per cent of Huyton's internees were over 50 years old.\n\nThe camp, first occupied in May 1940, was formed around several streets of new, empty council houses and flats and then made secure with [[barbed wire]] fencing. Twelve internees were allocated to each house, but overcrowding resulted in many sleeping in tents. Initially the camp was only meant to hold the internees until they could be shipped to the [[Isle of Man]]. However, largely in response to the torpedoing of the transport ship the ''[[Arandora Star]]'', with the loss of nearly 700 lives, the deportations ended. Most of the internees were released before the camp closed in 1942. The camp was sited in and around what became known as the \"Bluebell Estate\" and many of the streets were given names of the great battles of the Second World War. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe prisoner of war camp closed in 1948. Some inmates \"went native\", stayed in Britain and married local women. Among those in the Huyton camp was [[Bert Trautmann]], who later went on to be the 1950s [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Manchester City]]. From 1944, American servicemen were temporarily stationed in Huyton.\n\n===Murders===\nHuyton was brought to national attention in 2005 after the racially motivated murder of black teenager [[murder of Anthony Walker|Anthony Walker]] in McGoldrick Park.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4732563.stm|title=Man held over student axe murder|work=BBC News|date=31 July 2005|accessdate=1 February 2008}}</ref> Two white local youths were later found guilty of his murder and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

Other smaller developments were commissioned by the [[urban district council]] or privately commissioned. By 1950 the population was over 55,000, the vast majority of whom had moved to the area from the city of Liverpool.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the district successfully fought off absorption into the Liverpool City Council boundaries.

This club, later renamed [[Highfield RLFC|Highfield]], struggled on near the bottom of the pro game: in 1995\u20131996 they gained just one point all season and changed their name to [[Liverpool Stanley#Prescot Panthers \u2013 1996\u201397|Prescot Panthers]], before folding at the end of the 1997 season. (Huytonians still interested in supporting pro rugby league have the choice of either [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] or [[Widnes Vikings]], both of whom are {{convert|6|mi|km}} away from Huyton).\n\nIn football, the town has produced two outstanding midfield England internationals: [[Peter Reid]] ([[Everton F.C.|Everton]]) and [[Steven Gerrard]] ([[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]). Other footballers include [[Joey Barton]], [[Craig Hignett]], [[Tony Hibbert]], [[David Nugent]], [[Lee Molyneux]], [[Leon Osman]], [[John Relish]], [[Greg Tansey]], [[Lee Trundle]] and [[Callum McManaman]]. Notably on 28 March 2007, two of Huyton's most prominent footballers starred for England in a 3\u20130 away win in [[Andorra]]. Goals came from Steven Gerrard (2) and David Nugent in a proud night for Huyton. Both players were educated at Cardinal Heenan High School, who have a track record as one of the country's top schools for sport.\n\nHuyton has many amateur football teams at both junior and senior level, but only one FA Charter Standard Club, Paramount Community Football Club.\n\nDespite producing so many pro footballers, Huyton has never been able to sustain a semi-pro club for long. Nearby Kirkby Town changed their name to [[Knowsley United Football Club|Knowsley United]] in 1988 and moved to [[Alt Park]], the former home of Huyton [[Rugby league]] Club. In United's first five seasons they were successful. In 1988\u201389 they finished runners-up in the [[North West Counties Football League]]. The following season they were champions and won promotion to the [[Northern Premier League]] Division One. They were accordingly promoted to the Premier Division. The following season they reached the first round proper of the [[FA Cup]], only to be beaten by [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] at home. The momentum did not last and Knowsley United ceased to be a senior semi-pro side in 1998.\n\nHuytonians wishing to support a local semi-pro outfit have [[Prescot Cables F.C.|Prescot Cables]] located at [[Valerie Park]] in the Northern Premier League (Premier Division) less than {{convert|2|mi|km}} away.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{see also|List of people from Merseyside}}\nHuyton-with-Roby has several [[Beatles]] connections.

In the 19th century [[Wales|Welsh]] workers settled in the area to work in nearby collieries. A Welsh-speaking [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Non-conformist]] chapel ([[Calvinistic Methodists]]) was founded in Wood Lane, Huyton Quarry. Nearby [[Cronton#Cronton Colliery|Cronton Colliery]] finally ceased production in March 1984, shortly before the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)]]. Both Huyton and Roby have stations on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (another station, [[Huyton Quarry railway station|Huyton Quarry]], closed in 1958). The railway's construction was supervised by [[George Stephenson]] and, when it opened in 1830, it became the world's first regular passenger train service. On the day of the railway's official opening, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] alighted the train at [[Roby railway station|Roby station]].<ref>{{cite book |title= 'Huyton & Roby: A History of Two Townships'|last= King|first= Alan|year= 1984|publisher= Metro. Borough of Knowsley|location= Knowsley|isbn= 0-947739-01-7|page= 45}}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the Second World War, Huyton suffered bombing from the [[Luftwaffe]] but the scale of destruction was much less than that experienced by Liverpool, [[Bootle]] and [[Birkenhead]]. Schoolchildren were not evacuated from Huyton, instead schools and homes were provided with [[air-raid shelter]]s.\n\nHuyton was also host to three wartime camps: an [[internment camp]], a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] and a base for American servicemen.\n\nThe internment camp appeared to have been one of the biggest in the country. Some internees were refugees from the [[Nazi]]s, including [[socialist]]s such as [[Kurt Hager]] and a large number of artists attacked for their \"degeneracy.\" Huyton internees included artists Martin Bloch, Hugo Dachinger, and Walter Nessler, dancer [[Kurt Jooss]], musicians, sociologist [[Norbert Elias]], anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] and composer [[Hans G\u00e1l]]. More than 40 per cent of Huyton's internees were over 50 years old.\n\nThe camp, first occupied in May 1940, was formed around several streets of new, empty council houses and flats and then made secure with [[barbed wire]] fencing. Twelve internees were allocated to each house, but overcrowding resulted in many sleeping in tents. Initially the camp was only meant to hold the internees until they could be shipped to the [[Isle of Man]]. However, largely in response to the torpedoing of the transport ship the ''[[Arandora Star]]'', with the loss of nearly 700 lives, the deportations ended. Most of the internees were released before the camp closed in 1942. The camp was sited in and around what became known as the \"Bluebell Estate\" and many of the streets were given names of the great battles of the Second World War. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe prisoner of war camp closed in 1948. Some inmates \"went native\", stayed in Britain and married local women. Among those in the Huyton camp was [[Bert Trautmann]], who later went on to be the 1950s [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Manchester City]]. From 1944, American servicemen were temporarily stationed in Huyton.\n\n===Murders===\nHuyton was brought to national attention in 2005 after the racially motivated murder of black teenager [[murder of Anthony Walker|Anthony Walker]] in McGoldrick Park.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4732563.stm|title=Man held over student axe murder|work=BBC News|date=31 July 2005|accessdate=1 February 2008}}</ref> Two white local youths were later found guilty of his murder and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

Other smaller developments were commissioned by the [[urban district council]] or privately commissioned. By 1950 the population was over 55,000, the vast majority of whom had moved to the area from the city of Liverpool.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the district successfully fought off absorption into the Liverpool City Council boundaries.

[[Huyton RLFC]] struggled in the second division of the [[Rugby Football League]] until 1985, when they were replaced by [[Runcorn Highfield RLFC|Runcorn Highfield]].

The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a \"[[List of The Great British Bake Off Star Bakers|Star Baker]]\" for the week (introduced in series 2), and a contestant is also eliminated although if the contestant numbers in certain years are not even or there is an non-elimination a week before, then two bakers may be eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.\n\n; Signature Challenge: This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes for bakes they might make for their friends and family.\n; Technical Challenge: This challenge requires enough technical knowledge and experience to produce a certain finished product when given only limited \u2013 or even minimal \u2013 instructions. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best.\n; Showstopper Challenge: This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges favour a bake that has a professional appearance but is also outstanding in flavours.\n\nIn the first series, the location of the cast and crew moves from town to town each week, but starting from the second series, the competition is held in one location in a specially constructed marquee.

The rounds took place in various locations across the UK, with the final round being held at [[Fulham Palace]], London.\n\nThe three finalists were Ruth Clemens, Miranda Gore Browne, and Edd Kimber.

Several have had a significant impact on what a baker presents, notably:  \n* Presenters [[Mel Giedroyc]] and [[Sue Perkins]] have accidentally interfered with several bakes. In Series 4, Sue leaned on Howard Middleton's [[English Muffins]] in the technical challenge and Series 6, she broke [[Nadiya Hussain]]'s biscuit lid in the showstopper challenge. \n* In Series 2, Robert Billington accidentally dropped his tiered showstopper while applying finishing touches to the cake. Both judges and presenters came to his aid to salvage the bottom tier of his cake. He was able to present the incomplete showstopper as a single-tiered cake.\n* In Series 3, [[John Whaite]] was unable to complete his bake after he suffered a severe cut to his finger on the food processor. He tried to continue working on his strudel wearing a rubber glove, but the bleeding required medical attention, including assistance from Dani, who left her bake to help him.  As a result, John had to abandon the last bake, and no one was eliminated that week.\n* In Series 4, contestant Deborah Manger accidentally used Howard Middleton's custard instead of her own. As a result, Howard was forced to use Deborah's custard, and this was taken into account by the judges, who judged the trifles and custards individually.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/deborah-s-desserts-fail-to-impress-on-great-british-bake-off-1-5452839 |title=Deborah's desserts fail to impress on Great British Bake Off |author=Stephanie Weaver |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n* In Series 5, during the [[Baked Alaska]] challenge, Iain Watters's ice cream melted on a very hot day, as did that of several other bakers. He threw his ice cream into the bin in frustration and left the tent. He returned shortly after, and as he had no cake for judging (he produced his bin instead, and the incident was labelled \"[[List of scandals with \"-gate\" suffix#Television|bingate]]\"), he was disqualified from the competition. The event that led to his departure provoked extreme anger from the viewers, who believed the interference of Diana Beard was the reason his ice cream melted.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n*In Series 9, one of contestant Rahul Mandal's empty storage jars burst from the heat within the tent and glass covered the workbench and potentially contaminated the mixtures. The production team had to dispose of all of his mixtures and clear his station. He was then given 15 extra minutes after the other finalists had finished as this was the exact amount of time he had lost. His bake was then judged with equal scrutiny as the others.\n\n==''The Great Christmas/Festive Bake Off''==\nSince 2016, two holiday specials have been transmitted between each series.

[[Love Productions]], in which a group of amateur bakers compete against each other in a series of rounds, attempting to impress a group of judges with their baking skills, with a contestant being eliminated in each round, with the winner being selected from the contestants who reach the finals. The first episode was aired on 17 August 2010, with its first four series broadcast on [[BBC Two]], until its growing popularity led the [[BBC]] to move it to [[BBC One]] for the next three series. After its seventh series, [[Love Productions]] signed a three-year deal with [[Channel 4]] to produce the series for the broadcaster.<ref name=\"Bake Off Move 2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off/|title=BBC loses Great British Bake Off, as Channel 4 swoops for corporation's biggest show|last=Foster|first=Patrick|date=12 September 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> However, [[BBC Studios]] still owns the global distribution rights to the show, which are set for renewal in 2028.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/a807901/bbc-worldwide-still-has-the-international-rights-to-great-british-bake-off-so-there/|title=BBC Worldwide still has the global Bake Off rights|last=Nissim|first=Mayer|date=2016-09-14|website=Digital Spy|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally presented by [[Sue Perkins]] and [[Mel Giedroyc]], with judges [[Mary Berry]] and [[Paul Hollywood]].

The applicants to the show are assessed by a researcher, followed by an audition in London with two of their bakes. They then undergo a screen test and an interview with a producer. A second audition involves the applicants baking two recipes for the judges in front of the cameras.<ref name=\"telegraph 2012\" /> Ten contestants were chosen for the first series, twelve for the following two series, thirteen for the fourth and tenth,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/20/meet-the-2019-great-british-bake-off-contestants-from-the-teacher-to-the-terminator |accessdate=13 September 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 August 2019}}</ref> and twelve from series five to series nine.\n\nIn each episode, the amateur bakers are given three challenges based on that week's theme: a signature bake, a technical challenge, and a show-stopper.<ref name=\"telegraph 2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9411189/Behind-the-scenes-at-the-Great-British-Bake-Off.html |title=Behind the scenes at the Great British Bake-Off |author=Sarah Stephens |date= 14 August 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph }}</ref> The three challenges take place over two days, and the filming takes up to 16 hours a day. The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a \"[[List of The Great British Bake Off Star Bakers|Star Baker]]\" for the week (introduced in series 2), and a contestant is also eliminated although if the contestant numbers in certain years are not even or there is an non-elimination a week before, then two bakers may be eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.\n\n; Signature Challenge: This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes for bakes they might make for their friends and family.\n; Technical Challenge: This challenge requires enough technical knowledge and experience to produce a certain finished product when given only limited \u2013 or even minimal \u2013 instructions. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best.\n; Showstopper Challenge: This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges favour a bake that has a professional appearance but is also outstanding in flavours.\n\nIn the first series, the location of the cast and crew moves from town to town each week, but starting from the second series, the competition is held in one location in a specially constructed marquee. Interspersed in the programme are the background of the contestants as well as video vignettes on the history of baking. What each baker intends to bake during a particular challenge is illustrated using animated graphics. These graphics have been created by illustrator Tom Hovey since the show's inception in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/illustration-tom-hovey |title=Illustration: We interview the artist behind the Great British Bake Off, Tom Hovey|author= Liv Siddall |date=1 November 2013 |work=It's Nice That }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomhovey.co.uk/the-great-british-bake-off/ |title=Tom Hovey }}</ref>\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winner\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:silver;\"|Runners-up\n! scope=\"col\"  |Average UK viewers<br />(millions)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10379873/The-Great-British-Bake-Off-moves-to-BBC1.html |title=The Great British Bake Off moves to BBC1 |author=Rachel Moss|date= 15 October 2013|work=Daily Telegraph }}</ref><ref name=\"broadcast\">{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/bbc1-rises-to-the-challenge/5082034.article |title=BBC1 rises to the challenge|date=22 January 2015 |author= Stephen Price |work=Broadcast }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Timeslot\n! scope=\"col\" | Channel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 17 August 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 21 September 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Edd Kimber]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Miranda Gore Browne\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2.77\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Tuesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"8\"| [[BBC Two]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ruth Clemens\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 2)|2]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 4 October 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Joanne Wheatley]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Holly Bell\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 4.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mary-Anne Boermans\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 3)|3]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 16 October 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[John Whaite]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Brendan Lynch\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 5.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[James Morton (baker)|James Morton]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 20 August 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 22 October 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Frances Quinn]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kimberley Wilson\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 7.35\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Ruby Tandoh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 6 August 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 8 October 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nancy Birtwhistle]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Luis Troyano\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10.04\n| rowspan=\"6\" | Wednesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"6\" | [[BBC One]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Burr\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 5 August 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 7 October 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nadiya Hussain]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ian Cumming\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12.50\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Tamal Ray]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 7)|7]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 24 August 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 26 October 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Candice Brown]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Andrew M.

The rounds took place in various locations across the UK, with the final round being held at [[Fulham Palace]], London.\n\nThe three finalists were Ruth Clemens, Miranda Gore Browne, and Edd Kimber.

Several have had a significant impact on what a baker presents, notably:  \n* Presenters [[Mel Giedroyc]] and [[Sue Perkins]] have accidentally interfered with several bakes. In Series 4, Sue leaned on Howard Middleton's [[English Muffins]] in the technical challenge and Series 6, she broke [[Nadiya Hussain]]'s biscuit lid in the showstopper challenge. \n* In Series 2, Robert Billington accidentally dropped his tiered showstopper while applying finishing touches to the cake. Both judges and presenters came to his aid to salvage the bottom tier of his cake. He was able to present the incomplete showstopper as a single-tiered cake.\n* In Series 3, [[John Whaite]] was unable to complete his bake after he suffered a severe cut to his finger on the food processor. He tried to continue working on his strudel wearing a rubber glove, but the bleeding required medical attention, including assistance from Dani, who left her bake to help him.  As a result, John had to abandon the last bake, and no one was eliminated that week.\n* In Series 4, contestant Deborah Manger accidentally used Howard Middleton's custard instead of her own. As a result, Howard was forced to use Deborah's custard, and this was taken into account by the judges, who judged the trifles and custards individually.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/deborah-s-desserts-fail-to-impress-on-great-british-bake-off-1-5452839 |title=Deborah's desserts fail to impress on Great British Bake Off |author=Stephanie Weaver |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n* In Series 5, during the [[Baked Alaska]] challenge, Iain Watters's ice cream melted on a very hot day, as did that of several other bakers. He threw his ice cream into the bin in frustration and left the tent. He returned shortly after, and as he had no cake for judging (he produced his bin instead, and the incident was labelled \"[[List of scandals with \"-gate\" suffix#Television|bingate]]\"), he was disqualified from the competition. The event that led to his departure provoked extreme anger from the viewers, who believed the interference of Diana Beard was the reason his ice cream melted.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n*In Series 9, one of contestant Rahul Mandal's empty storage jars burst from the heat within the tent and glass covered the workbench and potentially contaminated the mixtures. The production team had to dispose of all of his mixtures and clear his station. He was then given 15 extra minutes after the other finalists had finished as this was the exact amount of time he had lost. His bake was then judged with equal scrutiny as the others.\n\n==''The Great Christmas/Festive Bake Off''==\nSince 2016, two holiday specials have been transmitted between each series.

It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a critical positive response from critics despite tepid success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs and persuades her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]], and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality and begins to hallucinate, in which she is mocked by a crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to medication. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curl into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.

It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoiding reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a critical positive response from critics despite tepid success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs and persuades her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]], and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality and begins to hallucinate, in which she is mocked by a crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to medication. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curl into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.

Aronofsky had been a fan of Selby's work since his college years. Describing Selby's work, Aronofsky said, \"Anyone that reads Selby's work can see how intense his world is. He writes the most discordant, angry words that tickle the air with some sweet music around it. It's an unbelievable experience to read his books.

In 1942, a film of Johnson's life, ''[[They Flew Alone]]'', was made by director-producer [[Herbert Wilcox]], starring [[Anna Neagle]] as Johnson, and [[Robert Newton]] as Mollison. The movie is known in the United States as ''Wings and the Woman''.  ''Amy!'' (1980) was an avant-garde documentary written and directed by feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] and semiologist Peter Wollen. In the 1991 Australian television miniseries [[The Great Air Race (miniseries)|''The Great Air Race'']], aka ''Half a World Away'', based on the 1934 [[MacRobertson Air Race]], Johnson was portrayed by [[Caroline Goodall]].\n\nJohnson earned a passing mention in other works such as  the 2007 British film adaption of [[Noel Streatfeild]]'s 1936 novel ''[[Ballet Shoes (novel)|Ballet Shoes]]'', wherein the character Petrova is inspired by Johnson in her dreams of becoming an aviatrix.\n\nIn radio, the 2002 [[BBC Radio]] broadcast ''The Typist who Flew to Australia'', a play by Helen Cross, presented the theme that Johnson's aviation career was prompted by years of boredom in an unsatisfying job as a typist and sexual adventures including a seven-year affair with a Swiss businessman who married someone else.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0076b6g |title=BBC Radio 4 Extra - Helen Cross - The Typist Who Flew to Australia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn music, Johnson inspired a number of works, including the song \"Flying Sorcery\" from Scottish singer-songwriter [[Al Stewart]]'s album, ''[[Year of the Cat]]'' (1976).<ref>Dyer, Kim (29 January 2016), [https://www.alstewart.com/blog.html \"Review of 'Flying Sorcery'.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413085234/https://www.alstewart.com/blog.html |date=13 April 2016 }} ''alstewart.com.''
