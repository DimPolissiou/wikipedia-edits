This page also gives a list of [[lightvessel]] stations within the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Gibraltar]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe world's first lightvessel was the result of a business partnership between Robert Hamblin, an impoverished former [[barber]] and ship manager from [[King's Lynn]], and David Avery, a regular investor in small projects.<ref name=naish>Naish, J. M. ''Seamarks: Their History and Development'', Stanford Maritime, 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-540-07309-2}}, p. 107</ref> In 1730 the pair secured a government licence to moor a ship {{ndash}} with a prominent light affixed to it to serve as a navigation aid {{ndash}} at the [[Nore]] in the [[Thames]] mouth. Hamblin and Avery intended to profit from the vessel by collecting a fee from passing merchant vessels. The licence was opposed by [[Trinity House]] which considered that it possessed a monopoly on construction and maintenance of navigation aids in British waters. After extensive legal dispute the licence was revoked in 1732 and Trinity House assumed direct responsibility for the proposed lightship; Hamblin and Avery were granted nominal lease revenues in exchange.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Nautical Magazine and Naval Chronicle for 1865|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=624|year=2013|isbn=9781108054911}}</ref> The Nore lightship commenced operations in 1734.<ref name=Marcus>{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=G.J.|title=Heart of Oak: A Survey of British Sea Power in the Georgian Era|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1975|pages=[https://archive.org/details/heartofoaksurvey0000marc/page/53 53\u201354]|isbn=0192158120|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/heartofoaksurvey0000marc/page/53}}</ref>\n\nA further lightvessel was placed at the Dudgeon station, off the [[Norfolk]] coast, in 1736, with others following at [[Owers Bank]] (1788) and the [[Goodwin Sands]] (1793).<ref name=Marcus/> Many others were commissioned during the nineteenth century, especially off England's east coast and the approaches to the Thames, where there were many treacherous [[shoal]]s.\n\n[[File:Lv-Nore.jpg|thumb|right|Lightship LV86, on station at the Nore from 1931 to 1974]]\n\nFollowing their acquisition of the patent, all English and Welsh lightvessels were maintained by Trinity House, with the exception of the four vessels in the approaches to the [[River Mersey]], which were maintained by the [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Board]] until 1973, and those in the [[Humber Estuary]], which were the responsibility of the Humber Conservancy Board. In order to act as effective [[daymark]]s Trinity House lightvessels were painted red, with the station name in large white letters on the side of the hull, and a system of balls and cones at the masthead for identification. The first revolving light was fitted to the Swin Middle lightvessel in 1837: others used occulting or flashing lights. White lights were preferred for visibility though red and very occasionally green (as with the Mouse lightvessel) were also used.<ref name=miltoun>Miltoun, F. (ed) ''[http://www.kellscraft.com/ShipsandShipping/ShipsandShippingCh11.html Ships and Shipping]'', Moring Ltd, 1903, Ch. 11</ref>\n\n===Communications and safety===\n\nCommunication with lightvessels proved to be a major problem for Trinity House; lightvessel crews were well-placed to observe ships in distress, but could not always alert [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|lifeboats]] on shore. After a series of shipwrecks, an experiment was conducted whereby a nine-mile undersea cable was run from the Sunk lightvessel in the [[Thames Estuary]] to the [[post office]] at [[Walton-on-the-Naze]]. This was intended to commence in 1884, but was plagued by delays;<ref name=hansard>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1884/may/16/board-of-trade-telegraphic-communication BOARD OF TRADE \u2014 TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION WITH LIGHT VESSELS], [[Hansard]] 16-05-1884</ref> the trial was unsuccessful as the cable repeatedly broke. As a result of a motion brought forward by Sir [[Edward Birkbeck]], a [[Royal Commission]] was established to look at the issue of 'electrical communication' and gave its first Report in 1892;<ref name=hansard2>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1892/apr/26/coast-communications COAST COMMUNICATIONS], [[Hansard]] 26-04-1892</ref><ref name=hansard1>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1893/mar/21/communication-with-lighthouses COMMUNICATION WITH LIGHTHOUSES], [[Hansard]] 21-03-1893</ref> the East Goodwin lightvessel was used during one of [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s early experiments in radio transmission in 1896.<ref name=marconi>{{cite book|last=Baker|first= W.

F. Matthews'' rammed it in a dense fog. Safety was further improved by the development of more powerful lamps and through the replacement by [[foghorn]]s of the [[gong]]s previously used as fog signals.\n\n===Crew===\n\nUntil the later 20th century, all Trinity House vessels were permanently manned. An 1861 article in the [[Cornhill Magazine]] described lightshipmen as being paid 55 shillings a month (in addition to drawing 1 shilling and sixpence a week \"in lieu of 3 gallons of [[small beer|small-beer]]\"): the vessels were supplied, and the crews relieved, once a month. It was also noted that \"a general tone of decent, orderly and superior conduct\" was observed, that the men were \"very respectable [...] swearing and profane language are [...] prohibited\" and that every man was supplied with a Bible as well as \"a library of varied and entertaining literature\".<ref name=cornhill>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbkCAAAAIAAJ Light-Vessels]'', The Cornhill Magazine, III (1861), 39.</ref>\n\nBy the start of the 20th century, Trinity House lightvessels had a crew of 11, of whom seven (a master and six ratings) would be on active duty at any one time. It was an extremely demanding and dangerous profession, and it would take 15 to 20 years of service to be promoted to master.<ref name=portcities1>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.64/chapterId/1506/Trinity-House.html Trinity House], portcities.org, accessed 02-09-08</ref>\n\n===Replacement===\n\nThe majority of British lightvessels were decommissioned during the 1970s - 1980s and replaced with light floats or [[Lanby buoy|LANBY]] buoys, which were vastly cheaper to maintain: in 1974 at the time of Trinity House's original development project, lightship annual running costs at \u00a330,000 were ten times those of the LANBY.<ref name=design1974>Rowlands, D. [http://vads.ac.uk/diad/article.php?title=310&year=1974&article=d.310.39 \"Points of Reference\"], ''Design'' 310 (1974)</ref>\n\nThe remaining UK lightvessels have now been converted to unmanned operation and most now use [[solar power]].\n\n==Lightvessel stations==\n\nThe following are lightvessel ''stations''; i.e. a named position at which a lightvessel was placed, rather than the names of vessels themselves. Individual vessels were often transferred between different stations during their existence but they kept their Trinity House LV number. Stations themselves were occasionally changed, especially during wartime, when lights were only displayed in response to specific shipping needs. It is likely that photographs on various websites showing named lightvessels, may appear to be structurally different to comparable records on other web pages due to the fact that the particular LV might have been withdrawn from a station after photographing and being towed away for drydocking, overhaul and possible direction to a new station and therefore a different lightvessel would have been substituted at the named station on withdrawal of the previous LV. This has been most evident on those LVs that have been withdrawn and shipped to another port at home or abroad to become a floating museum, floating restaurant, 'clubhouse', etc. Scarweather LV and Helwick LV have for instance changed their r\u00f4le in their lifetime and their appearance on various records varies considerably.\n\n===England===\n\n====Active lightvessel stations====\n\nThe following are active stations at which Trinity House still maintains unmanned lightships, which also act as [[weather station]]s.\n\n[[File:Lightvessel East Goodwin.jpg|thumb|right|The East Goodwin lightvessel while under repair at [[Harwich]]]]\n\n*[[Channel Light Vessel Automatic|Channel Lightvessel]]  (north of [[Guernsey]])\n*F3 Lightvessel (middle of [[English Channel]], east of [[Ramsgate]])\n*East Goodwin Lightvessel ([[Goodwin Sands]])\n*[[Greenwich Light Vessel Automatic|Greenwich Lightvessel]]  (south of [[East Sussex]] on the [[Prime Meridian]])\n*[[Sandettie Light Vessel Automatic|Sandettie Lightvessel]]  (north of [[Calais]])\n*[[Sevenstones Lightship|Sevenstones Lightvessel]]  (west of [[Land's End]])\n*Sunk Lightvessel ([[Thames Estuary]])\n*[[Varne Bank|Varne Lightvessel]]  (southwest of [[Dover]])\n\n====Former lightvessel stations====\n[[File:Calshot Spit Lightship.jpg|thumb|Lightship LV78, formerly at [[Calshot Spit]] station]]\n\n*Bar ([[Mersey Estuary]]; maintained by MDHB)\n*Barrow Deep (Barrow Deep channel, Thames Estuary)\n*[[Black Deep]] (Thames Estuary)\n*Brake (Brake Sand, near [[Goodwin Sands]])\n*Bull (Bull Sands, mouth of the [[Humber Estuary]]; maintained by Humber Conservancy Board)\n*[[Calshot Spit]]\n*Cockle (North Sea)\n*Cork (Cork Bank, off [[Harwich]])\n*Corton (North Sea)\n*Crosby (Mersey Estuary; maintained by MDHB)\n*Docking Shoal, Norfolk coast\n*Inner / Outer Dowsing (North Sea; Inner Dowsing was the last manned lightship station, replaced by the Dowsing lighthouse in 1991)<ref name=dowsing>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.64/chapterId/1506/Trinity-House.html Trinity House], portcities.org</ref>\n*Dudgeon (North Sea; the Dudgeon lightvessel was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]] on 29 January 1940.

This page also gives a list of [[lightvessel]] stations within the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Gibraltar]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe world's first lightvessel was the result of a business partnership between Robert Hamblin, an impoverished former [[barber]] and ship manager from [[King's Lynn]], and David Avery, a regular investor in small projects.<ref name=naish>Naish, J. M. ''Seamarks: Their History and Development'', Stanford Maritime, 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-540-07309-2}}, p. 107</ref> In 1730 the pair secured a government licence to moor a ship {{ndash}} with a prominent light affixed to it to serve as a navigation aid {{ndash}} at the [[Nore]] in the [[Thames]] mouth. Hamblin and Avery intended to profit from the vessel by collecting a fee from passing merchant vessels. The licence was opposed by [[Trinity House]] which considered that it possessed a monopoly on construction and maintenance of navigation aids in British waters. After extensive legal dispute the licence was revoked in 1732 and Trinity House assumed direct responsibility for the proposed lightship; Hamblin and Avery were granted nominal lease revenues in exchange.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Nautical Magazine and Naval Chronicle for 1865|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=624|year=2013|isbn=9781108054911}}</ref> The Nore lightship commenced operations in 1734.<ref name=Marcus>{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=G.J.|title=Heart of Oak: A Survey of British Sea Power in the Georgian Era|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1975|pages=[https://archive.org/details/heartofoaksurvey0000marc/page/53 53\u201354]|isbn=0192158120|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/heartofoaksurvey0000marc/page/53}}</ref>\n\nA further lightvessel was placed at the Dudgeon station, off the [[Norfolk]] coast, in 1736, with others following at [[Owers Bank]] (1788) and the [[Goodwin Sands]] (1793).<ref name=Marcus/> Many others were commissioned during the nineteenth century, especially off England's east coast and the approaches to the Thames, where there were many treacherous [[shoal]]s.\n\n[[File:Lv-Nore.jpg|thumb|right|Lightship LV86, on station at the Nore from 1931 to 1974]]\n\nFollowing their acquisition of the patent, all English and Welsh lightvessels were maintained by Trinity House, with the exception of the four vessels in the approaches to the [[River Mersey]], which were maintained by the [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Board]] until 1973, and those in the [[Humber Estuary]], which were the responsibility of the Humber Conservancy Board. In order to act as effective [[daymark]]s Trinity House lightvessels were painted red, with the station name in large white letters on the side of the hull, and a system of balls and cones at the masthead for identification. The first revolving light was fitted to the Swin Middle lightvessel in 1837: others used occulting or flashing lights. White lights were preferred for visibility though red and very occasionally green (as with the Mouse lightvessel) were also used.<ref name=miltoun>Miltoun, F. (ed) ''[http://www.kellscraft.com/ShipsandShipping/ShipsandShippingCh11.html Ships and Shipping]'', Moring Ltd, 1903, Ch. 11</ref>\n\n===Communications and safety===\n\nCommunication with lightvessels proved to be a major problem for Trinity House; lightvessel crews were well-placed to observe ships in distress, but could not always alert [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|lifeboats]] on shore. After a series of shipwrecks, an experiment was conducted whereby a nine-mile undersea cable was run from the Sunk lightvessel in the [[Thames Estuary]] to the [[post office]] at [[Walton-on-the-Naze]]. This was intended to commence in 1884, but was plagued by delays;<ref name=hansard>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1884/may/16/board-of-trade-telegraphic-communication BOARD OF TRADE \u2014 TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION WITH LIGHT VESSELS], [[Hansard]] 16-05-1884</ref> the trial was unsuccessful as the cable repeatedly broke. As a result of a motion brought forward by Sir [[Edward Birkbeck]], a [[Royal Commission]] was established to look at the issue of 'electrical communication' and gave its first Report in 1892;<ref name=hansard2>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1892/apr/26/coast-communications COAST COMMUNICATIONS], [[Hansard]] 26-04-1892</ref><ref name=hansard1>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1893/mar/21/communication-with-lighthouses COMMUNICATION WITH LIGHTHOUSES], [[Hansard]] 21-03-1893</ref> the East Goodwin lightvessel was used during one of [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s early experiments in radio transmission in 1896.<ref name=marconi>{{cite book|last=Baker|first= W.

F. Matthews'' rammed it in a dense fog. Safety was further improved by the development of more powerful lamps and through the replacement by [[foghorn]]s of the [[gong]]s previously used as fog signals.\n\n===Crew===\n\nUntil the later 20th century, all Trinity House vessels were permanently manned. An 1861 article in the [[Cornhill Magazine]] described lightshipmen as being paid 55 shillings a month (in addition to drawing 1 shilling and sixpence a week \"in lieu of 3 gallons of [[small beer|small-beer]]\"): the vessels were supplied, and the crews relieved, once a month. It was also noted that \"a general tone of decent, orderly and superior conduct\" was observed, that the men were \"very respectable [...] swearing and profane language are [...] prohibited\" and that every man was supplied with a Bible as well as \"a library of varied and entertaining literature\".<ref name=cornhill>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbkCAAAAIAAJ Light-Vessels]'', The Cornhill Magazine, III (1861), 39.</ref>\n\nBy the start of the 20th century, Trinity House lightvessels had a crew of 11, of whom seven (a master and six ratings) would be on active duty at any one time. It was an extremely demanding and dangerous profession, and it would take 15 to 20 years of service to be promoted to master.<ref name=portcities1>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.64/chapterId/1506/Trinity-House.html Trinity House], portcities.org, accessed 02-09-08</ref>\n\n===Replacement===\n\nThe majority of British lightvessels were decommissioned during the 1970s - 1980s and replaced with light floats or [[Lanby buoy|LANBY]] buoys, which were vastly cheaper to maintain: in 1974 at the time of Trinity House's original development project, lightship annual running costs at \u00a330,000 were ten times those of the LANBY.<ref name=design1974>Rowlands, D. [http://vads.ac.uk/diad/article.php?title=310&year=1974&article=d.310.39 \"Points of Reference\"], ''Design'' 310 (1974)</ref>\n\nThe remaining UK lightvessels have now been converted to unmanned operation and most now use [[solar power]].\n\n==Lightvessel stations==\n\nThe following are lightvessel ''stations''; i.e. a named position at which a lightvessel was placed, rather than the names of vessels themselves. Individual vessels were often transferred between different stations during their existence but they kept their Trinity House LV number. Stations themselves were occasionally changed, especially during wartime, when lights were only displayed in response to specific shipping needs. It is likely that photographs on various websites showing named lightvessels, may appear to be structurally different to comparable records on other web pages due to the fact that the particular LV might have been withdrawn from a station after photographing and being towed away for drydocking, overhaul and possible direction to a new station and therefore a different lightvessel would have been substituted at the named station on withdrawal of the previous LV. This has been most evident on those LVs that have been withdrawn and shipped to another port at home or abroad to become a floating museum, floating restaurant, 'clubhouse', etc. Scarweather LV and Helwick LV have for instance changed their r\u00f4le in their lifetime and their appearance on various records varies considerably.\n\n===England===\n\n====Active lightvessel stations====\n\nThe following are active stations at which Trinity House still maintains unmanned lightships, which also act as [[weather station]]s.\n\n[[File:Lightvessel East Goodwin.jpg|thumb|right|The East Goodwin lightvessel while under repair at [[Harwich]]]]\n\n*[[Channel Light Vessel Automatic|Channel Lightvessel]]  (north of [[Guernsey]])\n*F3 Lightvessel (middle of [[English Channel]], east of [[Ramsgate]])\n*East Goodwin Lightvessel ([[Goodwin Sands]])\n*[[Greenwich Light Vessel Automatic|Greenwich Lightvessel]]  (south of [[East Sussex]] on the [[Prime Meridian]])\n*[[Sandettie Light Vessel Automatic|Sandettie Lightvessel]]  (north of [[Calais]])\n*[[Sevenstones Lightship|Sevenstones Lightvessel]]  (west of [[Land's End]])\n*Sunk Lightvessel ([[Thames Estuary]])\n*[[Varne Bank|Varne Lightvessel]]  (southwest of [[Dover]])\n\n====Former lightvessel stations====\n[[File:Calshot Spit Lightship.jpg|thumb|Lightship LV78, formerly at [[Calshot Spit]] station]]\n\n*Bar ([[Mersey Estuary]]; maintained by MDHB)\n*Barrow Deep (Barrow Deep channel, Thames Estuary)\n*[[Black Deep]] (Thames Estuary)\n*Brake (Brake Sand, near [[Goodwin Sands]])\n*Bull (Bull Sands, mouth of the [[Humber Estuary]]; maintained by Humber Conservancy Board)\n*[[Calshot Spit]]\n*Cockle (North Sea)\n*Cork (Cork Bank, off [[Harwich]])\n*Corton (North Sea)\n*Crosby (Mersey Estuary; maintained by MDHB)\n*Docking Shoal, Norfolk coast\n*Inner / Outer Dowsing (North Sea; Inner Dowsing was the last manned lightship station, replaced by the Dowsing lighthouse in 1991)<ref name=dowsing>[http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.64/chapterId/1506/Trinity-House.html Trinity House], portcities.org</ref>\n*Dudgeon (North Sea; the Dudgeon lightvessel was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]] on 29 January 1940.

Some domestic weaving was carried out using local flax. Water power from nearby streams ground corn and provided a suitable environment for bleaching the flax.\n\nThe urbanisation and development of Neilston came largely with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Industrial scale [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile processing]] was introduced to Neilston around the middle of the 18th century with the building of several [[cotton mill]]s. Neilston became a centre for cotton and [[Calico (textile)|calico]] bleaching and printing in the 18th century, which developed into a [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and dying industry, and continued into the early 20th century. Although Neilston is known as a former [[Mill town|milling village]], [[agriculture]] has played, and continues to play, an economic role.

The restrictions set in place were cause for hundreds of gay people to be forcibly outed and fired from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. With a stroke of a pen, President Eisenhower expanded the federal government's anti-homosexual policies and procedures to include every department and agency and every private corporation with a government contract \u2013 affecting the job security of more than six million workers and armed forces personnel.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\">{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=269}}</ref> The executive order was also the cause for the firing of approximately 5,000 gay people from federal employment; this included private contractors and military personnel. Not only did the victims lose their jobs, but also they were forced out of the closet and thrust into the public eye as lesbian or gay.\n\nSpecifically, Truman's loyalty program had been extended through this executive order: \u201csexual perversion\u201d was added to a list of behaviors that would keep a person from holding a position in government. There were many new regulations and policies put into place to detect and remove gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. The new procedures to search out homosexuals were frequently to interview and look for signs of sexual orientation. They also looked at places these individuals frequently visited, such as gay bars, and they even found people guilty by association. If their friends or family showed signs of being homosexual, they might also be suspected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/items/show/1425|title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government \u00b7 OutHistory.org: It's About Time|website=outhistory.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1950s, similar repressive and oppressive policies had gone into effect in state and local governments which extended the prohibitions on the employment of lesbians and gay men to cover twelve million workers \u2013 more than twenty percent of the United States labor force \u2013 who now had to sign oaths attesting to their moral purity to get or to keep their jobs.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\"/> It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled that a person's sexual orientation alone could not be the sole reason for termination from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the [[United States Civil Service Commission]] announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case by case basis.

It was easy to convince a Congress dictated by a communist containment policy to respond to the perceived homosexual menace because they were already viewed to be not only subversive social elements of American culture, but subversive political elements. Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their homosexual [[sexual orientation]] than because they were left-leaning or communist. George Chauncey noted that: \"The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America,\" and homosexuality (and by implication homosexuals themselves) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism and subversives.<ref>Field, Douglas, ed.

Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] similarly attempted to invoke a connection between homosexuality and anti-nationalism. He said in an interview with [[Max Lerner]] that: \"You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives.\" Later in that same interview, he drew the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: \"But look, Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we? I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government.\"<ref>Lerner, Max, ''The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols'' Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313\u2013316</ref>\n\nThe term \u201cHomintern\u201d was coined in the 1930s, possibly by Cyril Connolly, W.H. Auden, or Harold Norse, as a [[Camp (style)|camp]] term playing off of \"Comintern\" ([[Communist International]]).

Eisenhower|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed [[Executive Order 10450]], which set security standards for federal employment and barred homosexuals from working in the federal government. The restrictions set in place were cause for hundreds of gay people to be forcibly outed and fired from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. With a stroke of a pen, President Eisenhower expanded the federal government's anti-homosexual policies and procedures to include every department and agency and every private corporation with a government contract \u2013 affecting the job security of more than six million workers and armed forces personnel.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\">{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=269}}</ref> The executive order was also the cause for the firing of approximately 5,000 gay people from federal employment; this included private contractors and military personnel. Not only did the victims lose their jobs, but also they were forced out of the closet and thrust into the public eye as lesbian or gay.\n\nSpecifically, Truman's loyalty program had been extended through this executive order: \u201csexual perversion\u201d was added to a list of behaviors that would keep a person from holding a position in government. There were many new regulations and policies put into place to detect and remove gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. The new procedures to search out homosexuals were frequently to interview and look for signs of sexual orientation. They also looked at frequent places these individuals visited, such as gay bars, and they even found people guilty by association. If their friends or family showed signs of being homosexual, they might also be suspected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/items/show/1425|title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government \u00b7 OutHistory.org: It's About Time|website=outhistory.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1950s, similar repressive and oppressive policies had gone into effect in state and local governments which extended the prohibitions on the employment of lesbians and gay men to cover twelve million workers \u2013 more than twenty percent of the United States labor force \u2013 who now had to sign oaths attesting to their moral purity to get or to keep their jobs.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\"/> It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled that a person's sexual orientation alone could not be the sole reason for termination from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the [[United States Civil Service Commission]] announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case by case basis.

Johnson notes that without an idealized traditional American moral fiber, any citizen could succumb to immoral temptations such as homosexuality; and they could ultimately be seduced by communism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lavender Scare|last=Johnson|first=David K.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=95}}</ref> The association of homosexuality with communism proved to be a convenient political tool to develop and implement homophobic discriminatory policy throughout the federal government. It was easy to convince a Congress dictated by a communist containment policy to respond to the perceived homosexual menace because they were already viewed to be not only subversive social elements of American culture, but subversive political elements. Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their homosexual [[sexual orientation]] than because they were left-leaning or communist. George Chauncey noted that: \"The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America,\" and homosexuality (and by implication homosexuals themselves) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism and subversives.<ref>Field, Douglas, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DztQtydwimMC American cold war culture]. Edinburgh University Press, 2005.</ref>\n\nSenator [[Kenneth S. Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] similarly attempted to invoke a connection between homosexuality and anti-nationalism. He said in an interview with [[Max Lerner]] that: \"You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives.\" Later in that same interview, he drew the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: \"But look, Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we? I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government.\"<ref>Lerner, Max, ''The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols'' Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313\u2013316</ref>\n\nThe term \u201cHomintern\u201d was coined in the 1930s, possibly by Cyril Connolly, W.H. Auden, or Harold Norse, as a [[Camp (style)|camp]] term playing off of \"Comintern\" ([[Communist International]]). It was first used to describe an imagined group of gay men who controlled the art world, and later used in reference to \u201ca fantastical gay international that sought to control the world\u201d. In 1952, an article written by [[R. G. Waldeck|R.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref>), and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three.

Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref>Gill, F. and D.

''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, a male and female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times. Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods; however, they will steal from their mate's cache if given the opportunity.<ref name=Powlesland/> Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males.<ref name=SteerBurns>{{cite journal|last1=Steer|first1=Jamie|last2=Burns|first2=KC|year=2008|title=Seasonal variation in male-female competition, cooperation and selfish hoarding in a monogamous songbird|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1175\u20131183|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0546-z}}</ref> During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.<ref name=\"ref2\"/>\n\nSouth Island robins become sexually mature between six and 12 months of age.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=Powlesland>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref>), and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R.

Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=\"ref1\"/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref>Gill, F. and D.

''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, a male and female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times. Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods; however, they will steal from their mate's cache if given the opportunity.<ref name=Powlesland/> Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males.<ref name=SteerBurns>{{cite journal|last1=Steer|first1=Jamie|last2=Burns|first2=KC|year=2008|title=Seasonal variation in male-female competition, cooperation and selfish hoarding in a monogamous songbird|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1175\u20131183|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0546-z}}</ref> During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.<ref name=\"ref2\"/>\n\nSouth Island robins become sexually mature between six and 12 months of age.

Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=Powlesland>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=\"ref2\"/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

A sequence of such edges may be called a [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]].\n\nA [[bioinformatics workflow management system]] is a specialized scientific workflow system focused on [[bioinformatics]].\n\n==Scientific workflows==\nThe simplest computerized scientific workflows are scripts that call in data, programs, and other inputs and produce outputs that might include visualizations and analytical results.  These may be implemented in programs such as [[R (programming language)|R]] or [[MATLAB]], using a scripting language such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Perl]] with a [[command-line interface]], or more recently using open-source web applications such as [[Jupyter Notebook]].\n\nThere are many motives for differentiating scientific workflows from traditional business process workflows. These include:\n* providing an easy-to-use environment for individual application scientists themselves to create their own workflows.\n* providing interactive tools for the scientists enabling them to execute their workflows and view their results in real-time.\n* simplifying the process of sharing and reusing workflows between the scientists. \n* enabling scientists to track the [[provenance]] of the workflow execution results and the workflow creation steps.\n\nBy focusing on the scientists, the focus of designing scientific workflow system shifts away from the workflow [[scheduling]] activities, typically considered by [[grid computing]] environments for optimizing the execution of complex computations on predefined resources, to a domain-specific view of what data types, tools and distributed resources should be made available to the scientists and how can one make them easily accessible and with specific Quality of Service requirements  <ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.future.2007.07.009 | volume=24 | issue=6 | title=An innovative workflow mapping mechanism for Grids in the frame of Quality of Service | journal=Future Generation Computer Systems | pages=498\u2013511| year=2008 | last1=Kyriazis | first1=Dimosthenis | last2=Tserpes | first2=Konstantinos | last3=Menychtas | first3=Andreas | last4=Litke | first4=Antonis | last5=Varvarigou | first5=Theodora }}</ref>\n\nScientific workflows are now recognized{{by whom|date=January 2014}} as a crucial element of the [[cyberinfrastructure]], facilitating e-Science. Typically sitting on top of a [[middleware]] layer, scientific workflows are a means by which scientists can model, design, execute, debug, re-configure, and re-run their analysis and visualization [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelines]]. Part of the established scientific method is to create a record of the origins of a result, how it was obtained, experimental methods used, machine calibrations and parameters, etc. It is the same in e-Science, except provenance data are a record of the workflow activities invoked, services and databases accessed, data sets used, and so forth. Such information is useful for a scientist to interpret their workflow results and for other scientists to establish trust in the experimental result.<ref>Automatic capture and efficient storage of e-Science experiment provenance. Concurrency Computat.: Pract.

A sequence of such edges may be called a [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]].\n\nA [[bioinformatics workflow management system]] is a specialized scientific workflow system focused on [[bioinformatics]].\n\n==Scientific workflows==\nThe simplest computerized scientific workflows are scripts that call in data, programs, and other inputs and produce outputs that might include visualizations and analytical results.  These may be implemented in programs such as [[R (programming language)|R]] or [[MATLAB]], using a scripting language such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Perl]] with a [[command-line interface]], or more recently using open-source web applications such as [[Jupyter Notebook]].\n\nThere are many motives for differentiating scientific workflows from traditional business process workflows. These include:\n* providing an easy-to-use environment for individual application scientists themselves to create their own workflows.\n* providing interactive tools for the scientists enabling them to execute their workflows and view their results in real-time.\n* simplifying the process of sharing and reusing workflows between the scientists. \n* enabling scientists to track the [[provenance]] of the workflow execution results and the workflow creation steps.\n\nBy focusing on the scientists, the focus of designing scientific workflow system shifts away from the workflow [[scheduling]] activities, typically considered by [[grid computing]] environments for optimizing the execution of complex computations on predefined resources, to a domain-specific view of what data types, tools and distributed resources should be made available to the scientists and how can one make them easily accessible and with specific Quality of Service requirements  <ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.future.2007.07.009 | volume=24 | issue=6 | title=An innovative workflow mapping mechanism for Grids in the frame of Quality of Service | journal=Future Generation Computer Systems | pages=498\u2013511| year=2008 | last1=Kyriazis | first1=Dimosthenis | last2=Tserpes | first2=Konstantinos | last3=Menychtas | first3=Andreas | last4=Litke | first4=Antonis | last5=Varvarigou | first5=Theodora }}</ref>\n\nScientific workflows are now recognized{{by whom|date=January 2014}} as a crucial element of the [[cyberinfrastructure]], facilitating e-Science. Typically sitting on top of a [[middleware]] layer, scientific workflows are a means by which scientists can model, design, execute, debug, re-configure, and re-run their analysis and visualization [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelines]]. Part of the established scientific method is to create a record of the origins of a result, how it was obtained, experimental methods used, machine calibrations and parameters, etc. It is the same in e-Science, except provenance data are a record of the workflow activities invoked, services and databases accessed, data sets used, and so forth. Such information is useful for a scientist to interpret their workflow results and for other scientists to establish trust in the experimental result.<ref>Automatic capture and efficient storage of e-Science experiment provenance.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.
