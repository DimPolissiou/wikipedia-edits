Ramollah) was born in [[Kermanshah]], [[Iran]], and started his public teachings at the age of 23. His teaching covers a wide range of topics from [[spirituality]] to thought and thinking methods as well as [[parapsychology]], [[metaphysics]] and [[esoteric]] knowledge. He has been the originator of some applied theories among which the ''[http://www.prothinka.org/Article/2850/ Systematic Decision Making using 7/10 Method]'' and ''poly-what planning formulae'' have been more popular.<ref>Prothinka emagazine, [http://www.prothinka-src.org/Persian/Show_eZine.php?ezine_id=12%20Prothinka-SRC vol. 12]</ref><ref>Sublime Thinking magazine, Summer 2006, Vol. 3</ref><ref>[http://360thinkingtips.blogspot.com/2010/08/136.html 360 Thinking tips]</ref> <br />\nFattahi's appearance is not similar to religious characters and he has insisted repeatedly that he is not a religious man. Although he does not teach about religions and faiths, a large proportion of his teachings are focused to revive divine spiritualism, esoteric cognition, and self-awareness. He has little if not none academic education; according to him, ''\"One day I burnt that little acquired knowledge and left it to oblivion\"'',<ref>The Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, Page 2-5</ref> but there are more than 4000 pages of manuscripts available on his teachings in the field of esoteric knowledge as well as applied and fundamental theories.

He is especially concerned about people who are astray and in deviation \u2013 that majority caught in darkness and ignorance.  He points out that he has completely explored and fully known their world; therefore, he has a very deep and strong relation with them.  However, he avoids arrogant, fanatic, pessimistic, hesitant and so-called wise people.<ref>same</ref><br />\nAlthough Fattahi's teachings on the field of thinking methods have been most popular within the past 15 years, some of his followers still know him as a spiritual leader.\n\nFattahi has been given various appellations by different categories of his followers and admirers. There have been different opinions about his nature of identity and it's been told by some of his devotees he is such or such person. But far from any pretension he has called all those attributes chimerical and superstitious and once answered to the question 'who you really are?': ''\"I am not somebody else, I am who I am.\"''<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/WhoIsTheMasterEn/2090/ Who is Master Iliya?], An Introduction published at Fattahi's official website.</ref>\nHe presents himself as a servant of God and frequently refers to himself as an ordinary and normal person.

Fattahi |source=[http://ostad-iliya.org/Manifest/1999/], An extract from 1st to 5th official statements of Master Elia Public Relation Office.}}\n\n==Teachings==\nThe biographical materials available on Fattahi via various blogs as well as [http://www.ostad-iliya.org his official website] state that he has begun his teachings at the age of 16 among a limited number of his students.<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Ammin- vol. 1] an autobiography available on [ostad-iliya.org/en Master Elia official website]</ref> Later at the age of 23, his public speeches began which was to be most welcomed by scholars, intellectuals, students and youth. However, it's been recognized that people from different categories of the society has joined him as his followers; [[literate]] and [[illiterate]], young and old, religious and secular, [[intellectual]] and [[dogmatic]], rich, poor, and even a few numbers of people with a very low incidence of being influenced by his teachings; those who have been addicted, [[perverted]] or had been considering themselves as extraordinary people and had some followers.\n\nFattahi's teachings are based on ''Elahism''.<ref>Elahism is a universal monotheistic ritual transcending any religion or faith (in [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] languages it could be an abbreviation of [[Allah]]-ism). The founder of Elahism is Maha-Avatar who has been called by various names and appellations in different regions of the globe. He is known as Master Rouhollah in Iran. A number of documentaries (in the form of films and books) have been produced about him. It's also been claimed that he has the highest rank in the esoteric masters' hierarchy. However, ''Elahism'' has been taught by some other spiritual masters in the world. The Esoteric Elahism could be defined as divine-shifted esoteric knowledge which is neither related to any of the religions nor faiths, sects or cults. Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques (named ZX methods) are the secret part of these teachings which is taught in the form of non \u2013public tutorials.</ref> A more popular name given to his teachings is \"The Art of [[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendental]] Life\" which is carried on two levels. The first level consists of simple and general instructions which is called the ''Solar Level'' or the stage of \"Revival and Rebirth\". This is the cycle of awakening, of the opening of eyes and ears, of mobilization of minds and activation of hearts.\n\nThe essence of his instructions in this level is a perception of [[divinity|divine]] presence and revelation of love for [[The Lord]] or \"living lovingly in the divine presence\". His teachings are based upon determining principles and clear basis.<ref>The Art of Transcendental Life is neither a new sacred law \u2013 [[shariat]] \u2013 nor a new spiritual path, but it is the interpretation and significance of the words of the Living Lord in the present time. The basis of his teachings consists of \"tendency towards the truth\" and this means to be inclined towards existence and presence instead of to lean towards the illusion. That is to say, being inclined toward God, God- worshiping, God-seeking, God-centeredness, God-infatuation, God-mindfulness, God-observance, God-infatuation instead of being inclined towards oneself, self-worshiping, selfishness, self-conceit, self-infatuation, and self-centeredness.  In the art of transcendental life, the emphasis is on quality, introversion, and worship of the Lining One rather than extroversion and worship of dead.</ref>\n\nThe second level is called ''Astronomical Level'' or ''Transcendental Arts'' which is related to metaphysical techniques or Psychotechnology and consists of teachings of mysteries. This level is meant for the selected and admitted individuals and due to its mysterious nature, quite a little information has been publicized about its details.<ref>More information could be retrieved at [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Fattahi's autobiography], page 112</ref><br />\n \nElia does not charge the attendees for his teachings but he believes the student's self is the price of their training.<ref>same</ref>\n\n===Other branches of Elia's public teachings===\nIn addition to [[spirituality|spiritual]] and cognitive teachings, Fattahi has held some tutorials for a limited number of his students during which they have been trained in more specialized fields. Science of Success, Harmonical Marriage, Sublime Nutrition, Creative Speaking, Methods of Sublime Struggling, Methods of Writing, Lecturing and Doing research, [[wikt:symbolism|Symbolism]] and Nature-based [[Semiotics]], Methods of Dynamic and Coordinated Therapy, Techniques of Analyzing and Interpreting of the Articles, and Esoteric [[Anthropology]] are some of his semi-public teaching courses.<ref>same</ref>\n\n====Thinking Methods====\nOne of the most pivotal branches of Fattahi's teachings is called ''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Teach/Teach9/1710/ XZY]'' or ''36 Methods of Sublime Thinking''. Methods such as [http://prothinka.org/Article/2887/ Creative Thinking], [http://prothinka.org/Article/2886/ Pattern-extractor Thinking] as well as Conceptualizer Thinking, Foresighter, Symmetrizing and Ultra-viewing methods could be noted.

This can be concluded regarding his activities within the recent years which was mainly focused on the field of thinking and thought. Some of the El-Yasin affiliated institutions such as [http://www.pmrg.ir/portal Professional Management Research Group] (PMRG) as well as [[www.prothinka.com|Association of Thinkers and Researchers]] have also been very active in discussion and transcription of Fattahi's thinking methods ever since.\n\n===Non-public Teachings===\nAnother aspect of Fattahi's teaching is focused on [[esoteric]] knowledge. It's been called ''Astronomical level'', ''ZX methods'' or Psychotechnology in which Creative Dreaming (dream making), Spiritual Communication, Teletransportation, Energy Hunting and Parallel Experiencing are taught to the trainees.<br />\nFattahi believes such trainings are not necessary for the public, therefore, he has recommended them to a limited number of his followers who have been selected and admitted by precise and strict criteria. According to Fattahi's followers, it's necessary for an esoteric apprentice to be committed to some strict rules such as keeping anonymity, protecting the mysterious techniques, avoiding the use of their abilities for personal means and complying with some unusual conditions.<ref>More information could be retrieved from [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Aamin, vol.1], page 12</ref>\n\nRegardless to the detailed content of all above-mentioned categories, Fattahi considers the extract of his teachings in the divine phrase ''There is no deity other than Him/Her'' (La Elaha Ella Hou).<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, 1998</ref>\n\n==Lectures==\nThe first rounds of Master Elia's public lectures were begun at his age of 23 (1996) in [[Tehran]]. These lectures used to be held mostly in cultural centers and community halls and were extremely welcomed by different categories of audiences especially youth, [[students]], writers, [[intellectuals]] and [[scholars]]. \nBefore being forced to stop by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Iran)]], the organizers had to arrange his lectures in the largest [[auditoriums]] of Tehran with the capacity for admission of thousands of people, but, those auditoriums were not spacious enough for eager audiences, therefore, further sessions were carried out with [[wikt:audio|audio]] or video playback.\n\nThose lectures were generally given in various subjects such as:\n* [[Faith]], the key of human [[salvation]]\n* [[Thinking]] and its methods\n* [[wikt:divine|Divine]] [[Parables]]\n* Calling on God\n* God is the one\n* Review and analysis of Eastern mysticism\n* Guiles and traps of the [[Devil]]\n* Observation and methods of controlling [[ego (spirituality)|ego]]\n* God's holy names\n* [[Parapsychology]] and Science of success\n* The art of [[transcendentals|transcendental]] living; the sublime life\n* God's [[blessing]], God's [[Divine grace|grace]]\n* Gratitude to God\n* Divine communication\n* Methods of [[worshiping]] and the keys to materialization of a wish\n* [[The Art of Dreaming|Dreaming]] and creative observation\n* Female-dominance or male-dominance?\n* The Superior President\n* Your attitude is determinant to your [[future]]\n* Determinative words\n* ...\n\nIn the following years, under serious pressures of the Security Office against Religions and Religious Minorities, the lectures were held less frequently. Not a day passed without direct or indirect attacks from radical [[clergies]] in their bid to control the scene of culture and religion. \nIn Spring 2005, during a lecture at the [[Shahid Shiroudi Stadium]] in Tehran, a direct and physical attack was mounted by undercover agents in a bid to harm and arrest Elia.<ref>To watch a footage of this event click [http://ostad-iliya.org/MovieEn/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=114 here] or [http://ostad-iliya.org/Movie/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=103 here] .</ref> Although, he was not arrested as a result of participants' robust defense but this session is considered as the last public meeting of Master Elia M. Ramollah since 2005. It is worth mentioning that in winter 2007 a plan was set to hold a speech session in [[Azadi Stadium]] (Tehran) with a capacity to admit 100,000 audiences, but it was dropped due to strong disagreement of the authorities at [[Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Ministry of Intelligence and Security of Iran]].\n\n==From the critics' point of view==\nFattahi's name (Elia M. Ramollah) was first mentioned by [[Kayhan|''Kayhan'' newspaper]]<ref>Kayhan newspaper, 28/03/1383- Persian calendar</ref> (the organ of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]) as a perverted character (2004). His name was published once again in ''Kayhan''<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> and ''[[Resalat (newspaper)|Resalat]]''<ref>New religions typology, Hamidieh Behzad, 20/03/1385- Persian calendar</ref> newspapers a few months before his first detention in 2007 by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)|Security service of Iran]].\n\nTaking the actions of Iranian governmental newspapers and TVs into account, one can conclude that despite having thousands of followers and admirers, Fattahi is faced with serious [[dogmatic]] [[critics]] some of which accuse him of heresy and claiming [[prophecy]], and categorize his teachings as a [[New religious movement]] (NRM).<ref>New religions typology, Hamidieh Behzad, 20/03/1385- Persian calendar</ref>\n\nSome others, however, consider him as the master of a tempting and [[Subversion|subversive]] [[sect]], related to global [[Zionism]] networks, related to [[Freemasonry|Masons]], a talented [[Hypnotize Minds|mesmerizer]], [[wizard (paranormal)|wizard]], a neo-[[Rasputin]] and a [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] promoter.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Islamic Republican (newspaper)|Jomhouri Eslami]] newspaper published an article titled ''A God who is the 13th child of his family'' in which Fattahi was introduced as a person claiming [[deity]].<ref>Jomhouri Eslami newspaper, No. 8619, 02/03/1388- persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn brief, various calumnious accusations surfaced against Fattahi were:\nThe new [[Messiah]], [[Krishnamurti]]'s next ring, the [[Devil]], spirit of Messiah, the prophet of non-believers and non-religious, the preacher of spirituality without religion, US and Western power's agent, a preacher of negative resistance, 21st century wizard, Mahatma Elia, the second [[Gandhi]], the second [[Martin Luther|Luther]], the 3rd [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], corrupted, excommunicated, leader of American culture, a preacher of spiritual innovation and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], harbinger of so-called Elia-ism, and a deity claimant.\n\nTo address the accusations claimed by Fattahi's opponents, the 6th branch of the Special Court for Governmental Staffs was authorized to open a special case against him (2006), and recalled the possible plaintiffs through a public announcement by [[Kayhan]] to lodge their complaints.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> However, the case was closed without any specific result due to lack of plaintiffs.<ref>[http://www.ettelaat.net/08-maj/news.asp?id=28905 Ettelaat Net]</ref>\n\nElia's opponents do not deny his ability and knowledge in different areas but unlike his fans who consider it as an entitlement of a divine sense, their approach is to destruct and to question his talents.\nSome of them claim that his charismatic character has its root on his childhood and the family issues he was facing combined with an essence of talent and innate genius: \n''Due to his family problems, especially mental turbulent atmosphere full of family conflicts, he was forced to quit school and became solitary and isolated.''<ref>Anonymous,''Elia, Ramollah, the Avatar and ...'', Kajraheh Supplement, Jam e Jam Newspaper, March 2007, p. 18</ref> <br />\n \nSome other opponents attribute his talents to extensive studies in various fields:\n''Later on, he began studying the metaphysics books and documents such as Psycho technology, halo vision, dreaming, Maha-meditation, energy healing and other so-called science including cosmic science. He then met some celebrities and masters in this area\u2026''<ref>same</ref>\n\n''Despite lack of formal education and classical studies, he took advantage of his talents and proportional abilities to compensate his personality defects very well.''<ref>same</ref>\n\nFattahi has responded to some of these allegations in this way:\n\n''Question: Some believe you are insane or a wizard. Why should they believe so?''\n\nAnswer: \"If I would use the opposite medicine you would use to cure the same illness, we shall, naturally, take each other for insane. It is not your fault to call me mad for you to realize the way I act, think or move is contrary to your expectations. Since you take yourself as a wise person, you will naturally call mad and insane whoever moves and thinks unlike you\u2026those who call me sorcerer and wizard want to relieve their conscience and actually assert themselves and maintain their claims.\nThey hear my teachings and get impressed and see that others are impressed as well. They observe changes and evolution, awakenings and cries and are thus faced with divine power and holy teachings. However, they think if they accept these teachings, the colossal palace they have built in their conceit will collapse and their false and superficial rightfulness will be denounced. They believe accepting the teachings of God's Spirit jeopardizes their profits\u2026They see the divine power yet because it goes against their egoistic aspirations they attack the person and individuality of the teacher. They calumniate him and investigate his personality.\"<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Page 123-124</ref>\n\nThere have been several statements officially published by Elyasin Community as a response to rumors and allegations about Peyman Fattahi.<ref>These statements have originally been issued between 1990 and 1997 by the Office of Public Relations of the community and republished to clarify his followers' attitude toward those rumors. To read an extract of them click [http://www.ostad-iliya.org/Manifest/1999/ here].</ref>\n\nFattahi's devotees do believe most of these rumors and allegations have been already responded in officially issued statements, however, many of them have been actively challenging with such destructive acts specifically after the open conflicts of Iranian security service with their master and leader. They have expressed their disagreement with these demolition jobs mostly by compiling books, publishing articles, film making, and blogging and are still working on these issues.\n\nIn spite of their attempts to respond to the allegations and rumors, destructive acts by Fattahi's opponents are still ongoing, using the governmental tribunes and in form of publishing articles, circulation of free bulletins and digests, broadcasting TV serials and round-tables as well as making fake and fabricated documentaries. In Summer 2011, a report was published by Religions and Faiths Watch<ref>http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/308/1/ Corruptors and Demons!</ref> about the exhibition and fairs held by [[Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom|Qom Seminary]] and the [http://www.ido.ir/en/en-default.aspx Islamic Development Organization] (IDO). In those events, an extensive attack has been designated to happen against Green movement leaders ([[Mirhossein Mousavi|Mousavi]], [[Mehdi KARUBI|Karubi]] and [[Seyed Mohammad Khatami|Khatami]]), U.S. presidents ([[Barack Obama]] and [[George W. Bush]]), European presidents (like [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]), some Iranian intellectuals and dissidents (such as Dr [[Abdolkarim Soroush|Soroush]], [[Mohsen Kadivar]], [[Akbar Ganji]], [[Alireza Nourizadeh]], [[Mohsen Sazegara]]). In these sets of exhibitions, further to Peyman Fattahi (known as Master Elia \u2013 the leader of Elyasin Community) some spiritual movements (such as [[Baha'i]]s and [[Dervish]]es) and spiritual leaders (such as [[Dalai Lama]], [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], Paul Twitchel \u2013 the master of [[Eckankar]] and Li Hongzhi \u2013 the master of [[Falun Dafa]]) has been targeted by Iranian extremist clergies.\n\nFurthermore, a TV programme entitled ''[[Armageddon]]'' (the final battle between the good and evil) has been broadcast by the News Channel of Islamic republic of Iran (IRINN) and other governmental media (2011). The TV series consists of 104 episodes, some of which have been replayed several times by governmental TV. According to the latest report of ''Association of Thinkers and Researcher''<ref>''The 45th attack of Iranian extremist clergies to Master Elia'' (Summary of Armageddon TV Series, episode 25), Paris Keynezhad \u2013 Senior member of Association of THikers and Researchers</ref> episode 25 begins with blatant lies and demolition jobs on Elia M. then continues doing the same against the author [[Paulo Coelho]]. It is claimed in the film that Paulo Coelho is corrupted, Satanist, Zionist and a drug addict. In another episode the narrator speaks about other famous characters and groups like [[Shimon Peres]]-the ex-prime minister and the current president of Israel and one of the pioneers of modern Zionism, [[Osho Rajneesh]] and [[Eckankar]] spiritual movement then emphasizes that the [[U.S.]] presidents, like Mr. Bush and Obama as well as the foreign minister of United States [[Hillary Clinton]], European presidents and even the Pope<ref>the world leader of catholic Christians</ref> are all [[Satanist]]s.\n\nThe 4th season of ''Armageddon'' TV programme has been replayed four times on governmental television of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].<ref>The main subject of the other episodes of Armageddon, season 4 is as follows:\nMedia Pluralism, Satellite Channels, BBC, VOA ( in this episode it is claimed that VOA is affiliated with Zionism, Baha'i, etc), Cold Digital War (claiming that Facebook, Microsoft, Internet, etc. are all perverted and Zionistic), Rereading the History of Cinema in Iran (claiming that the cinema of Iran has its roots in Freemasons and Zionism\u2026), Zionist Cults and Terrorist Coup d'\u00e9tat-seekers (it speaks about the Baha'i's attempts to dominate Iran and their treachery and demolitions), Secular Sufis, Modern Spiritualities (claiming that Dalai Lama, Sai Baba, Osho, Krishnamurti, etc. are all perverted and hirelings and Ekankar, TSM, etc. are all Zionistic), Anarchistic Spirituality (claiming that Elia M.

These reports and the growing magnitude of his public events may have ultimately contributed to his arrest.\n\n\"On May 27, 2007, Master Fattahi (known as Eliya M) was arrested by the \"Department against Religions and Religious Minorities\" (DARRM). He was sent to notorious security ward 209 of [[Evin prison]]. Afraid of his follower's support, the security officials were at loss to decide on jailing him. According to DARRM statement, Eliya M. was finally arrested by the decision of high-ranking religious officials. A council consist of highest-ranking religious and cleric powers of Iran decided that Eliya M. should be quietly arrested under charges of permuting the religion (Islam), proselytism, an invitation to spiritual pluralism, conspiracy against the Islamic government, renewal of religion by linking Islam, Christianity and Judaism; spiritual liberalism and incitement to the so \u0640 called American Islam and many other routine accusations that are used in these cases such as Offending sacred symbols of religion, a conspiracy by creating underground secret society and cult (Eliya \u0640 ism). But he had only one crime: he was against the Islam that calls for violence\u2026 Eliya was arrested for spiritual liberty, for a different interpretation of God's words which was against the cold stagnant understanding of religion.\".<ref>Extracted from [http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/40/36/ the first open letter of Elia's followers to leaders of the world]</ref>\n\nIn November 2007, Peyman Fattahi was released on a bail of 300 million Tomans (almost 300,000 USD) after spending six months in prison, suffering from recurrent bleeding from nose and ears, bloody vomiting and bloody urination.<ref>[[U.S Department of State]] annual report on Iran Human Rights.

Although there is no press released report available on this matter.\n\n===Third Detention===\nOn 24 July 2011, a report was published about Fatahi's third detention along with a number of his students and members of Association of Thinkers and Researchers.<ref>To original script of the news could be retrieved from this [http://prothinka.org/News/3381/ link]</ref>\n\nA few days later, the official spokesperson of Elyasin Community who resides in UK<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/people/Paris-Keynejad/1108926967 Paris Keynezhad]</ref> verified this news by publishing an announcement but she mentioned they have all been released shortly after detention and none of the Elyasin members are under arrest. Some other key members of Elyasin verified this official announcement as well.<ref>The statement can be retrieved from this [http://www.emruznews.com/2011/08/post-7081.php link]</ref>\n\nImmediately after publishing of this announcement [[Tabnak]] and some the government- related blogs and websites began to widely publish a short note about Fattahi's arrest in which the event was distorted.<ref>[http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/179079/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%DB%8C-%C2%AB%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%C2%BB Tabnak], 02/05/1390 \u2013 Persian calendar, news code# 179079</ref> Fattahi's followers do believe re-publishing of this news firstly by Tabnak then by the other government affiliated websites have happened to proceed with the aim of [[psychological war]] against Fattahi and Elyasin Community.\n\nHowever, this act brought an immediate response from Fattahi's followers in the form of publishing an open letter from members of [http://www.prothinka-src.org Association of Thinkers and Researchers (overseas branch)] to world leaders.

Elyasin consists of a number of NGO's and publishing houses, most of which have been banned and shut time from the time of Ahmadinejad's presidency. There are some magazines affiliated to Elyasin such as ''Art of Living'', ''Esoteric Knowledge'', ''Motivators'', [[Science of Success (magazine)|''Science of Success'']], ''The Art of Transcendental Life'', and ''Sublime Thinking''. \nAvamer-e-Yasin, Science of Success, [http://www.prothinka.com Association of Thinkers and Researchers], Nature Front Association, Yasin Society of Writers and Researchers (Payam), and [http://ayahra.org/en Elyasin Human Rights and International Affairs] are some of Elyasin treaty bodies to be noted.\nIt's worth mentioning that Fattahi's followers are generally known as 'Elahioun' who can be recognized in different sub-categories such as \"Mansouroun (Elias' Offsprings)\", Iliya Supporters, The protectors of Elia M., Ghadr and Payam 1,2,3 groups, and Sina group (Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques trainees and apprentices).\nFattahi's devotees are running a number of active blogs and websites at the moment.\n\n==Written Works and confiscated books==\n'''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Jaryane-_Hedayate-Elahi_edition-2.pdf The Flow of Divine Guidance]''' is the only published book which is a transcription of Fattahi's public speeches at the age of 23. This book has been compiled by one of his close disciples and primarily published in 1998. However, this book was banned after the first publishing. His followers claim thousands of copies of it have been printed and distributed by Fattahi's devotees inside and outside of Iran. \nThere are more than 30 books have been confiscated by Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran) including:<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/ILIYA-CV-en.pdf Victims of ruthlessness]</ref>\n\n# The \"Teachings of Truth\" canon which contains some of his speeches and lectures.\n# \"Esoteric schools and the mysterious meanings in manuscripts\"\n# \"Sublime thinking and methods of creative thinking\" (consist of thirty six methods of thinking)\n# \"Thinking Formulas and Mental Software\"(consist of more than seven hundred thinking formulas to do different works)\n# \"The Art of Sublime Struggle\"\n# [[Hezbollah]] Doctrine (The Army of God Doctrine) (on inviting Hezbollah to use flexible methods and software thinking and to avoid violence and increase tendency to love)\n# \"Universal Theories and Modern Spirituality\"\n# \"Fundamental Life patterns\"\n# \"True Intuitions and False interpretations\"\n# \"The Art of Dreaming in Elahism (creative dreaming and dream making)\"\n# \"Esoteric judgment and true justice\"\n# \"Harmonious and Disharmonic Marriage\"\n# \"Saviors of the World and Motivators\"\n# \"Fundamental Insights and Enlivening Thoughts\"\n# \"The Ancient Science of Semiotics\"(understanding the signs of the world around us)\n# \"Teaching revolutionary counseling\"\n# \"Inward Interpretations of outward verses or signs\"\n# \"Creative Look; constructive thoughts and inventive words\"\n# \"The Meanings of Nature Sounds and Birds Songs\"\n# \"The Future of the World, Civilizations and Religions\"\n# \"The Knowledge of Names and Luminous Keys\"\n# \"The Methods of Predicting future\"\n# \"Cults and Anti Cults\" (on what cults are and analyzing and controlling them)\n# \"The Correspondence\"(letters, questions, messages and recommendations to the leaders of the world, scientists and scholars)\n\n==Doctrines and Fundamental Theories==\nAccording to Fattahi's old allies a large number of [[doctrine]]s and fundamental theories have been proposed by him since 20 years ago.<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Ammin, vol.1], page 452-454,</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been usually suggested during public speeches and meetings as well as personal conversations and discussions on the daily routine. Then, they have been further analyzed by students who have been responsible for collecting them. Although most of these theories are esoteric-based and esoteric-oriented, they do concern all aspects of life and sometimes are linked to the details of daily life.\nThe doctrines of Sublime Struggle, Reconciliation of Civilizations, Creative Look, Harmonious Marriage, as well as the doctrine of coordination, doctrine Suprapolar Human Being (bipolar man), the doctrine of 360-degree view are some of which could be mentioned in this regard. Also, the theories of Intuitive References, Creative Review and the doctrine of Voluntary and Recurrent Death could be noted.<ref>same</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been collected and further discussed by a number of his students in a multi-volume set of books entitled ''360 Doctrines and Comprehensive Theories''.

His teaching covers a wide range of topics from [[spirituality]] to thought and thinking methods as well as [[parapsychology]], [[metaphysics]] and [[esoteric]] knowledge. He has been the originator of some applied theories among which the ''[http://www.prothinka.org/Article/2850/ Systematic Decision Making using 7/10 Method]'' and ''poly-what planning formulae'' have been more popular.<ref>Prothinka emagazine, [http://www.prothinka-src.org/Persian/Show_eZine.php?ezine_id=12%20Prothinka-SRC vol. 12]</ref><ref>Sublime Thinking magazine, Summer 2006, Vol. 3</ref><ref>[http://360thinkingtips.blogspot.com/2010/08/136.html 360 Thinking tips]</ref> <br />\nFattahi's appearance is not similar to religious characters and he has insisted repeatedly that he is not a religious man. Although he does not teach about religions and faiths, a large proportion of his teachings are focused to revive divine spiritualism, esoteric cognition, and self-awareness. He has little if not none academic education; according to him, ''\"One day I burnt that little acquired knowledge and left it to oblivion\"'',<ref>The Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, Page 2-5</ref> but there are more than 4000 pages of manuscripts available on his teachings in the field of esoteric knowledge as well as applied and fundamental theories.

However, he avoids arrogant, fanatic, pessimistic, hesitant and so-called wise people.<ref>same</ref><br />\nAlthough Fattahi's teachings on the field of thinking methods have been most popular within the past 15 years, some of his followers still know him as a spiritual leader.\n\nFattahi has been given various appellations by different categories of his followers and admirers. There have been different opinions about his nature of identity and it's been told by some of his devotees he is such or such person. But far from any pretension he has called all those attributes chimerical and superstitious and once answered to the question 'who you really are?': ''\"I am not somebody else, I am who I am.\"''<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/WhoIsTheMasterEn/2090/ Who is Master Iliya?], An Introduction published at Fattahi's official website.</ref>\nHe presents himself as a servant of God and frequently refers to himself as an ordinary and normal person.

However, it's been recognized that people from different categories of the society has joined him as his followers; [[literate]] and [[illiterate]], young and old, religious and secular, [[intellectual]] and [[dogmatic]], rich, poor, and even a few numbers of people with a very low incidence of being influenced by his teachings; those who have been addicted, [[perverted]] or had been considering themselves as extraordinary people and had some followers.\n\nFattahi's teachings are based on ''Elahism''.<ref>Elahism is a universal monotheistic ritual transcending any religion or faith (in [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] languages it could be an abbreviation of [[Allah]]-ism). The founder of Elahism is Maha-Avatar who has been called by various names and appellations in different regions of the globe. He is known as Master Rouhollah in Iran. A number of documentaries (in the form of films and books) have been produced about him. It's also been claimed that he has the highest rank in the esoteric masters' hierarchy. However, ''Elahism'' has been taught by some other spiritual masters in the world. The Esoteric Elahism could be defined as divine-shifted esoteric knowledge which is neither related to any of the religions nor faiths, sects or cults. Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques (named ZX methods) are the secret part of these teachings which is taught in the form of non \u2013public tutorials.</ref> A more popular name given to his teachings is \"The Art of [[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendental]] Life\" which is carried on two levels. The first level consists of simple and general instructions which is called the ''Solar Level'' or the stage of \"Revival and Rebirth\". This is the cycle of awakening, of the opening of eyes and ears, of mobilization of minds and activation of hearts.\n\nThe essence of his instructions in this level is a perception of [[divinity|divine]] presence and revelation of love for [[The Lord]] or \"living lovingly in the divine presence\". His teachings are based upon determining principles and clear basis.<ref>The Art of Transcendental Life is neither a new sacred law \u2013 [[shariat]] \u2013 nor a new spiritual path, but it is the interpretation and significance of the words of the Living Lord in the present time. The basis of his teachings consists of \"tendency towards the truth\" and this means to be inclined towards existence and presence instead of to lean towards the illusion. That is to say, being inclined toward God, God- worshiping, God-seeking, God-centeredness, God-infatuation, God-mindfulness, God-observance, God-infatuation instead of being inclined towards oneself, self-worshiping, selfishness, self-conceit, self-infatuation, and self-centeredness.  In the art of transcendental life, the emphasis is on quality, introversion, and worship of the Lining One rather than extroversion and worship of dead.</ref>\n\nThe second level is called ''Astronomical Level'' or ''Transcendental Arts'' which is related to metaphysical techniques or Psychotechnology and consists of teachings of mysteries. This level is meant for the selected and admitted individuals and due to its mysterious nature, quite a little information has been publicized about its details.<ref>More information could be retrieved at [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Fattahi's autobiography], page 112</ref><br />\n \nElia does not charge the attendees for his teachings but he believes the student's self is the price of their training.<ref>same</ref>\n\n===Other branches of Elia's public teachings===\nIn addition to [[spirituality|spiritual]] and cognitive teachings, Fattahi has held some tutorials for a limited number of his students during which they have been trained in more specialized fields. Science of Success, Harmonical Marriage, Sublime Nutrition, Creative Speaking, Methods of Sublime Struggling, Methods of Writing, Lecturing and Doing research, [[wikt:symbolism|Symbolism]] and Nature-based [[Semiotics]], Methods of Dynamic and Coordinated Therapy, Techniques of Analyzing and Interpreting of the Articles, and Esoteric [[Anthropology]] are some of his semi-public teaching courses.<ref>same</ref>\n\n====Thinking Methods====\nOne of the most pivotal branches of Fattahi's teachings is called ''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Teach/Teach9/1710/ XZY]'' or ''36 Methods of Sublime Thinking''. Methods such as [http://prothinka.org/Article/2887/ Creative Thinking], [http://prothinka.org/Article/2886/ Pattern-extractor Thinking] as well as Conceptualizer Thinking, Foresighter, Symmetrizing and Ultra-viewing methods could be noted.

This can be concluded regarding his activities within the recent years which was mainly focused on the field of thinking and thought. Some of the El-Yasin affiliated institutions such as [http://www.pmrg.ir/portal Professional Management Research Group] (PMRG) as well as [[www.prothinka.com|Association of Thinkers and Researchers]] have also been very active in discussion and transcription of Fattahi's thinking methods ever since.\n\n===Non-public Teachings===\nAnother aspect of Fattahi's teaching is focused on [[esoteric]] knowledge. It's been called ''Astronomical level'', ''ZX methods'' or Psychotechnology in which Creative Dreaming (dream making), Spiritual Communication, Teletransportation, Energy Hunting and Parallel Experiencing are taught to the trainees.<br />\nFattahi believes such trainings are not necessary for the public, therefore, he has recommended them to a limited number of his followers who have been selected and admitted by precise and strict criteria. According to Fattahi's followers, it's necessary for an esoteric apprentice to be committed to some strict rules such as keeping anonymity, protecting the mysterious techniques, avoiding the use of their abilities for personal means and complying with some unusual conditions.<ref>More information could be retrieved from [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Aamin, vol.1], page 12</ref>\n\nRegardless to the detailed content of all above-mentioned categories, Fattahi considers the extract of his teachings in the divine phrase ''There is no deity other than Him/Her'' (La Elaha Ella Hou).<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, 1998</ref>\n\n==Lectures==\nThe first rounds of Master Elia's public lectures were begun at his age of 23 (1996) in [[Tehran]]. These lectures used to be held mostly in cultural centers and community halls and were extremely welcomed by different categories of audiences especially youth, [[students]], writers, [[intellectuals]] and [[scholars]]. \nBefore being forced to stop by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Iran)]], the organizers had to arrange his lectures in the largest [[auditoriums]] of Tehran with the capacity for admission of thousands of people, but, those auditoriums were not spacious enough for eager audiences, therefore, further sessions were carried out with [[wikt:audio|audio]] or video playback.\n\nThose lectures were generally given in various subjects such as:\n* [[Faith]], the key of human [[salvation]]\n* [[Thinking]] and its methods\n* [[wikt:divine|Divine]] [[Parables]]\n* Calling on God\n* God is the one\n* Review and analysis of Eastern mysticism\n* Guiles and traps of the [[Devil]]\n* Observation and methods of controlling [[ego (spirituality)|ego]]\n* God's holy names\n* [[Parapsychology]] and Science of success\n* The art of [[transcendentals|transcendental]] living; the sublime life\n* God's [[blessing]], God's [[Divine grace|grace]]\n* Gratitude to God\n* Divine communication\n* Methods of [[worshiping]] and the keys to materialization of a wish\n* [[The Art of Dreaming|Dreaming]] and creative observation\n* Female-dominance or male-dominance?\n* The Superior President\n* Your attitude is determinant to your [[future]]\n* Determinative words\n* ...\n\nIn the following years, under serious pressures of the Security Office against Religions and Religious Minorities, the lectures were held less frequently. Not a day passed without direct or indirect attacks from radical [[clergies]] in their bid to control the scene of culture and religion. \nIn Spring 2005, during a lecture at the [[Shahid Shiroudi Stadium]] in Tehran, a direct and physical attack was mounted by undercover agents in a bid to harm and arrest Elia.<ref>To watch a footage of this event click [http://ostad-iliya.org/MovieEn/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=114 here] or [http://ostad-iliya.org/Movie/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=103 here] .</ref> Although, he was not arrested as a result of participants' robust defense but this session is considered as the last public meeting of Master Elia M. Ramollah since 2005. It is worth mentioning that in winter 2007 a plan was set to hold a speech session in [[Azadi Stadium]] (Tehran) with a capacity to admit 100,000 audiences, but it was dropped due to strong disagreement of the authorities at [[Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Ministry of Intelligence and Security of Iran]].\n\n==From the critics' point of view==\nFattahi's name (Elia M. Ramollah) was first mentioned by [[Kayhan|''Kayhan'' newspaper]]<ref>Kayhan newspaper, 28/03/1383- Persian calendar</ref> (the organ of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]) as a perverted character (2004).

Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Islamic Republican (newspaper)|Jomhouri Eslami]] newspaper published an article titled ''A God who is the 13th child of his family'' in which Fattahi was introduced as a person claiming [[deity]].<ref>Jomhouri Eslami newspaper, No. 8619, 02/03/1388- persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn brief, various calumnious accusations surfaced against Fattahi were:\nThe new [[Messiah]], [[Krishnamurti]]'s next ring, the [[Devil]], spirit of Messiah, the prophet of non-believers and non-religious, the preacher of spirituality without religion, US and Western power's agent, a preacher of negative resistance, 21st century wizard, Mahatma Elia, the second [[Gandhi]], the second [[Martin Luther|Luther]], the 3rd [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], corrupted, excommunicated, leader of American culture, a preacher of spiritual innovation and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], harbinger of so-called Elia-ism, and a deity claimant.\n\nTo address the accusations claimed by Fattahi's opponents, the 6th branch of the Special Court for Governmental Staffs was authorized to open a special case against him (2006), and recalled the possible plaintiffs through a public announcement by [[Kayhan]] to lodge their complaints.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> However, the case was closed without any specific result due to lack of plaintiffs.<ref>[http://www.ettelaat.net/08-maj/news.asp?id=28905 Ettelaat Net]</ref>\n\nElia's opponents do not deny his ability and knowledge in different areas but unlike his fans who consider it as an entitlement of a divine sense, their approach is to destruct and to question his talents.\nSome of them claim that his charismatic character has its root on his childhood and the family issues he was facing combined with an essence of talent and innate genius: \n''Due to his family problems, especially mental turbulent atmosphere full of family conflicts, he was forced to quit school and became solitary and isolated.''<ref>Anonymous,''Elia, Ramollah, the Avatar and ...'', Kajraheh Supplement, Jam e Jam Newspaper, March 2007, p. 18</ref> <br />\n \nSome other opponents attribute his talents to extensive studies in various fields:\n''Later on, he began studying the metaphysics books and documents such as Psycho technology, halo vision, dreaming, Maha-meditation, energy healing and other so-called science including cosmic science. He then met some celebrities and masters in this area\u2026''<ref>same</ref>\n\n''Despite lack of formal education and classical studies, he took advantage of his talents and proportional abilities to compensate his personality defects very well.''<ref>same</ref>\n\nFattahi has responded to some of these allegations in this way:\n\n''Question: Some believe you are insane or a wizard. Why should they believe so?''\n\nAnswer: \"If I would use the opposite medicine you would use to cure the same illness, we shall, naturally, take each other for insane. It is not your fault to call me mad for you to realize the way I act, think or move is contrary to your expectations. Since you take yourself as a wise person, you will naturally call mad and insane whoever moves and thinks unlike you\u2026those who call me sorcerer and wizard want to relieve their conscience and actually assert themselves and maintain their claims.\nThey hear my teachings and get impressed and see that others are impressed as well. They observe changes and evolution, awakenings and cries and are thus faced with divine power and holy teachings. However, they think if they accept these teachings, the colossal palace they have built in their conceit will collapse and their false and superficial rightfulness will be denounced. They believe accepting the teachings of God's Spirit jeopardizes their profits\u2026They see the divine power yet because it goes against their egoistic aspirations they attack the person and individuality of the teacher. They calumniate him and investigate his personality.\"<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Page 123-124</ref>\n\nThere have been several statements officially published by Elyasin Community as a response to rumors and allegations about Peyman Fattahi.<ref>These statements have originally been issued between 1990 and 1997 by the Office of Public Relations of the community and republished to clarify his followers' attitude toward those rumors. To read an extract of them click [http://www.ostad-iliya.org/Manifest/1999/ here].</ref>\n\nFattahi's devotees do believe most of these rumors and allegations have been already responded in officially issued statements, however, many of them have been actively challenging with such destructive acts specifically after the open conflicts of Iranian security service with their master and leader. They have expressed their disagreement with these demolition jobs mostly by compiling books, publishing articles, film making, and blogging and are still working on these issues.\n\nIn spite of their attempts to respond to the allegations and rumors, destructive acts by Fattahi's opponents are still ongoing, using the governmental tribunes and in form of publishing articles, circulation of free bulletins and digests, broadcasting TV serials and round-tables as well as making fake and fabricated documentaries. In Summer 2011, a report was published by Religions and Faiths Watch<ref>http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/308/1/ Corruptors and Demons!</ref> about the exhibition and fairs held by [[Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom|Qom Seminary]] and the [http://www.ido.ir/en/en-default.aspx Islamic Development Organization] (IDO). In those events, an extensive attack has been designated to happen against Green movement leaders ([[Mirhossein Mousavi|Mousavi]], [[Mehdi KARUBI|Karubi]] and [[Seyed Mohammad Khatami|Khatami]]), U.S. presidents ([[Barack Obama]] and [[George W. Bush]]), European presidents (like [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]), some Iranian intellectuals and dissidents (such as Dr [[Abdolkarim Soroush|Soroush]], [[Mohsen Kadivar]], [[Akbar Ganji]], [[Alireza Nourizadeh]], [[Mohsen Sazegara]]). In these sets of exhibitions, further to Peyman Fattahi (known as Master Elia \u2013 the leader of Elyasin Community) some spiritual movements (such as [[Baha'i]]s and [[Dervish]]es) and spiritual leaders (such as [[Dalai Lama]], [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], Paul Twitchel \u2013 the master of [[Eckankar]] and Li Hongzhi \u2013 the master of [[Falun Dafa]]) has been targeted by Iranian extremist clergies.\n\nFurthermore, a TV programme entitled ''[[Armageddon]]'' (the final battle between the good and evil) has been broadcast by the News Channel of Islamic republic of Iran (IRINN) and other governmental media (2011). The TV series consists of 104 episodes, some of which have been replayed several times by governmental TV. According to the latest report of ''Association of Thinkers and Researcher''<ref>''The 45th attack of Iranian extremist clergies to Master Elia'' (Summary of Armageddon TV Series, episode 25), Paris Keynezhad \u2013 Senior member of Association of THikers and Researchers</ref> episode 25 begins with blatant lies and demolition jobs on Elia M. then continues doing the same against the author [[Paulo Coelho]]. It is claimed in the film that Paulo Coelho is corrupted, Satanist, Zionist and a drug addict. In another episode the narrator speaks about other famous characters and groups like [[Shimon Peres]]-the ex-prime minister and the current president of Israel and one of the pioneers of modern Zionism, [[Osho Rajneesh]] and [[Eckankar]] spiritual movement then emphasizes that the [[U.S.]] presidents, like Mr. Bush and Obama as well as the foreign minister of United States [[Hillary Clinton]], European presidents and even the Pope<ref>the world leader of catholic Christians</ref> are all [[Satanist]]s.\n\nThe 4th season of ''Armageddon'' TV programme has been replayed four times on governmental television of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].<ref>The main subject of the other episodes of Armageddon, season 4 is as follows:\nMedia Pluralism, Satellite Channels, BBC, VOA ( in this episode it is claimed that VOA is affiliated with Zionism, Baha'i, etc), Cold Digital War (claiming that Facebook, Microsoft, Internet, etc. are all perverted and Zionistic), Rereading the History of Cinema in Iran (claiming that the cinema of Iran has its roots in Freemasons and Zionism\u2026), Zionist Cults and Terrorist Coup d'\u00e9tat-seekers (it speaks about the Baha'i's attempts to dominate Iran and their treachery and demolitions), Secular Sufis, Modern Spiritualities (claiming that Dalai Lama, Sai Baba, Osho, Krishnamurti, etc. are all perverted and hirelings and Ekankar, TSM, etc. are all Zionistic), Anarchistic Spirituality (claiming that Elia M.

A number of his close associates and followers were also arrested<ref>[[Khabarnet]], 13 July 2009</ref> including two of his brothers, Keyvan and Ramin Fattahi.\n\nIn 2004, Fattahi and his followers began to gain attention in the mainstream media, with an incendiary editorial in a hard-line national newspaper portraying Fattahi as a miscreant.<ref>[[Kayhan]], 17 June 2004</ref> Several more articles were published in hard-line newspapers since then (Resalat, Kayhan, Jam e jam, Jomhouri Eslami), with the charges leveled at Fattahi and his group taking on a more serious air. These reports and the growing magnitude of his public events may have ultimately contributed to his arrest.\n\n\"On May 27, 2007, Master Fattahi (known as Eliya M) was arrested by the \"Department against Religions and Religious Minorities\" (DARRM). He was sent to notorious security ward 209 of [[Evin prison]]. Afraid of his follower's support, the security officials were at loss to decide on jailing him. According to DARRM statement, Eliya M. was finally arrested by the decision of high-ranking religious officials. A council consist of highest-ranking religious and cleric powers of Iran decided that Eliya M. should be quietly arrested under charges of permuting the religion (Islam), proselytism, an invitation to spiritual pluralism, conspiracy against the Islamic government, renewal of religion by linking Islam, Christianity and Judaism; spiritual liberalism and incitement to the so \u0640 called American Islam and many other routine accusations that are used in these cases such as Offending sacred symbols of religion, a conspiracy by creating underground secret society and cult (Eliya \u0640 ism). But he had only one crime: he was against the Islam that calls for violence\u2026 Eliya was arrested for spiritual liberty, for a different interpretation of God's words which was against the cold stagnant understanding of religion.\".<ref>Extracted from [http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/40/36/ the first open letter of Elia's followers to leaders of the world]</ref>\n\nIn November 2007, Peyman Fattahi was released on a bail of 300 million Tomans (almost 300,000 USD) after spending six months in prison, suffering from recurrent bleeding from nose and ears, bloody vomiting and bloody urination.<ref>[[U.S Department of State]] annual report on Iran Human Rights.

[[U.S. Department of State]] and [[Amnesty International]] have mentioned in their annual reports about human rights abuses and violations against Elyasin Community and its leadership (Peyman Fattahi) by the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nSome of the most important events during Fattahi's re-arrest can be cited as:\n# Publishing a testimonial film about one of Fattahi's students who had been detained on the first round (2007) in which he was claiming the interrogators had forced him to act against Fattahi and lodge a complaint against him.

Although there is no press released report available on this matter.\n\n===Third Detention===\nOn 24 July 2011, a report was published about Fatahi's third detention along with a number of his students and members of Association of Thinkers and Researchers.<ref>To original script of the news could be retrieved from this [http://prothinka.org/News/3381/ link]</ref>\n\nA few days later, the official spokesperson of Elyasin Community who resides in UK<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/people/Paris-Keynejad/1108926967 Paris Keynezhad]</ref> verified this news by publishing an announcement but she mentioned they have all been released shortly after detention and none of the Elyasin members are under arrest.

To read the letter you can click [http://prothinka-src.org/Persian/Show_News.php?msg=596 here].\n\n==Elyasin (Ale-Yasin) Community==\nAfter Fattahi's first detention in June 2007, the institutions and non-governmental organizations that were directly or indirectly supervised and directed by him, integrated and announced the formation of a unique organization named El-Yasin (Ale-Yasin) community.\nThis community was working without being dependent on any political party of the group and their activities were mainly focused on research and studying of cultural- spiritual matters, but its members were prosecuted and their activities were harshly suppressed by the security service of Iran. Elyasin consists of a number of NGO's and publishing houses, most of which have been banned and shut time from the time of Ahmadinejad's presidency. There are some magazines affiliated to Elyasin such as ''Art of Living'', ''Esoteric Knowledge'', ''Motivators'', [[Science of Success (magazine)|''Science of Success'']], ''The Art of Transcendental Life'', and ''Sublime Thinking''. \nAvamer-e-Yasin, Science f Success, [http://www.prothinka.com Association of Thinkers and Researchers], Nature Front Association, Yasin Society of Writers and Researchers (Payam), and [http://ayahra.org/en Elyasin Human Rights and International Affairs] are some of Elyasin treaty bodies to be noted.\nIt's worth mentioning that Fattahi's followers are generally known as 'Elahioun' who can be recognized in different sub-categories such as \"Mansouroun (Elias' Offsprings)\", Iliya Supporters, The protectors of Elia M., Ghadr and Payam 1,2,3 groups, and Sina group (Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques trainees and apprentices).\nFattahi's devotees are running a number of active blogs and websites at the moment.\n\n==Written Works and confiscated books==\n'''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Jaryane-_Hedayate-Elahi_edition-2.pdf The Flow of Divine Guidance]''' is the only published book which is a transcription of Fattahi's public speeches at the age of 23. This book has been compiled by one of his close disciples and primarily published in 1998. However, this book was banned after the first publishing. His followers claim thousands of copies of it have been printed and distributed by Fattahi's devotees inside and outside of Iran. \nThere are more than 30 books have been confiscated by Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran) including:<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/ILIYA-CV-en.pdf Victims of ruthlessness]</ref>\n\n# The \"Teachings of Truth\" canon which contains some of his speeches and lectures.\n# \"Esoteric schools and the mysterious meanings in manuscripts\"\n# \"Sublime thinking and methods of creative thinking\" (consist of thirty six methods of thinking)\n# \"Thinking Formulas and Mental Software\"(consist of more than seven hundred thinking formulas to do different works)\n# \"The Art of Sublime Struggle\"\n# [[Hezbollah]] Doctrine (The Army of God Doctrine) (on inviting Hezbollah to use flexible methods and software thinking and to avoid violence and increase tendency to love)\n# \"Universal Theories and Modern Spirituality\"\n# \"Fundamental Life patterns\"\n# \"True Intuitions and False interpretations\"\n# \"The Art of Dreaming in Elahism (creative dreaming and dream making)\"\n# \"Esoteric judgment and true justice\"\n# \"Harmonious and Disharmonic Marriage\"\n# \"Saviors of the World and Motivators\"\n# \"Fundamental Insights and Enlivening Thoughts\"\n# \"The Ancient Science of Semiotics\"(understanding the signs of the world around us)\n# \"Teaching revolutionary counseling\"\n# \"Inward Interpretations of outward verses or signs\"\n# \"Creative Look; constructive thoughts and inventive words\"\n# \"The Meanings of Nature Sounds and Birds Songs\"\n# \"The Future of the World, Civilizations and Religions\"\n# \"The Knowledge of Names and Luminous Keys\"\n# \"The Methods of Predicting future\"\n# \"Cults and Anti Cults\" (on what cults are and analyzing and controlling them)\n# \"The Correspondence\"(letters, questions, messages and recommendations to the leaders of the world, scientists and scholars)\n\n==Doctrines and Fundamental Theories==\nAccording to Fattahi's old allies a large number of [[doctrine]]s and fundamental theories have been proposed by him since 20 years ago.<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Ammin, vol.1], page 452-454,</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been usually suggested during public speeches and meetings as well as personal conversations and discussions on the daily routine. Then, they have been further analyzed by students who have been responsible for collecting them. Although most of these theories are esoteric-based and esoteric-oriented, they do concern all aspects of life and sometimes are linked to the details of daily life.\nThe doctrines of Sublime Struggle, Reconciliation of Civilizations, Creative Look, Harmonious Marriage, as well as the doctrine of coordination, doctrine Suprapolar Human Being (bipolar man), the doctrine of 360-degree view are some of which could be mentioned in this regard. Also, the theories of Intuitive References, Creative Review and the doctrine of Voluntary and Recurrent Death could be noted.<ref>same</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been collected and further discussed by a number of his students in a multi-volume set of books entitled ''360 Doctrines and Comprehensive Theories''.

During the event he reveals his special relationship to Koharu: Her father asked him to name her, something he is still particularly proud of as every other endeavor in his life failed miserably.\n\nAfter the event the family is forced to apologize formally to the groom's family and the oldest brother of Ginko and Tetsuro severs all ties with his younger brother. After staying with Ginko for a short time, she lends him money to go back to [[Osaka]] where he came from in the first place.\n\nHer uncle's behavior casts a shadow over Koharu's marriage and soon she has got to move in with her mother again. Even Ginko's patience with her brother comes to an end when she is forced to reimburse a lover of his who had entrusted him with her savings which he has gambled away. Now even Ginko severs her ties with Tetsuro and does not want to hear from him anymore: When he visits her next time, Ginko and Koharu throw him out.\n\nSome time passes while Koharu struggles with her ultimate divorce and tries to get her life back together and starts a new relationship with a shy carpenter from the neighborhood.\n\nFinally Ginko- who has secretly filled a missing person report- gets the news that Tetsuro has been hospitalized in Osaka. Despite his misbehavior, she is deeply worried and visits him in Osaka, learning that he is terminally ill with [[lung cancer]] and living in a [[hospice]]. Despite his illness, Tetsuro has neither lost his sense of humor, nor his childish character and Ginko is moved to see him being merry among the other patients and the staff of the hospice who have learned to enjoy his character.\n\nTetsuro predicts his own day of death, telling Ginko that the [[Buddha]] told him in a dream.\n\nWhen the day draws closer, Ginko gets the news that Tetsuro's health is deteriorating. She hurries to Osaka and finds him being as cheerful as ever, even tricking her into giving him a drink through his feeding tube. When his death gets closer, Koharu arrives as well and finally forgives her uncle on his deathbed.\n\nSome time later, Koharu makes preparations for her upcoming wedding with the shy carpenter. Around the dinner table Ginko's [[Dementia|senile]] mother-in-law suggests inviting Tetsuro and Koharu and Ginko agree, moved to tears by their memories.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sayuri Yoshinaga]] - Ginko\n*[[:ja:\u7b11\u798f\u4ead\u9db4\u74f6|Tsurube Shofukutei]] - Tetsuro\n*[[Y\u016b Aoi]] - Koharu\n*[[Ry\u014d Kase]] - Akira\n*[[Haruko Kato]]\n*[[Takashi Sasano]]\n\n==Production==\nThis movie is dedicated to the memory of director [[Kon Ichikawa]] who had made a film with the same name, [[Her Brother|Ot\u014dto]] in 1960, which won a Special Distinction Award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1961.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3265/year/1961.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Her Brother |accessdate=2010-09-08|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Film festivals==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
