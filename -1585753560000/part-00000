Since 2007 it has been a part of [[Lolland Municipality]]. R\u00f8dbyhavn (\"R\u00f8dby Harbour\") is located approximately 5&nbsp;km southwest of the town of [[R\u00f8dby]]. It is a harbour on the northern shore of the [[Fehmarn Belt]]. A ferry service connects R\u00f8dbyhavn with [[Puttgarden]] on the island of [[Fehmarn]]. Thus one can drive or take the train from Copenhagen over the Fehmarn Belt, and on to L\u00fcbeck and Hamburg by [[European route E47]], which in Germany is known as [[Bundesautobahn 1|autobahn A1]] or [[Vogelfluglinie]].\n\nThe original [[Lalandia]] holiday resort is located just west of R\u00f8dbyhavn on the shore of Fehmarn Belt.\n\nThe town of R\u00f8dbyhavn has a population of 1,624 (1 January 2019).<ref>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil work began on constructing a harbour in 1908, this part of the dyke featured only a few small farmsteads. The dyke had been constructed in 1872 following storm floods, and on its outer side, at Syltholm, a harbour for fishing and commerce was opened in 1912. With the emergence of a new settlement to support the activities of the harbour, the name of Syltholm was changed to \"R\u00f8dbyhavn\". 1916 saw the construction of a first shipyard, but by the 1920s, the shipbuilding business at R\u00f8dbyhavn ran into bankruptcy, and activity in the harbour stagnated.
