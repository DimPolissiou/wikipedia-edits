While scientists at the time considered that the skeletons could belong to [[ape]]s, [[canid]]s, [[felid]]s, or even [[dragon]]s or [[unicorn]]s, Esper postulated that they actually belonged to [[polar bear]]s. Twenty years later, [[Johann Christian Rosenm\u00fcller]], an anatomist at the [[Leipzig University]], gave the species its binomial name. The bones were so numerous that most researchers had little regard for them. During [[World War I]], with the scarcity of [[phosphate]] dung, earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates. When the \"dragon caves\" in Austria's [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] region were exploited for this purpose, only the skulls and leg bones were kept.<ref name=\"Brunner2007\">{{cite book|author=Bernd Brunner|title=Bears: A Brief History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1W98s7aVy8cC&pg=PA41|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12299-2|page=41}}</ref>\n\nMany caves in [[Central Europe]] have skeletons of cave bears inside, for example the ''Heinrichsh\u00f6hle'' in [[Hemer, Germany|Hemer]], the ''Dechenh\u00f6hle'' in [[Iserlohn]], [[Germany]].

The three anterior [[premolar]]s were gradually reduced, then disappeared, possibly in response to a largely vegetarian diet. In a fourth of the skulls found in the [[Conturines]], the third premolar is still present, while more [[Synapomorphy|derived]] specimens elsewhere lack it. The last remaining premolar became conjugated with the true [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], enlarging the crown and granting it more cusps and cutting borders.

No traces of cave bears have been found in [[Scotland]], [[Scandinavia]] or the [[Baltic countries]], which were all covered in extensive [[glacier]]s at the time. The largest numbers of cave bear remains have been found in [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], northern Italy, northern Spain, southern France, and Romania, roughly corresponding with the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathians. The huge number of bones found in southern, central and eastern Europe has led some scientists to think Europe may have once had literally herds of cave bears. Others, however, point out that, though some caves have thousands of bones, they were accumulated over a period of 100,000 years or more, thus requiring only two deaths in a cave per year to account for the large numbers.<ref name=\"bieder\"/>\n\nThe cave bear inhabited low mountainous areas, especially in regions rich in [[limestone]] caves.

It also uncovered a stone chest or [[cist]] consisting of a low wall built from limestone slabs near a cave wall with a number of bear skulls inside it. Also, a cave bear skull was found with a femur bone from another bear stuck inside it.

This specialized hibernation behavior would have caused a high winter mortality rate for cave bears that failed to find available caves. Therefore, as human populations slowly increased, the cave bear faced a shrinking pool of suitable caves, and slowly faded away to extinction, as both Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans sought out caves as living quarters, depriving the cave bear of vital habitat. This hypothesis is being researched at this time. According to the research study, published in the journal ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'', radiocarbon dating of the fossil remains shows that the cave bear ceased to be abundant in Central Europe around 35,000 years ago. \"This can be attributed to increasing human expansion and the resulting competition between humans and bears for land and shelter,\" explains the scientist, who links this with the scarce fossil representation of the bear's prey in the abundant fossil record of this species.<ref>{{cite web|title=True Causes for Extinction of Cave Bear Revealed: More Human Expansion Than Climate Change|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100824082230.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=Plataforma SINC|date=25 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the results of a large scale study of 81 bone specimens (resulting in 59 new sequences), and\u00a064 previously published complete mitochondrial genomes of cave bear mitochondrial DNA remains found in Switzerland, Poland, France, Spain, Germany, Italy and Serbia, indicated that the cave bear population drastically declined starting around 40,000 years ago at the onset of the [[Aurignacian]], coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49345392|title=Extinction: Humans played big role in demise of the cave bear|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=16 August 2019|website=BBC News|access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Gretzinger2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Gretzinger|first1= J.|last2= Molak|first2= M.|last3= Reiter|first3= E.|last4= Pfrengle|first4= S.|last5= Urban|first5= C.|last6= Neukamm|first6= J.|last7= Blant|first7= M.|last8= Conard|first8=N.

While scientists at the time considered that the skeletons could belong to [[ape]]s, [[canid]]s, [[felid]]s, or even [[dragon]]s or [[unicorn]]s, Esper postulated that they actually belonged to [[polar bear]]s. Twenty years later, [[Johann Christian Rosenm\u00fcller]], an anatomist at the [[Leipzig University]], gave the species its binomial name. The bones were so numerous that most researchers had little regard for them. During [[World War I]], with the scarcity of [[phosphate]] dung, earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates.

It was apparently used by Neanderthals for a ceremony; bear bones scattered on the floor further suggests this was likely to have had some sort of ritual purpose.<ref>{{cite book|title=Humankind emerging|year=1996 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York|pages=440\u2013441|edition=7th |isbn= 0-673-52364-0|author1=B.G.

The late paleontologist [[Bj\u00f6rn Kurt\u00e9n]] [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] cave bear populations were fragmented and under stress even before the advent of the glaciers.<ref name=\"bieder\"/> Populations living south of the [[Alps]] possibly survived significantly longer.<ref name=\"extinction\"/>\n\nSome evidence indicates that the cave bear used only caves for hibernation and was not inclined to use other locations, such as [[thicket]]s, for this purpose, in contrast to the more versatile [[brown bear]]. This specialized hibernation behavior would have caused a high winter mortality rate for cave bears that failed to find available caves. Therefore, as human populations slowly increased, the cave bear faced a shrinking pool of suitable caves, and slowly faded away to extinction, as both Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans sought out caves as living quarters, depriving the cave bear of vital habitat. This hypothesis is being researched at this time. According to the research study, published in the journal ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'', radiocarbon dating of the fossil remains shows that the cave bear ceased to be abundant in Central Europe around 35,000 years ago. \"This can be attributed to increasing human expansion and the resulting competition between humans and bears for land and shelter,\" explains the scientist, who links this with the scarce fossil representation of the bear's prey in the abundant fossil record of this species.<ref>{{cite web|title=True Causes for Extinction of Cave Bear Revealed: More Human Expansion Than Climate Change|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100824082230.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=Plataforma SINC|date=25 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the results of a large scale study of 81 bone specimens (resulting in 59 new sequences), and\u00a064 previously published complete mitochondrial genomes of cave bear mitochondrial DNA remains found in Switzerland, Poland, France, Spain, Germany, Italy and Serbia, indicated that the cave bear population drastically declined starting around 40,000 years ago at the onset of the [[Aurignacian]], coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49345392|title=Extinction: Humans played big role in demise of the cave bear|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=16 August 2019|website=BBC News|access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Gretzinger2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Gretzinger|first1= J.|last2= Molak|first2= M.|last3= Reiter|first3= E.|last4= Pfrengle|first4= S.|last5= Urban|first5= C.|last6= Neukamm|first6= J.|last7= Blant|first7= M.|last8= Conard|first8=N.

The first series, broadcast from 28 May to 20 September 1951, was titled '''''Crazy People'''''; subsequent series had the title ''The Goon Show''.\n\nThe show's chief creator and main writer was [[Spike Milligan]]. The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with [[surreal humour]], puns, catchphrases and an array of [[#Music and sound effects|bizarre sound effects]]. Some of the later episodes feature electronic effects devised by the fledgling [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], many of which were reused by other shows for decades. Many elements of the show satirised contemporary life in Britain, parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, the military, education, class structure, literature and film.\n\nAmong the writers contributing to the series were [[Larry Stephens]], [[Jimmy Grafton]], [[Eric Sykes]], and [[Maurice Wiltshire]].\n\nThe show was released internationally through the [[BBC Transcription Services]] (TS).<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\">{{cite book | last = Wilmut | first = Roger |author2=Jimmy Grafton | title = The Goon Show Companion - A History and Goonography | year = 1976 | publisher = Robson Books | location = London | isbn = 0-903895-64-1 }}</ref>{{rp|54}} It was heard regularly from the 1950s in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Canada, although these TS versions were frequently edited to avoid controversial subjects.<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\"/>{{rp|54}}  In the United States, [[NBC]] began broadcasting the programme on its radio network from the mid-1950s.<ref name=\"NBC\">{{cite web|publisher=[[The Firesign Theatre|Firesign Theatre]] |url=http://www.firezine.net/issue4/fz4_13.htm |title=Under the Influence of the Goons |work=FIREZINE #4 |date=Winter 1997\u20131998  |accessdate=14 October 2006}}</ref> \n\n[[Subversive]] and absurdist, ''The Goon Show'' exercised a considerable influence on the development of British and American comedy and popular culture.

He pressed the BBC for a long term contract for the gang, knowing that it would secure Sellers for more than just seasonal work, something for which the BBC had been aiming. The BBC acquiesced and ordered an initial series, though without much enthusiasm.<ref name=Spike&Co/>\n\nThe series had its premiere in May 1951 and audience figures grew rapidly, from around 370,000 to nearly two million by the end of the 17th show.<ref name=Spike&Co/> No recordings of any episode of this series are known to have survived. The BBC commissioned a second series and a number of other changes occurred. The musical interludes were shortened, and [[Max Geldray]] joined the lineup. [[Peter Eton]], from the BBC's drama department, replaced [[Dennis Main Wilson]] as producer. Eton brought stricter discipline to the show's production. He was also an expert at sound effects and microphone technique, ensuring that the show became a far more dynamic listening experience. However, a few episodes into the series Milligan suffered a major [[nervous breakdown]]. He was hospitalised in early December 1952,<ref>Carpenter, 2003, pp.136-139</ref> just before the broadcast of episode five, but it, and the following episode, had already been written, and the next 12 episodes were co-written by Stephens and Grafton. Milligan was absent as a performer for about two months, returning for episode 17, broadcast in early March 1953. As with Series 2, all episodes were co-written by Milligan and Stephens and edited by Jimmy Grafton.\n\nBentine left the show at the end of series 2, citing a desire to pursue solo projects, although there had been an increasing degree of creative tension between him and Milligan.<ref>There are three or four versions of this story regarding the split. Jimmy Grafton's account is in ''The Goon Show Companion'' p.39; Secombe's account is in ''Arias and Raspberries'' p.208; Milligan's account changed over the years and the bitterness shows in the interview ''Now That's Funny'' p.16; and Bentine's account is in ''The Story of the Goons'' p.30 and also in his autobiography \"The Reluctant Jester\" (1992), p.321 of the paperback edition.</ref>\n\nMilligan blamed his breakdown and the collapse of his first marriage on the sheer volume of writing the show required.<ref name=\"MoreGoonShowScripts\">{{cite book | last = Milligan | first = Spike | title = More Goon Show Scripts. | year = 1974 | publisher = Sphere | location = London | isbn = 0-7221-6077-1}} (a)p.13</ref> His then ground-breaking use of sound effects also contributed to the pressure.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"p217\">{{harvnb|Lewis|1995|page=217}} \"owing to the complexities of the technical side, the BBC were wanting the scripts delivered earlier and earlier - so that the boffins in the electronics department etc. could experiment with the new noises\"</ref><ref name=\"Life&DeathofSellers\" >{{cite book\n| last = Lewis\n| first = Roger\n| title = The Life and Death of Peter Sellers.\n| year = 1995\n| publisher = Arrow Books\n| location = London\n| isbn = 0-09-974700-6}} (e)pp.205-206</ref> All this exacerbated his mental instability that included [[bipolar disorder]], especially during the third series.<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_/ai_n9623932\n |title=Goon with the wind \n |author=Andrew Billen \n |newspaper=Sunday Herald \n |date=2 Jan 2000 \n |accessdate=12 December 2008 \n}}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \"Writing the third season of The Goon Show in 1952, he suffered a relapse.

The first series had 17 episodes plus one special, ''Cinderella'' (1951); the second series had 25 episodes, (1952); the third series had 25 episodes plus one special - ''The Coronation Special'' (1952\u201353); the fourth series had 30 episodes plus one special, ''Archie In Goonland'' (1953\u201354); the fifth series had 26 episodes plus one special - ''The Starlings'' (1954\u201355); the sixth series had 27 episodes plus three specials, (1955\u201356); the seventh series had 25 episodes plus two specials, (1956\u201357); the eighth series had 26 episodes, (1957\u201358); the ''Vintage Goons'' were re-performances of 14 episodes from series four; the ninth series had 17 episodes, (1958\u201359); and the tenth series had six episodes, (1959\u20131960).<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\"/>{{rp|101}}<ref name=\"Spike&Co\"/>\n\n==Format==\nThroughout its history, each episode of ''The Goon Show, ''which usually ran just under 30 minutes, was essentially structured as a comedy-variety programme, consisting of scripted comedy segments alternating with musical interludes.<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\"/>{{rp|116ff}}\n\nThe first two series were mostly produced by [[Dennis Main Wilson]]; none of the episodes was given an individual title<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoonshow.net/shows_list_all.asp |title=The Goon Show Site - All Episodes Listed by Series |publisher=Thegoonshow.net |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref> and these early shows were loosely structured and consisted of four or five unconnected sketches, separated by musical items. According to later producer [[Peter Eton]], the musical segments took up around half the programme.<ref>Carpenter, 2003, p.113</ref> In this formative phase the show co-starred Milligan (who played only minor roles in the early shows), Sellers, Secombe and [[Michael Bentine]] as the nominal 'hero' of each episode, madcap inventor Dr Osric Pureheart.<ref>Humphrey Carpenter, ''Spike Milligan, The Biography'' (Hodder & Stoughton, London, 2003), p.124</ref> Musical performances were by virtuoso jazz harmonica player [[Max Geldray]], singer [[Ray Ellington]] and his quartet (both of whom were recruited by Dixon) and vocal group the Stargazers, but they left after Episode 6 of Series 2, and for the remaining episodes Secombe filled in, singing a straight vocal number.<ref>Carpenter, 2003, p.124</ref> Incidental, theme and backing music was provided by [[Stanley Black]] and the BBC Dance Orchestra.<ref name=\"Carpenter, 2003, p.127\">Carpenter, 2003, p.127</ref> Series 2 also saw the first appearances of popular characters Minnie Bannister (Milligan) and Henry Crun (Sellers).\n\nFrom Series 3, ''The Goon Show'' (as it was now officially titled) gradually settled into its 'classic' format. Milligan, Stephens and Grafton began to work within a narrative structure and by the second half of Series 4 each episode typically consisted of three acts linked by a continuing plot,<ref>Carpenter, 2003, p.143</ref> with Geldray performing between Acts I and II and Ellington between Acts II and III. Almost all the principal and occasional characters were now performed by Milligan and Sellers, with Secombe usually playing only Neddie Seagoon, who had replaced Pureheart as the hero of most of the stories. The closing theme, backing for Geldray and incidental music was now provided by a big band of freelance musicians under the direction of [[Wally Stott]], who had been writing for the show since the first series.<ref name=\"Carpenter, 2003, p.127\"/> After the end of Series 3, original announcer [[Andrew Timothy]] was replaced (at the suggestion of [[John Snagge]]) by [[Wallace Greenslade]],<ref name=\"Carpenter, 2003, p.127\"/> who provided spoken narrative links as well as occasionally performing small roles in the scripts.\n\nFrom Series 3 onwards, the principal character roles were:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoonshow.net/characters.asp|title=The Goon Show Site - Goons Characters|website=Thegoonshow.net}}</ref>\n*Neddie Seagoon (Secombe)\n*Eccles (Milligan)\n*Bluebottle (Sellers)\n*Henry Crun (Sellers)\n*Minnie Bannister (Milligan)\n*Hercules Grytpype-Thynne (Sellers)\n*Count Jim Moriarty (Milligan)\n*Major Denis Bloodnok (Sellers)\n\nSecondary characters were the \"Indians\", Banerjee and Lalkaka, the servant Abdul/Singez Thingz, Willium \"Mate\" Cobblers, Cyril, Jim Spriggs, Little Jim, Flowerdew and Chief Ellinga/The Red Bladder - both played by Ray Ellington.<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\"/>{{rp|107}} There were also occasional guest stars including senior BBC announcer [[John Snagge]], and actors [[Valentine Dyall]], [[Dick Emery]], [[Kenneth Connor]], [[Dennis Price]] and [[Bernard Miles]].

Stott produced many arrangements and link passages, further improved by the first-class sound quality the BBC engineers managed to achieve.<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\"/>{{rp|81}} Members of the band featured prominently in the comedy proceedings, particularly jazz trombonist  [[George Chisholm (musician)|George Chisholm]] who frequently played Scots characters. The show's concluding music was usually either \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\" or a truncated and ironic rendition of the ''[[Alte Kameraden]]'' (Old Comrades') march, followed by Max Geldray and the Ray Ellington Quartet playing \"[[Crazy Rhythm]]\" as play-out music.\n\nIn keeping with the [[Variety show|variety]] requirements of the BBC's \"light entertainment\" format, ''The Goon Show'' scripts were structured in three acts, separated by two musical interludes. These were provided by the [[Ray Ellington]] Quartet&nbsp;\u2013 who performed a mixture of [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]] and [[Calypso music|calypso]] songs&nbsp;\u2013 and by harmonica virtuoso [[Max Geldray]] who performed mostly middle of the road numbers and jazz standards of the 30s and 40s accompanied by the big band. Both Ellington and Geldray also made occasional cameo appearances; Ellington was often drafted in to play stereotypical \"black\" roles such as a tribal chieftain, native bearer or Major Bloodnok's nemesis (and counterpoint to Bloodnok's affliction) \"The Red Bladder\".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIt was in its use of pre-recorded and live sound effects that ''The Goon Show'' broke the most new ground.<ref name=Spike&Co/><ref name=\"Life&DeathofSellers\"/>  Part of the problem was that \"not even Milligan knew how to capture electronically the peculiar sounds that came alive in his head&nbsp;\u2013 he just knew when it had not yet happened\".<ref name=\"Spike&amp;Co205\">McCann (2006) p.205</ref> An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a squelching effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard&nbsp;\u2013 which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled \"Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone.\" One after the other, he swung them around his head against the wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking (\"So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!\").<ref name=\"Spike&amp;Co205\"/><ref name=\"Ventham19\">Harry Secombe, in Ventham (2002) p.19. The socks-filled-with-custard story has been frequently cited since at least the 1970s, when it was reiterated in newspaper articles</ref> Secombe noted that \"Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each&nbsp;\u2013 chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys braying, massive explosions, ships' sirens&nbsp;\u2013 all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects.\"<ref name=\"Ventham19\"/> An FX instruction in one script read \"Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can't get two lions, two hippos will do\".  Over time, the sound engineers became increasingly adept at translating the script into desired sounds, assisted  from the late 1950s onwards by specialists in the BBC's newly formed Radiophonic Workshop.<ref name=\"Spike&amp;Co205\"/>\n\nMilligan's relationship with BBC managers preparing for the recording of episodes was often acrimonious and resulted in rows, and Milligan later agreed that he was a diva during this time, adding \"I was trying to shake the BBC out of its apathy. Sound effects were a knock on the door and tramps on gravel\u2013 that was it, and I tried to transform it.\".<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\"/>{{rp|44}}\n\nMany of the sound effects created for later programmes featured innovative production techniques borrowed from the realm of ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'', and using the then new technology of magnetic tape. Many of these sequences involved the use of complex multiple edits, echo and reverberation and the deliberate slowing down, speeding up or reversing of tapes. One of the most famous was the legendary \"Bloodnok's Stomach\" sound effect, created by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] to represent the sound of Major Bloodnok's digestive system in action, which included a variety of inexplicable gurgling and explosive noises. Lewis (1995, p.&nbsp;218) states Bloodnok's stomach \"was achieved by overlaying burps, whoops from oscillators, water splashes, cork-like pops, and light artillery blasts\".<ref name=\"Life&DeathofSellers\"/>\n\n==Cast members and characters==\n{{main|List of The Goon Show cast members and characters}}\n\n*'''[[Harry Secombe]]'s characters'''\n:{{hlist| Major: [[Neddie Seagoon]] }}\n:{{hlist| Minor: [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Uncle Oscar|Uncle Oscar]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Private Bogg|Private Bogg]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Nugent Dirt|Nugent Dirt]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Izzy|Izzy]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Welshmen|Welshmen]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Yorkshiremen|Yorkshiremen]] }}\n*'''[[Spike Milligan]]'s characters'''\n:{{hlist| Major:  [[Eccles (character)|Eccles]] | [[Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister|Minnie Bannister]] | [[Count Jim Moriarty]] }}\n:{{hlist| Minor: [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Throat|Throat]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Little Jim|Little Jim]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Spriggs|Spriggs]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Yakamoto|Yakamoto]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Cor blimey|Cor blimey]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Thingz|Singes Thingz]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Hugh Jampton|Hugh Jampton]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Fu Manchu|Fu Manchu]] | [[Mr Banerjee]] }}\n*'''[[Peter Sellers]]' characters'''\n:{{hlist| Major: [[Major Bloodnok]] | [[Hercules Grytpype-Thynne]] |  [[Bluebottle (character)|Bluebottle]] | [[Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister|Henry Crun]] }}\n:{{hlist| Minor: [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Cynthia|Cynthia]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Willium \"Mate\" Cobblers|Willium \"Mate\" Cobblers]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Mr Lalkaka|Mr Lalkaka]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Eidelberger|Eidelberger]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Flowerdew|Flowerdew]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Cyril|Cyril]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Fred Nurke|Fred Nurke]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Gladys|Gladys]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Lew/Ernie Cash|Lew/Ernie Cash]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Churchill|Churchill]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Hearn|Hearn]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#And more...|and more...]] }}\n*'''[[Michael Bentine]]'s characters'''\n:[[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Michael Bentine|Prof. Osric Pureheart and more]]\n*[[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Other members|Other cast members]]\n*[[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Guest appearances|Guest cast members]]\n\n==Episodes and archiving==\n{{main|Goon Show episodes and archiving}}\n\n==Running jokes==\n{{main|The Goon Show running jokes}}\n\n===Lurgi===\n{{anchor|Lurgy}}\n:''[[Lurgy (river)]] is a small river near [[Kilmacrennan]] in Donegal in Ireland.''\nSeveral of the words and phrases invented for the show soon entered common usage, the most famous being the word [[wikt:lurgy|lurgi]]. In the episode \"Lurgi Strikes Britain\", Spike Milligan introduced the fictional malady of Lurgi (sometimes spelled Lurgy), which has survived into modern usage to mean the common cold, or any miscellaneous or non-specific illness (often preceded by the adjective \"dreaded\"). The symptoms of Lurgi included the uncontrollable urge to cry \"Eeeeyack-a-boo\", though even during the episode the ailment proved to be an extortionate attempt to sell [[brass band]] musical instruments. Milligan was later to make up his own definition in ''[[Treasure Island According to Spike Milligan]]'', where Jim Hawkins' mother describes it as \"like brown spots of shit on the liver\".<!-- Please put non goon related lurgi references under the Wikipedia entry for lurgy -->\n\n===Brandyyy!===\nAlcohol was strictly forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk in turn was fortified with brandy. In later episodes the catchphrase \"round the back for the old brandy!\" or \"the old Marlon Brando\" was used to announce the exit of one or more characters, or a break for music. In \"The Pam's Paper Insurance Policy\" (Series 9, Episode 4), Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, \"I wonder where he keeps that stuff!\". In \"The Scarlet Capsule\" (Series 9, Episode 14), Ellington's reply to Secombe's cry of \"Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there\" was \"The introductions he gives me...\".  In \"The Moon Show\" (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating \"Man, the excuses he makes to get to that brandy!\", causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail \"MATE!\" in protest. However, Milligan got his own back by making Ellington laugh halfway through the song by doing Minnie Bannister voices while Ellington was singing.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilmut | first = Roger |author2=Jimmy Grafton | title = The Goon Show Companion - A History and Goonography | year = 1976 | publisher = Robson Books | location = London | isbn = 0-903895-64-1 | page = 62 | chapter = Produced by Pat Dixon | quote = Possibly the cast's brandy-and-milk in the back room had a little to do with it (those cries of \"round the back for the old brandy\" before the musical items are not there just for effect!).}}</ref>\n\n===Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb!===\nDuring radio programmes of the 1920s and 1930s, the background noise for crowd scenes was often achieved by a moderately large group of people mumbling \"[[Rhubarb (sound effect)|rhubarb]]\" under their breath with random inflections. This was often parodied by Milligan, who would try to get the same effect with only three or four people, clearly intoning the word rather than mumbling. After some time, Secombe began throwing in \"custard\" during these scenes (for example, in \"The Fear of Wages<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goonshowscripts.afraid.org/raw/series06/s06e25.html|title=The Fear of Wages|website=Goonshowscripts.afraid.org|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310163150/http://goonshowscripts.afraid.org/raw/series06/s06e25.html|archive-date=10 March 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Wings Over Dagenham\", where the phrase was amended to 'flying rhubarb').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goonshowscripts.afraid.org/raw/series07/s07e15a.html|title=Wings Over Dagenham|website=Goonshowscripts.afraid.org|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310144700/http://goonshowscripts.afraid.org/raw/series07/s07e15a.html|archive-date=10 March 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Raspberry blowing===\nAs well as being used as a comic device randomly inserted into different sketches to avoid silence, the [[Blowing a raspberry|blowing of raspberries]] entered the Goons as Harry Secombe's signal to the other actors that he was going to crack up; you would hear a joke from him, a raspberry, and a stream of laughter.  In the Goons' musical recording \"The Ying-Tong Song\", Milligan performed a solo for raspberry-blower, as one might for tuba or baritone saxophone.  Milligan made much use of a rather surreal Columbia 78RPM sound effects disc, catalogue number YB20, which bears the innocuous title \"Donkey\" on the label. Approximating possibly the most obscene and flatulent noise ever recorded, it appeared first in the show \"The Sinking of Westminster Pier\" as a sound to accompany an oyster opening its shell; it thereafter became known as Fred the Oyster, and appears as such in the scripts.  This recording was often used as a reaction to a bad joke. Examples include ''[[The Last Goon Show of All]]'' during which Neddie shouts old jokes into a fuel tank in order to \"start the show\".\n\nYears later, Milligan collaborated with [[Ronnie Barker]] on ''[[The Phantom Raspberry Blower|The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town]]'' in which the credits read, \"Raspberries professionally blown by Spike Milligan\".  [[David Jason]] has also claimed to have produced the sound effect and indeed was credited with this in the second segment of Ronnie Barker's [[LWT]] series ''[[Six Dates with Barker]]'' (1971).<ref>{{IMDb episode |0502939 |Six Dates with Barker - 1899: The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town\" (15 Jan. 1971)}}</ref>\n\n===\"Trapped in a piano\"===\nIn several shows, one character, typically either Henry Crun or Minnie Bannister, would be found trapped in a piano.  In ''The Mystery of the Fake Neddie Seagoon'', Crun was inside a piano and his speech was accompanied by suitable piano noises.  In ''The Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI'', Moriarty is hiding in a piano disguised as one of the strings.  Gritpype-Thynne plays a \"do-re-mi\" scale to find him - Moriarty is \"me\".\n\nThe \"in a piano\" joke was re-used one last time in ''[[The Last Goon Show of All]]''.\n\n===Other references===\nSometimes characters were introduced as \"scion of the house of Rowton\", or \"member of Rowton House\".  This was a reference to the \"[[Rowton Houses]]\", which were hostels for working men in London.\n\n==Films==\nThe following films were a product of Goon activity:\n*''[[Let's Go Crazy (film)|Let's Go Crazy]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Penny Points to Paradise]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Down Among the Z Men]]'' (1952) (with Bentine)\n*''[[The Case of the Mukkinese Battle Horn]]'' (1956)  A two-reeler starring Milligan, Sellers and [[Dick Emery]]\n*''[[The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film]]'' (1959)  A surreal one-reeler short subject starring Milligan and Sellers and directed by [[Richard Lester|Dick Lester]]\n\n== Later revivals ==\n===Books===\nSpike Milligan teamed up with illustrator Pete Clarke to produce two books of comic strip Goons.

Made for [[Associated-Rediffusion]] during 1956 and only broadcast in the London area, it was mainly written by Milligan, with contributions from other writers in the [[Associated London Scripts]] cooperative including  [[Dave Freeman (British writer)|Dave Freeman]] and [[Terry Nation]], with Eric Sykes as script editor. ''[[The Idiot Weekly]]'' (1958\u20131962) was an Australian radio comedy series written by and starring Milligan with an Australian supporting cast including [[Ray Barrett]] and [[John Bluthal]]. It was made for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] during Milligan's numerous visits to Australia, where his family had emigrated. Milligan adapted some ''Goon Show'' scripts and included his ''Goon Show'' characters (notably Eccles) in many episodes. Six episodes of ''[[The Idiot Weekly]]'' were remade by the BBC as ''[[The Omar Khayyam Show]]'' in 1963.\n\n*'''''The Telegoons'' (1963\u20131964)'''\n''[[The Telegoons]]'' (1963\u20131964) was a 15-minute BBC puppet show featuring the voices of Milligan, Secombe and Sellers and adapted from the radio scripts. 26 episodes were made.

The last time all three Goons worked together was in 1978 when they recorded two new songs, \"The Raspberry Song\" and \"Rhymes\".\n\n*'''''Bridge on the River Wye'' (Parlophone 1962)'''\nA 1962 comedy LP with Milligan and Sellers as well as [[Peter Cook]] and [[Jonathan Miller]]. A spoof of the film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', it was originally recorded under that name. However, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Thus some clever editing of the recording by future Beatles producer [[George Martin]] removed the ''K'' every time the word ''Kwai'' was uttered, creating ''[[Bridge on the River Wye]]''. The LP is based on ''The Goon Show''{{'}}s ''African Incident'' (30 December 1957),<ref name=Spike&Co/> which featured Sellers' vocal impersonation of [[Alec Guinness]].

It was not exactly a Goons reunion because Sellers was in Hollywood and had to record his lines separately.

In this period, two radio comedy shows exercised a profound influence. The first was ''[[Take It From Here]]'', with its polished professionalism. The other was ''The Goon Show'', with its absurdity, manic surreality and unpredictability.\"<ref name=\"Perry\">{{cite book | last = Perry | first = George | title = The Life of Python | year = 1999 | publisher = Pavilion Books | location = London | isbn = 1-85793-441-5 | pages = 14\u201317}}</ref>\n\nOn the influence of The Goons, Eric Sykes wrote that in the post-World War II years, \"other shows came along but 'The House of Comedy' needed electricity. Then, out of the blue&nbsp;... ''The Goons''&nbsp;...Spike Milligan simply blew the roof off, and lit the whole place with sunshine. At a cursory glance, ''The Goon Show'' was merely quick-fire delivery of extremely funny lines mouthed by eccentric characters, but this was only the froth.

Other ALS-related comedies such as ''[[Sykes and A...]]'', ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'', ''[[Beyond Our Ken]]'', and ''[[Round The Horne]]'' influenced their own genres of comedy.<ref name=Spike&Co/>\n\n[[Eddie Izzard]] notes that the Goons and Milligan in particular \"influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as 'alternative'.\"<ref name=\" TheEssentialSpikeMilliganvii\"/>  In Ventham's (2002, p.&nbsp;151) compilation, [[John Cleese]] notes that \"In comedy, there are a very small number of defining moments when somebody comes along and genuinely creates a breakthrough, takes us into territory where nobody has been before.

On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book ''The Goon Show Scripts'' for ''[[The New York Times]]''. He wrote: \"I was 12 when ''The Goon Show'' first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof that the world was insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called ''The Daily Howl''. I would write it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud to my friends. Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to ''The Goon Show''.\" Lennon also noted that [[George Martin]], the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.<ref name=\"Lennon\">[http://www.telegoons.org/famous_fans.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218185620/http://www.telegoons.org/famous_fans.htm |date=18 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn a discussion of an accidentally Goonish nature, about introducing the next song during the 1963 BBC production of ''Pop Go The Beatles'', Lennon is also recorded as quipping \"Love these Goon shows\".

The first series, broadcast from 28 May to 20 September 1951, was titled '''''Crazy People'''''; subsequent series had the title ''The Goon Show''.\n\nThe show's chief creator and main writer was [[Spike Milligan]]. The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with [[surreal humour]], puns, catchphrases and an array of [[#Music and sound effects|bizarre sound effects]]. Some of the later episodes feature electronic effects devised by the fledgling [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], many of which were reused by other shows for decades. Many elements of the show satirised contemporary life in Britain, parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, the military, education, class structure, literature and film.\n\nThe show was released internationally through the [[BBC Transcription Services]] (TS).<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\">{{cite book | last = Wilmut | first = Roger |author2=Jimmy Grafton | title = The Goon Show Companion - A History and Goonography | year = 1976 | publisher = Robson Books | location = London | isbn = 0-903895-64-1 }}</ref>{{rp|54}} It was heard regularly from the 1950s in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Canada, although these TS versions were frequently edited to avoid controversial subjects.<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\"/>{{rp|54}}  In the United States, [[NBC]] began broadcasting the programme on its radio network from the mid-1950s.<ref name=\"NBC\">{{cite web|publisher=[[The Firesign Theatre|Firesign Theatre]] |url=http://www.firezine.net/issue4/fz4_13.htm |title=Under the Influence of the Goons |work=FIREZINE #4 |date=Winter 1997\u20131998  |accessdate=14 October 2006}}</ref> \n\n[[Subversive]] and absurdist, ''The Goon Show'' exercised a considerable influence on the development of British and American comedy and popular culture.

The BBC commissioned a second series and a number of other changes occurred. The musical interludes were shortened, and [[Max Geldray]] joined the lineup. [[Peter Eton]], from the BBC's drama department, replaced [[Dennis Main Wilson]] as producer. Eton brought stricter discipline to the show's production. He was also an expert at sound effects and microphone technique, ensuring that the show became a far more dynamic listening experience. However, a few episodes into the series Milligan suffered a major [[nervous breakdown]]. He was hospitalised in early December 1952,<ref>Carpenter, 2003, pp.136-139</ref> just before the broadcast of episode five, but it, and the following episode, had already been written, and the next 12 episodes were co-written by Stephens and Grafton. Milligan was absent as a performer for about two months, returning for episode 17, broadcast in early March 1953. As with Series 2, all episodes were co-written by Milligan and Stephens and edited by Jimmy Grafton.\n\nBentine left the show at the end of series 2, citing a desire to pursue solo projects, although there had been an increasing degree of creative tension between him and Milligan.<ref>There are three or four versions of this story regarding the split.

According to later producer [[Peter Eton]], the musical segments took up around half the programme.<ref>Carpenter, 2003, p.113</ref> In this formative phase the show co-starred Milligan (who played only minor roles in the early shows), Sellers, Secombe and [[Michael Bentine]] as the nominal 'hero' of each episode, madcap inventor Dr Osric Pureheart.<ref>Humphrey Carpenter, ''Spike Milligan, The Biography'' (Hodder & Stoughton, London, 2003), p.124</ref> Musical performances were by virtuoso jazz harmonica player [[Max Geldray]], singer [[Ray Ellington]] and his quartet (both of whom were recruited by Dixon) and vocal group the Stargazers, but they left after Episode 6 of Series 2, and for the remaining episodes Secombe filled in, singing a straight vocal number.<ref>Carpenter, 2003, p.124</ref> Incidental, theme and backing music was provided by [[Stanley Black]] and the BBC Dance Orchestra.<ref name=\"Carpenter, 2003, p.127\">Carpenter, 2003, p.127</ref> Series 2 also saw the first appearances of popular characters Minnie Bannister (Milligan) and Henry Crun (Sellers).\n\nFrom Series 3, ''The Goon Show'' (as it was now officially titled) gradually settled into its 'classic' format. Milligan, Stephens and Grafton began to work within a narrative structure and by the second half of Series 4 each episode typically consisted of three acts linked by a continuing plot,<ref>Carpenter, 2003, p.143</ref> with Geldray performing between Acts I and II and Ellington between Acts II and III. Almost all the principal and occasional characters were now performed by Milligan and Sellers, with Secombe usually playing only Neddie Seagoon, who had replaced Pureheart as the hero of most of the stories. The closing theme, backing for Geldray and incidental music was now provided by a big band of freelance musicians under the direction of [[Wally Stott]], who had been writing for the show since the first series.<ref name=\"Carpenter, 2003, p.127\"/> After the end of Series 3, original announcer [[Andrew Timothy]] was replaced (at the suggestion of [[John Snagge]]) by [[Wallace Greenslade]],<ref name=\"Carpenter, 2003, p.127\"/> who provided spoken narrative links as well as occasionally performing small roles in the scripts.\n\nFrom Series 3 onwards, the principal character roles were:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoonshow.net/characters.asp|title=The Goon Show Site - Goons Characters|website=Thegoonshow.net}}</ref>\n*Neddie Seagoon (Secombe)\n*Eccles (Milligan)\n*Bluebottle (Sellers)\n*Henry Crun (Sellers)\n*Minnie Bannister (Milligan)\n*Hercules Grytpype-Thynne (Sellers)\n*Count Jim Moriarty (Milligan)\n*Major Denis Bloodnok (Sellers)\n\nSecondary characters were the \"Indians\", Banerjee and Lalkaka, the servant Abdul/Singez Thingz, Willium \"Mate\" Cobblers, Cyril, Jim Spriggs, Little Jim, Flowerdew and Chief Ellinga/The Red Bladder - both played by Ray Ellington.<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\"/>{{rp|107}} There were also occasional guest stars including senior BBC announcer [[John Snagge]], and actors [[Valentine Dyall]], [[Dick Emery]], [[Kenneth Connor]], [[Dennis Price]] and [[Bernard Miles]].

The show's concluding music was usually either \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\" or a truncated and ironic rendition of the ''[[Alte Kameraden]]'' (Old Comrades') march, followed by Max Geldray and the Ray Ellington Quartet playing \"[[Crazy Rhythm]]\" as play-out music.\n\nIn keeping with the [[Variety show|variety]] requirements of the BBC's \"light entertainment\" format, ''The Goon Show'' scripts were structured in three acts, separated by two musical interludes. These were provided by the [[Ray Ellington]] Quartet&nbsp;\u2013 who performed a mixture of [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]] and [[Calypso music|calypso]] songs&nbsp;\u2013 and by harmonica virtuoso [[Max Geldray]] who performed mostly middle of the road numbers and jazz standards of the 30s and 40s accompanied by the big band. Both Ellington and Geldray also made occasional cameo appearances; Ellington was often drafted in to play stereotypical \"black\" roles such as a tribal chieftain, native bearer or Major Bloodnok's nemesis (and counterpoint to Bloodnok's affliction) \"The Red Bladder\".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIt was in its use of pre-recorded and live sound effects that ''The Goon Show'' broke the most new ground.<ref name=Spike&Co/><ref name=\"Life&DeathofSellers\"/>  Part of the problem was that \"not even Milligan knew how to capture electronically the peculiar sounds that came alive in his head&nbsp;\u2013 he just knew when it had not yet happened\".<ref name=\"Spike&amp;Co205\">McCann (2006) p.205</ref> An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a squelching effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard&nbsp;\u2013 which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled \"Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone.\" One after the other, he swung them around his head against the wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking (\"So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!\").<ref name=\"Spike&amp;Co205\"/><ref name=\"Ventham19\">Harry Secombe, in Ventham (2002) p.19. The socks-filled-with-custard story has been frequently cited since at least the 1970s, when it was reiterated in newspaper articles</ref> Secombe noted that \"Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each&nbsp;\u2013 chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys braying, massive explosions, ships' sirens&nbsp;\u2013 all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects.\"<ref name=\"Ventham19\"/> An FX instruction in one script read \"Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can't get two lions, two hippos will do\".  Over time, the sound engineers became increasingly adept at translating the script into desired sounds, assisted  from the late 1950s onwards by specialists in the BBC's newly formed Radiophonic Workshop.<ref name=\"Spike&amp;Co205\"/>\n\nMilligan's relationship with BBC managers preparing for the recording of episodes was often acrimonious and resulted in rows, and Milligan later agreed that he was a diva during this time, adding \"I was trying to shake the BBC out of its apathy. Sound effects were a knock on the door and tramps on gravel\u2013 that was it, and I tried to transform it.\".<ref name=\"Wilmut1976\"/>{{rp|44}}\n\nMany of the sound effects created for later programmes featured innovative production techniques borrowed from the realm of ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'', and using the then new technology of magnetic tape. Many of these sequences involved the use of complex multiple edits, echo and reverberation and the deliberate slowing down, speeding up or reversing of tapes. One of the most famous was the legendary \"Bloodnok's Stomach\" sound effect, created by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] to represent the sound of Major Bloodnok's digestive system in action, which included a variety of inexplicable gurgling and explosive noises. Lewis (1995, p.&nbsp;218) states Bloodnok's stomach \"was achieved by overlaying burps, whoops from oscillators, water splashes, cork-like pops, and light artillery blasts\".<ref name=\"Life&DeathofSellers\"/>\n\n==Cast members and characters==\n{{main|List of The Goon Show cast members and characters}}\n\n*'''[[Harry Secombe]]'s characters'''\n:{{hlist| Major: [[Neddie Seagoon]] }}\n:{{hlist| Minor: [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Uncle Oscar|Uncle Oscar]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Private Bogg|Private Bogg]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Nugent Dirt|Nugent Dirt]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Izzy|Izzy]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Welshmen|Welshmen]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Yorkshiremen|Yorkshiremen]] }}\n*'''[[Spike Milligan]]'s characters'''\n:{{hlist| Major:  [[Eccles (character)|Eccles]] | [[Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister|Minnie Bannister]] | [[Count Jim Moriarty]] }}\n:{{hlist| Minor: [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Throat|Throat]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Little Jim|Little Jim]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Spriggs|Spriggs]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Yakamoto|Yakamoto]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Cor blimey|Cor blimey]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Thingz|Singes Thingz]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Hugh Jampton|Hugh Jampton]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Fu Manchu|Fu Manchu]] | [[Mr Banerjee]] }}\n*'''[[Peter Sellers]]' characters'''\n:{{hlist| Major: [[Major Bloodnok]] | [[Hercules Grytpype-Thynne]] |  [[Bluebottle (character)|Bluebottle]] | [[Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister|Henry Crun]] }}\n:{{hlist| Minor: [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Cynthia|Cynthia]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Willium \"Mate\" Cobblers|Willium \"Mate\" Cobblers]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Mr Lalkaka|Mr Lalkaka]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Eidelberger|Eidelberger]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Flowerdew|Flowerdew]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Cyril|Cyril]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Fred Nurke|Fred Nurke]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Gladys|Gladys]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Lew/Ernie Cash|Lew/Ernie Cash]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Churchill|Churchill]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Hearn|Hearn]] | [[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#And more...|and more...]] }}\n*'''[[Michael Bentine]]'s characters'''\n:[[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Michael Bentine|Prof. Osric Pureheart and more]]\n*[[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Other members|Other cast members]]\n*[[List of The Goon Show cast members and characters#Guest appearances|Guest cast members]]\n\n==Episodes and archiving==\n{{main|Goon Show episodes and archiving}}\n\n==Running jokes==\n{{main|The Goon Show running jokes}}\n\n===Lurgi===\n{{anchor|Lurgy}}\n:''[[Lurgy (river)]] is a small river near [[Kilmacrennan]] in Donegal in Ireland.''\nSeveral of the words and phrases invented for the show soon entered common usage, the most famous being the word [[wikt:lurgy|lurgi]]. In the episode \"Lurgi Strikes Britain\", Spike Milligan introduced the fictional malady of Lurgi (sometimes spelled Lurgy), which has survived into modern usage to mean the common cold, or any miscellaneous or non-specific illness (often preceded by the adjective \"dreaded\"). The symptoms of Lurgi included the uncontrollable urge to cry \"Eeeeyack-a-boo\", though even during the episode the ailment proved to be an extortionate attempt to sell [[brass band]] musical instruments. Milligan was later to make up his own definition in ''[[Treasure Island According to Spike Milligan]]'', where Jim Hawkins' mother describes it as \"like brown spots of shit on the liver\".<!-- Please put non goon related lurgi references under the Wikipedia entry for lurgy -->\n\n===Brandyyy!===\nAlcohol was strictly forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk in turn was fortified with brandy. In later episodes the catchphrase \"round the back for the old brandy!\" or \"the old Marlon Brando\" was used to announce the exit of one or more characters, or a break for music. In \"The Pam's Paper Insurance Policy\" (Series 9, Episode 4), Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, \"I wonder where he keeps that stuff!\". In \"The Scarlet Capsule\" (Series 9, Episode 14), Ellington's reply to Secombe's cry of \"Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there\" was \"The introductions he gives me...\".  In \"The Moon Show\" (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating \"Man, the excuses he makes to get to that brandy!\", causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail \"MATE!\" in protest. However, Milligan got his own back by making Ellington laugh halfway through the song by doing Minnie Bannister voices while Ellington was singing.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilmut | first = Roger |author2=Jimmy Grafton | title = The Goon Show Companion - A History and Goonography | year = 1976 | publisher = Robson Books | location = London | isbn = 0-903895-64-1 | page = 62 | chapter = Produced by Pat Dixon | quote = Possibly the cast's brandy-and-milk in the back room had a little to do with it (those cries of \"round the back for the old brandy\" before the musical items are not there just for effect!).}}</ref>\n\n===Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb!===\nDuring radio programmes of the 1920s and 1930s, the background noise for crowd scenes was often achieved by a moderately large group of people mumbling \"[[Rhubarb (sound effect)|rhubarb]]\" under their breath with random inflections. This was often parodied by Milligan, who would try to get the same effect with only three or four people, clearly intoning the word rather than mumbling. After some time, Secombe began throwing in \"custard\" during these scenes (for example, in \"The Fear of Wages<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goonshowscripts.afraid.org/raw/series06/s06e25.html|title=The Fear of Wages|website=Goonshowscripts.afraid.org|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310163150/http://goonshowscripts.afraid.org/raw/series06/s06e25.html|archive-date=10 March 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Wings Over Dagenham\", where the phrase was amended to 'flying rhubarb').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goonshowscripts.afraid.org/raw/series07/s07e15a.html|title=Wings Over Dagenham|website=Goonshowscripts.afraid.org|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310144700/http://goonshowscripts.afraid.org/raw/series07/s07e15a.html|archive-date=10 March 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Raspberry blowing===\nAs well as being used as a comic device randomly inserted into different sketches to avoid silence, the [[Blowing a raspberry|blowing of raspberries]] entered the Goons as Harry Secombe's signal to the other actors that he was going to crack up; you would hear a joke from him, a raspberry, and a stream of laughter.  In the Goons' musical recording \"The Ying-Tong Song\", Milligan performed a solo for raspberry-blower, as one might for tuba or baritone saxophone.  Milligan made much use of a rather surreal Columbia 78RPM sound effects disc, catalogue number YB20, which bears the innocuous title \"Donkey\" on the label. Approximating possibly the most obscene and flatulent noise ever recorded, it appeared first in the show \"The Sinking of Westminster Pier\" as a sound to accompany an oyster opening its shell; it thereafter became known as Fred the Oyster, and appears as such in the scripts.  This recording was often used as a reaction to a bad joke. Examples include ''[[The Last Goon Show of All]]'' during which Neddie shouts old jokes into a fuel tank in order to \"start the show\".\n\nYears later, Milligan collaborated with [[Ronnie Barker]] on ''[[The Phantom Raspberry Blower|The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town]]'' in which the credits read, \"Raspberries professionally blown by Spike Milligan\".  [[David Jason]] has also claimed to have produced the sound effect and indeed was credited with this in the second segment of Ronnie Barker's [[LWT]] series ''[[Six Dates with Barker]]'' (1971).<ref>{{IMDb episode |0502939 |Six Dates with Barker - 1899: The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town\" (15 Jan. 1971)}}</ref>\n\n===\"Trapped in a piano\"===\nIn several shows, one character, typically either Henry Crun or Minnie Bannister, would be found trapped in a piano.  In ''The Mystery of the Fake Neddie Seagoon'', Crun was inside a piano and his speech was accompanied by suitable piano noises.  In ''The Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI'', Moriarty is hiding in a piano disguised as one of the strings.  Gritpype-Thynne plays a \"do-re-mi\" scale to find him - Moriarty is \"me\".\n\nThe \"in a piano\" joke was re-used one last time in ''[[The Last Goon Show of All]]''.\n\n===Other references===\nSometimes characters were introduced as \"scion of the house of Rowton\", or \"member of Rowton House\".  This was a reference to the \"[[Rowton Houses]]\", which were hostels for working men in London.\n\n==Films==\nThe following films were a product of Goon activity:\n*''[[Let's Go Crazy (film)|Let's Go Crazy]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Penny Points to Paradise]]'' (1951)\n*''[[Down Among the Z Men]]'' (1952) (with Bentine)\n*''[[The Case of the Mukkinese Battle Horn]]'' (1956)  A two-reeler starring Milligan, Sellers and [[Dick Emery]]\n*''[[The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film]]'' (1959)  A surreal one-reeler short subject starring Milligan and Sellers and directed by [[Richard Lester|Dick Lester]]\n\n== Later revivals ==\n===Books===\nSpike Milligan teamed up with illustrator Pete Clarke to produce two books of comic strip Goons.

It recreates the Goons recording the show, but part way through Spike has a mental breakdown and is committed to an asylum. While it features all of the Goons throughout (although Bentine is mentioned, the fourth character represents Wallace Greenslade), the focus is on Milligan and his breakdown.\n*'''''Apollo Theatre Company''\nTouring in late 2018 in the UK, Apollo Theatre Company in conjunction with Spike Milligan Productions recreated three episodes of The Goon Show - The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler, Tails of Men's Shirts, and The Phantom Head Shaver - with faithful recreations of the original scripts. Co-producer Norma Farnes, Milligan\u2019s ex-manager, agreed to the use of the material on the basis the production was respectful of the scripts. The roles of Sellers, Milligan, and Secombe were played by Julian McDowell, Colin Elmer and Clive Greenwood and the production was directed by McDowell and Tim Astley.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2018/the-goon-show-returns-how-a-new-play-is-celebrating-spike-milligan-harry-secombe-and-peter-sellers/ |title=The Goon Show returns: how a new play is celebrating Milligan and Co |newspaper=The Stage |accessdate=2018-09-15}}</ref>\n\n===Radio and television===\n*'''''The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d (TV, 1956)''''' and '''''The Idiot Weekly'' (radio, 1958\u20131962)\n''[[The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d]]'', which starred Peter Sellers, was the first attempt to translate ''Goon Show'' humour to television. Made for [[Associated-Rediffusion]] during 1956 and only broadcast in the London area, it was mainly written by Milligan, with contributions from other writers in the [[Associated London Scripts]] cooperative including  [[Dave Freeman (British writer)|Dave Freeman]] and [[Terry Nation]], with Eric Sykes as script editor. ''[[The Idiot Weekly]]'' (1958\u20131962) was an Australian radio comedy series written by and starring Milligan with an Australian supporting cast including [[Ray Barrett]] and [[John Bluthal]]. It was made for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] during Milligan's numerous visits to Australia, where his family had emigrated. Milligan adapted some ''Goon Show'' scripts and included his ''Goon Show'' characters (notably Eccles) in many episodes. Six episodes of ''[[The Idiot Weekly]]'' were remade by the BBC as ''[[The Omar Khayyam Show]]'' in 1963.\n\n*'''''The Telegoons'' (1963\u20131964)'''\n''[[The Telegoons]]'' (1963\u20131964) was a 15-minute BBC puppet show featuring the voices of Milligan, Secombe and Sellers and adapted from the radio scripts. 26 episodes were made. The series was briefly repeated immediately after its original run, and all episodes are known to survive, having been unofficially released online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filmthreat.com/uncategorized/the-bootleg-files-the-telegoons/|title=THE BOOTLEG FILES: THE TELEGOONS|last=|first=|date=February 18, 2011|website=https://filmthreat.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://roxburgh.org/telegoons/history_0_intro.htm|title=History|website=Roxburgh.org|accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n*'''''The Goon Show - The Whistling Spy Enigma'' (Secombe & Friends) (1966)'''\nRecorded for Harry Secombe's six-part comedy series, of which only a portion was actually used for the original broadcast, this was similar to ''Tales of Men's Shirts'' as a re-enactment of a radio play for television.

The last time all three Goons worked together was in 1978 when they recorded two new songs, \"The Raspberry Song\" and \"Rhymes\".\n\n*'''''Bridge on the River Wye'' (Parlophone 1962)'''\nA 1962 comedy LP with Milligan and Sellers as well as [[Peter Cook]] and [[Jonathan Miller]]. A spoof of the film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', it was originally recorded under that name. However, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Thus some clever editing of the recording by future Beatles producer [[George Martin]] removed the ''K'' every time the word ''Kwai'' was uttered, creating ''[[Bridge on the River Wye]]''. The LP is based on ''The Goon Show''{{'}}s ''African Incident'' (30 December 1957),<ref name=Spike&Co/> which featured Sellers' vocal impersonation of [[Alec Guinness]]. Lewis' (1995, pp.&nbsp;205\u2013206) gives a good account of this background.<ref name=\"Life&DeathofSellers\"/>\n\n*'''''How to Win an Election'' (1964)'''\nIn 1964, Milligan, Secombe and Sellers lent their voices to a comedy LP, ''How to Win an Election (or Not Lose by Much)'', which was written by [[Leslie Bricusse]]. It was not exactly a Goons reunion because Sellers was in Hollywood and had to record his lines separately. The album was reissued on CD in 1997.\n\n==Impact on comedy and culture==\nIn George Perry's book ''The Life of Python'' (1999) he comments: \"In the Britain of 1950, humour was derived from three main sources: print, film and radio, and despite the advent of television, throughout the 1950s radio remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy. In this period, two radio comedy shows exercised a profound influence. The first was ''[[Take It From Here]]'', with its polished professionalism. The other was ''The Goon Show'', with its absurdity, manic surreality and unpredictability.\"<ref name=\"Perry\">{{cite book | last = Perry | first = George | title = The Life of Python | year = 1999 | publisher = Pavilion Books | location = London | isbn = 1-85793-441-5 | pages = 14\u201317}}</ref>\n\nOn the influence of The Goons, Eric Sykes wrote that in the post-World War II years, \"other shows came along but 'The House of Comedy' needed electricity. Then, out of the blue&nbsp;... ''The Goons''&nbsp;...Spike Milligan simply blew the roof off, and lit the whole place with sunshine. At a cursory glance, ''The Goon Show'' was merely quick-fire delivery of extremely funny lines mouthed by eccentric characters, but this was only the froth. In ''The Goon Show'', Spike was unknowingly portraying every facet of the British psyche\".<ref name=\"SykesComedyHeroes\">{{cite book | last = Sykes | first = Eric | title = Eric Sykes\u2019 Comedy Heroes. | year = 2003 | publisher = Virgin Books | location = London | isbn = 0-7535-0966-0}} p.137</ref>\n\nSykes and Milligan, along with [[Ray Galton]],  [[Alan Simpson (scriptwriter)|Alan Simpson]], [[Frankie Howerd]] and Stanley (\"Scruffy\") Dale, co-founded the writers' cooperative Associated London Scripts (ALS), which over time included others including Larry Stephens.<ref name=Spike&Co/><ref name=ScudamoresMilliganbio/> In his book '''''Spike & Co''''' (2006, pp.&nbsp;344\u2013345), Graham McCann says \"the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show...would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents, ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'', ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', '' [[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', ''[[Vic Reeves Big Night Out]]'', ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'' and countless other strange and bold new comedies\". Other ALS-related comedies such as ''[[Sykes and A...]]'', ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'', ''[[Beyond Our Ken]]'', and ''[[Round The Horne]]'' influenced their own genres of comedy.<ref name=Spike&Co/>\n\n[[Eddie Izzard]] notes that the Goons and Milligan in particular \"influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as 'alternative'.\"<ref name=\" TheEssentialSpikeMilliganvii\"/>  In Ventham's (2002, p.&nbsp;151) compilation, [[John Cleese]] notes that \"In comedy, there are a very small number of defining moments when somebody comes along and genuinely creates a breakthrough, takes us into territory where nobody has been before. The only experiences to which I can compare my own discovery of the Goons are going to see N. F. Simpson's play ''One Way Pendulum''&nbsp;... or, later on, hearing Peter Cook for the first time. They were just light years ahead of everyone else.\"<ref name= MilliganHisPartInOurLives/>\n\n===The Beatles===\nThe Goons made a considerable impact on the humour of [[The Beatles]], and especially on [[John Lennon]]. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book ''The Goon Show Scripts'' for ''[[The New York Times]]''. He wrote: \"I was 12 when ''The Goon Show'' first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof that the world was insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called ''The Daily Howl''. I would write it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud to my friends. Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to ''The Goon Show''.\" Lennon also noted that [[George Martin]], the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.<ref name=\"Lennon\">[http://www.telegoons.org/famous_fans.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218185620/http://www.telegoons.org/famous_fans.htm |date=18 February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn a discussion of an accidentally Goonish nature, about introducing the next song during the 1963 BBC production of ''Pop Go The Beatles'', Lennon is also recorded as quipping \"Love these Goon shows\".

The point is that once somebody has crossed a barrier and done something that has never been done before, it is terribly easy for everybody else to cross it\".<ref name= MilliganHisPartInOurLives/>\n\nSimilarly, in the introduction to [[Graham Chapman]]'s posthumous anthology (2006, p. xvii) Yoakum notes that while other radio comedies influenced Chapman, \"the show that truly astounded Graham, and was a major influence on his comedy was ''The Goon Show''.\" And on page 23 Chapman states: \"from about the age of seven or eight I used to be an avid listener to a radio programme called ''The Goon Show''. In fact, at that stage I wanted to ''be'' a Goon\".<ref name=CalciumMadeInteresting/>\n\nIn their episode [[Election Night Special]], the Pythons gave an appreciative nod to their forebears.

Although many Jews were killed, expelled or sold off into slavery after the AD 66\u201370 and the 123\u2013125 rebellions, the degree to which these transfers affected the Jewish dominance in Palestine is rarely addressed. What is certain is that Palestine did not lose its Jewish component. Goldblatt<ref name=CHJ /> concludes that the Jews may have remained a majority into the 3rd century AD and even beyond. He notes that 'Jewish followers of Jesus' (Jewish Christians) would not have taken part in the rebellions'. Non-Christian conversions from Judaism after the Bar Kochba revolt were not given much attention.<ref>Robert Goldenberg (2008)The destruction of the Jerusalem Temple: its meaning and its consequences.

Apostates from Judaism (aside from converts to Christianity) received little notice in antiquity from either Jewish or non-Jewish writers, but ambitious individuals are known to have turned pagan before the war, and it stands to reason that many more did so after its disastrous conclusion. It is impossible to determine the number who joined the budding Christian movement and the number who disappeared into the polytheist majority.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe highest population of the 3rd to 7th centuries probably occurred in the Byzantine period.<ref name=CHJ/> Most scholars consider that the proportion of Jews decreased during these centuries, a loss of dominance not related to any specific diaspora and at dates not agreed to by historians. For instance, by counting settlements, Avi-Yonah estimated that Jews comprised half the population of the Galilee at the end of the 3rd century, and a quarter in the other parts of the country, but had declined to 10\u201315% of the total by 614.<ref name=CHJ/> On the other hand, by counting churches and synagogues, Tsafrir estimated the Jewish fraction at 25% in the Byzantine period.<ref name=CHJ/>  Stemberger, however, considers that Jews were the largest population group at the beginning of the 4th century, closely followed by the pagans.<ref>{{cite book | author = G\u00fcnter Stemberger | title = Jews and Christians in the Holy Land: Palestine in the Fourth Century | year = 2000 | publisher = T&T Clark Int'l | page = 20 | isbn = 978-0-567-08699-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=tu7esOXinfkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Stemberger+%22Jews+and+Christians%22#v=onepage&q=population&f=false}}</ref> In contrast to Avi-Yonah, Schiffman estimated that Christians only became the majority of the country's population at the beginning of the 5th century,<ref name=\"Schiffman2003\">{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

Of these 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or\u2014a small number\u2014are Protestants.\n\nThe Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850 there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions. Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees. They practised, with modern methods, all the processes of agriculture. There are at the present time 64 of these settlements, large and small, with a population of some 15,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/349B02280A930813052565E90048ED1C|title=Mandate for Palestine - Interim report of the Mandatory to the League of Nations/Balfour Declaration text (30 July 1921)|website=unispal.un.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 1948, the population had risen to 1,900,000, of whom 68% were [[Arabs]], and 32% were [[Jews]] ([[UNSCOP]] report, including [[Bedouin]]).\n\nReport and general abstract of the Jewish agriculture was taken by the Palestine Zionist Executive in April 1927.\n\n<blockquote> '''Object of the Census''':\n\n(p 85) Demography: to enumerate all Jewish inhabitants living in the agricultural and semi-agricultural communities.\n\n(p 86) Number of Settlements: 130 places have been enumerated.

It is known that the Arab population of Palestine doubled during the British Mandate era, from 670,000 in 1922 to over 1.2 million in 1948, and there has been considerable debate over the subject on how much of this growth was due to natural increase, as opposed to immigration. Estimates on the scope of Arab immigration to Palestine during this period vary.\n\n===Ottoman Period 1800-1918===\n\nSome Egyptian migration to Palestine happened at the end of the 18th century due to a severe famine in Egypt, and several waves of Egyptian immigrants came even earlier due to escape natural disasters such as droughts and plagues, government oppression, taxes, and military conscription. Although many Palestinian Arabs also moved to Egypt, Egyptian immigration to Palestine was more dominant. In the 19th century, large numbers of Egyptians fled to Palestine to escape the military conscription and forced labor projects in the Nile Delta under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. Following the [[Egyptian-Ottoman War (1831-1833)|First Egyptian-Ottoman War]], which saw the Egyptian conquest of Palestine, more Egyptians were brought to Palestine as forced laborers. Following the [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)|Second Egyptian-Ottoman War]], which saw Egyptian rule in Palestine terminated, massive numbers of soldiers deserted during the Egyptian army's retreat from Palestine to permanently settle there. Egyptians settled mainly in Jaffa, the Coastal plain, Samaria and in Wadi Ara. In the southern plain there were 19 villages with Egyptian populations, while in Jaffa there were some 500 Egyptian families with a population of over 2,000 people. The largest rural concentration of Egyptian immigrants was in the Sharon region.<ref>Rural Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine: Distribution By David Grossman, pp. 45-52</ref> According to David Grossman, statistics show the number of Egyptian immigrants to Palestine between 1829 and 1841 exceeded 15,000, and he estimated that it was at least 23,000 and possibly up to 30,000.<ref>Rural Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine: Distribution By David Grossman P 60</ref> In 1860, there was significant immigration to [[Safed]] by [[Moors|Moorish]] (i.e. [[Arab-Berber]]) tribes from [[Algeria]] and a small number of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], while some 6,000 Arabs from the [[Beni Sakhr]] tribe immigrated to Palestine from what is now [[Jordan]] to settle in [[Tiberias]]. In addition, considerable numbers of [[Turkish people|Turks]] stationed in Palestine to garrison the land settled there.<ref>Merry, Sidney: ''How the State Controls Society'', p. 220</ref>\n\nIn 1878, following [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], many Bosnian Muslims, apprehensive of living under Christian rule, emigrated to the Ottoman Empire, and significant numbers went to Palestine, where most adopted the surname [[Bushnak]]. Bosnian Muslim immigration continued throughout the following decades and increased after Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia in 1908. To this day, Bushnak remains a common surname among Palestinians of Bosnian origin.<ref>Cohen, Philip J.; Riesman, David (1996). \"Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History\".

The Egyptian fellahins settled mostly in the region around Gaza and received protection from Bedouins, in return for goods. Bedouins brought African slaves (abid) from Sudan who worked for them. To reduce frictions and to stabilize the boundaries between Bedouin tribes, the Ottomans established an administrative center in Beersheba around 1900, as the first planned settlement in Negev since the Nabatean and Byzantine times.<ref>International Handbook of Research on Indigenous Entrepreneurship By L. -P.

Specifically, of Muslims, 93.1% were born in their current locality of residence, 5.2% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 1.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Christians, 93.4% were born in their current locality, 3.0% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 3.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Jews (excluding the large fraction who were not Ottoman citizens), 59.0% were born in their current locality, 1.9% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 39.0% were born outside Palestine.<ref>{{cite book | author = U.

This can be compared to the very crude estimate of about 4 per thousand for the \"less developed countries\" of the world (in Asia, Africa, and Latin America) between 1800 and 1910. It is possible that some part of the growth of the Muslim population was due to immigration. However, it seems likely that the dominant determinant of this modest growth was the beginning of some natural increase.\"{{sfn|Bachi|1974|pp=34\u201335}}\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], \"... evidence for Muslim immigration into Palestine is minimal. Because no Ottoman records of that immigration have yet been discovered, one is thrown back on demographic analysis to evaluate Muslim migration.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|pp=16, 33}} McCarthy argues that there is no significant Arab immigration into mandatory Palestine:\n<blockquote>\nFrom analyses of rates of increase of the Muslim population of the three Palestinian sanjaks, one can say with certainty that Muslim immigration after the 1870s was small. Had there been a large group of Muslim immigrants their numbers would have caused an unusual increase in the population and this would have appeared in the calculated rate of increase from one registration list to another... Such an increase would have been easily noticed; it was not there.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=16}}\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nThe argument that Arab immigration somehow made up a large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable. The vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs resident in 1947 were the sons and daughters of Arabs who were living in Palestine before modern Jewish immigration began. There is no reason to believe that they were not the sons and daughters of Arabs who had been in Palestine for many centuries.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=38}}\n</blockquote>\nMcCarthy also concludes that there was no significant internal migration to Jewish areas attributable to better economic conditions:\n<blockquote>\nSome areas of Palestine did experience greater population growth than others, but the explanation for this is simple. Radical economic change was occurring all over the Mediterranean Basin at the time. Improved transportation, greater mercantile activity, and greater industry had increased the chances for employment in cities, especially coastal cities... Differential population increase was occurring all over the Eastern Mediterranean, not just in Palestine... The increase in Muslim population had little or nothing to do with Jewish immigration. In fact the province that experienced the greatest Jewish population growth (by .035 annually), Jerusalem Sanjak, was the province with the lowest rate of growth of Muslim population (.009).{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|pp=16\u201317}}\n</blockquote>Fred M. Gottheil has questioned McCarthy's estimates of immigration. Gottheil says that McCarthy didn't give proper weight to the importance of economic incentives at the time, and that McCarthy cites Roberto Bachi's estimates as conclusive numbers, rather than lower bounds based detected illegal immigration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottheil|first=Fred M.|date=2003-01-01|title=The Smoking Gun: Arab Immigration into Palestine, 1922-1931|url=http://www.meforum.org/522/the-smoking-gun-arab-immigration-into-palestine|journal=Middle East Quarterly|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKRlAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|title=Palestine and Israel in the 19th and 20th Centuries|chapter=Arab Immigration into Pre-State Israel 1922-1931|last=Gottheil|first=Fred M.|editor-last=Kedourie|editor-first=Elie|editor-last2=Haim|editor-first2=Sylvia G.|date=1982-05-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135168148|language=en}}</ref>\n\nGad Gilbar has also concluded that the prosperity of Palestine in the 45\u201350 years before World War I was a result of the modernization and growth of the economy owing to its integration with the world economy and especially with the economies of Europe. Although the reasons for growth were exogenous to Palestine the bearers were not waves of Jewish immigration, foreign intervention nor Ottoman reforms but \"primarily local Arab Muslims and Christians.\"<ref>Gilbar, 1986, p. 188.</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that the British turned a blind eye to large-scale Arab illegal immigration, and instead disproportionately focused on Jewish illegal immigration. In particular, Freddy Liebreich claimed that significant undocumented Arab immigration, much of it from the [[Hauran]] region of Syria, did take place during the Mandate era, and that the British authorities largely ignored it. According to Liebreich: \"Jewish illegal immigration was minutely detailed and meticulously recorded but all references to Arab illegal immigration were, perhaps deliberately, obscured.\" He claimed that one major example took place in 1934, when, according to him, approximately 35,000 Arabs illegally immigrated to Palestine from the Hauran, basing this estimate on a claim made by the Governor of the Hauran at the time, who estimated that 30,000-36,000 people from the Hauran had left to settle in Palestine in recent months. By contrast, the British estimated the number of illegal immigrants to Palestine in 1934, both Arab and non-Arab, at 3,000. Liebreich also wrote that many British documents from the beginning of the Mandate era to the 1940s contain references to Syrians from the Hauran being freely admitted into Palestine without a passport or visa, and noted that illegal immigration from the Hauran was mentioned in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] a year before the end of British rule in Palestine.<ref>Liebreich, Freddy: ''Britain's Naval and Political Reaction to the Illegal Immigration of Jews to Palestine, 1945-1949'', pgs. 27-28</ref>\n\n[[Yehoshua Porath]] believes that the notion of \"large-scale immigration of Arabs from the neighboring countries\" is a myth \"proposed by Zionist writers\". He writes:\n<blockquote>\nAs all the research by historian Fares Abdul Rahim and geographers of modern Palestine shows, the Arab population began to grow again in the middle of the nineteenth century. That growth resulted from a new factor: the demographic revolution. Until the 1850s there was no \"natural\" increase of the population, but this began to change when modern medical treatment was introduced and modern hospitals were established, both by the Ottoman authorities and by the foreign Christian missionaries. The number of births remained steady but infant mortality decreased. This was the main reason for Arab population growth. ... No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century. Trans-Jordan exported unskilled casual labor to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase.<ref>Porath, Y. (1986). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5249 Mrs. Peters's Palestine]. ''New York Review of Books''. 16 January, 32 (21 & 22).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[Daniel Pipes]] responded to Porath by granting that ''[[From Time Immemorial]]'' quoted carelessly, used statistics sloppily, and ignored inconvenient facts. Nonetheless, he explained that:<blockquote>\nMiss Peters's central thesis is that a substantial immigration of Arabs to Palestine took place during the first half of the twentieth century. She supports this argument with an array of demographic statistics and contemporary accounts, the bulk of which have not been questioned by any reviewer, including Porath.\n</blockquote>Porath replied with an array of demographic data to support his position. He also wrote that Peters's demographic statistics were inexplicable: <blockquote>\n...nowhere in her main text or in the methodological appendices (V and VI) did Mrs. Peters bother to explain to her readers how she managed to break down the Ottoman or Cuinet's figures into smaller units than subdistricts. As far as I know no figures for the units smaller than subdistricts (Nahia; the parallel of the French commune), covering the area of Ottoman Palestine, were ever published. Therefore I can't avoid the conclusion that Mrs. Peters's figures were, at best, based on guesswork and an extremely tendentious guesswork at that.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5172 Mrs. Peters's Palestine: An Exchange], ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 33, Number 5, March 27, 1986.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Modern era==\n{{See also|Demographics of Israel|Israelis|Demographics of the Palestinian territories|Palestinian people#Demographics}}\n\n{{as of|2014}}, Israeli and Palestinian statistics for the overall numbers of Jews and Arabs in the area west of the Jordan, inclusive of Israel and the [[Palestinian territories]], are similar and suggest a rough parity in the two populations.

Although many Jews were killed, expelled or sold off into slavery after the AD 66\u201370 and the 123\u2013125 rebellions, the degree to which these transfers affected the Jewish dominance in Palestine is rarely addressed. What is certain is that Palestine did not lose its Jewish component. Goldblatt<ref name=CHJ /> concludes that the Jews may have remained a majority into the 3rd century AD and even beyond. He notes that 'Jewish followers of Jesus' (Jewish Christians) would not have taken part in the rebellions'. Non-Christian conversions from Judaism after the Bar Kochba revolt were not given much attention.<ref>Robert Goldenberg (2008)The destruction of the Jerusalem Temple: its meaning and its consequences.

Apostates from Judaism (aside from converts to Christianity) received little notice in antiquity from either Jewish or non-Jewish writers, but ambitious individuals are known to have turned pagan before the war, and it stands to reason that many more did so after its disastrous conclusion.

Of these 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or\u2014a small number\u2014are Protestants.\n\nThe Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850 there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions. Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees. They practised, with modern methods, all the processes of agriculture. There are at the present time 64 of these settlements, large and small, with a population of some 15,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/349B02280A930813052565E90048ED1C|title=Mandate for Palestine - Interim report of the Mandatory to the League of Nations/Balfour Declaration text (30 July 1921)|website=unispal.un.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 1948, the population had risen to 1,900,000, of whom 68% were [[Arabs]], and 32% were [[Jews]] ([[UNSCOP]] report, including [[Bedouin]]).\n\nReport and general abstract of the Jewish agriculture was taken by the Palestine Zionist Executive in April 1927.\n\n<blockquote> '''Object of the Census''':\n\n(p 85) Demography: to enumerate all Jewish inhabitants living in the agricultural and semi-agricultural communities.\n\n(p 86) Number of Settlements: 130 places have been enumerated.

It is known that the Arab population of Palestine doubled during the British Mandate era, from 670,000 in 1922 to over 1.2 million in 1948, and there has been considerable debate over the subject on how much of this growth was due to natural increase, as opposed to immigration. Estimates on the scope of Arab immigration to Palestine during this period vary.\n\n===Ottoman Period 1800-1918===\n\nSome Egyptian migration to Palestine happened at the end of the 18th century due to a severe famine in Egypt, and several waves of Egyptian immigrants came even earlier due to escape natural disasters such as droughts and plagues, government oppression, taxes, and military conscription. Although many Palestinian Arabs also moved to Egypt, Egyptian immigration to Palestine was more dominant. In the 19th century, large numbers of Egyptians fled to Palestine to escape the military conscription and forced labor projects in the Nile Delta under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. Following the [[Egyptian-Ottoman War (1831-1833)|First Egyptian-Ottoman War]], which saw the Egyptian conquest of Palestine, more Egyptians were brought to Palestine as forced laborers. Following the [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)|Second Egyptian-Ottoman War]], which saw Egyptian rule in Palestine terminated, massive numbers of soldiers deserted during the Egyptian army's retreat from Palestine to permanently settle there. Egyptians settled mainly in Jaffa, the Coastal plain, Samaria and in Wadi Ara. In the southern plain there were 19 villages with Egyptian populations, while in Jaffa there were some 500 Egyptian families with a population of over 2,000 people. The largest rural concentration of Egyptian immigrants was in the Sharon region.<ref>Rural Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine: Distribution By David Grossman, pp. 45-52</ref> According to David Grossman, statistics show the number of Egyptian immigrants to Palestine between 1829 and 1841 exceeded 15,000, and he estimated that it was at least 23,000 and possibly up to 30,000.<ref>Rural Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine: Distribution By David Grossman P 60</ref> In 1860, there was significant immigration to [[Safed]] by [[Moors|Moorish]] (i.e. [[Arab-Berber]]) tribes from [[Algeria]] and a small number of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], while some 6,000 Arabs from the [[Beni Sakhr]] tribe immigrated to Palestine from what is now [[Jordan]] to settle in [[Tiberias]]. In addition, considerable numbers of [[Turkish people|Turks]] stationed in Palestine to garrison the land settled there.<ref>Merry, Sidney: ''How the State Controls Society'', p. 220</ref>\n\nIn 1878, following [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], many Bosnian Muslims, apprehensive of living under Christian rule, emigrated to the Ottoman Empire, and significant numbers went to Palestine, where most adopted the surname [[Bushnak]]. Bosnian Muslim immigration continued throughout the following decades and increased after Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia in 1908. To this day, Bushnak remains a common surname among Palestinians of Bosnian origin.<ref>Cohen, Philip J.; Riesman, David (1996). \"Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History\".

The Egyptian fellahins settled mostly in the region around Gaza and received protection from Bedouins, in return for goods. Bedouins brought African slaves (abid) from Sudan who worked for them. To reduce frictions and to stabilize the boundaries between Bedouin tribes, the Ottomans established an administrative center in Beersheba around 1900, as the first planned settlement in Negev since the Nabatean and Byzantine times.<ref>International Handbook of Research on Indigenous Entrepreneurship By L. -P.

Specifically, of Muslims, 93.1% were born in their current locality of residence, 5.2% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 1.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Christians, 93.4% were born in their current locality, 3.0% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 3.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Jews (excluding the large fraction who were not Ottoman citizens), 59.0% were born in their current locality, 1.9% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 39.0% were born outside Palestine.<ref>{{cite book | author = U.

This can be compared to the very crude estimate of about 4 per thousand for the \"less developed countries\" of the world (in Asia, Africa, and Latin America) between 1800 and 1910. It is possible that some part of the growth of the Muslim population was due to immigration. However, it seems likely that the dominant determinant of this modest growth was the beginning of some natural increase.\"{{sfn|Bachi|1974|pp=34\u201335}}\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], \"... evidence for Muslim immigration into Palestine is minimal. Because no Ottoman records of that immigration have yet been discovered, one is thrown back on demographic analysis to evaluate Muslim migration.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|pp=16, 33}} McCarthy argues that there is no significant Arab immigration into mandatory Palestine:\n<blockquote>\nFrom analyses of rates of increase of the Muslim population of the three Palestinian sanjaks, one can say with certainty that Muslim immigration after the 1870s was small. Had there been a large group of Muslim immigrants their numbers would have caused an unusual increase in the population and this would have appeared in the calculated rate of increase from one registration list to another... Such an increase would have been easily noticed; it was not there.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=16}}\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nThe argument that Arab immigration somehow made up a large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable. The vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs resident in 1947 were the sons and daughters of Arabs who were living in Palestine before modern Jewish immigration began. There is no reason to believe that they were not the sons and daughters of Arabs who had been in Palestine for many centuries.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=38}}\n</blockquote>\nMcCarthy also concludes that there was no significant internal migration to Jewish areas attributable to better economic conditions:\n<blockquote>\nSome areas of Palestine did experience greater population growth than others, but the explanation for this is simple. Radical economic change was occurring all over the Mediterranean Basin at the time. Improved transportation, greater mercantile activity, and greater industry had increased the chances for employment in cities, especially coastal cities... Differential population increase was occurring all over the Eastern Mediterranean, not just in Palestine... The increase in Muslim population had little or nothing to do with Jewish immigration. In fact the province that experienced the greatest Jewish population growth (by .035 annually), Jerusalem Sanjak, was the province with the lowest rate of growth of Muslim population (.009).{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|pp=16\u201317}}\n</blockquote>Fred M. Gottheil has questioned McCarthy's estimates of immigration. Gottheil says that McCarthy didn't give proper weight to the importance of economic incentives at the time, and that McCarthy cites Roberto Bachi's estimates as conclusive numbers, rather than lower bounds based detected illegal immigration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottheil|first=Fred M.|date=2003-01-01|title=The Smoking Gun: Arab Immigration into Palestine, 1922-1931|url=http://www.meforum.org/522/the-smoking-gun-arab-immigration-into-palestine|journal=Middle East Quarterly|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKRlAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|title=Palestine and Israel in the 19th and 20th Centuries|chapter=Arab Immigration into Pre-State Israel 1922-1931|last=Gottheil|first=Fred M.|editor-last=Kedourie|editor-first=Elie|editor-last2=Haim|editor-first2=Sylvia G.|date=1982-05-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135168148|language=en}}</ref>\n\nGad Gilbar has also concluded that the prosperity of Palestine in the 45\u201350 years before World War I was a result of the modernization and growth of the economy owing to its integration with the world economy and especially with the economies of Europe. Although the reasons for growth were exogenous to Palestine the bearers were not waves of Jewish immigration, foreign intervention nor Ottoman reforms but \"primarily local Arab Muslims and Christians.\"<ref>Gilbar, 1986, p. 188.</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that the British turned a blind eye to large-scale Arab illegal immigration, and instead disproportionately focused on Jewish illegal immigration. In particular, Freddy Liebreich claimed that significant undocumented Arab immigration, much of it from the [[Hauran]] region of Syria, did take place during the Mandate era, and that the British authorities largely ignored it. According to Liebreich: \"Jewish illegal immigration was minutely detailed and meticulously recorded but all references to Arab illegal immigration were, perhaps deliberately, obscured.\" He claimed that one major example took place in 1934, when, according to him, approximately 35,000 Arabs illegally immigrated to Palestine from the Hauran, basing this estimate on a claim made by the Governor of the Hauran at the time, who estimated that 30,000-36,000 people from the Hauran had left to settle in Palestine in recent months. By contrast, the British estimated the number of illegal immigrants to Palestine in 1934, both Arab and non-Arab, at 3,000. Liebreich also wrote that many British documents from the beginning of the Mandate era to the 1940s contain references to Syrians from the Hauran being freely admitted into Palestine without a passport or visa, and noted that illegal immigration from the Hauran was mentioned in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] a year before the end of British rule in Palestine.<ref>Liebreich, Freddy: ''Britain's Naval and Political Reaction to the Illegal Immigration of Jews to Palestine, 1945-1949'', pgs. 27-28</ref>\n\n[[Yehoshua Porath]] believes that the notion of \"large-scale immigration of Arabs from the neighboring countries\" is a myth \"proposed by Zionist writers\". He writes:\n<blockquote>\nAs all the research by historian Fares Abdul Rahim and geographers of modern Palestine shows, the Arab population began to grow again in the middle of the nineteenth century. That growth resulted from a new factor: the demographic revolution. Until the 1850s there was no \"natural\" increase of the population, but this began to change when modern medical treatment was introduced and modern hospitals were established, both by the Ottoman authorities and by the foreign Christian missionaries. The number of births remained steady but infant mortality decreased. This was the main reason for Arab population growth. ... No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century. Trans-Jordan exported unskilled casual labor to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase.<ref>Porath, Y. (1986).

''New York Review of Books''. 16 January, 32 (21 & 22).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[Daniel Pipes]] responded to Porath by granting that ''[[From Time Immemorial]]'' quoted carelessly, used statistics sloppily, and ignored inconvenient facts. Nonetheless, he explained that:<blockquote>\nMiss Peters's central thesis is that a substantial immigration of Arabs to Palestine took place during the first half of the twentieth century. She supports this argument with an array of demographic statistics and contemporary accounts, the bulk of which have not been questioned by any reviewer, including Porath.\n</blockquote>Porath replied with an array of demographic data to support his position. He also wrote that Peters's demographic statistics were inexplicable: <blockquote>\n...nowhere in her main text or in the methodological appendices (V and VI) did Mrs. Peters bother to explain to her readers how she managed to break down the Ottoman or Cuinet's figures into smaller units than subdistricts. As far as I know no figures for the units smaller than subdistricts (Nahia; the parallel of the French commune), covering the area of Ottoman Palestine, were ever published. Therefore I can't avoid the conclusion that Mrs. Peters's figures were, at best, based on guesswork and an extremely tendentious guesswork at that.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5172 Mrs. Peters's Palestine: An Exchange], ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 33, Number 5, March 27, 1986.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Modern era==\n{{See also|Demographics of Israel|Israelis|Demographics of the Palestinian territories|Palestinian people#Demographics}}\n\n{{as of|2014}}, Israeli and Palestinian statistics for the overall numbers of Jews and Arabs in the area west of the Jordan, inclusive of Israel and the [[Palestinian territories]], are similar and suggest a rough parity in the two populations.
