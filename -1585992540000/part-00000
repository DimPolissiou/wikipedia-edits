This [[Halo car|broadened the image]] of Japanese car-makers beyond their econobox successes, as well as being credited as a catalyst for the import performance parts industry.\n\nBefore Honda unveiled [[Acura]] in 1986, Japanese automobiles exports were primarily economical in design and largely targeted at low-cost consumers. The Japanese big three created their luxury marques to challenge the established brands. Following Honda's lead, Toyota launched the [[Lexus]] name with the [[Lexus LS|LS 400]] which debuted at $38,000 in the U.S. (in some markets being priced against mid-sized six cylinder [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]] models),<ref name=comfortable>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=115368|title=Lexus LS 400, LS 430 and LS 460 Generations:  Setting the Standard in the Most Comfortable Way Possible|accessdate=2007-04-08|publisher=Edmunds.com|date=2003-03-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401180015/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D115368|archivedate=1 April 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> and was rated by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine as better than both the $63,000 [[Mercedes-Benz W126]] and the $55,000 [[BMW E32]] in terms of ride, handling and performance.<ref name=zen>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971153-1,00.html|title=Zen and the Art of Automotive Maintenance|date=1990-09-17|accessdate=2007-04-29|last=Detroit|first=S.C.

The vehicle included a class-leading (at the time) 278&nbsp;[[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers/SAE International|hp]] (207&nbsp;[[Watt|kW]]) V8 engine, [[four wheel steering]], the first [[active suspension]] system offered on a motor vehicle, and numerous interior luxury appointments.  These made it competitive against the [[Germany|German]] imports like [[Audi]], [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]], which by the time of Infiniti's release had overtaken [[Cadillac]] and [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] in dominating the luxury segment of the American market. In 1990, four years after the debut of the Legend and Integra, Acura introduced the [[Acura NSX|NSX]], a midship V6 powered, rear-wheel-drive sports car.  The NSX, an acronym for \"New Sports eXperimental\", was billed as the first Japanese car capable of competing with [[Ferrari]] and [[Porsche]]. This vehicle served as a [[halo car]] for the Acura brand. The NSX was the world's first all-aluminum production car, and was also marketed and viewed by some as the \"Everyday Supercar\" thanks in part to its ease of use, quality and reliability, traits that were unheard of in the supercar segment at the time.<ref name=acura>The Legend was built on the Accord platform, and the Integra was built on the Civic platform. [http://www.acura.com/ Acura History page > timeline]</ref>\n\nThe success of the Japanese automakers contributed to their American counterparts falling into a recession in the late 1970s. Unions and lobbyists in both North America and Europe put pressure on their government to restrict imports. In 1981, Japan agreed to [[Voluntary Export Restraints]] in order to preempt [[protectionism]] measures that the US may have taken, where it be [[tariff]]s or [[import quota]]s. Consequently, Japanese companies responded by investing heavily in US production facilities, as they were not subject to the VER. Unlike the plants of domestic automakers, Japanese plants are non-unionized (save for [[NUMMI]]), so they have lower wage expenses and do not face the risk of strikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/related/links/story.html?id=562830 |title=Caw Girds For War |publisher=Financialpost.com |author=Nicolas Van Praet |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216154211/http://www.financialpost.com/related/links/story.html?id=562830 |archivedate=February 16, 2009 }}</ref>  The VER was lifted in 1994 upon agreement of all members of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perc.org/articles/article416.php |title=PERC - The Property and Environment Research Center: Voluntary Export Restraints on Automobiles |publisher=Perc.org |accessdate=2008-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216132355/http://www.perc.org/articles/article416.php |archive-date=2009-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Establishing US production facilities was also a significant step in improving public relations, along with philanthropy, lobbying efforts, and sharing technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aol.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_10/b4024071.htm |title=Why Toyota Is Afraid Of Being Number One |publisher=Aol.businessweek.com |accessdate=2008-11-01 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708041634/http://aol.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_10/b4024071.htm |archive-date=2012-07-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Europe has still largely maintained its protectionism policies against Japanese cars, though theirs varies considerably.<ref name=zen/>\n\nToyota has always been by far Japan's largest automaker, and it recently overtook perennial world leader GM in both production and sales by early 2008.

The vehicle included a class-leading (at the time) 278&nbsp;[[Horsepower#Society of Automotive Engineers/SAE International|hp]] (207&nbsp;[[Watt|kW]]) V8 engine, [[four wheel steering]], the first [[active suspension]] system offered on a motor vehicle, and numerous interior luxury appointments.

In 1990, four years after the debut of the Legend and Integra, Acura introduced the [[Acura NSX|NSX]], a midship V6 powered, rear-wheel-drive sports car.  The NSX, an acronym for \"New Sports eXperimental\", was billed as the first Japanese car capable of competing with [[Ferrari]] and [[Porsche]]. This vehicle served as a [[halo car]] for the Acura brand. The NSX was the world's first all-aluminum production car, and was also marketed and viewed by some as the \"Everyday Supercar\" thanks in part to its ease of use, quality and reliability, traits that were unheard of in the supercar segment at the time.<ref name=acura>The Legend was built on the Accord platform, and the Integra was built on the Civic platform.

Unions and lobbyists in both North America and Europe put pressure on their government to restrict imports. In 1981, Japan agreed to [[Voluntary Export Restraints]] in order to preempt [[protectionism]] measures that the US may have taken, where it be [[tariff]]s or [[import quota]]s. Consequently, Japanese companies responded by investing heavily in US production facilities, as they were not subject to the VER.

[[Gronings]]: {{lang|gos|Grunnen}}) is the main municipality as well as the capital city of the [[Groningen (province)|eponymous province]] in the [[Netherlands]]. It is the largest city in the north of the Netherlands and has 231,037 inhabitants (31 January 2019) on a total area of {{convert|180.21|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and land area of {{convert|168.93|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population density of 1,367 per km<sup>2</sup> (3,540 per square mile). It merged with [[Ten Boer]] and [[Haren, Groningen|Haren]] municipalities in 1 January 2019. The [[Groningen-Assen metropolitan area]] has about half a million inhabitants. Groningen is an old city (more than 950 years) and was the regional power of the north of the Netherlands, a semi-independent city-state and member of the German [[Hanseatic League]]. Groningen is a university city, with an estimated 31,000 students at the [[University of Groningen]] (1 October 2018), and an estimated 28,000 at the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen|Hanze University of Applied Sciences]] (1 October 2018).\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded at the northernmost point of the ''[[Hondsrug]]'' area. The oldest document referring to Groningen's existence dates from 1040. However, the city already existed long before then: the oldest archaeological traces found are believed to stem from the years 3950\u20133720 BC, although the first major settlement in Groningen has been traced back to the 3rd century AD.\n\nIn the 13th century, when Groningen was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a [[city wall]] to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its [[dialect]] a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of [[Friesland]] was administered from Groningen. During these years, the ''[[Martinitoren]]'', then {{convert|127|m|abbr=off}} tall, was built; it loomed over the city. The city's independence ended in 1536, when it chose to accept [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the Habsburg ruler of the other Netherlands, as its overlord.\n\n[[File:Groningen 1565.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Groningen in the 16th century]]\nIn 1594, Groningen, until then held by Spain, [[Siege of Groningen (1594)|was captured]] by a Dutch and English force led by [[Maurice of Nassau]]. Soon afterwards the city and the province joined the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]].\n\nIn 1614, the [[University of Groningen]] was founded, initially only for [[Theology#Theology as an academic discipline|religious education]]. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That same city wall was tested during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672, when the city was [[Siege of Groningen|attacked fiercely]] by the bishop of [[Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], [[Bernhard von Galen]]. The city walls resisted, an event that is still celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as \"''[[:nl:Gronings Ontzet|Gronings Ontzet]]''\" or \"''Bommen Berend''\").\n[[File:Groningen-7.jpg|alt=|thumb|280px|Der Aa Church and the Canal (2018)]]\nThe city did not escape the devastation of [[World War II]]. In particular, the main square, the Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945 in the [[Battle of Groningen]]. However, the ''Martinitoren'', its church, the ''[[Goudkantoor]]'', and the city hall were not damaged. The battle lasted several days.\n\n==Geography==\n===Climate===\nGroningen has an oceanic temperate climate, like all of the Netherlands, although slightly colder in winter than other major cities in the Netherlands due to its northeasterly position. Weather is influenced by the North Sea to the north-west and its prevailing north-western winds and gales.\n\nSummers are somewhat warm and humid. Temperatures of {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or higher occur sporadically; the average daytime high is around {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Very rainy periods are common, especially in spring and summer. Average annual precipitation is about {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Annual sunshine hours vary, but are usually below 1600&nbsp;hours, giving much cloud cover similar to most of the Netherlands.  Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.  The [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]\". (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=592559&cityname=Groningen%2C+Groningen%2C+Netherlands&units= Climate Summary for Groningen]</ref>\n\nWinters are cool: on average above freezing, although frosts are common during spells of easterly wind from Germany, Russia and even Siberia. Night-time temperatures of {{convert|-10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or lower are not uncommon during cold winter periods. The lowest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|-26.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 16 February 1956. Snow often falls, but rarely stays long due to warmer daytime temperatures, although white snowy days happen every winter. \n{{Groningen weatherbox}}\n\n== Population growth ==\n[[File:Martini2.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Martinitoren|Martini Tower]]]]\n[[File:Eyecatcher (23907089).jpeg|thumb|280px|High Rise Office of ministry of Education]]\nThe municipality of Groningen has grown rapidly.

The [[Suiker Unie]] plant was originally outside Groningen, but it was completely swallowed by the expansion of the city. After a campaign to close the factory, it was finally shut down in 2008/2009. Before closing down, its sugar production amounted to 250,000 [[tonnes]] of [[beet sugar]], with 250 employees (2005 figures). The only remaining sugar factory is ''CSM Vierverlaten'' in [[Hoogkerk]], which produces 235,000&nbsp;tonnes of beet sugar, with 283 employees.\n\nWell known companies from Groningen are publishing company [[Noordhoff Uitgevers]], tobacco company [[Royal Theodorus Niemeyer]], health insurance company Menzis, distillery [[Hooghoudt distillery|Hooghoudt]], and natural gas companies GasUnie and [[GasTerra]].

Several caf\u00e9s feature live music, a few of which specialize in jazz music, including ''Jazzcafe De Spieghel'' on the Peperstraat. The jazz music students from the [[Prince Claus Conservatoire]] have been known to hold regular jam sessions in caf\u00e9s such as ''Peter Pan'' on the ''Voor Het Voormalige Klein Poortje'' and ''caf\u00e9 De Smederij'' on the Tuinstraat 2\u20134. Groningen is also the host city for [[Eurosonic Noorderslag]], an annual music showcase event for over a hundred bands from all over Europe.\n\n===Nightlife===\nGroningen's nightlife depends largely on its student population. Its cultural scene is vibrant and remarkable for a city its size. In particular, the Grote Markt, the Vismarkt, the Poelestraat and Peperstraat are crowded every night of the week, and most bars do not close until 5 in the morning.

A large network of bike paths makes it convenient to cycle to various destinations. In 2000, Groningen was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands|Fietsstad 2002]]'' \u2014 top BikeCity of the Netherlands for 2002.\n\nThe city is very much adapted to the wishes of those who want to get around without a car, as it has an extensive network of segregated cycle-paths, good public transport, and a large pedestrianised zone in the city centre. The transformation of the historic centre into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking. This is achieved by applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|\"filtered permeability\"]]. It means that the network configuration favours [[active transportation]] and selectively \"filters out\" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces, increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image). The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts \u2013 the [[fused grid]].\n\n===Public transport===\n====Train's<ref>https://nieuws.ns.nl/spoorkaart-2020-hier-te-downloaden/</ref>====\n[[File:20080430_Hoofdstation_Groningen_NL.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Groningen_railway_station|Railway station ]] Groningen (2008)]]\nThe Station of [[Groningen railway station|Groningen]] or Hoofdstation as the locals call it, has regular services to most of the major cities in the Netherlands.

[[Gronings]]: {{lang|gos|Grunnen}}) is the main municipality as well as the capital city of the [[Groningen (province)|eponymous province]] in the [[Netherlands]]. It is the largest city in the north of the Netherlands and has 231,037 inhabitants (31 January 2019) on a total area of {{convert|180.21|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and land area of {{convert|168.93|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} with a population density of 1,367 per km<sup>2</sup> (3,540 per square mile). It merged with [[Ten Boer]] and [[Haren, Groningen|Haren]] municipalities in 1 January 2019. The [[Groningen-Assen metropolitan area]] has about half a million inhabitants. Groningen is an old city (more than 950 years) and was the regional power of the north of the Netherlands, a semi-independent city-state and member of the German [[Hanseatic League]]. Groningen is a university city, with an estimated 31,000 students at the [[University of Groningen]] (1 October 2018), and an estimated 28,000 at the [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen|Hanze University of Applied Sciences]] (1 October 2018).\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded at the northernmost point of the ''[[Hondsrug]]'' area. The oldest document referring to Groningen's existence dates from 1040. However, the city already existed long before then: the oldest archaeological traces found are believed to stem from the years 3950\u20133720 BC, although the first major settlement in Groningen has been traced back to the 3rd century AD.\n\nIn the 13th century, when Groningen was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a [[city wall]] to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its [[dialect]] a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of [[Friesland]] was administered from Groningen. During these years, the ''[[Martinitoren]]'', then {{convert|127|m|abbr=off}} tall, was built; it loomed over the city. The city's independence ended in 1536, when it chose to accept [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the Habsburg ruler of the other Netherlands, as its overlord.\n\n[[File:Groningen 1565.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Groningen in the 16th century]]\nIn 1594, Groningen, until then held by Spain, [[Siege of Groningen (1594)|was captured]] by a Dutch and English force led by [[Maurice of Nassau]]. Soon afterwards the city and the province joined the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]].\n\nIn 1614, the [[University of Groningen]] was founded, initially only for [[Theology#Theology as an academic discipline|religious education]]. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That same city wall was tested during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1672, when the city was [[Siege of Groningen|attacked fiercely]] by the bishop of [[Bishopric of M\u00fcnster|M\u00fcnster]], [[Bernhard von Galen]]. The city walls resisted, an event that is still celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as \"''[[:nl:Gronings Ontzet|Gronings Ontzet]]''\" or \"''Bommen Berend''\").\n[[File:Groningen-7.jpg|alt=|thumb|280px|Der Aa Church and the Canal (2018)]]\nThe city did not escape the devastation of [[World War II]]. In particular, the main square, the Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945 in the [[Battle of Groningen]]. However, the ''Martinitoren'', its church, the ''[[Goudkantoor]]'', and the city hall were not damaged. The battle lasted several days.\n\n==Geography==\n===Climate===\nGroningen has an oceanic temperate climate, like all of the Netherlands, although slightly colder in winter than other major cities in the Netherlands due to its northeasterly position. Weather is influenced by the North Sea to the north-west and its prevailing north-western winds and gales.\n\nSummers are somewhat warm and humid. Temperatures of {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or higher occur sporadically; the average daytime high is around {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Very rainy periods are common, especially in spring and summer. Average annual precipitation is about {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Annual sunshine hours vary, but are usually below 1600&nbsp;hours, giving much cloud cover similar to most of the Netherlands.  Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.  The [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is \"[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]\". (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=592559&cityname=Groningen%2C+Groningen%2C+Netherlands&units= Climate Summary for Groningen]</ref>\n\nWinters are cool: on average above freezing, although frosts are common during spells of easterly wind from Germany, Russia and even Siberia. Night-time temperatures of {{convert|-10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or lower are not uncommon during cold winter periods. The lowest temperature ever recorded is {{convert|-26.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}} on 16 February 1956. Snow often falls, but rarely stays long due to warmer daytime temperatures, although white snowy days happen every winter. \n{{Groningen weatherbox}}\n\n== Population growth ==\n[[File:Martini2.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Martinitoren|Martini Tower]]]]\n[[File:Eyecatcher (23907089).jpeg|thumb|280px|High Rise Office of ministry of Education]]\nThe municipality of Groningen has grown rapidly.

The [[Suiker Unie]] plant was originally outside Groningen, but it was completely swallowed by the expansion of the city. After a campaign to close the factory, it was finally shut down in 2008/2009. Before closing down, its sugar production amounted to 250,000 [[tonnes]] of [[beet sugar]], with 250 employees (2005 figures). The only remaining sugar factory is ''CSM Vierverlaten'' in [[Hoogkerk]], which produces 235,000&nbsp;tonnes of beet sugar, with 283 employees.\n\nWell known companies from Groningen are publishing company [[Noordhoff Uitgevers]], tobacco company [[Royal Theodorus Niemeyer]], health insurance company Menzis, distillery [[Hooghoudt distillery|Hooghoudt]], and natural gas companies GasUnie and [[GasTerra]].

Several caf\u00e9s feature live music, a few of which specialize in jazz music, including ''Jazzcafe De Spieghel'' on the Peperstraat. The jazz music students from the [[Prince Claus Conservatoire]] have been known to hold regular jam sessions in caf\u00e9s such as ''Peter Pan'' on the ''Voor Het Voormalige Klein Poortje'' and ''caf\u00e9 De Smederij'' on the Tuinstraat 2\u20134. Groningen is also the host city for [[Eurosonic Noorderslag]], an annual music showcase event for over a hundred bands from all over Europe.\n\n===Nightlife===\nGroningen's nightlife depends largely on its student population. Its cultural scene is vibrant and remarkable for a city its size. In particular, the Grote Markt, the Vismarkt, the Poelestraat and Peperstraat are crowded every night of the week, and most bars do not close until 5 in the morning.

A large network of bike paths makes it convenient to cycle to various destinations. In 2000, Groningen was chosen as ''[[Cycling in the Netherlands|Fietsstad 2002]]'' \u2014 top BikeCity of the Netherlands for 2002.\n\nThe city is very much adapted to the wishes of those who want to get around without a car, as it has an extensive network of segregated cycle-paths, good public transport, and a large pedestrianised zone in the city centre. The transformation of the historic centre into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking. This is achieved by applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|\"filtered permeability\"]]. It means that the network configuration favours [[active transportation]] and selectively \"filters out\" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces, increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image). The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts \u2013 the [[fused grid]].\n\n===Public transport===\n====Train's<ref>https://nieuws.ns.nl/spoorkaart-2020-hier-te-downloaden/</ref>====\n[[File:20080430_Hoofdstation_Groningen_NL.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Groningen_railway_station|Railway station ]] Groningen (2008)]]\nThe Station of [[Groningen railway station|Groningen]] or Hoofdstation as the locals call it, has regular services to most of the major cities in the Netherlands.

Between 1982 and 1986, the wreck was excavated by an Oxford University team led by Bound.&nbsp; Fine wares from the site consisted mainly of Corinthian, Laconian, Ionian and Etruscan fabrics representing a range of shapes.&nbsp; Some were painted with human figures, animals, florals and mythological motifs.&nbsp; The storage jars (amphorae) were of Etruscan, Samian, East Greek and Punic-Phoenician origin; some contained pitch, olives and olive oil.&nbsp; Other finds included amber, lamps, arrowheads, parts of helmets, copper nuggets, iron bars, gaming, bones, musical pipes, a wooden writing plaque, callipers, lead and copper ingots. &nbsp; Surviving ship's timber displayed \u2018sewn\u2019 joinery techniques.&nbsp; In 1961 an intact bronze helmet decorated with etched boars and snakes was found on the wreck by a sports diver and taken to Germany; its whereabouts are currently unknown. The entire top floor of the national underwater museum at Porto Santo Stefano is dedicated to the finds from the Giglio ship.\n\n<u>The rescue excavation of the Hoi An Wreck</u>\n\nThe Hoi An wreck was a mid-15<sup>th</sup> century junk that was lost in the South China Sea, 22 kilometres to the west of the Da Nang headland, with a cargo of Vietnamese porcelain that had been made at Cu Dao on the Red River Delta.&nbsp; The wreck was discovered by fishermen around the early 1990s.&nbsp; For several years the site was intensively plundered resulting in pieces turning up on the market all over the world.&nbsp; The method employed by the looters was to drag a series of hooks across the site with nets behind the catch to dislodge artefacts.\n\nThe wreck was discovered by the Vietnamese Authorities following the arrest of two dealers at Da Nang airport who had in their possession suitcases full of pottery from the site. The problem was that the wreck was beyond standard diving depth, but something had to be done quickly to prevent further looting.&nbsp; Bound's maritime archaeology unit at Oxford University was contracted to conduct &nbsp;a rescue excavation of the wreck, with York Archaeological Trust providing conservation services.&nbsp; Over three seasons the team excavated a third of a million pieces of pottery, far more than expected and enough to fill two large warehouses.&nbsp; Most of the pottery was repetitive everyday table ware of little artistic value but there were also items of outstanding artistry.&nbsp; An \u2018Evaluation Committee\u2019 of leading Vietnamese archaeologists and art historians selected all the most important pieces for the National Collection in Hanoi and then other museums were invited to select what they wished.&nbsp; Six museums in Vietnam now host permanent exhibitions of material from the wreck. What was left was put on the market with part of the proceeds being used to pay for the display, curation and study of the selection that went into the National Collection.\n\nThe Hoi An excavation (1997\u201399) was the deepest hands-on excavation there has been.&nbsp; Involving three large vessels, three deep-ocean tugs, two gun-boats for protection and over 150 people, this was also the most expensive excavation there has been.\n\nDiving was a 24-hour operation working at a maximum dive-table depth of 82 meters. Saturation diving techniques were employed in which divers lived in pressurized modules on the deck and were transported to and from the site in a dive-bell. This is the only time that this advanced method of diving has been used in underwater archaeology. Bound considers this to have been the most important project of his career, however, it is known that following the excavation, looting of the site resumed.\n\n<u>Lord Nelson's ''Agamemnon''</u>\n\nIn 1997 Bound led a survey of the frigate HMS ''Agamemnon'' (built 1781).&nbsp; This was Nelson's first major command, the ship upon which he first fought the French and which, in 1805, was part of his column at Trafalgar. It was also the ship upon which he first met Lady Hamilton.&nbsp; In 1809, the ship was lost in Maldonado Bay near the mouth of the River Plate.&nbsp; The main result of the survey was the discovery of a cannon which, because of the number on its breach, was confirmed by the Woolwich Arsenal to be the only cannon in existence that can be proven to have been fired in the Battle of Trafalgar. The cannon was conserved in the Uruguayan Navy Yard and is now on display in the Maritime Museum of Montevideo.\n\n<u>Pocket Battleship ''Admiral Graf Spee''</u> In 1997 Bound conducted the first archaeological survey of the \u2018pocket\u2019 battleship ''Admiral Graf Spee'' which blew herself up not far from Montevideo following the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939.  The wreck was found by dragging an anchor through the water.  A sidescan survey showed that the wreck was upright but heeled to starboard and that she was in two parts, the separation occurring where the after turret had exploded during scuttling operations.  Following the survey, Bound was given permission by the Uruguayan Navy and Ministry of Culture to recover one of the 5.9-inch guns which is now on display outside the maritime museum in Montevideo.  Bound was also part of the small team which in subsequent years, under the leadership of H. Bado and A. Etchegaray, recovered the range finder (now on display in the port of Montevideo) and the bronze stern eagle (now in storage in the Cerro Museum, Montevideo)<ref>{{cite web |title=Graf Spee rangefinder recovered |url=https://en.mercopress.com/2004/02/26/graf-spee-range-finder-recovered |website=Mercopress |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\n== Documentaries ==\nBound's work has been the focus of many documentaries in England, Italy and the US, including an award-winning, four-part series entitled ''Lost Ships'' by the [[Discovery Channel]], which covered the ''Agamemnon'', the Hoi An wreck, the ''Graf Spee'' and the Mahdia ship. The [[BBC]] has made several documentaries on Bound's work including ''Queen Elizabeth's Lost Guns'', about the recovery, replication and test-firing of an Elizabethan iron cannon from the Alderney wreck<ref name=\"timewatchlostguns\" />.

His great grandfather, William Biggs, was the first to raise the Union Jack when the settlement was moved to Jackson's Harbour (now Port Stanley) in 1843-44.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Strange |first1=Ian J |title=The Falkland Islands |date=26 January 1984 |publisher=David & Charles |isbn=978-0715385319}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Biggs |first1=James |title=The Dictionary of Falklands Biography |date=1 June 2008 |publisher=David Tatham |isbn=978-0955898501 |url=https://falklandsbiographies.org/biographies/biggs_james}}</ref> \nBound's early education was in the Falkland Islands and Montevideo, Uruguay. After high school, he worked at sea on the steam ship ''Darwin.'' In 1972, he received a scholarship from the Leopold Schepp Foundation to attend [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]], from where he graduated ''[[Summa Cum Laude]]'' in Ancient History. Whilst undertaking a further degree in Classical Art and Archaeology at [[Rutgers University]], he was a research assistant in Greek Pottery at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.  In 1976 he was awarded a Commonwealth scholarship to [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], Oxford University, to study classical archaeology. In 1985, he was given a Junior Research Fellowship at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College]], Oxford University. At the same time, under the Chairmanship of [[Alan Bullock]], he was appointed Director of Oxford University MARE<ref name=\"DragonSea\" />, the first academic maritime archaeological unit in England. In 1994, he became the Triton Fellow in Maritime Archaeology at [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St. Peter's College]], Oxford. He retired from academic life in 2013 to pursue his interest in deep-ocean archaeology.\n\n== Early archaeological experience ==\nBound's student experience as an archaeologist was on land, where he worked on Roman villa sites outside Rome and various sites in the English Midlands. Bound's underwater archaeological career began in 1979 when he worked for [[George Bass (archaeologist)|George Bass]] of the [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]] in Texas on sites off the coast of Turkey. This was followed by the [[Madrague de Giens (shipwreck)|''Madrague de Giens'']] shipwreck off the South of France and the ''[[Mary Rose]]'' in England<ref name=\"seahistorymare\">{{cite news |last1=Dingemans |first1=Timothy G |title=Oxford's Nautical Archaeology Team: The First Ten Years of MARE |url=https://issuu.com/seahistory/docs/sh_057_spring-1991/22 |accessdate=29 March 2020 |issue=Spring 1991 |publisher=Sea History |pages=22-24}}</ref>.\n\n== Principal excavations and surveys ==\nThe following are some of the surveys and excavations directed by Bound:\n\n# The Giglio wreck. 1981\u201386.

Bound was also the first in maritime archaeology to use ROVs (Giglio excavation) and mixed gas techniques (nitrox during the Giglio excavation and surface-demand heliox systems on later projects). \n\n<u>The Giglio Ship</u>\n\nIn 1961, a diver named Reg Vallintine, who had a dive school on the Island of Giglio off Tuscany, discovered a wreck from 600 BC in 50 meters of water beside a reef in Campese Bay. Between 1982 and 1986, the wreck was excavated by an Oxford University team led by Bound.&nbsp; Fine wares from the site consisted mainly of Corinthian, Laconian, Ionian and Etruscan fabrics representing a range of shapes.&nbsp; Some were painted with human figures, animals, florals and mythological motifs.&nbsp; The storage jars (amphorae) were of Etruscan, Samian, East Greek and Punic-Phoenician origin; some contained pitch, olives and olive oil.&nbsp; Other finds included amber, lamps, arrowheads, parts of helmets, copper nuggets, iron bars, gaming, bones, musical pipes, a wooden writing plaque, callipers, lead and copper ingots. &nbsp; Surviving ship's timber displayed \u2018sewn\u2019 joinery techniques.&nbsp; In 1961 an intact bronze helmet decorated with etched boars and snakes was found on the wreck by a sports diver and taken to Germany; its whereabouts are currently unknown. The entire top floor of the national underwater museum at Porto Santo Stefano is dedicated to the finds from the Giglio ship.\n\n<u>The rescue excavation of the Hoi An Wreck</u>\n\nThe Hoi An wreck was a mid-15<sup>th</sup> century junk that was lost in the South China Sea, 22 kilometres to the west of the Da Nang headland, with a cargo of Vietnamese porcelain that had been made at Cu Dao on the Red River Delta.&nbsp; The wreck was discovered by fishermen around the early 1990s.&nbsp; For several years the site was intensively plundered resulting in pieces turning up on the market all over the world.&nbsp; The method employed by the looters was to drag a series of hooks across the site with nets behind the catch to dislodge artefacts.\n\nThe wreck was discovered by the Vietnamese Authorities following the arrest of two dealers at Da Nang airport who had in their possession suitcases full of pottery from the site. The problem was that the wreck was beyond standard diving depth, but something had to be done quickly to prevent further looting.&nbsp; Bound's maritime archaeology unit at Oxford University was contracted to conduct &nbsp;a rescue excavation of the wreck, with York Archaeological Trust providing conservation services.&nbsp; Over three seasons the team excavated a third of a million pieces of pottery, far more than expected and enough to fill two large warehouses.&nbsp; Most of the pottery was repetitive everyday table ware of little artistic value but there were also items of outstanding artistry.&nbsp; An \u2018Evaluation Committee\u2019 of leading Vietnamese archaeologists and art historians selected all the most important pieces for the National Collection in Hanoi and then other museums were invited to select what they wished.&nbsp; Six museums in Vietnam now host permanent exhibitions of material from the wreck. What was left was put on the market with part of the proceeds being used to pay for the display, curation and study of the selection that went into the National Collection.\n\nThe Hoi An excavation (1997\u201399) was the deepest hands-on excavation there has been.&nbsp; Involving three large vessels, three deep-ocean tugs, two gun-boats for protection and over 150 people, this was also the most expensive excavation there has been.\n\nDiving was a 24-hour operation working at a maximum dive-table depth of 82 meters. Saturation diving techniques were employed in which divers lived in pressurized modules on the deck and were transported to and from the site in a dive-bell. This is the only time that this advanced method of diving has been used in underwater archaeology. Bound considers this to have been the most important project of his career, however, it is known that following the excavation, looting of the site resumed.\n\n<u>Lord Nelson's ''Agamemnon''</u>\n\nIn 1997 Bound led a survey of the frigate HMS ''Agamemnon'' (built 1781).&nbsp; This was Nelson's first major command, the ship upon which he first fought the French and which, in 1805, was part of his column at Trafalgar. It was also the ship upon which he first met Lady Hamilton.&nbsp; In 1809, the ship was lost in Maldonado Bay near the mouth of the River Plate.&nbsp; The main result of the survey was the discovery of a cannon which, because of the number on its breach, was confirmed by the Woolwich Arsenal to be the only cannon in existence that can be proven to have been fired in the Battle of Trafalgar. The cannon was conserved in the Uruguayan Navy Yard and is now on display in the Maritime Museum of Montevideo.\n\n<u>Pocket Battleship ''Admiral Graf Spee''</u> In 1997 Bound conducted the first archaeological survey of the \u2018pocket\u2019 battleship ''Admiral Graf Spee'' which blew herself up not far from Montevideo following the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939.  The wreck was found by dragging an anchor through the water.  A sidescan survey showed that the wreck was upright but heeled to starboard and that she was in two parts, the separation occurring where the after turret had exploded during scuttling operations.  Following the survey, Bound was given permission by the Uruguayan Navy and Ministry of Culture to recover one of the 5.9-inch guns which is now on display outside the maritime museum in Montevideo.  Bound was also part of the small team which in subsequent years, under the leadership of H. Bado and A. Etchegaray, recovered the range finder (now on display in the port of Montevideo) and the bronze stern eagle (now in storage in the Cerro Museum, Montevideo)<ref>{{cite web |title=Graf Spee rangefinder recovered |url=https://en.mercopress.com/2004/02/26/graf-spee-range-finder-recovered |website=Mercopress |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\n== Documentaries ==\nBound's work has been the focus of many documentaries in England, Italy and the US, including an award-winning, four-part series entitled ''Lost Ships'' by the [[Discovery Channel]], which covered the ''Agamemnon'', the Hoi An wreck, the ''Graf Spee'' and the Mahdia ship. The [[BBC]] has made several documentaries on Bound's work including ''Queen Elizabeth's Lost Guns'', about the recovery, replication and test-firing of an Elizabethan iron cannon from the Alderney wreck<ref name=\"timewatchlostguns\" />.
