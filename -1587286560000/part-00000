[[Lithography]] of 1836.]]\nIn his famous ''Instruction'' (also known as ''The Testament'') to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the [[Cumans|Polovtsi]]. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin [[Oleg of Chernigov|Oleg]], but after Volodymyr was sent by his father to rule [[Chernigov]] and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company. Since that time, Volodymyr and Oleg were bitter enemies who would often engage in internecine wars. The enmity continued among their children and more distant posterity.\n\nFrom 1094, his chief patrimony was the southern town of [[Pereiaslav|Pereyaslav]], although he also controlled [[Rostov]], [[Suzdal]], and other northern provinces (see [[Principality of Pereyaslavl]]). In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], the future capital of Russia. In order to unite the princes of [[Ancient Rus'|Rus']] in their struggle against the Great Steppe, Volodymyr initiated three princely [[congress]]es, the most important being held at [[Lyubech]] in 1097 and [[Dolobsk]] in 1103.\n\nIn 1107 he defeated [[Boniak]], a [[Cuman]] [[Khan (title)|khan]] who led an invasion on [[Kievan Rus']]. When [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II]] died in 1113, the [[Kiev]]an populace revolted and summoned Volodymyr to the capital. The same year he entered Kyiv to the great delight of the crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125. As may be seen from his ''Instruction'', he promulgated a number of reforms in order to allay the social tensions in the capital. These years saw the last flowering of [[Ancient Rus]], which was torn apart 10 years after his death.\n\nVolodymyr Monomakh is buried in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Kyiv]]. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the [[golden age]] of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from [[Constantinople]] to Rus of such precious [[relic]]s as the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] and the Volodymyr/Muscovite crown called [[Monomakh's Cap]].\n\n== Marriages and children ==\nVolodymyr married three times. Some sources cite his first wife as [[Gytha of Wessex]], daughter of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold of England]] who had fallen at [[Battle of Hastings|Hastings]] in 1066 and of [[Edith Swannesha]]. Problems exist in that none of the sources citing this are contemporary, and none of the Russian sources cite the name of his first wife as the daughter of Harold Godwinson. They had at least five children:\n\n* [[Mstislav I of Kiev]] (1 June 1076 \u2013 14 April 1132)\n* Izyaslav Volodymyrovych, [[Prince of Kursk]] (c. 1077 \u2013 6 September 1096)\n* Svyatoslav Volodymyrovych, [[Prince of Smolensk]] and [[Pereyaslav]] (c. 1080 \u2013 16 March 1114)\n* [[Yaropolk II of Kiev]] (1082 \u2013 18 February 1139)\n* [[Viacheslav I of Kiev]] (1083 \u2013 2 February 1154)\n\nThe following daughter has been attributed to either the first or the second wife:\n* Marina Volodymyrivna (d. 1146). Married [[Leon Diogenes]], a pretender to the throne of the [[Byzantine Empire]] who claimed to be a son of [[Romanos IV]] and who rose to the rank of khan of the [[Cumans]] in [[Ossetia]].\n\n[[Image:\u041e\u0442\u0434\u044b\u0445 \u0412.\u041c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044b.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monomakh rests after hunting (painting by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], c. 1900).]]\n\nVolodymyr's second wife, Eufimia, is considered to have been a Byzantine noblewoman.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1989|pp=416\u2014417}}  The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' and the \"Testament of Volodymyr Monomakh\" record her date of death as 7 May 1107. However the ''Chronicle'' does not mention her name. This marriage produced at least six children:\n* [[Roman Vladimirovich|Roman]], Prince of [[List of rulers of Halych and Volhynia|Volhynia]] (d. 6 January 1119)\n* [[Eufemia of Kiev]] (d. 4 April 1139). Married [[Coloman of Hungary]].\n* Agafia (Agatha). Married Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of [[Hrodna|Gorodno]]. According to older historians her husband was a son of [[David Igorevich]], Prince of [[List of rulers of Halych and Volhynia|Volhynia]] (d. 1113), but this theory was rejected.<ref>Oleg \u0141atyszonek, ''Wczesno\u015bredniowieczne ksi\u0119stwo grodzie\u0144skie w historiografii ostatniego dwudziestolecia'', p. 10.</ref>\n* [[Yuri Dolgoruki|Yuri]] (George), later known as Yuri Dolgoruki (d. 15 May 1157).\n* [[Andrey Vladimirovich|Andrew]], Prince of [[List of rulers of Halych and Volhynia|Volhynia]] (11 July 1102 \u2013 1141).\n\nVolodymyr's third marriage is thought to have been to a daughter of Aepa Ocenevich, Khan of the [[Cumans]]. Her paternal grandfather was Osen. Her people belonged to the [[Kipchaks]], a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] origin.\n\nHowever the ''Primary Chronicle'' identifies Aepa as father-in-law to Yuri Dolgoruki, with Volodymyr negotiating the marriage in name of his son.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Whether father and son married sisters or the identity of intended groom was misidentified

In doing so he created a formal overarching structure for the Habsburg Monarchy, which had functioned as a [[composite monarchy]] for about 300 years.

The Kingdom of Hungary had always been considered a separate realm, the country's status was affirmed by Article X, which was added to Hungary's constitution in 1790 during the phase of the composite monarchy; it described the state as a ''Regnum Independens''. Hungary's affairs continued to be administered by its own institutions (King and Diet) as they had been previously. Thus, under the new arrangements, no imperial institutions were involved in its internal government.<ref>{{Citation|last=Laszlo|first=P\u00e9ter|title=Hungary's Long Nineteenth Century: Constitutional and Democratic Traditions |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |location=Leiden, Netherlands |year=2011|page=6 }}</ref> From the perspective of the Court since 1723, ''regnum Hungariae'' had been a hereditary province of the dynasty's three main branches on both lines. From the perspective of the ''orsz\u00e1g'' (the country), Hungary was ''regnum independens'', a separate Land as Article X of 1790 stipulated. In 1804 Emperor Franz assumed the title of Emperor of Austria for all the ''[[Erblande]]'' of the dynasty and for the other Lands, including Hungary. Thus Hungary formally became part of the Empire of Austria. The Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806. The Court reassured the diet, however, that the assumption of the monarch's new title (Emperor of Austria) did not in any sense affect the laws and the constitution of Hungary.<ref>\"Vor dem Jahr 1848 is[t] das Kaisertum \u00d6sterreich verfassungsrechtlich als ein monarchischer Einheitsstaat auf differenziert f\u00f6deralistischer Grundlage zu sehen, wobei die besondere Stel[l]ung Ungarns im Rahmen dieses Gesamtstaates stets offenkundig war.

Austria also lost much of its remaining claims and influence in [[Italy]], which had been its chief foreign policy interest.\n\nAfter a period of [[German Question|Greater German ambitions]], when Austria tried to establish itself as the leading German power, Austria again needed to redefine itself to maintain unity in the face of nationalism.<ref name=\"two\">Seton-Watson, R.

The Habsburgs and part of the Hungarian political elite arranged the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The Compromise was arranged and legitimated by a very small part of the Hungarian society (suffrage was very limited: less than 8% of the population had voting rights), and was seen by a very large part of the population as betrayal of the Hungarian cause and the heritage of the 1848\u201349 War of Independence. This caused deep and lasting cracks in Hungarian society.<ref>CIEGER Andr\u00e1s: [http://c3.hu/scripta/szazadveg/14/cieger.htm Korm\u00e1ny a m\u00e9rlegen - a m\u00falt sz\u00e1zadban].</ref>\n\nHungarian statesman [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]] is considered the intellectual force behind the Compromise. De\u00e1k initially wanted independence for Hungary and supported the 1848 Revolution, but he broke with hardline nationalists and advocated a modified union under the Habsburgs. De\u00e1k believed that while Hungary had the right to full internal independence, the terms of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1723]] made questions of defence and foreign affairs \"common\" to both Austria and Hungary. He also felt that Hungary benefited from continued union with wealthier, more industrialized Austria and that the Compromise would end the continual pressures on Austria to choose between the Magyars and the Slavs of the Kingdom of Hungary.<ref name= \"five\">{{cite journal | last1 = Tihany | first1 = Leslie C | year = 1969 | title = The Austro-Hungarian Compromise, 1867\u20131918: A Half Century of Diagnosis; Fifty Years of Post-Mortem | url = | journal = Central European History | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 114\u201338 | doi=10.1017/s0008938900000169}}</ref>  Imperial Chancellor [[Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust|Beust]] quickly negotiated the Compromise with the Hungarian leaders.<ref>{{Citation|last=Albertini|first=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914, Volume I|publisher= Oxford University Press |year=1952|page=4}}</ref> Beust was particularly eager to renew the conflict with Prussia and thought a quick settlement with Hungary would make that possible.<ref>\"Impatient to take his revenge on Bismarck for Sadowa, he persuaded Franz Joseph to accept the Magyar demands that he had until then rejected. ...

The members of the delegates from the two parliaments had no right to give speeches, to debate or introduce new ideas during the meetings, thus they were nothing more than the extended arms of their own parliaments. The only function of the delegates was to transfer the votes according to the previously made decisions of their political fractions from the Austrian and the Hungarian parliaments.

The ethnic minorities had the key role in the political maintenance of the compromise in Hungary, because they were able to vote the pro-compromise liberal parties into the position of the majority/ruling parties of the Hungarian parliament. The pro-compromise liberal parties were the most popular among ethnic minority voters, however i.e. the Slovak, Serb and Romanian minority parties remained unpopular among their own ethnic minority voters. The coalitions of Hungarian nationalist parties \u2013 which were supported by the overwhelming majority of ethnic Hungarian voters \u2013 always remained in the opposition, with the exception of the 1906\u20131910 period, where the Hungarian-supported nationalist parties were able to form a government.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Ger\u0151 (2014).

In 1804 Emperor Franz assumed the title of Emperor of Austria for all the ''[[Erblande]]'' of the dynasty and for the other Lands, including Hungary. Thus Hungary formally became part of the Empire of Austria. The Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806.

The ethnic minorities had the key role in the political maintenance of the compromise in Hungary, because they were able to vote the pro-compromise liberal parties into the position of the majority/ruling parties of the Hungarian parliament. The pro-compromise liberal parties were the most popular among ethnic minority voters, however i.e. the Slovak, Serb and Romanian minority parties remained unpopular among their own ethnic minority voters. The coalitions of Hungarian nationalist parties \u2013 which were supported by the overwhelming majority of ethnic Hungarian voters \u2013 always remained in the opposition, with the exception of the 1906\u20131910 period, where the Hungarian-supported nationalist parties were able to form a government.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Ger\u0151 (2014).

The majority of Hungarians felt they had accepted the Compromise only under coercion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The Austrian Emperor, separately crowned King of Hungary, had to swear in his coronation oath not to revise or diminish the historic imperial (Hungarian) domains of the Hungarian nobility, magnates, and upper classes.

Ultimately, although the Compromise hoped to fix the problems faced by a multi-national state while maintaining the benefits of a large state, the new system still faced the same internal pressures as the old.
