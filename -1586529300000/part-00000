A young man named Ryo and his tiger White Blaze mysteriously appears in the street, nearly causing a young boy named Ully to be injured while skateboarding. Mia and her grandfather believe that Ryo is one of the Ronin Warriors and that there is perhaps hope for the world. Mia rushes off to meet Ryo, but he is surrounded by police. Meanwhile, the storm clouds move in and all power cuts out, leaving cars stranded and causing a helicopter to crash. As glass shatters all over the city from a massive lightning strike, everyone but Ryo runs in fear and Ully gets separated from his parents.  Ryo calls out for the Dynasty to fight him and a Dynasty soldier shows up and the two battle. Ryo battles the soldier with the aid of White Blaze, which proves difficult, and Ully, who comes across the battle, is nearly killed before Mia saves him.  Ryo and White Blaze are defeated and Ryo is about to be killed when another Ronin Warrior, Rowen, protects him. The other Ronin Warriors, Cye, Sage and Kento also arrive to fight.  The Warriors summon their full armor and fight the soldier, but don't work as a team and are therefore unable to defeat him. He takes Ully and Mia hostage, trapping them in a television screen where they feel every injury he receives.  The soldier beats up Ryo until he calls up his ultimate attack, \"Flare Up Now\", destroying the soldier and accidentally blasting the building behind him in half. Mia and Ully are set free and the Dark Warlords and Talpa, the leaders of the Dynasty introduce themselves, sure in their victory over the Ronin Warriors, whom they see as weak, while a giant castle appears in the sky.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Glory for Anubis\n| TranslitTitle       = Onimash\u014d!

The military tries to launch an attack on Talpa's castle to no avail as the Dynasty turns their own weapons against them and obliterates the attacking force.  Anubis finds the Warriors, Mia and Ully hiding in the subway and attacks.  The Warriors use their armor to form the Circle of Power to protect Mia and Ully, but without their armors, they are no match for Anubis and he ties them up with his Quake With Fear attack.  The Ronins are unable to dissolve the circle and call upon their armors, but the Ancient One appears and uses his staff to dissolve it himself.  The Ronins summon their armor and Ryo and Anubis launch their most powerful attacks against each other at the same time.  One of Ryo's swords gets knocked from his hand and he passes out, but Anubis is injured too.  Realizing that the Circle of Power is unbroken and that he cannot allow the Ronins to face him, Talpa sends a tornado of dark energy that picks up the Warriors and scatters them to the most desolate regions on Earth.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = Secret of Wildfire\n| TranslitTitle       = Yoroi Gia, Rekka no Himitsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u93a7\u64ec\u4e9c\u3001\u70c8\u706b\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|5|14}}\n| AltDate             = June 28, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Mia and Ully find the sword Ryo dropped and are taken by White Blaze towards the volcano where Talpa dropped him.  Ryo awakens and starts climbing out while Talpa sends Anubis to destroy him for good.  Anubis and a bunch of Dynasty soldiers chase down Mia and Ully, believing that the two will lead them to Ryo, but they are saved by the Ancient One who uses his staff to open a giant chasm, taking out the Dynasty soldiers, though Anubis emerges unharmed.  The staff also restores power to the city and finding Mia's abandoned jeep working now, Mia and Ully head off again to find Ryo.  Ryo climbs out of the volcano, but is attacked by Anubis.  White Blaze returns his missing sword, but Anubis knocks him back into the volcano again.  However, Ryo's power is increased and he emerges as more than a match for Anubis.  Anubis captures Mia and Ully and Ryo is unable to approach them as his armor is hot enough to incinerate them.  Anubis casts them into the volcano to force Ryo to get rid of his armor to rescue them then prevents him from re-summoning it and beats him up and tosses him in the volcano again, but Ryo manages to pull Anubis in with him.  Both manage to get to safety in the volcano which starts to erupt.  Ryo calls upon his armor again and destroys Anubis' weapons as the volcano erupts and knocks Anubis into the eruption, but Anubis survives and is yelled at by Talpa for his failure.  Mia, Ully, Ryo and White Blaze vow to find the remaining Warriors who they believe are still alive and Ryo accepts that they need to work as a team to defeat the Dynasty.  This pleases the Ancient One who is watching from nearby.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = The Search Begins\n| TranslitTitle       = Dokumash\u014d Naaza no Wana\n| NativeTitle         = \u6bd2\u9b54\u5c06 \u90a3\u5516\u632b\u306e\u7f60\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|5|21}}\n| AltDate             = June 29, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = With Anubis having failed, Talpa sends Sekhmet after the Ronin Warriors.  It is also shown that Talpa has captured the people of the city.  At the suggestion of Mia, she, Ryo, Ully and White Blaze head to the university where her grandfather works to get his help in finding the other Ronin Warriors.  On the way, the group stops by Ully's house to try to find his parents, but have no luck, so Ully vows he will help the Warriors defeat Talpa and save the world.  At the university, the group tries to enlist the help of Mia's grandfather, but he refuses to help, telling them to just give up.  Ully realizes that two suits of armor are two disguised Dynasty soldiers that attack.  Ryo, with help from White Blaze and Ully, defeats the soldiers, but Dr. Koji is possessed by a Dynasty spirit and attacks too.  Ryo manages to free Dr. Koji, but he has been poisoned by the Dynasty and dies, but not before revealing that the Warriors have been returned to the places where their armor was created.  Mia tries to find the answer in his computer while Sekhmet watches nearby, planning to follow them and attack once they find their comrades.  However, White Blaze detects the Dark Warlord and attacks him.  Ryo notices the fight and joins in, but is unable to defeat Sekhmet.  Finally Mia realizes that her grandfather was referring to a poem he used to teach her and finds it on the computer before the university is destroyed.  Ully notices that Sekhmet doesn't have six arms like it appears, he's just moving his arms really fast and informs Ryo who uses the information to defeat him.  Following the information found in the riddle, the group then heads to the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles with Sekhmet following them, unknown to them.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Halo's Prison\n| TranslitTitle       = Fukkatsu!

Ryo battles a bunch of Dynasty soldiers and summons his armor to defeat them, while White Blaze takes out two enemy archers.  However, as Ryo heads underwater to find Cye, something goes wrong with his armor and Sekhmet attacks.  It turns out Ryo's armor is being affected by Sekhmet's poison amplified by the water and he is defeated.  Sekhmet heads to finish Cye off before he can awaken, but is attacked by fish and a whale.  He kills all of them, but it allows Ryo's swords to wake Cye.  Cye blasts Sekhmet and rescues Ryo before returning to the water to continue the battle.  As in the water Cye is immune to his poison, Sekhmet brings them to a bridge nearby and beats up Cye.  Ully and White Blaze revive Ryo by dragging him into a fire and he steps in to help Cye.  Combining Cye's Super Wave Smasher and Ryo's Flare Up Now, they defeat Sekhmet which Talpa is not pleased with.

After they are forced to abandon Mia's jeep, Sage heads off on his own and orders Mia to return to the city, but she refuses and follows him.  A snowstorm starts and Mia is attacked by a pack of wild wolves, but is saved by Sage.  Cale tries to take them out with an avalanche, but they jump out of the way and the wolves are swept away by the avalanche.  Knowing it is too dangerous for Mia to leave if Talpa or his Warlords caused that, Sage allows Mia to come with him and they head to a giant rock called The Throne of the Gods.  Mia believes that this is what the line of the poem \"burning within a throne of rock\" meant when it referred to Kento's location.  Cale attacks the two and Sage tries to break the rock with his Thunder Bolt Cut, but does no damage to it.  Cale thrusts his sword into the rock and it will seek out Kento's heart and kill him before he wakes.  Sage and Cale battle, but Sage is unable to defeat him and he and Mia fall over a cliff next a waterfall.  The two fall into a cave and as they lay unconscious, the Ancient One appears and tells Sage that he needs to unlock the full power of his armor by achieving concentration of both mind and body then disappears before Sage wakes up.  Mia decides to distract Cale while Sage rescues Kento and upon reaching a cliff-top, calls Cale out.  He doesn't appear, but she notices the Ancient One and remembers how he dissolved the Circle of Power and gave the Ronins back their armor and saved her and Sage from drowning and wonders why he just doesn't save Kento himself.  As he walks away, Mia calls after him and follows, but he disappears as the snow starts up again.  Cale catches her and dangles her in a waterfall to draw the meditating Sage out.  When that fails, he freezes the waterfall, but Sage emerges and saves Mia.  With his full power unlocked, it restores life to the land and he successfully uses the Thunder Bolt Cut on the rock as the sword reaches Kento.  At first it appears as if Sage acted too late, but Kento bursts out of the rock and causes an explosion that blows Cale away.  With Kento rescued, the three head back to the city to reunite with the others and find Rowen.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Friend or Foe\n| TranslitTitle       = Genmash\u014d, Rajura no Sakuryaku\n| NativeTitle         = \u5e7b\u9b54\u5c06\u3001\u87ba\u546a\u7f85\u306e\u7b56\u7565\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|6|25}}\n| AltDate             = July 5, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Talpa sends Dais to destroy the Ronin Warriors before they can locate and rescue Rowen.  As they drive back to the city, Mia explains the poem to Sage and Kento, explaining that the last verse that will lead them to Rowen is \"floating amongst the eyes of the ages, unmoored in the stream of the sky,\" but she has no idea what this means.  At a temple, Ryo, Cye, Ully and White Blaze wait for the others, but Ully is captured by Dais.  Ryo and Cye battle him to save Ully and manage to free Ully, but he nearly falls to his death before White Blaze saves him.  Dais easily defeats Ryo and Cye and then claims that he holds Rowen captive and tells them to meet him in the city of Sandai to rescue him.  Ryo and Cye head off to find Rowen, leaving Ully and White Blaze behind to let the others know what happened.  At Sandai, Ryo and Cye find Rowen held captive by Dynasty soldiers.  The two armor up and destroy the soldiers and it is revealed that \"Rowen\" is actually an illusion and that it is really Dais.  Dais creates an illusion so that Ryo and Cye each believe that they are fighting Dais, but are really fighting each other.  The two use their ultimate attacks on each other, and knock each other out, realizing the truth just after they attack.  Dais prepares to finish them, but the others arrive and he decides to do the same to Sage and Kento.  Sage sees through the illusion and drops his weapon, but Kento doesn't and beats Sage up.  After the truth is revealed, Kento turns on Dais and uses his Iron Rock Crusher to drive him off.  While the group recovers from their wounds, Ryo sees a shooting star and realizes that \"unmoored in the stream of the sky\" means that Rowen is floating in outer space and Mia believes that he's right.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = Wildfire in the Sky\n| TranslitTitle       = Rekka, Tenk\u016b o Sukue\n| NativeTitle         = \u70c8\u706b\u3001\u5929\u7a7a\u3092\u3059\u304f\u3048\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|7|2}}\n| AltDate             = July 6, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Now that they know where Rowen is, the Warriors try to figure out how to get to him.  Not having a way to do so themselves, they realize that Talpa will try to destroy Rowen himself and they decide to try to find out what that method will be.  Mia proposes that two of the Warriors find out Talpa's plan while the other two return to the city.  When the Warriors get into an argument about who will go, Mia chooses Cye and Sage herself, but that night, Ryo, Kento and White Blaze sneak off to do the job themselves after telling Ully to tell Mia when she wakes up.  Talpa summons the Nether Spirits to deal with Rowen, explaining to the Warlords that the spirits can combine their powers together to create a massive supernatural construct called a Dark Matrix that will be able to destroy anything it's sent against.  Talpa plans to send it to destroy Rowen.  As Kento and Ryo approach the building where the Dark Matrix is, Talpa sends Dynasty soldiers to distract them.  Though they easily defeat them, the Dark Matrix is launched, but the Ancient One intervenes and destroys it.  Talpa calls upon the spirits again to form another one while sending Anubis to stop Ryo and Kento.  The two battle him, then, knowing they're running out of time, armor up and start climbing the building.  However, the energy from the Dark Matrix strikes Anubis and gives him even more power and then while he battles Ryo and Kento, causes their armor to start squeezing them to death.  The Dark Matrix starts to launch and Ryo, seeing his only chance to save Rowen, jumps on it to ride it into space, but is absorbed by the matrix.  Kento meets up with the others and informs them of what happened and they watch as the Dark Matrix launches into space.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = In the Sea of the Sky\n| TranslitTitle       = Sh\u016bketsu!

Talpa appears to the others and taunts them about the fact that Ryo and Rowen will soon be dead and sends his soldiers to face them.  Anubis asks for a fair fight against Ryo, claiming it won't be victory if the Warriors aren't defeated in a fair fight, but Talpa refuses to listen to him and plans to use the power of the Nether Realm to destroy the Warriors and sends Anubis away.  Inside the Dark Matrix, as Ryo is slowly crushed, he realizes that if he doesn't do something both he and Rowen will die.  Channeling the energy his armor is absorbing, Ryo launches Flare Up Now and destroys the Dark Matrix from within.  Seeing this from the ground, the other Warriors despair, but continue fighting.  Ryo survives the explosion, but passes out and starts to drift out into space.  However, Rowen wakes up and uses his bow to reel Ryo in.  Rowen propels them back to Earth which the other Warriors witness and rejoice.  Anubis senses it too and heads out to stop Ryo and Rowen while Talpa realizes that another power has awakened inside of Anubis.  Rowen doesn't remember what happened and before Ryo can explain, they are attacked by Anubis.  Ryo is injured and weakened from the energy ball and fails when he tries Flare Up Now on Anubis who captures him and Rowen with Quake With Fear.  However, Anubis hesitates to kill the helpless Ryo with his desire for a fair fight conflicting with his Dynasty morals.  Before he can decide, Rowen hits him with Arrow Shockwave.  Anubis survives the attack, but his mask and helmet breaks in half, revealing to a shocked Rowen that he's human.  Anubis tries to attack Rowen again, but is stopped by Talpa himself as his loyalty seems to be faltering.  Talpa teleports Anubis back to his castle.  The other Warriors, Mia, Ully and White Blaze arrive and the Ronin Warriors are finally reunited.  Seeing that he has failed to stop the Warriors reunion, Talpa orders his castle gates sealed against the inevitable attack.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 11\n| Title               = Assault on the Dynasty\n| TranslitTitle       = Y\u014djamon o Uchiyabure\n| NativeTitle         = \u5996\u90aa\u9580\u3092\u6253\u3061\u7834\u308c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|7|16}}\n| AltDate             = July 10, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Talpa has his castle gates closed and the defenses activated.  A bank of think fog rolls over Toyama and Mia reveals that it is part of the castle's defenses.  The group walks along and comes to a bank of thick black fog that's another part of the defenses and Kento tries to enter with a vehicle, but is attacked by streams of energy and driven out.  The energy attacks the rest of the group, but they manage to escape.  In the castle, Talpa summons Dais to deal with the Warriors and he convinces Talpa to open the gates and let the Warriors in so he can draw them into a trap, explaining that their armor will be easier to control inside the castle with the hep of the Nether Spirits.  Talpa agrees, but warns Dais that he will be very angry if Dais fails to stop the Warriors.  The fog is lifted and the group is able to see the four gates to Talpa's castle, but decide to leave Mia and Ully behind as it is too dangerous.  Ryo refuses to listen to Ully's pleas to let him come and slaps him, causing Ully to run off.  Mia follows him and Ryo sends White Blaze after them to protect them while he and the other Warriors enter the gates, closing them behind them.  Dais arrives and opens the gates, summoning the Nether Spirits.  Unable to defeat Dais, the Warriors try to summon their armor, but the spirits block their powers and Dais easily defeats them.  Mia finds Ully who knows Ryo never meant to hurt him and convinces her that they need to help the Warriors.  They notice their friends in trouble and start to go to help them, but the spirits attack them, but the Ancient One's staff appears and drives them away.  Dais ties up the Warriors and offers Ryo his life in exchange for serving Talpa, but Ryo refuses so Dais cuts him down to kill him.  Before he can, Mia, Ully and White Blaze arrive and Dais tries to attack them, but the Ancient One's staff protects them and drives away the spirits.  With the spirits gone, Ryo is able to summon his armor and blasts Dais away with Flare Up Now.  The attack also destroys the castle gates.  Talpa promises that Ryo will fall and won't be able to defeat him.  Ryo apologizes to Ully and thanks him and Mia for saving him.

He plans to use the Ronins own strengths against them and assigns Dais to the task, though he doesn't tell him the plan.  In the subway, Kento is anxious to get out and find the others and suggests blasting out while Rowen cautions that their job is to protect and rebuild and not destroy.  Two subway trains come at them, sending them different ways on the track to separate them again.  Rowen manages to get out of the way by clinging to the celing, but Kento has to battle several Dynasty soldiers on his train and when it heads for a pile of rock, climbs on top to escape, but is thrown into a field.  There he sees images of the Dark Warlords and Talpa speaks to him.  Talpa reveals that the field contains the bones of every mortal that fell to the Ronin armor and that the Ronin armors and the Warlord armors have the same origin.  He also reveals that the Ronin armors used to be worn by men that used them to conquer and that while the people wearing them grow stronger the more they're used, so too grows the bloodlust.  Talpa believes that it will eventually bring the Warriors over to his side and that they will help him conquer everything.  The other Warriors attack Kento and he defeats them, but it is revealed to be all just one of Dais' illusions.  He and Talpa try to convince Kento to join them, telling him that the armor contains evil and that its bloodthirsty nature will eventually overwhelm him and cause him to turn.  Dais and Talpa claim that Kento's armor was always the most blood-thirsty of the group and thus he will be the first to turn.  Dais sends an illusion of an army at Kento and while he realizes what it is, he feels the urge to kill.  Kento armors up and battles Dais and when he grows angry, the armor seems to take control of him somewhat.  After taunting Kento by attacking him in the guise of his friends, Dais causes Kento to hit him with Iron Rock Crusher.  The attack shatters the illusion and blasts Dais away, but also causes destruction in the city, attracting Rowen to Kento's position.  Talpa speaks to Kento, telling him to look at the destruction he caused and saying he proved that all Kento will cause is destruction and that he will soon join his side.  Rowen and Kento reunite, but Kento now has doubts about the nature of his and the other Ronins armor and what will happen.  Talpa congratulates Dais and tells him his plan is not over yet and that Anubis will handle the next part.  Dais doesn't believe Anubis worthy, but Talpa assures him that Anubis has changed.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = Armor of Life\n| TranslitTitle       = Shuten, Kokoro Naki Tatakai\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b7\u30e5\u30c6\u30f3\u3001\u5fc3\u306a\u304d\u6226\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|6}}\n| AltDate             = July 13, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = As Anubis showed weakness when he battled Ryo and Rowen last, Talpa has the Nether Spirits fortify the evil in his heart.  Anubis protests at first, but after the spirits powers take effect, he breaks free of his binds and is sent by Talpa to enact the next phase of his plan.  At an amusement park, while Ully heads off with White Blaze to play, Dynasty soldiers attack.  Sage battles them and is nearly beaten, but is saved by Ryo and Cye.  Together they defeat the Dynasty soldiers in the park and in a subway and decide that following the subway might lead them to Talpa's castle.  Rowen and Kento arrive having followed the sounds of battle, but Kento displays doubts about his future when they refer to the soldiers as \"Dynasty twerps\" wondering if he'll become a \"Dynasty twerp\" too when his armor turns him evil.  Anubis arrives, his eyes glowing red occasionally and proves to be more powerful than ever.  The Warriors except for Kento armor up, with Kento's own doubts combined with Anubis being human increasing his fear of what he could become.  At the insistence of the others, Kento tries to power up, but fails due to his fears about his armor.  Kento explains what happened to the others and his fears that if he uses the armor he will become like the Dark Warlords.  As a result, Kento refuses to fight with his armor and without it, the other Warriors are weakened and no match for Anubis.  Talpa is pleased as without Kento the Warriors will be easy for Anubis, who the Nether Spirits are keeping in control, to defeat.  Anubis proves too powerful for the Warriors and defeats them with his Quake With Fear.  The Ancient One appears nearby and tells the Warriors to trust their armor, that it responds to what's in their hearts.  Anubis goes to finish Ryo, but Ully and White Blaze try to stop him.  Anubis easily throws them aside, injuring them, but Ully's courage causes Kento to summon his armor, saying that Ully taught him what real courage is.  Anubis tries to attack again with Quake With Fear, but Kento hits him with Iron Rock Crusher.  Not only does Kento's attack knock Anubis out, but it drives the spirits influence from his body.  However, it leaves the Warriors wondering what does it mean for them that a human is wearing evil armor.  Talpa tries to pull Anubis back to his castle, but the Ancient One intervenes and pulls Anubis to him instead.  Talpa is furious while the Warriors realize that the Ancient One has arrived to help them which he confirms.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 15\n| Title               = The Ancient's Battle\n| TranslitTitle       = Kaosu, Shukumei no Taiketsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u30ab\u30aa\u30b9\u3001\u5bbf\u547d\u306e\u5bfe\u6c7a\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|13}}\n| AltDate             = July 14, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, Ully and Mia meet with the Ancient One in a park. The Ancient One commends the Ronin Warriors for all of the good they have done so far and Mia for helping to bring the Warriors together. The Ancient One confirms that the Ronin and Warlord armors do share the same origin and that they can be bent to either good or evil. According to the Ancient One, Talpa knows that the armors can be used to destroy him and will be working to bend the Warriors armors to evil and Talpa can bend the Ronin armor to his will if goodness isn't in the Ronins hearts and souls. Anubis awakens and the Ancient One stops the Warriors from attacking him so he can talk to him and try to convince him to change sides. By this point, Anubis has seen enough that he understands that Talpa is only using him for his armor and the Ancient One explains that the nine armors were once all one and are formed out of human emotions. Anubis' virtue is Loyalty which means he is loyal to whoever is his master, but the Ancient One points out that Anubis can choose his own master. The Ancient One walks away after telling Anubis to no longer be controlled by Talpa (which he has been for over a thousand years) and to pick his own path and follow it. Realizing Anubis is lost to him, Talpa sends all three Dark Warlords to attack Anubis and retrieve his armor. By the time they arrive, Anubis has come to the conclusion that the Ancient One is right and fights back against them but is easily defeated. However, before the Warlords can take Anubis to Talpa, the Ronin Warriors attack and engage them in battle. The Warriors hold off the Warlords, but Talpa blinds them temporarily with a bolt of energy, allowing the Warlords to escape with Anubis. The Warriors are more determined than ever to attack Talpa's castle and defeat him and the Ancient One agrees to become the bridge to the castle, but worries about the power of the Dark Side within. In the castle, Anubis is brought before Talpa and tries to no avail to convince the other Warlords of the truth and is thrown in the dungeon. The Warlords ask for the power of the Dark Side to make them stronger so they can defeat the Warriors, but Talpa reveals the source is pure evil and demands they prove themselves ready for the power. As the Warriors discuss the upcoming attack on the castle and Ryo's fears about what the Ancient One told them about their armor, the Ancient One summons Talpa and does battle with him. The Ancient One is no match for Talpa and is destroyed, but as his last act he turns himself into a bridge to Talpa's castle. The Warriors hear the commotion and are saddened when they realize the Ancient One's sacrifice, but prepare themselves to make use of it to finally assault Talpa's castle. At the same time, Talpa is aware of what the Ancient One planned and is amused, planning to let the Warriors in, confident in his coming victory.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 16\n| Title               = Raid on Talpa's Castle\n| TranslitTitle       = Totsuny\u016b, Arago-j\u014d\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a81\u5165\u3001\u30a2\u30e9\u30b4\u57ce\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|20}}\n| AltDate             = July 17, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, leaving behind Mia, Ully and White Blaze who wish them good luck, enter the Ancient One's bridge. Talpa sends the Nether Spirits to destroy the bridge and the Warriors and collect their armor and they nearly succeed, but the spirit of the Ancient One is able to channel the bridge's energy and destroy the spirits. Upon arrival at the castle, the Warriors are attacked by Dynasty soldiers and after fighting for a while, summon their armor and Rowen destroys them with Arrow Shockwave. However, when Ryo tries to use Flare Up Now against the castle, it just rebounds on him. Talpa then sends the Dark Warlords, now with increased power from the Nether Spirits to attack the Warriors. Their attacks easily overpower the Warriors and the Warlords warn them not to go on or face destruction, but the Warriors decide to push on anyways. Entering the castle, they end up separated and Sage is confronted by Cale, Ryo and Cye by Sekhmet and Rowen and Kento by Dais. Cye and Kento go up against Sekhmet and Dais one on one to allow Ryo and Rowen to go confront Talpa and the two meet up and finally confront Talpa face to face and demand answers. Talpa explains that as his Nether World grows bigger he needs the Earth as his world feeds off the anger and hatred in humans. He explains that just with the humans from Toyama he is able to create an unending army of Nether Spirits and Dynasty soldiers to take over the world. Ryo and Rowen attack Talpa to no avail with both of their attacks being deflected back at them and Ryo even getting blown outside the castle. Meanwhile, as the other Ronin fight their opponents, Anubis, still trapped in the castle dungeon, tells them to hold on as he will help them thanks to the Ancient One freeing him from Talpa's evil.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 17\n| Title               = The Legend of the Armor\n| TranslitTitle       = Akasareta Yoroi Densetsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u660e\u304b\u3055\u308c\u305f\u93a7\u4f1d\u8aac\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|27}}\n| AltDate             = July 18, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Ryo falls to a ledge and is nearly killed by Sekhmet but is saved by Cye. Ryo climbs to the top of the castle and faces Talpa again inside, but is again easily defeated and thrown back outside. Meanwhile, Mia and Ully become determined to help the Ronin Warriors and ride White Blaze through the bridge to the castle where they dodge Dynasty attacks. Talpa watches as the Warriors fight with some success against the Warlords and realizes that their armor grows stronger the more they battle and he needs that for himself. When the Warriors manage to get past the Warlords, Talpa calls them off and demands the Warlords give their armor to him. They agree and Talpa absorbs the Warlords and starts building a physical body for himself. Mia, Ully and White Blaze find Ryo in a lot of pain and come under attack by a Dynasty army but are saved by Rowen and Cye and Rowen destroys most of the army with Arrow Shockwave. The Ronins then destroy much of the rest and form an energy pyramid that destroys the rest. Talpa reveals that the source of the armor is that it originally belonged to him before the Ancient One stole it and tried to hide it from him and attacks with his hand, injuring Ryo and causing his armor to disappear and absorbing Rowen, Cye and Kento. Meanwhile, Anubis escapes from his prison to help. Mia and Ully are captured by more Dynasty soldiers while White Blaze is surrounded, but Anubis saves them. His presence causes the remaining Ronin virtues to activate and Ryo is healed. Sage attacks Talpa to no avail and his sword is destroyed and he is absorbed.

This causes Mia to lose hope, but not Ully. Ryo attacks Talpa to no avail with not even Flare Up Now doing anything. Talpa grabs Ryo and explains that having absorbed eight armors he is too powerful for Ryo to harm. However, before he can harm or absorb Ryo, the other Warriors, who are still alive inside Talpa, fight back and manage to force Talpa to let Ryo go. Ryo becomes determined to find someway to free his friends and kill Talpa, but is unsure how while Talpa grows stronger by feeding off the fear of the people he has captured which gives Mia and Ully hope as that means that Ully's parents and the other people Talpa has captured are still alive. Talpa chases Ryo who is reluctant to destroy him as doing so will kill the other Ronin Warriors. Ryo is nearly absorbed by Talpa, but White Blaze saves him and they fight Talpa who forces the other Ronin Warriors to use their attacks against Ryo.

However, the spirit of the Ancient One appears to him to show him how Talpa tried to take over the world in the past. The Ancient One shows Ryo how he defeated Talpa and killed him, but Talpa swore that with his armor he would return one day and returned to the Nether World as a soul. The Ancient One, knowing that with Talpa's armor still intact this is still possible and unable to destroy it, splits the armor into the five Ronin and four Warlord armors to diffuse Talpa's armor's power. The nine armors are thus linked, but according to the Ancient One, not necessarily to Talpa's evil. While all of the armors are made up of the parts of the human spirit, the Ronins are linked to the purest parts of it while the other armors are more easily corruptible and eventually returned to Talpa's side. The Ancient One explains that while the armors can be used for either good or evil, it is the wearer's soul that determines which side that armor is on. Unfortunately, after the Ancient One explains all of this, Ryo is absorbed by Talpa who sends out a blast of energy that causes destruction in the city below. Inside Talpa, Ryo watches as the spirit of the Ancient One apologizes to the Warriors for involving them in the battle against Talpa who appears and tries to make Ryo despair by claiming his friends now hate and feel betrayed by him. Ryo refuses to give into despair and calls upon his friends to help him fight once more. Ryo emerges from Talpa and absorbs the power of the other four armors to form a new armor, the Inferno Armor. With the Inferno, Ryo is more than a match for Talpa and blasts him with Flare Up Now, destroying him and his castle and releasing the other Ronin Warriors. The Warriors float safely to the ground while Mia, Ully and White Blaze escape through the Ancient One's bridge and the group stands on a rooftop and looks out at the now freed city, the threat over.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 20\n| Title               = Ronin vs. Saranbo\n| TranslitTitle       = Arata naru Tatakai\n| NativeTitle         = \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u6226\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|9|24}}\n| AltDate             = July 21, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Ryo is attacked and killed by Talpa, but is relieved when he wakes up and realizes that it was just a nightmare.

At the gates to the Nether World, a new threat, Saranbo appears, announcing his intention to destroy the world and steal the Ronin armors for himself to become invincible. Ryo finds Mia researching his armor and she explains that her grandfather was aware of the armors special powers and that the white armor he had summoned is called the Inferno armor. However, she is worried about Ryo as it takes a lot out of him to use and she believes he should rest. Ryo feels fine after sleeping a lot and believes he is okay now. After having stopped to get a drink, a gate to the Nether World appears in front of Rowen and Sage and Saranbo arrives to attack them. Saranbo proves to be more than a match for them and demands to know which of them holds the Inferno armor and leaves after blasting them and discovering that neither holds it. They inform Cye, Kento and Mia about this but don't tell Ryo as he is still exhausted from his fight with Talpa and needs more time to recover. Deciding to keep it from Ryo and protect him, they lure Saranbo into a trap, but he is unscathed by even the combined power of Arrow Shockwave and Thunder Bolt Cut and easily defeats them. Upon learning that none of them possess the armor, he goes in search of Ryo leaving the others captured. Saranbo finds Ryo and tells him he has captured his friends and demands he find them. Ryo and White Blaze head out in search of the others and upon finding them, come under attack by Saranbo. Ryo loses until the Inferno Armor forms around him and he blasts Saranbo with Flare Up Now, apparently destroying him.

Mia explains that the swords couldn't handle the intensity of the Inferno armor and continuing to use it as Ryo did could result in it failing him. Ryo is upset that he can't trust his own swords and Ully suggests finding him a new one, causing Mia to come up with the idea that maybe there is another sword meant to work with the Inferno armor which she looks through her grandfather's data for. Mia finds a special pair of swords meant for the original wearer of the Inferno armor called the Soul Swords of Fervor or the Soul Swords which legend states is hidden at the base of a volcano and protected by a special divine power.

A gateway to the Nether Realm appears and Sun Devil's master speaks to the Ronins through it, revealing himself to be the still-alive Talpa who is determined to have the Ronin armor return to him.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 25\n| Title               = Torrent's Evil Twin\n| TranslitTitle       = Taiketsu!

He creates an evil clone of Cye with the same armor, but red and more powerful. This clone will be powerful enough to defeat the Warriors. Talpa is worried that they will be defeated again because of their reliance on the art of fighting battles, but Sekhmet is confident that he has accounted for that problem. Meanwhile, Ryo worries about being able to control the intense power created by the combination of the Soul Swords and the Armor of Inferno while everyone else worries about it as well as the fact that the Dynasty nearly overpowered them with its evil. That night, Ryo dreams that he tests his strength by using Flare Up Now to cut a massive boulder in half which works, but the Ancient One's spirit appears to tell him that strength alone isn't enough to defeat Talpa and the forces of evil, he must also fight the battle with his heart. He then appears in the dreams of all the other Warriors to give them advice and the next day, Kento believes that they need to find their center to find the balance the Ancient One was talking about and they take off to do so. Cye travels to the ocean, but is attacked by Dynasty soldiers. After defeating them, he comes face to face with his evil clone, Red Torrent and proves to be no match for him, forced to take the battle out of the water due to Red Torrent possessing Sekhmet's poison which starts affecting the ocean and being overpowered by Red Torrent's Super Wave Smasher when they fire at each other. The Ancient One's spirit appears again and tells Cye to ignore the turmoil and strength of his foe and find the peace in the battle. Cye realizes this is like how a whale let a powerful current carry him. The Ancient One tells him not to fight, but to swim into the stream of its nature and Cye clears his mind and searches for a solution. Red Torrent shoots his poisonous Super Wave Smasher and Cye decides to absorb the attack and use his armor to purify the water. The effort works and Cye, his power strengthened, blasts Red Torrent with his own Super Wave Smasher, destroying Red Torrent. However, a wave of poison emerges from Red Torrent's remains and Cye's attempt to stop it fails and he is overwhelmed by the attack and passes out. Sekhmet reveals himself and captures Cye, taking him through a gate to the Nether World.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 26\n| Title               = The Armor Must Be Destroyed\n| TranslitTitle       = K\u014drin yo, Hikari o Torimodose\n| NativeTitle         = \u5149\u8f2a\u3088\u3001\u5149\u3092\u3068\u308a\u3082\u3069\u305b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|11|19}}\n| AltDate             = July 31, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ancient One's spirit tells Sage to rely on mind, skill and spirit and not just the strength of his armor to overcome evil, saying that harnessing those three things will allow him to attain an even greater strength. In order to do so, Sage returns to the caves at the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles where the Armor of Halo was created and the source of its power. At the Pinnacles, Sage saves a deer from a pack of wolves who run away when he starts glowing. The deer and its herd, also fearing Sage, run away from him. Meanwhile, Talpa summons Cale and sends him to go after Sage to try to turn him to the side of evil, believing that once the Ronin Warriors see their true power, they will switch sides. Cale approaches Sage and explains that the wolves and the deer ran from him because they sensed the evil of his armor and fear it. Cale claims that the armors purpose is to bring destruction to the world and attacks. Cale battles Sage, trying to convince him of the armors evil power and for Sage to turn to evil, telling him that the armor makes him continually fight and destroy. Fearing this might be true, Sage powers down his armor and runs, hiding in a waterfall and meditating. In order to show Sage how cold and dark the heart of a Dynasty warlord is, Cale covers everything, including all living creatures in ice and snow, freezing Sage in the waterfall and tries to convince him to help destroy the world. In an attempt to drive Sage to evil, Cale revives and controls five deer and makes them attack Sage, trying to force him to kill them and drive him further from good, but when it fails, Cale kills them again. Sage summons his armor to fight Cale again, understanding that while his strength may come from the Dynasty, he still controls it with his mind. Sage unleashes the Thunder Bolt Cut, defeating Cale, but blasting off the top of the caves. Cale tells Sage he has now become a Dynasty warrior before collapsing and not wanting to give into the evil in the armor, Sage separates it from him and cuts it in half with his sword. However, his sword channels the power of his own spirit and repairs the armor and realizing that this is not an evil power, Sage regains faith in his mind, skill and spirit to overcome evil.  This causes life to be restored to the land. However, this leaves Sage vulnerable and Talpa opens a gate to the Nether Realm and captures Sage and the Armor of Halo.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 27\n| Title               = Sand Blasted\n| TranslitTitle       = Ikare Kong\u014d, Suna Y\u014dja o Kudake\n| NativeTitle         = \u6012\u308c\u91d1\u525b\u3001\u7802\u5996\u90aa\u3092\u304f\u3060\u3051\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|11|26}}\n| AltDate             = August 1, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Having already captured Cye and Sage, Talpa decides to send Dais to capture another Ronin and Dais picks Kento. Dais reveals that he has a plan that Kento's brute strength will be no match against and asks for the help of the Twin Sand Strikers which Talpa agrees to as Dais has served him well in the past. As Kento dozes as he makes his journey, he remembers what the Ancient One's spirit told him in his dream: that while he is the strongest among the Ronin Warriors, one great force cannot ruin another and that he must use the spirit of the armor to push his way through the \"sands of deception\", telling him to know them and to \"see what is not there.\" At a construction site, Kento is confronted by Dais who he is shocked to see alive and is attacked by the Sand Strikers. Dais claims the Dynasty is unstoppable and while the Sand Strikers hold Kento down, sends a wrecking ball at him. Kento dodges and battles the Sand Strikers, apparently destroying them with the wrecking ball, but they survive and bring part of a building down on top of him. However, Dais prevents them from killing Kento, telling them he wants Kento to suffer and telling Kento to continue his quest, that he'll be waiting for him. The three then travel to a forest which they petrify to await Kento's arrival. Kento arrives and battles Dais, unleashing Iron Rock Crusher twice and causing the area to turn into a desert. Dais reminds Kento how he once revealed to him that the stronger he gets the stronger the hold of evil on him and tells him that the world will end up just like it if he insists on fighting. Kento battles the Sand Strikers again, but when he unleashes Iron Rock Crusher once more, they simply absorb the power and easily beat him and Dais leaves to tell Talpa of his victory. Kento wakes up and to confuse him, the Sand Strikers dash around so fast that it appears there are many of them. Remembering what the Ancient One told him, Kento taps into the spirit of the armor which he realizes is a part of the natural energy flowing through the Earth and is able to see where the Sand Strikers really are. Using this, Kento unleashes Iron Rock Crusher again and destroys the Sand Strikers. Kento finally understands that in order to use all of his armor's strength, he must focus all of its power. Dais shows up again and attacks, but after he reveals that Cye and Sage have been captured, Kento willingly follows him to the Nether Realm in an effort to rescue them.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 28\n| Title               = Lady Kayura and the Dark Realm\n| TranslitTitle       = Nazo no Onna Y\u014dja Kayura Shutsugen\n| NativeTitle         = \u8b0e\u306e\u5973\u5996\u90aa\u30ab\u30e6\u30e9\u51fa\u73fe\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|12|3}}\n| AltDate             = August 2, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Rowen practices his now-maximized powers by using Arrow Shockwave to successfully blast away storm clouds, but is blasted by an unseen force and pulled into the clouds where he is confronted by a beautiful girl named Lady Kayura.

The Ancient One proves to be skilled and dodges or counters all of her attacks to Lady Kayura's surprise. She tries blasting the Ancient One, but he absorbs her attack and disappears, causing her to realize that she needs to report the troubling development of the Ancient One's return to Talpa. The Ancient One travels to a waterfall where it is revealed that he's not actually the Ancient One but someone who has taken on his role and his way of doing things. Ryo is determined to get into the Nether Realm and rescue his friends and despite Mia and Rowen's warnings that it is a trap, he is insistent so Rowen decides to join him in trying.

Anubis convinces them of his sincerity and accepting him as a friend, they invite him to stay with them. Anubis explains to them how four hundred years ago he was a warrior that had become extremely power-hungry and bloodthirsty which caused him to join Talpa, but the Ancient One showed him that that wasn't a good thing and that Talpa wasn't his destiny as he thought. He now realizes that his destiny is to stop Talpa. Anubis senses the presence of Dais and forces him to show himself. Dais claims that all of the Ronin Warriors have been captured by Talpa, but Anubis points out that Ryo and Rowen are still free. Dais explains that they are merely being toyed with by Talpa and attacks Anubis who easily defeats him, knocking his helmet off and revealing his face to Ully and Mia. Anubis refuses to kill him, saying that Dais' armor protects him and tries to convince Dais that the armor's power doesn't come from Talpa like he believes but that Talpa wants it for himself before he, Ully and Mia leave. In the Nether World Ryo meets up with Rowen and White Blaze and a gate appears in front of them which they travel through. There they are met by a Nether Spirit who claims that Cye, Sage and Kento are merely guests of Talpa and asks them to join them, but to give up their armor first. However, they know that the spirit is lying and refuse and the spirit leaves and Talpa's castle appears nearby. Talpa visits the captured Warriors who are being drained by Nether Spirits and has the spirits drain a bunch of their power at once and give it to him, allowing him to create a sword from the power of their armor to defeat Ryo and Rowen with. Talpa then sends Lady Kayura to give the sword to a Dynasty warlord named Dala to use against Ryo and Rowen and capture them. However, upon returning to her room where she is visited by Talpa, Lady Kayura shows doubts about if what she is doing is right.

Dala reveals the origin of his sword to their shock. Meanwhile, the Dark Warlords worry about being confronted by Ryo and Rowen with the power of the Inferno Armor and beg Talpa to destroy them and end it. Talpa summons Badamon, Lord of the Nether Spirits to explain the story behind the Inferno. Badamon explains that it came to be when the world was plagued by evil a long time ago. The five Ronin armors combined together to form the Inferno and it was worn by the first Ronin Warrior, Hariel. Ryo and Rowen continue battling Dala who taunts them about the fact that Ryo refuses to summon the Inferno to fight because it might drain their friends of the last of their energy and kill them. Badamon continues his explanation, telling the Warlords that the Inferno defeated the evil force plaguing the world long ago and that what they have seen is just the beginning of the Inferno's power, that nothing can stop it and even he doesn't know the full power of the Inferno, but that it is rumored that at full power it could destroy the world and leave behind a void. Talpa explains that he wants to conquer the armor for just that purpose, to build a new world under his control. Badamon plans to be the one to control the armor which he claims he can do with just a bit more time. Rowen rides off on a horse, leaving Ryo to battle Dala on his own, telling him to summon the Inferno. Ryo refuses to take that risk and continues to battle Dala on his power alone, trying and failing to use Flare Up Now on Dala. With the power of the three armors in his sword, Dala is able to use Cye, Kento and Sage's attacks against Ryo, blasting him down. Badamon explains to the Warlords that he and his spirits can control the Inferno Armor where the Warlords would be destroyed and he has take control of the armor.

As he would be under the influence of the evil armors, he would then do what they want. Talpa agrees, but tells Badamon not to tell the Dark Warlords which he agrees with as they may change sides if they realize they are being used. Badamon asks for Lady Kayura's help and gives her a magic dust that will allow her to control Ryo. Ryo and Rowen try to make their way to Talpa's castle undetected, but are found and blocked in and the Dark Warlords and some Dynasty soldiers are sent to confront them. They defeat the soldiers and escape, but are confronted by Lady Kayrua who uses the dust on the Warlords, Ryo, Rowen and White Blaze and forces Ryo to summon the Inferno using the power of Rowen and the Dark Warlords armors with the Nether Spirits and the dust to control him. However, instead of the Inferno being controlled by the Dark Warlords armors, it works in reverse, controlling them and making them attack Lady Kayura. However, they are no match for her and she easily defeats them. She wakes Ryo, but he drives the Nether Spirits and dust's influence from his body and battles Lady Kayura.

Ryo, exhausted and in pain from the battle and Rowen rest and discuss how Ryo didn't feel any different after absorbing the power of the Dark Warlords. This leads Rowen to theorize that perhaps they aren't all bad as they protected Ryo briefly from Lady Kayura. While Lady Kayura lost against Ryo, Talpa is still pleased with her as the Armor of Inferno was proven to have the power to destroy the mortal world like Talpa wants. Ully, Mia and Anubis look through Mia's grandfather's data, looking for anything they can use against the Dynasty and Anubis spots a symbol that Talpa uses and becomes determined to find out what it is as it may be important. Mia discovers that the symbol stands for the Jewel of Life, an object capable of destroying Talpa which was hidden by the very first Ancients. After the discovery, Anubis senses something and when investigating, comes under attack from Dynasty soldiers. Anubis fights them and they alert Badamon of Mia's discovery. Badamon orders the soldiers not to let Mia, Ully and Anubis escape with the information and two soldiers lure Anubis away while another tries to kill Mia and Ully. Anubis defeats the soldiers and Mia locates the a map leading to the Jewel of Life which Anubis realizes is near water. Meanwhile, Ryo and Rowen contemplate how the Dark Warlords almost seemed to turn good and worry about their friends. Needing to stop Anubis, Mia and Ully from finding the Jewel, Badamon dispatches a Dynasty warrior named Gash to stop them, explaining that legend says that the Jewel is the heart of the nine armors and beats strong in the heart of the pure and gives strength to the weak and thus is a threat to Talpa and his empire. Mia uncovers the same thing, reading that the Jewel gives the armors their power and figuring out with Anubis that it must be in Jewel Lake. The three head there with Anubis planning to travel to the Nether World afterwards to help the Ronin Warriors, but refusing to allow Ully and Mia to come as it is too dangerous. At Jewel Lake, Anubis parts the water with the Ancient One's staff and is able to use the staff to open the tomb that's revealed at the bottom. In the tomb they find the armors of the Ancients that guard the tomb, murals of the battles between Hariel and evil in the past and the Jewel of Life. When Ully picks up the Jewel, the Ancient One speaks to them telling them that only the pure of heart can use the Jewel as in evil hands it could destroy the world. Gash arrives with Dynasty soldiers and attacks, but the Ancient armors, possessed by the souls of their wearers, destroy the soldiers and when Gash threatens Mia and Ully, Anubis stabs him through the back with the Ancient One's staff, killing him. At the Ancient One's request, Anubis releases the souls in the armors to move on, their job now finished and puts the Jewel around Mia's neck when Ully gives it to him, saying that Ully and Mia are the purest of heart people he knows and they will all go together to save their friends.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 34\n| Title               = Strata's Defiant Stand\n| TranslitTitle       = Tenk\u016b, Kizudarake no Tatakai\n| NativeTitle         = \u5929\u7a7a\u3001\u50b7\u3060\u3089\u3051\u306e\u6226\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1989|1|28}}\n| AltDate             = August 10, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Anubis, Mia and Ully contemplate the power of the Jewel of Life and wonder how it is supposed to defeat Talpa and Mia gives it to Ully to wear.

Badamon approaches Talpa with fears about allowing Ryo and Rowen free rein within the castle before a structure the Nether Spirits are building which Badamon calls the Tower of Pain is completed due to the unfathomable power of the Inferno Armor, but Talpa assures him that they won't be free for long as he is drawing them into a trap.

Ryo and Rowen continue to make their way through the maze, avoiding Dynasty soldiers and trying to find a way into the castle.

The two fight her to no avail and she tricks Ryo into launching Flare Up Now at her then dodges, causing him to hit a structure which drains his armor of power. Rowen is unable to stop it and Ryo is completely drained while the effects are seen in the mortal world as Talpa's castle flickering in and out of view, causing Anubis to say that the Dynasty is rising again. While wondering what to do, both the staff and the Jewel of Life glow again and Anubis finally understands what he has to do to help the others.

Realizing they need the other Ronin Warriors to win, Rowen sacrifices himself to buy them some more time by blasting Lady Kayura into the air and trying to fight her there, but is instead defeated and apparently killed. Ryo prepares to continue the battle with Lady Kayura, but Anubis interrupts and tells Ryo to let him handle it while Ryo goes off to rescue the other Ronin Warriors. Ryo agrees and leaves Anubis to continue the fight. Dynasty soldiers attack Mia and Ully, but the Jewel of Life protects them and kills the soldiers. Knowing that the Jewel is a mystical artifact that poses a threat to the Dynasty and not wanting to risk Mia and Ully uncovering its powers, Badamon suggests they do something about it, but Talpa isn't worried, believing that the Ronins and their allies have no way of using the three mystical artifacts that could spell doom for the Dynasty: the Inferno Armor, the Soul Swords of Fervor and the Jewel. Anubis is able to hold his own against Lady Kayura with the Ancient One's staff protecting him, however, to his surprise, the staff will not strike down Lady Kayura for some reason. Rowen is dropped into a cavern where it is revealed he faked his death and he finds the other Ronin Warriors completely drained of power which has turned them into statues. Rowen uses the strength of his armor's power of Life in the form of his arrows to try to awaken the others before collapsing. Ryo arrives near the other Warriors and is confronted by the Dark Warlords and defeated, however, Ully, Mia and White Blaze arrive and when Ully rushes forward to help, the Jewel protects Ryo and harms the Dark Warlords, driving them off. However, Lady Kayura arrives and like the Staff of the Ancients, the Jewel has no effect on her. As it looks like it is over for Ryo, Rowen and the other Ronin Warriors appear to once again help Ryo fight the Dynasty.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 36\n| Title               = Cheap Tricks\n| TranslitTitle       = Kessen!

However, the Dark Warlords demand to fight them instead and when Ryo, Cye and Kento charge them, drop them through trap doors to separate them and head off to face them, leaving Sage and Rowen to face Lady Kayura. Ryo, Sage and Cye land in a pit which is filled with water, but Cye manages to find an exit which he blasts open, dropping the three into a chasm. While Ryo and Kento manage to hang onto the side of the chasm, Cye falls in and later Dais and Sekhmet knock Kento and Ryo in. Sage and Rowen battle Lady Kayura, targeting her amulet while trying to protect Ully and Mia at the same time from Dynasty soldiers when the Jewel of Life doesn't seem to be doing anything. Cale confronts Cye in the chasm, using the darkness there to his advantage as Cye can't see where he is while Cale can see him and attack. At the same time, Kento faces Dais who grows to a giant size to fight him which doesn't seem to be an illusion while Ryo faces Sekhmet who traps Ryo in a sea of acidic venom which will slowly eat away at his armor and then his body. Anubis, who is nearby, is confused when the Ancient One's staff glows and remembers how it wouldn't let him harm Lady Kayura and how she disappeared after it didn't. Anubis realizes that it might be a sign that Ryo is in trouble and heads off to help him while Sage and Rowen continue to protect Mia and Ully, but are outnumbered. Just in time, Anubis reaches Ryo and rescues him from the poison with the staff and drives Sekhmet away. As Kento is about to be killed by the giant Dais, Anubis causes Dais disappear using the staff and Ryo is able to convince Kento that Anubis is now on their side and they head off together. They reach Cye in time for Anubis to restore light to the area with the staff which also drives off Cale. The group quickly reunites with the others and Ryo forms the Inferno. With the Inferno, Ryo is able to block Lady Kayura's Star Sword Scream and blasts her with Rage of Inferno, breaking her amulet off her neck. Lady Kayura is left completely confused at where she is and when Ryo goes to finish her off, Anubis stops him, explaining that for some reason the staff wouldn't let him harm her.

The Warriors reluctantly accept this, but warn Anubis that they won't hold back on Lady Kayura if they encounter her as she fights with Talpa. Meanwhile, Lady Kayura sits in her room and flashes back on her life which she is able to do as her amulet is cracked. She remembers that she is the last remaining member of the Ancient One's people who has great supernatural powers as a result. Lady Kayura takes her amulet off again and resists the evil, worrying Badamon and Talpa as without Lady Kayura he doesn't have the power of the Ancient One's clan on his side when the shrines he's building for the nine armors are complete, saying that his plan to unite the Dynasty and mortal world under his control is impossible without her help. However, Badamon proposes letting her regain her memories and then having him possess her mind and soul so she will be completely under their control, but they know they need to keep Anubis away for the plan to work so Talpa sends the Dark Warlords to deal with him. The Warriors battle an army of Dynasty soldiers and armor up to deal with them, which they easily do, but are confused by the fact that no stronger enemies appear to fight like Lady Kayura or the Dark Warlords. Badamon goes to Lady Kayura and successfully possesses her to do the Dynasty will while Anubis senses that something has happened to her and realizing that she is the last of the Ancient One's clan, becomes determined to save her like the Ancient One saved him.

Badamon explains that the nine armors forever link the mortal realm and the Nether World which has always been the Warlords purpose. Mia confirms this, saying that there is an old legend that mentions nine keys which she realizes means the nine armors and warns that the whole world could possibly be destroyed as a result of this.

Badamon and the Nether Spirits, rejoicing in this, fly through the gateway to the mortal world. Ryo tries Flare Up Now on Talpa, but he just jumps in the river and puts out the flames and climbs a tower. Lady Kayura warns Ryo to be careful as the tower is filled with the essence of pain and is behind the Dynasty's evil power and it could turn Ryo evil like she once was. Talpa transports the tower and himself into the mortal world where its influence brings out the worst in humanity and makes people turn on each other.

The Tree of Life forms the entrance to their valley, while all is underneath the Black Inferno Armor. Kento attempts to rescue Ryo and Sage but is intercepted by Mukala. Kento's armor then flashes a darker color as he attempts to battle Mukala, which Ully notices as appearing more evil. Mia reads on the cave walls that if the Black and White Inferno Armors, which were both born in the valley, were to ever meet, that it would release an energy that would be too much for the universe to bear. Rowen's armor unlocks a power within the crystals around them which causes the lightning to strike The Tree of Life. More dark crystals arise, which Mukala uses to don the Black Inferno Armor.

They notice the virtue has disappeared from his armor, noticing it must be removing themselves during this conflict. Naria explains the history of the armor and their tribe: the Black Inferno Armor appeared in the Valley of the Black Crystal, and that the Talaugi were worshiped because of this. The Black Inferno Armor was always worn by their tribe and protected them from outside influence, but one day it showed that it could move on its own power and revealed a darker side. When Mukala discovered there was another Inferno Armor, the Black Inferno Armor ordered that it find and fight it, to which Mukala obeyed. Naria is dismayed that Mukala has become overpowered by the Black Inferno Armor. Black Blaze soon separates himself from White Blaze, which then separates Cye from the Armor of Torrent, which moves on its own accord. The Ronin Warriors then decide to destroy both Inferno Armors, saying that the armors without virtue become sinister forces. Naria pleads with Mukala to end the conflict, but to no avail. White Blaze is soon attacked by the tribe, which then capture Mia, Ully and Naria. Black Blaze gives the Armor of Torrent to Mukala, who summons the other armors to create the Inferno Armor. The Ronin Warriors soon find Mukala, and though he attacks them, they state that they do not wish to fight them but rather want to confront their armors. The two armors manipulate the sun and moon, which creates an lunar eclipse that darkens the land. The Ronin Warriors see visions of the end of the world that would result from the two armors lust for battle. They resolve to let their virtues win, and summon their own armor to battle The Inferno Armor, which is now acting on its own will. Despite being initially unable to cause any damage, the five decide to fight with their spirits as one, attacking The Inferno Armor with the power of their virtues. This defeats the evil spirit residing within, and Ryo is able to don The Inferno Armor once again. Ryo then commences battle with Mukala, who has donned the Black Inferno armor. Ryo again pleads with Mukala to end the battle, saying that an armor that has abandoned its spirit can only bring death. While the two continue to fight, their attacks bring shockwaves onto the landscape; Naria and White Blaze are soon caught in the crossfire and are dealt fatal blows. Mukala, mortified, surveys the damage; the Ronin Warriors use the opportunity attack him with their virtues to let him see the true nature of the human spirit. The attack succeeds. The eclipse soon clears, and the armors then disappear, but not before reviving Naria and White Blaze. Mukala then approaches Naria and warmly calls her by her name, as Ryo, Rowen, Sage, Cye, Kento, Mia and Ully look on.\n}}\n|}\n\n===Ronin Warriors: Message===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #aaa;\"\n! width=\"30\" | # !!

A young man named Ryo and his tiger White Blaze mysteriously appears in the street, nearly causing a young boy named Ully to be injured while skateboarding. Mia and her grandfather believe that Ryo is one of the Ronin Warriors and that there is perhaps hope for the world. Mia rushes off to meet Ryo, but he is surrounded by police. Meanwhile, the storm clouds move in and all power cuts out, leaving cars stranded and causing a helicopter to crash. As glass shatters all over the city from a massive lightning strike, everyone but Ryo runs in fear and Ully gets separated from his parents.  Ryo calls out for the Dynasty to fight him and a Dynasty soldier shows up and the two battle. Ryo battles the soldier with the aid of White Blaze, which proves difficult, and Ully, who comes across the battle, is nearly killed before Mia saves him.  Ryo and White Blaze are defeated and Ryo is about to be killed when another Ronin Warrior, Rowen, protects him. The other Ronin Warriors, Cye, Sage and Kento also arrive to fight.  The Warriors summon their full armor and fight the soldier, but don't work as a team and are therefore unable to defeat him. He takes Ully and Mia hostage, trapping them in a television screen where they feel every injury he receives.  The soldier beats up Ryo until he calls up his ultimate attack, \"Flare Up Now\", destroying the soldier and accidentally blasting the building behind him in half. Mia and Ully are set free and the Dark Warlords and Talpa, the leaders of the Dynasty introduce themselves, sure in their victory over the Ronin Warriors, whom they see as weak, while a giant castle appears in the sky.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Glory for Anubis\n| TranslitTitle       = Onimash\u014d!

The military tries to launch an attack on Talpa's castle to no avail as the Dynasty turns their own weapons against them and obliterates the attacking force.  Anubis finds the Warriors, Mia and Ully hiding in the subway and attacks.  The Warriors use their armor to form the Circle of Power to protect Mia and Ully, but without their armors, they are no match for Anubis and he ties them up with his Quake With Fear attack.  The Ronins are unable to dissolve the circle and call upon their armors, but the Ancient One appears and uses his staff to dissolve it himself.  The Ronins summon their armor and Ryo and Anubis launch their most powerful attacks against each other at the same time.  One of Ryo's swords gets knocked from his hand and he passes out, but Anubis is injured too.  Realizing that the Circle of Power is unbroken and that he cannot allow the Ronins to face him, Talpa sends a tornado of dark energy that picks up the Warriors and scatters them to the most desolate regions on Earth.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = Secret of Wildfire\n| TranslitTitle       = Yoroi Gia, Rekka no Himitsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u93a7\u64ec\u4e9c\u3001\u70c8\u706b\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|5|14}}\n| AltDate             = June 28, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Mia and Ully find the sword Ryo dropped and are taken by White Blaze towards the volcano where Talpa dropped him.  Ryo awakens and starts climbing out while Talpa sends Anubis to destroy him for good.  Anubis and a bunch of Dynasty soldiers chase down Mia and Ully, believing that the two will lead them to Ryo, but they are saved by the Ancient One who uses his staff to open a giant chasm, taking out the Dynasty soldiers, though Anubis emerges unharmed.  The staff also restores power to the city and finding Mia's abandoned jeep working now, Mia and Ully head off again to find Ryo.  Ryo climbs out of the volcano, but is attacked by Anubis.  White Blaze returns his missing sword, but Anubis knocks him back into the volcano again.  However, Ryo's power is increased and he emerges as more than a match for Anubis.  Anubis captures Mia and Ully and Ryo is unable to approach them as his armor is hot enough to incinerate them.  Anubis casts them into the volcano to force Ryo to get rid of his armor to rescue them then prevents him from re-summoning it and beats him up and tosses him in the volcano again, but Ryo manages to pull Anubis in with him.  Both manage to get to safety in the volcano which starts to erupt.  Ryo calls upon his armor again and destroys Anubis' weapons as the volcano erupts and knocks Anubis into the eruption, but Anubis survives and is yelled at by Talpa for his failure.  Mia, Ully, Ryo and White Blaze vow to find the remaining Warriors who they believe are still alive and Ryo accepts that they need to work as a team to defeat the Dynasty.  This pleases the Ancient One who is watching from nearby.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = The Search Begins\n| TranslitTitle       = Dokumash\u014d Naaza no Wana\n| NativeTitle         = \u6bd2\u9b54\u5c06 \u90a3\u5516\u632b\u306e\u7f60\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|5|21}}\n| AltDate             = June 29, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = With Anubis having failed, Talpa sends Sekhmet after the Ronin Warriors.  It is also shown that Talpa has captured the people of the city.  At the suggestion of Mia, she, Ryo, Ully and White Blaze head to the university where her grandfather works to get his help in finding the other Ronin Warriors.  On the way, the group stops by Ully's house to try to find his parents, but have no luck, so Ully vows he will help the Warriors defeat Talpa and save the world.  At the university, the group tries to enlist the help of Mia's grandfather, but he refuses to help, telling them to just give up.  Ully realizes that two suits of armor are two disguised Dynasty soldiers that attack.  Ryo, with help from White Blaze and Ully, defeats the soldiers, but Dr. Koji is possessed by a Dynasty spirit and attacks too.  Ryo manages to free Dr. Koji, but he has been poisoned by the Dynasty and dies, but not before revealing that the Warriors have been returned to the places where their armor was created.  Mia tries to find the answer in his computer while Sekhmet watches nearby, planning to follow them and attack once they find their comrades.  However, White Blaze detects the Dark Warlord and attacks him.  Ryo notices the fight and joins in, but is unable to defeat Sekhmet.  Finally Mia realizes that her grandfather was referring to a poem he used to teach her and finds it on the computer before the university is destroyed.  Ully notices that Sekhmet doesn't have six arms like it appears, he's just moving his arms really fast and informs Ryo who uses the information to defeat him.  Following the information found in the riddle, the group then heads to the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles with Sekhmet following them, unknown to them.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Halo's Prison\n| TranslitTitle       = Fukkatsu!

They reach the Pinnacles followed by Sekhmet who plans to kill Sage while he's sleeping, but White Blaze senses his presence and alerts Ryo who starts a battle with him.  Ryo discovers that his armor has grown more powerful since he awakened in the volcano and realizes that he grows stronger with each battle.  Sekhmet blinds him with his poison, but White Blaze saves him and they escape.  Using his swords, Ryo tracks down Sage who is imprisoned in rock while Mia and Ully are captured by Sekhmet and Dynasty soldiers.  Sekhmet attacks Ryo who is no match for him without his sight, but Ryo manages to shatter Sage's prison.  Sage emerges and quickly defeats Sekhmet with his Thunder Bolt Cut, blasting him away.

Finding a whirlpool, the group splits up to find the Warriors: Mia and Sage head north to find Kento (with Talpa sending Cale to do the same) while Ryo, White Blaze and Ully stay to save Cye.  Ryo battles a bunch of Dynasty soldiers and summons his armor to defeat them, while White Blaze takes out two enemy archers.  However, as Ryo heads underwater to find Cye, something goes wrong with his armor and Sekhmet attacks.  It turns out Ryo's armor is being affected by Sekhmet's poison amplified by the water and he is defeated.  Sekhmet heads to finish Cye off before he can awaken, but is attacked by fish and a whale.  He kills all of them, but it allows Ryo's swords to wake Cye.  Cye blasts Sekhmet and rescues Ryo before returning to the water to continue the battle.  As in the water Cye is immune to his poison, Sekhmet brings them to a bridge nearby and beats up Cye.  Ully and White Blaze revive Ryo by dragging him into a fire and he steps in to help Cye.  Combining Cye's Super Wave Smasher and Ryo's Flare Up Now, they defeat Sekhmet which Talpa is not pleased with.

After they are forced to abandon Mia's jeep, Sage heads off on his own and orders Mia to return to the city, but she refuses and follows him.  A snowstorm starts and Mia is attacked by a pack of wild wolves, but is saved by Sage.  Cale tries to take them out with an avalanche, but they jump out of the way and the wolves are swept away by the avalanche.  Knowing it is too dangerous for Mia to leave if Talpa or his Warlords caused that, Sage allows Mia to come with him and they head to a giant rock called The Throne of the Gods.  Mia believes that this is what the line of the poem \"burning within a throne of rock\" meant when it referred to Kento's location.  Cale attacks the two and Sage tries to break the rock with his Thunder Bolt Cut, but does no damage to it.  Cale thrusts his sword into the rock and it will seek out Kento's heart and kill him before he wakes.  Sage and Cale battle, but Sage is unable to defeat him and he and Mia fall over a cliff next a waterfall.  The two fall into a cave and as they lay unconscious, the Ancient One appears and tells Sage that he needs to unlock the full power of his armor by achieving concentration of both mind and body then disappears before Sage wakes up.  Mia decides to distract Cale while Sage rescues Kento and upon reaching a cliff-top, calls Cale out.  He doesn't appear, but she notices the Ancient One and remembers how he dissolved the Circle of Power and gave the Ronins back their armor and saved her and Sage from drowning and wonders why he just doesn't save Kento himself.  As he walks away, Mia calls after him and follows, but he disappears as the snow starts up again.  Cale catches her and dangles her in a waterfall to draw the meditating Sage out.  When that fails, he freezes the waterfall, but Sage emerges and saves Mia.  With his full power unlocked, it restores life to the land and he successfully uses the Thunder Bolt Cut on the rock as the sword reaches Kento.  At first it appears as if Sage acted too late, but Kento bursts out of the rock and causes an explosion that blows Cale away.  With Kento rescued, the three head back to the city to reunite with the others and find Rowen.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = Friend or Foe\n| TranslitTitle       = Genmash\u014d, Rajura no Sakuryaku\n| NativeTitle         = \u5e7b\u9b54\u5c06\u3001\u87ba\u546a\u7f85\u306e\u7b56\u7565\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|6|25}}\n| AltDate             = July 5, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Talpa sends Dais to destroy the Ronin Warriors before they can locate and rescue Rowen.  As they drive back to the city, Mia explains the poem to Sage and Kento, explaining that the last verse that will lead them to Rowen is \"floating amongst the eyes of the ages, unmoored in the stream of the sky,\" but she has no idea what this means.  At a temple, Ryo, Cye, Ully and White Blaze wait for the others, but Ully is captured by Dais.  Ryo and Cye battle him to save Ully and manage to free Ully, but he nearly falls to his death before White Blaze saves him.  Dais easily defeats Ryo and Cye and then claims that he holds Rowen captive and tells them to meet him in the city of Sandai to rescue him.  Ryo and Cye head off to find Rowen, leaving Ully and White Blaze behind to let the others know what happened.  At Sandai, Ryo and Cye find Rowen held captive by Dynasty soldiers.  The two armor up and destroy the soldiers and it is revealed that \"Rowen\" is actually an illusion and that it is really Dais.  Dais creates an illusion so that Ryo and Cye each believe that they are fighting Dais, but are really fighting each other.  The two use their ultimate attacks on each other, and knock each other out, realizing the truth just after they attack.  Dais prepares to finish them, but the others arrive and he decides to do the same to Sage and Kento.  Sage sees through the illusion and drops his weapon, but Kento doesn't and beats Sage up.  After the truth is revealed, Kento turns on Dais and uses his Iron Rock Crusher to drive him off.  While the group recovers from their wounds, Ryo sees a shooting star and realizes that \"unmoored in the stream of the sky\" means that Rowen is floating in outer space and Mia believes that he's right.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = Wildfire in the Sky\n| TranslitTitle       = Rekka, Tenk\u016b o Sukue\n| NativeTitle         = \u70c8\u706b\u3001\u5929\u7a7a\u3092\u3059\u304f\u3048\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|7|2}}\n| AltDate             = July 6, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Now that they know where Rowen is, the Warriors try to figure out how to get to him.  Not having a way to do so themselves, they realize that Talpa will try to destroy Rowen himself and they decide to try to find out what that method will be.  Mia proposes that two of the Warriors find out Talpa's plan while the other two return to the city.  When the Warriors get into an argument about who will go, Mia chooses Cye and Sage herself, but that night, Ryo, Kento and White Blaze sneak off to do the job themselves after telling Ully to tell Mia when she wakes up.  Talpa summons the Nether Spirits to deal with Rowen, explaining to the Warlords that the spirits can combine their powers together to create a massive supernatural construct called a Dark Matrix that will be able to destroy anything it's sent against.  Talpa plans to send it to destroy Rowen.  As Kento and Ryo approach the building where the Dark Matrix is, Talpa sends Dynasty soldiers to distract them.  Though they easily defeat them, the Dark Matrix is launched, but the Ancient One intervenes and destroys it.  Talpa calls upon the spirits again to form another one while sending Anubis to stop Ryo and Kento.  The two battle him, then, knowing they're running out of time, armor up and start climbing the building.  However, the energy from the Dark Matrix strikes Anubis and gives him even more power and then while he battles Ryo and Kento, causes their armor to start squeezing them to death.  The Dark Matrix starts to launch and Ryo, seeing his only chance to save Rowen, jumps on it to ride it into space, but is absorbed by the matrix.  Kento meets up with the others and informs them of what happened and they watch as the Dark Matrix launches into space.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = In the Sea of the Sky\n| TranslitTitle       = Sh\u016bketsu!

Talpa appears to the others and taunts them about the fact that Ryo and Rowen will soon be dead and sends his soldiers to face them.  Anubis asks for a fair fight against Ryo, claiming it won't be victory if the Warriors aren't defeated in a fair fight, but Talpa refuses to listen to him and plans to use the power of the Nether Realm to destroy the Warriors and sends Anubis away.  Inside the Dark Matrix, as Ryo is slowly crushed, he realizes that if he doesn't do something both he and Rowen will die.  Channeling the energy his armor is absorbing, Ryo launches Flare Up Now and destroys the Dark Matrix from within.  Seeing this from the ground, the other Warriors despair, but continue fighting.  Ryo survives the explosion, but passes out and starts to drift out into space.  However, Rowen wakes up and uses his bow to reel Ryo in.  Rowen propels them back to Earth which the other Warriors witness and rejoice.  Anubis senses it too and heads out to stop Ryo and Rowen while Talpa realizes that another power has awakened inside of Anubis.  Rowen doesn't remember what happened and before Ryo can explain, they are attacked by Anubis.  Ryo is injured and weakened from the energy ball and fails when he tries Flare Up Now on Anubis who captures him and Rowen with Quake With Fear.  However, Anubis hesitates to kill the helpless Ryo with his desire for a fair fight conflicting with his Dynasty morals.  Before he can decide, Rowen hits him with Arrow Shockwave.  Anubis survives the attack, but his mask and helmet breaks in half, revealing to a shocked Rowen that he's human.  Anubis tries to attack Rowen again, but is stopped by Talpa himself as his loyalty seems to be faltering.  Talpa teleports Anubis back to his castle.

The group walks along and comes to a bank of thick black fog that's another part of the defenses and Kento tries to enter with a vehicle, but is attacked by streams of energy and driven out.  The energy attacks the rest of the group, but they manage to escape.  In the castle, Talpa summons Dais to deal with the Warriors and he convinces Talpa to open the gates and let the Warriors in so he can draw them into a trap, explaining that their armor will be easier to control inside the castle with the hep of the Nether Spirits.  Talpa agrees, but warns Dais that he will be very angry if Dais fails to stop the Warriors.  The fog is lifted and the group is able to see the four gates to Talpa's castle, but decide to leave Mia and Ully behind as it is too dangerous.  Ryo refuses to listen to Ully's pleas to let him come and slaps him, causing Ully to run off.  Mia follows him and Ryo sends White Blaze after them to protect them while he and the other Warriors enter the gates, closing them behind them.  Dais arrives and opens the gates, summoning the Nether Spirits.  Unable to defeat Dais, the Warriors try to summon their armor, but the spirits block their powers and Dais easily defeats them.  Mia finds Ully who knows Ryo never meant to hurt him and convinces her that they need to help the Warriors.  They notice their friends in trouble and start to go to help them, but the spirits attack them, but the Ancient One's staff appears and drives them away.  Dais ties up the Warriors and offers Ryo his life in exchange for serving Talpa, but Ryo refuses so Dais cuts him down to kill him.  Before he can, Mia, Ully and White Blaze arrive and Dais tries to attack them, but the Ancient One's staff protects them and drives away the spirits.  With the spirits gone, Ryo is able to summon his armor and blasts Dais away with Flare Up Now.  The attack also destroys the castle gates.  Talpa promises that Ryo will fall and won't be able to defeat him.  Ryo apologizes to Ully and thanks him and Mia for saving him.  Mia points out that it was the staff that did it and it causes the Warriors to realize that there's someone on their side trying to help them.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = Shallow Darkness\n| TranslitTitle       = Seiji!

Ully rushes off wanting to find his parents and Mia follows, but an army of Dynasty soldiers attack the Warriors.  The soldiers also go after Mia and Ully along with possessed cars and it forces the Warriors to split up which Sage realizes is the Dynasty's intention: to use Mia and Ully to split the Warriors up so they're weaker.  Sage, Mia and Ully escape the subway only to be confronted by Dynasty soldiers.  Sage armors up and takes them out while across the city the other Warriors take out the soldiers attacking them, but they are scattered.  A building is brought down forcing Sage, Ully and Mia back into the subway where they are confronted by Cale.  He absorbs all the light in the subway and Sage's light power.  Sage is unable to unleash his Thunder Bolt Cut for fear of hitting Mia and Ully and Cale captures him with his Black Lightning Flash.

Kento is skeptical at first that it is really Rowen, but Rowen makes a joke about how he found Kento by his growling stomach and he seems to be convinced.  Meanwhile, Talpa addresses Cale, Dais and Sekhmet and informs them that together the Ronin armors are unbeatable, but now that they're separate, they are vulnerable.  He plans to use the Ronins own strengths against them and assigns Dais to the task, though he doesn't tell him the plan.  In the subway, Kento is anxious to get out and find the others and suggests blasting out while Rowen cautions that their job is to protect and rebuild and not destroy.  Two subway trains come at them, sending them different ways on the track to separate them again.  Rowen manages to get out of the way by clinging to the celing, but Kento has to battle several Dynasty soldiers on his train and when it heads for a pile of rock, climbs on top to escape, but is thrown into a field.  There he sees images of the Dark Warlords and Talpa speaks to him.  Talpa reveals that the field contains the bones of every mortal that fell to the Ronin armor and that the Ronin armors and the Warlord armors have the same origin.  He also reveals that the Ronin armors used to be worn by men that used them to conquer and that while the people wearing them grow stronger the more they're used, so too grows the bloodlust.  Talpa believes that it will eventually bring the Warriors over to his side and that they will help him conquer everything.  The other Warriors attack Kento and he defeats them, but it is revealed to be all just one of Dais' illusions.  He and Talpa try to convince Kento to join them, telling him that the armor contains evil and that its bloodthirsty nature will eventually overwhelm him and cause him to turn.  Dais and Talpa claim that Kento's armor was always the most blood-thirsty of the group and thus he will be the first to turn.  Dais sends an illusion of an army at Kento and while he realizes what it is, he feels the urge to kill.  Kento armors up and battles Dais and when he grows angry, the armor seems to take control of him somewhat.  After taunting Kento by attacking him in the guise of his friends, Dais causes Kento to hit him with Iron Rock Crusher.  The attack shatters the illusion and blasts Dais away, but also causes destruction in the city, attracting Rowen to Kento's position.  Talpa speaks to Kento, telling him to look at the destruction he caused and saying he proved that all Kento will cause is destruction and that he will soon join his side.  Rowen and Kento reunite, but Kento now has doubts about the nature of his and the other Ronins armor and what will happen.  Talpa congratulates Dais and tells him his plan is not over yet and that Anubis will handle the next part.

Anubis protests at first, but after the spirits powers take effect, he breaks free of his binds and is sent by Talpa to enact the next phase of his plan.  At an amusement park, while Ully heads off with White Blaze to play, Dynasty soldiers attack.  Sage battles them and is nearly beaten, but is saved by Ryo and Cye.  Together they defeat the Dynasty soldiers in the park and in a subway and decide that following the subway might lead them to Talpa's castle.  Rowen and Kento arrive having followed the sounds of battle, but Kento displays doubts about his future when they refer to the soldiers as \"Dynasty twerps\" wondering if he'll become a \"Dynasty twerp\" too when his armor turns him evil.  Anubis arrives, his eyes glowing red occasionally and proves to be more powerful than ever.  The Warriors except for Kento armor up, with Kento's own doubts combined with Anubis being human increasing his fear of what he could become.  At the insistence of the others, Kento tries to power up, but fails due to his fears about his armor.  Kento explains what happened to the others and his fears that if he uses the armor he will become like the Dark Warlords.  As a result, Kento refuses to fight with his armor and without it, the other Warriors are weakened and no match for Anubis.  Talpa is pleased as without Kento the Warriors will be easy for Anubis, who the Nether Spirits are keeping in control, to defeat.  Anubis proves too powerful for the Warriors and defeats them with his Quake With Fear.  The Ancient One appears nearby and tells the Warriors to trust their armor, that it responds to what's in their hearts.  Anubis goes to finish Ryo, but Ully and White Blaze try to stop him.  Anubis easily throws them aside, injuring them, but Ully's courage causes Kento to summon his armor, saying that Ully taught him what real courage is.  Anubis tries to attack again with Quake With Fear, but Kento hits him with Iron Rock Crusher.  Not only does Kento's attack knock Anubis out, but it drives the spirits influence from his body.  However, it leaves the Warriors wondering what does it mean for them that a human is wearing evil armor.  Talpa tries to pull Anubis back to his castle, but the Ancient One intervenes and pulls Anubis to him instead.  Talpa is furious while the Warriors realize that the Ancient One has arrived to help them which he confirms.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 15\n| Title               = The Ancient's Battle\n| TranslitTitle       = Kaosu, Shukumei no Taiketsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u30ab\u30aa\u30b9\u3001\u5bbf\u547d\u306e\u5bfe\u6c7a\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|13}}\n| AltDate             = July 14, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, Ully and Mia meet with the Ancient One in a park. The Ancient One commends the Ronin Warriors for all of the good they have done so far and Mia for helping to bring the Warriors together. The Ancient One confirms that the Ronin and Warlord armors do share the same origin and that they can be bent to either good or evil. According to the Ancient One, Talpa knows that the armors can be used to destroy him and will be working to bend the Warriors armors to evil and Talpa can bend the Ronin armor to his will if goodness isn't in the Ronins hearts and souls. Anubis awakens and the Ancient One stops the Warriors from attacking him so he can talk to him and try to convince him to change sides. By this point, Anubis has seen enough that he understands that Talpa is only using him for his armor and the Ancient One explains that the nine armors were once all one and are formed out of human emotions. Anubis' virtue is Loyalty which means he is loyal to whoever is his master, but the Ancient One points out that Anubis can choose his own master. The Ancient One walks away after telling Anubis to no longer be controlled by Talpa (which he has been for over a thousand years) and to pick his own path and follow it. Realizing Anubis is lost to him, Talpa sends all three Dark Warlords to attack Anubis and retrieve his armor. By the time they arrive, Anubis has come to the conclusion that the Ancient One is right and fights back against them but is easily defeated. However, before the Warlords can take Anubis to Talpa, the Ronin Warriors attack and engage them in battle. The Warriors hold off the Warlords, but Talpa blinds them temporarily with a bolt of energy, allowing the Warlords to escape with Anubis. The Warriors are more determined than ever to attack Talpa's castle and defeat him and the Ancient One agrees to become the bridge to the castle, but worries about the power of the Dark Side within. In the castle, Anubis is brought before Talpa and tries to no avail to convince the other Warlords of the truth and is thrown in the dungeon. The Warlords ask for the power of the Dark Side to make them stronger so they can defeat the Warriors, but Talpa reveals the source is pure evil and demands they prove themselves ready for the power. As the Warriors discuss the upcoming attack on the castle and Ryo's fears about what the Ancient One told them about their armor, the Ancient One summons Talpa and does battle with him. The Ancient One is no match for Talpa and is destroyed, but as his last act he turns himself into a bridge to Talpa's castle. The Warriors hear the commotion and are saddened when they realize the Ancient One's sacrifice, but prepare themselves to make use of it to finally assault Talpa's castle. At the same time, Talpa is aware of what the Ancient One planned and is amused, planning to let the Warriors in, confident in his coming victory.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 16\n| Title               = Raid on Talpa's Castle\n| TranslitTitle       = Totsuny\u016b, Arago-j\u014d\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a81\u5165\u3001\u30a2\u30e9\u30b4\u57ce\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|8|20}}\n| AltDate             = July 17, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ronin Warriors, leaving behind Mia, Ully and White Blaze who wish them good luck, enter the Ancient One's bridge. Talpa sends the Nether Spirits to destroy the bridge and the Warriors and collect their armor and they nearly succeed, but the spirit of the Ancient One is able to channel the bridge's energy and destroy the spirits. Upon arrival at the castle, the Warriors are attacked by Dynasty soldiers and after fighting for a while, summon their armor and Rowen destroys them with Arrow Shockwave. However, when Ryo tries to use Flare Up Now against the castle, it just rebounds on him. Talpa then sends the Dark Warlords, now with increased power from the Nether Spirits to attack the Warriors. Their attacks easily overpower the Warriors and the Warlords warn them not to go on or face destruction, but the Warriors decide to push on anyways. Entering the castle, they end up separated and Sage is confronted by Cale, Ryo and Cye by Sekhmet and Rowen and Kento by Dais. Cye and Kento go up against Sekhmet and Dais one on one to allow Ryo and Rowen to go confront Talpa and the two meet up and finally confront Talpa face to face and demand answers. Talpa explains that as his Nether World grows bigger he needs the Earth as his world feeds off the anger and hatred in humans. He explains that just with the humans from Toyama he is able to create an unending army of Nether Spirits and Dynasty soldiers to take over the world. Ryo and Rowen attack Talpa to no avail with both of their attacks being deflected back at them and Ryo even getting blown outside the castle.

Meanwhile, Mia and Ully become determined to help the Ronin Warriors and ride White Blaze through the bridge to the castle where they dodge Dynasty attacks. Talpa watches as the Warriors fight with some success against the Warlords and realizes that their armor grows stronger the more they battle and he needs that for himself. When the Warriors manage to get past the Warlords, Talpa calls them off and demands the Warlords give their armor to him. They agree and Talpa absorbs the Warlords and starts building a physical body for himself. Mia, Ully and White Blaze find Ryo in a lot of pain and come under attack by a Dynasty army but are saved by Rowen and Cye and Rowen destroys most of the army with Arrow Shockwave. The Ronins then destroy much of the rest and form an energy pyramid that destroys the rest. Talpa reveals that the source of the armor is that it originally belonged to him before the Ancient One stole it and tried to hide it from him and attacks with his hand, injuring Ryo and causing his armor to disappear and absorbing Rowen, Cye and Kento. Meanwhile, Anubis escapes from his prison to help. Mia and Ully are captured by more Dynasty soldiers while White Blaze is surrounded, but Anubis saves them.

However, before he can harm or absorb Ryo, the other Warriors, who are still alive inside Talpa, fight back and manage to force Talpa to let Ryo go. Ryo becomes determined to find someway to free his friends and kill Talpa, but is unsure how while Talpa grows stronger by feeding off the fear of the people he has captured which gives Mia and Ully hope as that means that Ully's parents and the other people Talpa has captured are still alive. Talpa chases Ryo who is reluctant to destroy him as doing so will kill the other Ronin Warriors. Ryo is nearly absorbed by Talpa, but White Blaze saves him and they fight Talpa who forces the other Ronin Warriors to use their attacks against Ryo.

However, the spirit of the Ancient One appears to him to show him how Talpa tried to take over the world in the past. The Ancient One shows Ryo how he defeated Talpa and killed him, but Talpa swore that with his armor he would return one day and returned to the Nether World as a soul. The Ancient One, knowing that with Talpa's armor still intact this is still possible and unable to destroy it, splits the armor into the five Ronin and four Warlord armors to diffuse Talpa's armor's power. The nine armors are thus linked, but according to the Ancient One, not necessarily to Talpa's evil. While all of the armors are made up of the parts of the human spirit, the Ronins are linked to the purest parts of it while the other armors are more easily corruptible and eventually returned to Talpa's side. The Ancient One explains that while the armors can be used for either good or evil, it is the wearer's soul that determines which side that armor is on. Unfortunately, after the Ancient One explains all of this, Ryo is absorbed by Talpa who sends out a blast of energy that causes destruction in the city below. Inside Talpa, Ryo watches as the spirit of the Ancient One apologizes to the Warriors for involving them in the battle against Talpa who appears and tries to make Ryo despair by claiming his friends now hate and feel betrayed by him. Ryo refuses to give into despair and calls upon his friends to help him fight once more. Ryo emerges from Talpa and absorbs the power of the other four armors to form a new armor, the Inferno Armor. With the Inferno, Ryo is more than a match for Talpa and blasts him with Flare Up Now, destroying him and his castle and releasing the other Ronin Warriors.

After having stopped to get a drink, a gate to the Nether World appears in front of Rowen and Sage and Saranbo arrives to attack them. Saranbo proves to be more than a match for them and demands to know which of them holds the Inferno armor and leaves after blasting them and discovering that neither holds it. They inform Cye, Kento and Mia about this but don't tell Ryo as he is still exhausted from his fight with Talpa and needs more time to recover. Deciding to keep it from Ryo and protect him, they lure Saranbo into a trap, but he is unscathed by even the combined power of Arrow Shockwave and Thunder Bolt Cut and easily defeats them. Upon learning that none of them possess the armor, he goes in search of Ryo leaving the others captured. Saranbo finds Ryo and tells him he has captured his friends and demands he find them. Ryo and White Blaze head out in search of the others and upon finding them, come under attack by Saranbo.

Ryo is upset that he can't trust his own swords and Ully suggests finding him a new one, causing Mia to come up with the idea that maybe there is another sword meant to work with the Inferno armor which she looks through her grandfather's data for. Mia finds a special pair of swords meant for the original wearer of the Inferno armor called the Soul Swords of Fervor or the Soul Swords which legend states is hidden at the base of a volcano and protected by a special divine power. Black Blaze appears and he and White Blaze fight. Eventually Black Blaze disappears, but not before the Warriors realize he's from the Nether World and become even more determined to get the Swords of Fervor. However, Lord Saber Stryke is nearby and is determined to get the Inferno armor and reveals he possesses the Swords of Fervor which he won't give up easily. The Warriors, Mia, Ully and White Blaze travel to the location the Swords are supposed to be and find them in an energy triangle which the Warriors dissipate with their armors power. However, when Ryo gets the swords, he realizes that they are fakes and Lord Saber Stryke appears, revealing to them that he possesses the real swords and challenging them to a fight for the swords. The Warriors prove no match for Lord Saber Stryke so Ryo forms the Inferno. Lord Saber Stryke reveals that his old enemy is Talpa who he indicates is still alive and that he wishes for the Inferno armor to defeat him. Ryo launches Flare Up Now at Lord Saber Stryke, but his swords shatter and Lord Saber Stryke goes to kill him. However, White Blaze jumps in and takes the blow for Ryo and honoring White Blaze's courage, Lord Saber Stryke leaves, but promises a rematch. White Blaze collapses from his wounds and the Warriors, Ully and Mia rush to his side.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 23\n| Title               = White Blaze's Sacrifice\n| TranslitTitle       = Byakuen Shi o Kaketa Tatakai\n| NativeTitle         = \u767d\u708e\u6b7b\u3092\u304b\u3051\u305f\u6226\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|10|22}}\n| AltDate             = July 26, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Lord Saber Stryke locates the still-alive Talpa and does battle with him, but proves unable to defeat him and is knocked into a chasm which Black Blaze jumps after him into.

The volcano erupts at his arrival, but the warlord uses black ice to calm it. At the same time, Ully, Mia, White Blaze and Ryo visit another volcano in an attempt to fix the Swords of Wildfire. The power of the volcano successfully repairs the swords and the group heads back home, but Ryo senses the nearby presence of the warrior, though he dismisses it. On the ride home, Ully encourages Mia to race White Blaze who seems to be back to normal after being restored by Black Blaze, the power of whom he now carries inside. At home, the Warriors see a news report about the eruption of Mount Aso and the ice that now covers it and decide to investigate. On the road, the warrior appears and Ryo engages in a battle with him, but proves to be no match for him. The warrior proves to be more than a match for all of the Warriors together and nearly kills Ryo before White Blaze knocks him away, knocking off his cloak. The warrior introduces himself as Sun Devil and explains that he was sent by his master to test their armors limits, but refuses to identify that master.

He creates an evil clone of Cye with the same armor, but red and more powerful. This clone will be powerful enough to defeat the Warriors. Talpa is worried that they will be defeated again because of their reliance on the art of fighting battles, but Sekhmet is confident that he has accounted for that problem. Meanwhile, Ryo worries about being able to control the intense power created by the combination of the Soul Swords and the Armor of Inferno while everyone else worries about it as well as the fact that the Dynasty nearly overpowered them with its evil. That night, Ryo dreams that he tests his strength by using Flare Up Now to cut a massive boulder in half which works, but the Ancient One's spirit appears to tell him that strength alone isn't enough to defeat Talpa and the forces of evil, he must also fight the battle with his heart. He then appears in the dreams of all the other Warriors to give them advice and the next day, Kento believes that they need to find their center to find the balance the Ancient One was talking about and they take off to do so. Cye travels to the ocean, but is attacked by Dynasty soldiers. After defeating them, he comes face to face with his evil clone, Red Torrent and proves to be no match for him, forced to take the battle out of the water due to Red Torrent possessing Sekhmet's poison which starts affecting the ocean and being overpowered by Red Torrent's Super Wave Smasher when they fire at each other. The Ancient One's spirit appears again and tells Cye to ignore the turmoil and strength of his foe and find the peace in the battle. Cye realizes this is like how a whale let a powerful current carry him. The Ancient One tells him not to fight, but to swim into the stream of its nature and Cye clears his mind and searches for a solution. Red Torrent shoots his poisonous Super Wave Smasher and Cye decides to absorb the attack and use his armor to purify the water. The effort works and Cye, his power strengthened, blasts Red Torrent with his own Super Wave Smasher, destroying Red Torrent. However, a wave of poison emerges from Red Torrent's remains and Cye's attempt to stop it fails and he is overwhelmed by the attack and passes out. Sekhmet reveals himself and captures Cye, taking him through a gate to the Nether World.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 26\n| Title               = The Armor Must Be Destroyed\n| TranslitTitle       = K\u014drin yo, Hikari o Torimodose\n| NativeTitle         = \u5149\u8f2a\u3088\u3001\u5149\u3092\u3068\u308a\u3082\u3069\u305b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|11|19}}\n| AltDate             = July 31, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = The Ancient One's spirit tells Sage to rely on mind, skill and spirit and not just the strength of his armor to overcome evil, saying that harnessing those three things will allow him to attain an even greater strength. In order to do so, Sage returns to the caves at the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles where the Armor of Halo was created and the source of its power. At the Pinnacles, Sage saves a deer from a pack of wolves who run away when he starts glowing. The deer and its herd, also fearing Sage, run away from him. Meanwhile, Talpa summons Cale and sends him to go after Sage to try to turn him to the side of evil, believing that once the Ronin Warriors see their true power, they will switch sides. Cale approaches Sage and explains that the wolves and the deer ran from him because they sensed the evil of his armor and fear it. Cale claims that the armors purpose is to bring destruction to the world and attacks. Cale battles Sage, trying to convince him of the armors evil power and for Sage to turn to evil, telling him that the armor makes him continually fight and destroy. Fearing this might be true, Sage powers down his armor and runs, hiding in a waterfall and meditating. In order to show Sage how cold and dark the heart of a Dynasty warlord is, Cale covers everything, including all living creatures in ice and snow, freezing Sage in the waterfall and tries to convince him to help destroy the world. In an attempt to drive Sage to evil, Cale revives and controls five deer and makes them attack Sage, trying to force him to kill them and drive him further from good, but when it fails, Cale kills them again. Sage summons his armor to fight Cale again, understanding that while his strength may come from the Dynasty, he still controls it with his mind. Sage unleashes the Thunder Bolt Cut, defeating Cale, but blasting off the top of the caves. Cale tells Sage he has now become a Dynasty warrior before collapsing and not wanting to give into the evil in the armor, Sage separates it from him and cuts it in half with his sword. However, his sword channels the power of his own spirit and repairs the armor and realizing that this is not an evil power, Sage regains faith in his mind, skill and spirit to overcome evil.  This causes life to be restored to the land. However, this leaves Sage vulnerable and Talpa opens a gate to the Nether Realm and captures Sage and the Armor of Halo.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 27\n| Title               = Sand Blasted\n| TranslitTitle       = Ikare Kong\u014d, Suna Y\u014dja o Kudake\n| NativeTitle         = \u6012\u308c\u91d1\u525b\u3001\u7802\u5996\u90aa\u3092\u304f\u3060\u3051\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1988|11|26}}\n| AltDate             = August 1, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Having already captured Cye and Sage, Talpa decides to send Dais to capture another Ronin and Dais picks Kento. Dais reveals that he has a plan that Kento's brute strength will be no match against and asks for the help of the Twin Sand Strikers which Talpa agrees to as Dais has served him well in the past. As Kento dozes as he makes his journey, he remembers what the Ancient One's spirit told him in his dream: that while he is the strongest among the Ronin Warriors, one great force cannot ruin another and that he must use the spirit of the armor to push his way through the \"sands of deception\", telling him to know them and to \"see what is not there.\" At a construction site, Kento is confronted by Dais who he is shocked to see alive and is attacked by the Sand Strikers. Dais claims the Dynasty is unstoppable and while the Sand Strikers hold Kento down, sends a wrecking ball at him. Kento dodges and battles the Sand Strikers, apparently destroying them with the wrecking ball, but they survive and bring part of a building down on top of him. However, Dais prevents them from killing Kento, telling them he wants Kento to suffer and telling Kento to continue his quest, that he'll be waiting for him. The three then travel to a forest which they petrify to await Kento's arrival. Kento arrives and battles Dais, unleashing Iron Rock Crusher twice and causing the area to turn into a desert. Dais reminds Kento how he once revealed to him that the stronger he gets the stronger the hold of evil on him and tells him that the world will end up just like it if he insists on fighting. Kento battles the Sand Strikers again, but when he unleashes Iron Rock Crusher once more, they simply absorb the power and easily beat him and Dais leaves to tell Talpa of his victory. Kento wakes up and to confuse him, the Sand Strikers dash around so fast that it appears there are many of them. Remembering what the Ancient One told him, Kento taps into the spirit of the armor which he realizes is a part of the natural energy flowing through the Earth and is able to see where the Sand Strikers really are. Using this, Kento unleashes Iron Rock Crusher again and destroys the Sand Strikers. Kento finally understands that in order to use all of his armor's strength, he must focus all of its power.

Anubis convinces them of his sincerity and accepting him as a friend, they invite him to stay with them. Anubis explains to them how four hundred years ago he was a warrior that had become extremely power-hungry and bloodthirsty which caused him to join Talpa, but the Ancient One showed him that that wasn't a good thing and that Talpa wasn't his destiny as he thought. He now realizes that his destiny is to stop Talpa. Anubis senses the presence of Dais and forces him to show himself.

The five Ronin armors combined together to form the Inferno and it was worn by the first Ronin Warrior, Hariel. Ryo and Rowen continue battling Dala who taunts them about the fact that Ryo refuses to summon the Inferno to fight because it might drain their friends of the last of their energy and kill them. Badamon continues his explanation, telling the Warlords that the Inferno defeated the evil force plaguing the world long ago and that what they have seen is just the beginning of the Inferno's power, that nothing can stop it and even he doesn't know the full power of the Inferno, but that it is rumored that at full power it could destroy the world and leave behind a void. Talpa explains that he wants to conquer the armor for just that purpose, to build a new world under his control. Badamon plans to be the one to control the armor which he claims he can do with just a bit more time. Rowen rides off on a horse, leaving Ryo to battle Dala on his own, telling him to summon the Inferno.

Meanwhile, Ryo and Rowen contemplate how the Dark Warlords almost seemed to turn good and worry about their friends. Needing to stop Anubis, Mia and Ully from finding the Jewel, Badamon dispatches a Dynasty warrior named Gash to stop them, explaining that legend says that the Jewel is the heart of the nine armors and beats strong in the heart of the pure and gives strength to the weak and thus is a threat to Talpa and his empire. Mia uncovers the same thing, reading that the Jewel gives the armors their power and figuring out with Anubis that it must be in Jewel Lake. The three head there with Anubis planning to travel to the Nether World afterwards to help the Ronin Warriors, but refusing to allow Ully and Mia to come as it is too dangerous. At Jewel Lake, Anubis parts the water with the Ancient One's staff and is able to use the staff to open the tomb that's revealed at the bottom. In the tomb they find the armors of the Ancients that guard the tomb, murals of the battles between Hariel and evil in the past and the Jewel of Life. When Ully picks up the Jewel, the Ancient One speaks to them telling them that only the pure of heart can use the Jewel as in evil hands it could destroy the world. Gash arrives with Dynasty soldiers and attacks, but the Ancient armors, possessed by the souls of their wearers, destroy the soldiers and when Gash threatens Mia and Ully, Anubis stabs him through the back with the Ancient One's staff, killing him. At the Ancient One's request, Anubis releases the souls in the armors to move on, their job now finished and puts the Jewel around Mia's neck when Ully gives it to him, saying that Ully and Mia are the purest of heart people he knows and they will all go together to save their friends.\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 34\n| Title               = Strata's Defiant Stand\n| TranslitTitle       = Tenk\u016b, Kizudarake no Tatakai\n| NativeTitle         = \u5929\u7a7a\u3001\u50b7\u3060\u3089\u3051\u306e\u6226\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1989|1|28}}\n| AltDate             = August 10, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Anubis, Mia and Ully contemplate the power of the Jewel of Life and wonder how it is supposed to defeat Talpa and Mia gives it to Ully to wear. Meanwhile Dynasty soldiers cause havok and destruction in the city, easily repelling all human efforts to stop them. Badamon approaches Talpa with fears about allowing Ryo and Rowen free rein within the castle before a structure the Nether Spirits are building which Badamon calls the Tower of Pain is completed due to the unfathomable power of the Inferno Armor, but Talpa assures him that they won't be free for long as he is drawing them into a trap. At Mia's home, Anubis contemplates the war with the Dynasty and looks for a sign from the Ancient One when it will be time for him to complete his own destiny when suddenly the Ancient One's staff and the Jewel of Life glow, causing snow. Ryo and Rowen continue to make their way through the maze, avoiding Dynasty soldiers and trying to find a way into the castle. They get sucked into a wall while trying to climb it and end up trapped in the dungeon. Upon blasting their way out of the room, they are confronted by Lady Kayura. The two fight her to no avail and she tricks Ryo into launching Flare Up Now at her then dodges, causing him to hit a structure which drains his armor of power. Rowen is unable to stop it and Ryo is completely drained while the effects are seen in the mortal world as Talpa's castle flickering in and out of view, causing Anubis to say that the Dynasty is rising again. While wondering what to do, both the staff and the Jewel of Life glow again and Anubis finally understands what he has to do to help the others. As Ryo is unconscious and completely drained, Rowen holds off Lady Kayura while sending White Blaze to carry Ryo to safety. Rowen battles Lady Kayura but is no match for her, getting blasted so high into the air at one point that he nearly falls to his death before his armor saves him. At the same time, Anubis uses both the Jewel of Life and the Ancient One's staff to carry him, Mia and Ully to Ryo and Rowen to help them out. During his fight with Lady Kayura, Rowen spots White Blaze carry Ryo onto a barge and take off and he lands on the barge to protect them but is defeated. However, as Anubis, Mia and Ully approach, the power of the Jewel of Life causes a water spout that knocks Lady Kayura off the barge and forces her back ashore. Mia, Ully and Anubis land on the barge and reunite with exhausted Ryo and Rowen who are re-energized by the Jewel's power\n| LineColor           = aaa\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 35\n| Title               = The Warriors Return\n| TranslitTitle       = Yomigaere, Gaisenshitachi yo...\n| NativeTitle         = \u3088\u307f\u304c\u3048\u308c\u3001\u93a7\u6226\u58eb\u9054\u3088\u2026\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1989|2|4}}\n| AltDate             = August 11, 1995\n| ShortSummary        = Off-shore, Ryo, Rowen, Mia, Ully, White Blaze and Anubis are confronted by Lady Kayura and a bunch of Dynasty soldiers and Ryo and Rowen fight them, having no luck against Lady Kayura. Meanwhile, Talpa speaks with Badamon who has prepared altars for the nine armors and has been having his Nether Spirits \"purify\" the bodies of the Dark Warlords who Talpa only sees as useful tools. Anubis and White Blaze successfully protect Mia and Ully from Dynasty soldiers while Ryo and Rowen battle against more soldiers and Lady Kayura with little luck. Realizing they need the other Ronin Warriors to win, Rowen sacrifices himself to buy them some more time by blasting Lady Kayura into the air and trying to fight her there, but is instead defeated and apparently killed. Ryo prepares to continue the battle with Lady Kayura, but Anubis interrupts and tells Ryo to let him handle it while Ryo goes off to rescue the other Ronin Warriors. Ryo agrees and leaves Anubis to continue the fight. Dynasty soldiers attack Mia and Ully, but the Jewel of Life protects them and kills the soldiers. Knowing that the Jewel is a mystical artifact that poses a threat to the Dynasty and not wanting to risk Mia and Ully uncovering its powers, Badamon suggests they do something about it, but Talpa isn't worried, believing that the Ronins and their allies have no way of using the three mystical artifacts that could spell doom for the Dynasty: the Inferno Armor, the Soul Swords of Fervor and the Jewel. Anubis is able to hold his own against Lady Kayura with the Ancient One's staff protecting him, however, to his surprise, the staff will not strike down Lady Kayura for some reason. Rowen is dropped into a cavern where it is revealed he faked his death and he finds the other Ronin Warriors completely drained of power which has turned them into statues. Rowen uses the strength of his armor's power of Life in the form of his arrows to try to awaken the others before collapsing. Ryo arrives near the other Warriors and is confronted by the Dark Warlords and defeated, however, Ully, Mia and White Blaze arrive and when Ully rushes forward to help, the Jewel protects Ryo and harms the Dark Warlords, driving them off.

However, the Dark Warlords demand to fight them instead and when Ryo, Cye and Kento charge them, drop them through trap doors to separate them and head off to face them, leaving Sage and Rowen to face Lady Kayura. Ryo, Sage and Cye land in a pit which is filled with water, but Cye manages to find an exit which he blasts open, dropping the three into a chasm. While Ryo and Kento manage to hang onto the side of the chasm, Cye falls in and later Dais and Sekhmet knock Kento and Ryo in. Sage and Rowen battle Lady Kayura, targeting her amulet while trying to protect Ully and Mia at the same time from Dynasty soldiers when the Jewel of Life doesn't seem to be doing anything. Cale confronts Cye in the chasm, using the darkness there to his advantage as Cye can't see where he is while Cale can see him and attack. At the same time, Kento faces Dais who grows to a giant size to fight him which doesn't seem to be an illusion while Ryo faces Sekhmet who traps Ryo in a sea of acidic venom which will slowly eat away at his armor and then his body. Anubis, who is nearby, is confused when the Ancient One's staff glows and remembers how it wouldn't let him harm Lady Kayura and how she disappeared after it didn't. Anubis realizes that it might be a sign that Ryo is in trouble and heads off to help him while Sage and Rowen continue to protect Mia and Ully, but are outnumbered. Just in time, Anubis reaches Ryo and rescues him from the poison with the staff and drives Sekhmet away. As Kento is about to be killed by the giant Dais, Anubis causes Dais disappear using the staff and Ryo is able to convince Kento that Anubis is now on their side and they head off together.

The Warriors reluctantly accept this, but warn Anubis that they won't hold back on Lady Kayura if they encounter her as she fights with Talpa. Meanwhile, Lady Kayura sits in her room and flashes back on her life which she is able to do as her amulet is cracked. She remembers that she is the last remaining member of the Ancient One's people who has great supernatural powers as a result. Lady Kayura takes her amulet off again and resists the evil, worrying Badamon and Talpa as without Lady Kayura he doesn't have the power of the Ancient One's clan on his side when the shrines he's building for the nine armors are complete, saying that his plan to unite the Dynasty and mortal world under his control is impossible without her help. However, Badamon proposes letting her regain her memories and then having him possess her mind and soul so she will be completely under their control, but they know they need to keep Anubis away for the plan to work so Talpa sends the Dark Warlords to deal with him. The Warriors battle an army of Dynasty soldiers and armor up to deal with them, which they easily do, but are confused by the fact that no stronger enemies appear to fight like Lady Kayura or the Dark Warlords.

Badamon explains that the nine armors forever link the mortal realm and the Nether World which has always been the Warlords purpose. Mia confirms this, saying that there is an old legend that mentions nine keys which she realizes means the nine armors and warns that the whole world could possibly be destroyed as a result of this.

Badamon and the Nether Spirits, rejoicing in this, fly through the gateway to the mortal world. Ryo tries Flare Up Now on Talpa, but he just jumps in the river and puts out the flames and climbs a tower. Lady Kayura warns Ryo to be careful as the tower is filled with the essence of pain and is behind the Dynasty's evil power and it could turn Ryo evil like she once was.

The African maiden speaks to the warrior, whose name is revealed as Mukala, and asks why he brought the Ronin Warriors to fight in a distant land and if that is what the Black Inferno Armor wants. Mia notices that there is no record of the Black Inferno Armor, but is able to deduce that Mukala is located in Tanzania based on dialogue that they heard from him. Ryo and Sage are freed by the African maiden, who reveals her name as Naria and is engaged to Mukala, who is following an ancient tradition. As the strongest warrior in the village, he is able to don the Black Inferno Armor. Naria says that the White Inferno Armor and Black Inferno Armor cannot meet and begs them not to fight. Ryo tells Naria that he cannot summon his Inferno Armor without the others. Naria is surprised, saying that Mukala is able to summon the Black Inferno on his own, and that it may be testing Ryo and the White Inferno Armor. She also says the Black Inferno Armor is worshiped in their tribe, the Taulagi, as a god. Ryo is soon called to fight Mukala in a ritual, which Naria is vehemently against. She frees Ryo and Sage but they are soon found by Mukala. Ryo and Sage attack Mukala with their strongest moves, but Mukala emerges from the rubble unscathed.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Started Running Armor\n| TranslitTitle       = Hashirihajimeta Yoroi\n| NativeTitle         = \u8d70\u308a\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u93a7\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1989|12|1}}\n| AltDate             = April 2, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Mukala continues his attack on Ryo and Sage. Naria pleads with them to stop fighting, to which Ryo and Sage abide. They deduce that it is their armors that want to fight rather than themselves. Ryo refuses to fight and is then savagely beaten by Mukala. Sage saves Ryo from a fatal blow and resolves to keep fighting, but he too realizes that they have become pawns in a battle between the two Inferno Armors. He decides to stop fighting as well. Cye, still separated from the group and questioning his will to fight, is found by White Blaze. Kento, Rowen, Mia and Ully travel to Nairobi, Tanzania to find Ryo and Sage. They decide to decipher the conflict between the two armors rather leaving it as a contest of strength. As they attempt to locate the Taulagi village, they are attacked by the tribe. Kento and Ully become separated from Rowen and Mia, but spot Naria and follow her to Ryo and Sage's location. Rowen and Mia discover engravings in a cave, which speaks of The Tree of Life, whose evil light will inspire the people and save them from all that threaten their lives. The Tree of Life forms the entrance to their valley, while all is underneath the Black Inferno Armor. Kento attempts to rescue Ryo and Sage but is intercepted by Mukala. Kento's armor then flashes a darker color as he attempts to battle Mukala, which Ully notices as appearing more evil. Mia reads on the cave walls that if the Black and White Inferno Armors, which were both born in the valley, were to ever meet, that it would release an energy that would be too much for the universe to bear. Rowen's armor unlocks a power within the crystals around them which causes the lightning to strike The Tree of Life. More dark crystals arise, which Mukala uses to don the Black Inferno Armor. Rowen then arrives and tells Kento to stop fighting, telling them that another person's will is manipulating all of them into a dishonest fight. Naria tells Mukala the the armor has been influencing him negatively. Kento and Rowen attempt to attack Mukala, but both notice that it is their armor's will that is forcing them to fight rather than their own. Both then free themselves from their armor, to which Mia notices that there is a split between their armors as well as their own virtues that represent the forces of good. Back in Japan, Cye then retrieves his Armor of Torrent, saying he will wear it again to save his friends, but also to test to see whether his will is stronger than his armor's.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = The More Than Sadness, Seek!\n| TranslitTitle       = Kanashimi o Koeru Mono o Motomete!\n| NativeTitle         = \u60b2\u3057\u307f\u3092\u8d85\u3048\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3092\u3001\u6c42\u3081\u3066!\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|1990|1|11}}\n| AltDate             = April 2, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = Naria, Mia and Ully attempt to find ingredients to make medicine for the ailing Ronin Warriors. Mia again reiterates her belief that it was their armors that forced them to fight, rather than the Ronin Warriors themselves. Cye soon finds the group and uses his virtue to restore Ryo, Sage, Rowen, and Kento back to health. They notice the virtue has disappeared from his armor, noticing it must be removing themselves during this conflict. Naria explains the history of the armor and their tribe: the Black Inferno Armor appeared in the Valley of the Black Crystal, and that the Talaugi were worshiped because of this. The Black Inferno Armor was always worn by their tribe and protected them from outside influence, but one day it showed that it could move on its own power and revealed a darker side. When Mukala discovered there was another Inferno Armor, the Black Inferno Armor ordered that it find and fight it, to which Mukala obeyed. Naria is dismayed that Mukala has become overpowered by the Black Inferno Armor. Black Blaze soon separates himself from White Blaze, which then separates Cye from the Armor of Torrent, which moves on its own accord. The Ronin Warriors then decide to destroy both Inferno Armors, saying that the armors without virtue become sinister forces. Naria pleads with Mukala to end the conflict, but to no avail. White Blaze is soon attacked by the tribe, which then capture Mia, Ully and Naria. Black Blaze gives the Armor of Torrent to Mukala, who summons the other armors to create the Inferno Armor. The Ronin Warriors soon find Mukala, and though he attacks them, they state that they do not wish to fight them but rather want to confront their armors. The two armors manipulate the sun and moon, which creates an lunar eclipse that darkens the land. The Ronin Warriors see visions of the end of the world that would result from the two armors lust for battle. They resolve to let their virtues win, and summon their own armor to battle The Inferno Armor, which is now acting on its own will. Despite being initially unable to cause any damage, the five decide to fight with their spirits as one, attacking The Inferno Armor with the power of their virtues. This defeats the evil spirit residing within, and Ryo is able to don The Inferno Armor once again. Ryo then commences battle with Mukala, who has donned the Black Inferno armor. Ryo again pleads with Mukala to end the battle, saying that an armor that has abandoned its spirit can only bring death. While the two continue to fight, their attacks bring shockwaves onto the landscape; Naria and White Blaze are soon caught in the crossfire and are dealt fatal blows. Mukala, mortified, surveys the damage; the Ronin Warriors use the opportunity attack him with their virtues to let him see the true nature of the human spirit. The attack succeeds. The eclipse soon clears, and the armors then disappear, but not before reviving Naria and White Blaze. Mukala then approaches Naria and warmly calls her by her name, as Ryo, Rowen, Sage, Cye, Kento, Mia and Ully look on.\n}}\n|}\n\n===Ronin Warriors: Message===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #aaa;\"\n! width=\"30\" | # !!

[[Oberliga (ice hockey)|Oberliga]] season was the 55th season of the Oberliga, the third-tier of [[Germany|German]] [[ice hockey]]. For the fourth time in history, the Oberliga was split into four regional leagues (North, South, East, West). 39 teams competed in the season that spanned from 4 October 2013 till 21 April 2014. There was no Oberliga champion in 2013/14, due to an expanded [[DEL2]] promotion stage replacing the Oberliga Championship playoffs. [[L\u00f6wen Frankfurt]] and [[EC Kassel Huskies]] secured promotion to DEL2.

In 1913, she published the second Iranian women's magazine called ''Shokoufeh Newspaper''. She was also the founder of Iranian Women's Society, which was quite popular at the time with a reported five thousand memberships. <ref>https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=L-T-ng2v47QC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=Maryam+Amid&source=bl&ots=Wr8cqnmByp&sig=ACfU3U1yVVgATI-Gub-DVegkfbzLhrNb-Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5le3I8N3oAhXHDGMBHdX-DM84ChDoATADegQICxAw#v=onepage&q=Maryam%20Amid&f=false</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nMaryam Amid was the only daughter of Mir Seyed Razi Semnani, the first representative of [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]] and [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahrud]] in the [[National Assembly]], who was also known as \"Reyis Al-Atabeh\", doctor of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] and Mirza Ibrahim Amid al-Saltanah. Maryam Amid was born in Semnan and studied primary education with her father. Later, she learned French and photography. At the age of 16, she married Hosseini Mirza Emad al-Saltanah Salvar, one of the princes during the Qajar period.  After only one year of marriage, Miryam secured a divorce. \n\nSeven years later, Maryam married an intellectual named Qawamul Hakmah. Seven years later, Qawamul died leaving Maryam to raise their two children by herself.<ref> Truth, Abdul Rafiee. The first female journalist in Iran, Ghohar, numbers 11\u201312 (December 1973 \u2013 January 1974) .</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nMaryam Amid Semnani published a [[women's magazine]] named ''Shokoufeh''. Shokouefeh provided the opportunity for both women and men to be informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]]. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhetaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanuayeh Maziniyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by men. She translated several French books into the [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate their daughters, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying. This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) were taught, and the condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh.

As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam.

Maryam Amid was born in Semnan and studied primary education with her father. Later, she learned French and photography. At the age of 16, she married Hosseini Mirza Emad al-Saltanah Salvar, one of the princes during the Qajar period.  After only one year of marriage, Miryam secured a divorce. \n\nSeven years later, Maryam married an intellectual named Qawamul Hakmah. Seven years later, Qawamul died leaving Maryam to raise their two children by herself.<ref> Truth, Abdul Rafiee.

Shokouefeh provided the opportunity for both women and men to be informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]]. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhetaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanuayeh Maziniyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by men. She translated several French books into the [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate their daughters, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying. This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) were taught, and the condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nAt a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]].

The station building of the stopping point ''Freiburg-Littenweiler'' lies {{convert|318|m|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Altes Rathaus Littenweiler.JPG|thumbnail|left| House built in 1817 in the village square, town hall from 1846 to 1913]]\n\nThe village Littenweiler is mentioned for the first time in the 11th century as \"Lutenwile\" in a document of the Einsiedeln monastery. It has been a farming village located Eastern of the city of Freiburg at the edge of the Black Forest, where the Dreisam valley opens up to the Zartener basin in the East. Because the village\u2019s church is dedicated to Saint Barbara the patron of miners, it can be assumed that miners lived in Littenweiler, who along with the residents of the neighbouring village Kappel (Freiburg im Breisgau) worked in the tunnels of the [[Schauinsland]] (called \"Erzkasten\"). After various property situations, the village was divided in 1560 into two districts: one district belonging to the lords of the [[House of Sickingen]] and the other district belonging to the [[Teutonic Order]] of Freiburg. In 1614, these local lords concluded a contract, which organised the reciprocal interests as for example jurisdiction and taxes.\n\nDespite its incorporation into Freiburg in 1914 the character of the farmer\u2019s village at the gates of the city hadn\u2019t changed much until the middle of the 20th century, even though the modern world found its way into it with the construction of the [[H\u00f6llentalbahn (Black Forest)]] in 1887, a rail station and the tram in 1925. In the middle of the 1950s the high population growth of Freiburg impacted the development of this district (1950: 2.132 inhabitants, 1961: 4.735 inhabitants, 1970: 6.826 inhabitants): huge building sites were developed, a new parish church in honour of Saint Barbara was built (the old one became a community hall) as well as the Evangelic Ascension church and the University of Education was established on the fields between the railway line and the old centre of the village. The placid village with a few mansions along the sides of the mountain became a large municipal residential quarter for a predominantly middle-class population, which grew together with the neighbouring districts Waldsee, Ebnet and Kappel. \n\n== Coat of arms ==\n[[File:Wappen Littenweiler.png|50px|links]]\nThe village\u2019s coat of arms shows a white [[cross patt\u00e9e]] on a red background. In each of the four consequentially built sections is a silver bullet. It is a combination of the coats of arms of the long-time local lords of the German Order (cross) and the count of Sickingen (silver bullets). \n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Bahnhof Freiburg Littenweiler.jpg|thumbnail|The H\u00f6llentalbahn (a train) connects Littenweiler every half hour to Freiburg.]]\n \nThe district has very good transport connections. Because of the Eastern part of the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 31|B 31]], which mainly runs through a [[tunnel]] under Littenweiler, the congestion was reduced and simultaneously created a fast connection to the city centre and the Black Forest with its exit at the Eastern outskirts. The main connection to the city centre is the Hansjakobstra\u00dfe on which the tramline runs as well. Additionally, the [[H\u00f6llentalbahn (Black Forest)]] approaches the station ''Freiburg-Littenweiler'' every half hour and coming from the [[Freiburg Hauptbahnhof|central station]] traverses the whole [[H\u00f6llental (Black Forest)|H\u00f6llental]] up to Titisee-Neustadt thus being the most important public [[transport]] for commuters, tourists and winter sportsmen in the region. The terminal station of tram line 1 in Freiburg, the highest frequented line of the [[Freiburger Verkehrs AG]], links Littenweiler to the network of the local public transport. At the tram's endpoint, bus lines operate to the districts Ebnet and Kappel. \n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\nEspecially with the newly built [[shopping centre]] \"ZO\" (Zentrum Oberwiehre) new shopping possibilities were given to the [[citizens]] of Littenweiler. Although it lies outside Littenweiler in the nearby district [[Wiehre|Oberwiehre]], it can be reached easily by the Hansjakobstra\u00dfe and with the tram line 1. Relatively few shops are located in Littenweiler, there is only a small centre nearby the [[tram|tram's]] terminal station \"Lassbergstra\u00dfe\" and near the border of the neighbouring district Waldsee. The proper village centre around the former church, the former town hall and the schoolhouse of the Reinhold Schneider school is widely freed from transit traffic today. The Catholic church St. Barbara, a new building from the 1960s, is located in the district next to the old church in the village centre, which is used as village hall nowadays, and the Evangelical Ascension church, a modern concrete building with a characteristic bell tower. On the southern edge of the district lies the \"Waldhof\", an independent institution of the free adult education and professional development. The St. Anthony retirement home in Freiburg-Littenweiler is supervised by the [[Franciscan]] nuns of Gengenbach. It is a stationary care facility in a former spa and bathhouse, which was built around 1844 near a healing mineral spring. A separate, small, today seldom used, local cemetery indicates a history of the district as a former independent village. During the 1960s, the new \"Berg\u00e4cker\" cemetery was built on the area south of the H\u00f6llentalbahn in the south-west of the district, which became available for burials from all over the village. In 2007 a small part of it was sectioned off for a [[pet cemetery]].\n\n[[File:alte Schule Littenweiler.jpg|thumbnail|Built in 1870 as the second school in Littenweiler and used as a school until 1925, afterwards as a post office]]\n[[File:Reinhold Schneider Schule Littenweiler.JPG|thumbnail|The Reinhold Schneider school]]\n\nOne of the three [[civic amenity site|civic amenity sites]] of Freiburg is located in Littenweiler, where citizens can dispose of waste of all kinds.\n\n== Education ==\n* The University of Education Freiburg grew out of the Teacher Training colleges I and II in 1962, trains teachers for primary and secondary school education and offers courses for graduate teachers. From modest beginnings, a remarkable [[campus]] has been built on Lindenmattenstra\u00dfe.\n* The Waldhof Academy for Further Education was founded in 1950 as a free establishment for adult education. Its educational opportunities included seminars and lectures on the themes of humanities and sciences, art, geography and ethnology, religion and philosophy, as well as musical and creative courses.\n* The Reinhold Schneider School (primary and secondary school) had to vastly expand in the 1960s due to the huge population increase. It is named after the author [[Reinhold Schneider]], who lived for many years in Freiburg.\n* Thanks to the language school for foreign students supported by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, students from other language regions have been enabled to learn the German language.\n* Two large student dormitories, the [[Thomas More]] Hostel and the [Alban Stolz]] House, strengthened the link between the district and the universities of the city.\n\n== Sport ==\nOn the Schwarzwaldstra\u00dfe, in the neighbouring district of Waldsee, there is a series of major sports grounds belonging to the city of Freiburg. These are also important for Littenweiler and include:\n* A lido \u2013 Freiburg\u2019s largest open-air swimming pool with a slide of 91 metres in length, directly next to the Schwarzwald-Stadion\n* [[Schwarzwald-Stadion]] (formerly Dreisam Stadium) \u2013 the football ground of SC Freiburg; a little distance away is the [[M\u00f6slestadion]] with the football academy (which is for SC Freiburg amateur footballers) \n* Post-Turn- und Sportverein Jahn (PTSV Jahn), the Jahn gymnastics and sports club \u2013 grounds for popular sports\n* FT 1844 Freiburg \u2013 the largest sports club in southern Baden which has sports facilities including an indoor swimming pool, [[roller skating rink]], tennis courts etc. and a sports nursery and primary school\n* Freiburg Tennis Club\n* Sports facilities of the [[University of Freiburg]], which are also used by the students of the P\u00e4dagogischen Hochschule (University of Education)\n\n== References in Literature ==\nThe still rural district of Littenweiler is the setting of Christoph Meckel\u2019s autobiographical narrative, \"Der Brand\".

In the middle of the 1950s the high population growth of Freiburg impacted the development of this district (1950: 2.132 inhabitants, 1961: 4.735 inhabitants, 1970: 6.826 inhabitants): huge building sites were developed, a new parish church in honour of Saint Barbara was built (the old one became a community hall) as well as the Evangelic Ascension church and the University of Education was established on the fields between the railway line and the old centre of the village. The placid village with a few mansions along the sides of the mountain became a large municipal residential quarter for a predominantly middle-class population, which grew together with the neighbouring districts Waldsee, Ebnet and Kappel. \n\n== Coat of arms ==\n[[File:Wappen Littenweiler.png|50px|links]]\nThe village\u2019s coat of arms shows a white [[cross patt\u00e9e]] on a red background. In each of the four consequentially built sections is a silver bullet. It is a combination of the coats of arms of the long-time local lords of the German Order (cross) and the count of Sickingen (silver bullets). \n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Bahnhof Freiburg Littenweiler.jpg|thumbnail|The H\u00f6llentalbahn (a train) connects Littenweiler every half hour to Freiburg.]]\n \nThe district has very good transport connections. Because of the Eastern part of the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 31|B 31]], which mainly runs through a [[tunnel]] under Littenweiler, the congestion was reduced and simultaneously created a fast connection to the city centre and the Black Forest with its exit at the Eastern outskirts. The main connection to the city centre is the Hansjakobstra\u00dfe on which the tramline runs as well. Additionally, the [[H\u00f6llentalbahn (Black Forest)]] approaches the station ''Freiburg-Littenweiler'' every half hour and coming from the [[Freiburg Hauptbahnhof|central station]] traverses the whole [[H\u00f6llental (Black Forest)|H\u00f6llental]] up to Titisee-Neustadt thus being the most important public [[transport]] for commuters, tourists and winter sportsmen in the region. The terminal station of tram line 1 in Freiburg, the highest frequented line of the [[Freiburger Verkehrs AG]], links Littenweiler to the network of the local public transport. At the tram's endpoint, bus lines operate to the districts Ebnet and Kappel. \n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\nEspecially with the newly built [[shopping centre]] \"ZO\" (Zentrum Oberwiehre) new shopping possibilities were given to the [[citizens]] of Littenweiler. Although it lies outside Littenweiler in the nearby district [[Wiehre|Oberwiehre]], it can be reached easily by the Hansjakobstra\u00dfe and with the tram line 1. Relatively few shops are located in Littenweiler, there is only a small centre nearby the [[tram|tram's]] terminal station \"Lassbergstra\u00dfe\" and near the border of the neighbouring district Waldsee. The proper village centre around the former church, the former town hall and the schoolhouse of the Reinhold Schneider school is widely freed from transit traffic today. The Catholic church St. Barbara, a new building from the 1960s, is located in the district next to the old church in the village centre, which is used as village hall nowadays, and the Evangelical Ascension church, a modern concrete building with a characteristic bell tower. On the southern edge of the district lies the \"Waldhof\", an independent institution of the free adult education and professional development. The St. Anthony retirement home in Freiburg-Littenweiler is supervised by the [[Franciscan]] nuns of Gengenbach. It is a stationary care facility in a former spa and bathhouse, which was built around 1844 near a healing mineral spring. A separate, small, today seldom used, local cemetery indicates a history of the district as a former independent village. During the 1960s, the new \"Berg\u00e4cker\" cemetery was built on the area south of the H\u00f6llentalbahn in the south-west of the district, which became available for burials from all over the village. In 2007 a small part of it was sectioned off for a [[pet cemetery]].\n\n[[File:alte Schule Littenweiler.jpg|thumbnail|Built in 1870 as the second school in Littenweiler and used as a school until 1925, afterwards as a post office]]\n[[File:Reinhold Schneider Schule Littenweiler.JPG|thumbnail|The Reinhold Schneider school]]\n\nOne of the three [[civic amenity site|civic amenity sites]] of Freiburg is located in Littenweiler, where citizens can dispose of waste of all kinds.\n\n== Education ==\n* The University of Education Freiburg grew out of the Teacher Training colleges I and II in 1962, trains teachers for primary and secondary school education and offers courses for graduate teachers. From modest beginnings, a remarkable [[campus]] has been built on Lindenmattenstra\u00dfe.\n* The Waldhof Academy for Further Education was founded in 1950 as a free establishment for adult education. Its educational opportunities included seminars and lectures on the themes of humanities and sciences, art, geography and ethnology, religion and philosophy, as well as musical and creative courses.\n* The Reinhold Schneider School (primary and secondary school) had to vastly expand in the 1960s due to the huge population increase. It is named after the author [[Reinhold Schneider]], who lived for many years in Freiburg.\n* Thanks to the language school for foreign students supported by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, students from other language regions have been enabled to learn the German language.\n* Two large student dormitories, the [[Thomas More]] Hostel and the [Alban Stolz]] House, strengthened the link between the district and the universities of the city.\n\n== Sport ==\nOn the Schwarzwaldstra\u00dfe, in the neighbouring district of Waldsee, there is a series of major sports grounds belonging to the city of Freiburg. These are also important for Littenweiler and include:\n* A lido \u2013 Freiburg\u2019s largest open-air swimming pool with a slide of 91 metres in length, directly next to the Schwarzwald-Stadion\n* [[Schwarzwald-Stadion]] (formerly Dreisam Stadium) \u2013 the football ground of SC Freiburg; a little distance away is the [[M\u00f6slestadion]] with the football academy (which is for SC Freiburg amateur footballers) \n* Post-Turn- und Sportverein Jahn (PTSV Jahn), the Jahn gymnastics and sports club \u2013 grounds for popular sports\n* FT 1844 Freiburg \u2013 the largest sports club in southern Baden which has sports facilities including an indoor swimming pool, [[roller skating rink]], tennis courts etc. and a sports nursery and primary school\n* Freiburg Tennis Club\n* Sports facilities of the [[University of Freiburg]], which are also used by the students of the P\u00e4dagogischen Hochschule (University of Education)\n\n== References in Literature ==\nThe still rural district of Littenweiler is the setting of Christoph Meckel\u2019s autobiographical narrative, \"Der Brand\". In the novel he describes, amongst other things, the blaze after the bombing of Freiburg on 27 November 1944, which he watched from Eichberg.\n\n== People of interest ==\n* [[Albert Benitz]] (1904-1979), cinematographer, was born in Littenweiler.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== Weblinks ==\n{{Commonscat|Littenweiler (Freiburg im Breisgau)}}\n* [http://www.littenweiler.de/ Littenweiler.de]\n* [http://www.badische-seiten.de/freiburg/littenweiler.php Die Geschichte Littenweilers]\n* [http://www.fr-littenweiler.de/ Private Internetseite \u00fcber Littenweiler]\n\n[[Category:Freiburg im Breisgau]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littenweiler"}

This was one of the first rotary machines that retained the flatbed, which passed back and forth under inked rollers.  This invention provided for more automated, faster reproductions since the pages were produced and moved by rollers instead of pressing one single sheet at a time.\n\nBy 1900, two primary types of mimeographs had come into use: a single-drum machine and a dual-drum machine.  The single-drum machine used a single drum for ink transfer to the stencil, and the dual-drum machine used two drums and silk-screens to transfer the ink to the stencils. The single drum (example Roneo) machine could be easily used for multi-color work by changing the drum - each of which contained ink of a different color. This was spot color for mastheads. Colors could not be mixed.\n\nThe mimeograph became popular because it was much cheaper than traditional print - there was neither [[typesetting]] nor skilled labor involved. One individual with a [[typewriter]] and the necessary equipment became their own printing factory, allowing for greater circulation of printed material.\n\n<gallery widths=\"230\" heights=\"170\">\nImage:1889 Edison Mimeograph.jpg|Advertisement from 1889 for the Edison Mimeograph\nFile:Mimeograph, 1918.png|1918 illustration of a mimeograph machine\nFile:Mimeograph - The National Duplicator.JPG|Jackson & O'Sullivan's \"The National\" Duplicator.

Later this became an immersion-coated long-fibre paper, with the coating being a plasticized nitrocellulose.  This flexible waxed or coated sheet is backed by a sheet of stiff card stock, with the two sheets bound at the top.\n\nOnce prepared, the stencil is wrapped around the ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. Early flatbed machines used a kind of [[squeegee]]. The ink originally had a [[lanolin]] base<ref>[http://chem.5677567.com/formula/mimeograph-ink-vehicle-formula.html Mimeograph Ink Vehicle Formula] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709153405/http://chem.5677567.com/formula/mimeograph-ink-vehicle-formula.html |date=2012-07-09 }} Chemical Industry</ref> and later became an oil in water emulsion. This emulsion commonly uses Turkey-Red Oil (Sulfated Castor Oil) which gives it a distinctive and heavy scent.\n\n===Preparing stencils===\nFor printed copy, a stencil assemblage is placed in a [[typewriter]]. The part of the mechanism which lifts the [[typewriter ribbon|ribbon]] must be disabled so that the bare, sharp type element strikes the stencil directly. The impact of the type element displaces the coating, making the tissue paper permeable to the [[Mineral oil|oil]]-based [[ink]]. This is called \"cutting a stencil.\"<ref name=MimeoTypewriter>{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by using a typewriter|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil2.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121016144524/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil2.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-10-16|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>\n\nA variety of specialized [[styluses]] were used on the stencil to render lettering, illustrations, or other artistic features by hand against a textured plastic backing plate.<ref name=MimeoHand>{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by hand|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil1.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20111022224825/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil1.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-10-22|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>\n\nMistakes were corrected by brushing them out with a specially formulated [[correction fluid]], and retyping once it has dried.

The common machine was a [[Thermofax]].\n\nAnother device, called an [[electrostencil]] machine, sometimes was used to make mimeo stencils from a typed or printed original. It worked by scanning the original on a rotating drum with a moving optical head and burning through the blank stencil with an [[electric spark]] in the places where the optical head detected ink. It was slow and produced [[ozone]]. Text from electrostencils had lower resolution than that from typed stencils, although the process was good for reproducing illustrations. A skilled mimeo operator using an electrostencil and a very coarse [[halftone]] screen could make acceptable printed copies of a photograph.\n\nDuring the declining years of the mimeograph, some people made stencils with early computers and [[dot matrix printer|dot-matrix impact printers]].<ref name=MimeoDotMatrix>{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by using a dot matrix printer |url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080213121240/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-02-13 |work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>\n\n===Limitations===\nUnlike [[spirit duplicator]]s (where the only ink available is depleted from the master image), mimeograph technology works by forcing a replenishable supply of ink through the stencil master.  In theory, the mimeography process could be continued indefinitely, especially if a durable stencil master were used (e.g. a thin metal foil).  In practice, most low-cost mimeo stencils gradually wear out over the course of producing several hundred copies.  Typically the stencil deteriorates gradually, producing a characteristic degraded image quality until the stencil tears, abruptly ending the print run.  If further copies are desired at this point, another stencil must be made.\n\nOften, the stencil material covering the interiors of closed [[letterform]]s (e.g. \"a\", \"b\", \"d\", \"e\", \"g\", etc.) would fall away during continued printing, causing ink-filled letters in the copies.  The stencil would gradually stretch, starting near the top where the mechanical forces were greatest, causing a characteristic \"mid-line sag\" in the textual lines of the copies, that would progress until the stencil failed completely.  The [[Gestetner]] Company (and others) devised various methods to make mimeo stencils more durable.<ref name=DupStencil>{{cite web |title=Duplicating stencil |url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4535690/description.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421191131/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4535690/description.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-04-21 |work=Patentstorm |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>\n\nCompared to spirit duplication, mimeography produced a darker, more legible image.  Spirit duplicated images were usually tinted a light purple or lavender, which gradually became lighter over the course of some dozens of copies.  Mimeography was often considered \"the next step up\" in quality, capable of producing hundreds of copies.  Print runs beyond that level were usually produced by professional printers or, as the technology became available, [[xerography|xerographic copiers]].\n\n==Durability==\nMimeographed images generally have much better durability than spirit-duplicated images, since the inks are more resistant to [[ultraviolet light]].  The primary preservation challenge is the low-quality paper often used, which would yellow and degrade due to [[slow fire|residual acid]] in the treated pulp from which the paper was made. In the worst case, old copies can crumble into small particles when handled. Mimeographed copies have moderate durability when [[acid-free paper]] is used.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Contemporary use==\n\n[[Gestetner]], [[Risograph]], and other companies still make and sell highly automated mimeograph-like machines that are externally similar to photocopiers. The modern version of a mimeograph, called a [[digital duplicator]], or [[copyprinter]], contains a [[image scanner|scanner]], a thermal head for stencil cutting, and a large roll of stencil material entirely inside the unit. The stencil material consists of a very thin polymer film laminated to a long-fibre non-woven tissue.  It makes the stencils and mounts and unmounts them from the print drum automatically, making it almost as easy to operate as a photocopier. The Risograph is the best known of these machines.\n\nAlthough mimeographs remain more economical and energy-efficient in mid-range quantities, easier-to-use photocopying and offset printing have replaced mimeography almost entirely in [[developed country|developed countries]]. Mimeograph machines continue to be used in [[developing country|developing countries]] because it is a simple, cheap, and robust technology. Many mimeographs can be hand-cranked, requiring no electricity.\n\n==Uses and art==\nMimeographs and Spirit Duplications are closely related but distinctly different [[spirit duplicator]] process were both used extensively in schools to copy homework assignments and tests.  They were also commonly used for low-budget amateur [[publishing]], including club newsletters and church bulletins. They were especially popular with [[science fiction]] fans, who used them extensively in the production of [[fanzine]]s in the middle 20th century, before photocopying became inexpensive.\n\nLetters and typographical symbols were sometimes used to create illustrations, in a precursor to [[ASCII art]]. Because changing ink color in a mimeograph could be a laborious process, involving extensively cleaning the machine or, on newer models, replacing the drum or rollers, and then running the paper through the machine a second time, some fanzine publishers experimented with techniques for painting several colors on the pad.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Duplicating machines]]\n* [[Gocco]]\n* [[List of duplicating processes]]\n* [[Mimeoscope]]\n* [[Mimeo Revolution]]\n* [[Spirit duplicator]] (also known as a \"Ditto machine\" in the US or a \"Banda machine\" in the UK)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*  Hutchison, Howard.

When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. Early flatbed machines used a kind of [[squeegee]]. The ink originally had a [[lanolin]] base<ref>[http://chem.5677567.com/formula/mimeograph-ink-vehicle-formula.html Mimeograph Ink Vehicle Formula] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709153405/http://chem.5677567.com/formula/mimeograph-ink-vehicle-formula.html |date=2012-07-09 }} Chemical Industry</ref> and later became an oil in water emulsion.

The part of the mechanism which lifts the [[typewriter ribbon|ribbon]] must be disabled so that the bare, sharp type element strikes the stencil directly. The impact of the type element displaces the coating, making the tissue paper permeable to the [[Mineral oil|oil]]-based [[ink]]. This is called \"cutting a stencil.\"<ref name=MimeoTypewriter>{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by using a typewriter|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil2.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121016144524/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil2.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-10-16|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>\n\nA variety of specialized [[styluses]] were used on the stencil to render lettering, illustrations, or other artistic features by hand against a textured plastic backing plate.<ref name=MimeoHand>{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by hand|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil1.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20111022224825/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil1.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-10-22|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>\n\nMistakes were corrected by brushing them out with a specially formulated [[correction fluid]], and retyping once it has dried.

The common machine was a [[Thermofax]].\n\nAnother device, called an [[electrostencil]] machine, sometimes was used to make mimeo stencils from a typed or printed original. It worked by scanning the original on a rotating drum with a moving optical head and burning through the blank stencil with an [[electric spark]] in the places where the optical head detected ink. It was slow and produced [[ozone]]. Text from electrostencils had lower resolution than that from typed stencils, although the process was good for reproducing illustrations. A skilled mimeo operator using an electrostencil and a very coarse [[halftone]] screen could make acceptable printed copies of a photograph.\n\nDuring the declining years of the mimeograph, some people made stencils with early computers and [[dot matrix printer|dot-matrix impact printers]].<ref name=MimeoDotMatrix>{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by using a dot matrix printer |url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080213121240/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-02-13 |work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>\n\n===Limitations===\nUnlike [[spirit duplicator]]s (where the only ink available is depleted from the master image), mimeograph technology works by forcing a replenishable supply of ink through the stencil master.  In theory, the mimeography process could be continued indefinitely, especially if a durable stencil master were used (e.g. a thin metal foil).  In practice, most low-cost mimeo stencils gradually wear out over the course of producing several hundred copies.  Typically the stencil deteriorates gradually, producing a characteristic degraded image quality until the stencil tears, abruptly ending the print run.  If further copies are desired at this point, another stencil must be made.\n\nOften, the stencil material covering the interiors of closed [[letterform]]s (e.g. \"a\", \"b\", \"d\", \"e\", \"g\", etc.) would fall away during continued printing, causing ink-filled letters in the copies.  The stencil would gradually stretch, starting near the top where the mechanical forces were greatest, causing a characteristic \"mid-line sag\" in the textual lines of the copies, that would progress until the stencil failed completely.  The [[Gestetner]] Company (and others) devised various methods to make mimeo stencils more durable.<ref name=DupStencil>{{cite web |title=Duplicating stencil |url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4535690/description.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421191131/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4535690/description.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-04-21 |work=Patentstorm |accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref>\n\nCompared to spirit duplication, mimeography produced a darker, more legible image.  Spirit duplicated images were usually tinted a light purple or lavender, which gradually became lighter over the course of some dozens of copies.  Mimeography was often considered \"the next step up\" in quality, capable of producing hundreds of copies.  Print runs beyond that level were usually produced by professional printers or, as the technology became available, [[xerography|xerographic copiers]].\n\n==Durability==\nMimeographed images generally have much better durability than spirit-duplicated images, since the inks are more resistant to [[ultraviolet light]].  The primary preservation challenge is the low-quality paper often used, which would yellow and degrade due to [[slow fire|residual acid]] in the treated pulp from which the paper was made. In the worst case, old copies can crumble into small particles when handled. Mimeographed copies have moderate durability when [[acid-free paper]] is used.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Contemporary use==\n\n[[Gestetner]], [[Risograph]], and other companies still make and sell highly automated mimeograph-like machines that are externally similar to photocopiers. The modern version of a mimeograph, called a [[digital duplicator]], or [[copyprinter]], contains a [[image scanner|scanner]], a thermal head for stencil cutting, and a large roll of stencil material entirely inside the unit. The stencil material consists of a very thin polymer film laminated to a long-fibre non-woven tissue.  It makes the stencils and mounts and unmounts them from the print drum automatically, making it almost as easy to operate as a photocopier. The Risograph is the best known of these machines.\n\nAlthough mimeographs remain more economical and energy-efficient in mid-range quantities, easier-to-use photocopying and offset printing have replaced mimeography almost entirely in [[developed country|developed countries]]. Mimeograph machines continue to be used in [[developing country|developing countries]] because it is a simple, cheap, and robust technology. Many mimeographs can be hand-cranked, requiring no electricity.\n\n==Uses and art==\nMimeographs and the closely related but distinctly different [[spirit duplicator]] process were both used extensively in schools to copy homework assignments and tests.  They were also commonly used for low-budget amateur [[publishing]], including club newsletters and church bulletins. They were especially popular with [[science fiction]] fans, who used them extensively in the production of [[fanzine]]s in the middle 20th century, before photocopying became inexpensive.\n\nLetters and typographical symbols were sometimes used to create illustrations, in a precursor to [[ASCII art]]. Because changing ink color in a mimeograph could be a laborious process, involving extensively cleaning the machine or, on newer models, replacing the drum or rollers, and then running the paper through the machine a second time, some fanzine publishers experimented with techniques for painting several colors on the pad.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Duplicating machines]]\n* [[Gocco]]\n* [[List of duplicating processes]]\n* [[Mimeoscope]]\n* [[Mimeo Revolution]]\n* [[Spirit duplicator]] (also known as a \"Ditto machine\" in the US or a \"Banda machine\" in the UK)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*  Hutchison, Howard.

The word 'Viking' did not come into general use in the English language until the middle of the nineteenth Century - at about the same time that it was introduced into serious academic literature in Scandinavia - and has since then changed its meaning and been much abused. It must, however, be accepted that the term is today used throughout the world as a descriptor of the peoples of Scandinavia in the period from the late eighth Century until the mid-eleventh Century. To the general public, however, it has apparently two meanings; both are respectable and hallowed in the English language by two centuries of usage. The first is in the sense of 'raider' or 'pirate', the second in the sense of the activities of the Scandinavians outside their own country in that period. It is the latter meaning that has given rise to the useful term 'the Viking Age'. Disregarding the ultimate philology of the word and the history of its use over the centuries, which has been much discussed, it is now in such everyday use by both specialists and non-specialists - however improperly - to describe the Scandinavians of the Viking Age, that it almost impossible to avoid its use in this generic sense. Although it is often appropriate and necessary to use such terms as 'Scandinavian' or 'Norse', as I have done in this book, it is often simpler and less confusing to label something as 'Viking' rather than deal in scholastic circumlocution to placate purists, however justified they may be in their arguments.\" |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1= |first1= |date=2010 |orig-year= |chapter=Vikings |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195334036.001.0001/acref-9780195334036-e-0957?rskey=8P9rGR&result=3 |editor1-last=Rogers |editor1-first=Clifford J. |editor1-link=Clifford J.

Lindisfarne was different.

In medieval English chronicles, they are described as \"wolves among sheep\".\n\nThe first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age reached a small readership in Britain. Linguistics traced the Viking Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. New dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled more Victorians to read the Icelandic Sagas.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and Swedish scholar [[Olaus Rudbeck]] were the first to use runic inscriptions and Icelandic Sagas as primary historical sources. During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and Nordic Renaissance, historians such as the Icelandic-Norwegian [[Thormodus Torf\u00e6us]], Danish-Norwegian [[Ludvig Holberg]], and Swedish [[Olof von Dalin]] developed a more \"rational\" and \"pragmatic\" approach to historical scholarship.\n\nBy the latter half of the 18th century, while the [[Icelandic saga]]s were still used as important historical sources, the Viking Age had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the Nordic countries.\n\nScholars outside Scandinavia did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the Vikings until the 1890s, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Northern Shores: a history of the Baltic Sea and its peoples |last=Palmer |first=Alan Warwick |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7195-6299-0 |oclc=63398802}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, the history of the Viking Age had largely been based on Icelandic Sagas, the history of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] written by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], the [[Kievan Rus']]<nowiki/>s ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', and ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]''.

They also settled in the [[Faroe Islands]], Ireland, Iceland, peripheral Scotland ([[Caithness]], the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Northern Isles]]), Greenland, and Canada.\n\nTheir [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], [[Old Norse]], became the mother-tongue of present-day Scandinavian languages. By 801, a strong central authority appears to have been established in [[Jutland]], and the Danes were beginning to look beyond their own territory for land, trade, and plunder.\n\nIn Norway, mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. Communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in lowland Denmark. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway.\n\nThe sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century, Scandinavians began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the Viking Age. The [[North Sea]] rovers were traders, colonisers, explorers, and plunderers.\n\n== Probable causes of Norse expansion ==\n{{Norse people sidebar}}\n{{Main|Viking expansion}}\nMany theories are posited for the cause of the Viking invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role. At the time, England, Wales, and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Overpopulation, especially near the [[Scandinavian Mountains|Scandes]], was possibly influential (this theory regarding overpopulation is disputed).<ref>\"One of the most popular explanations offered for the Viking phenomenon is that overpopulation created a need for more land\u2014especially in mountainous Norway\u2014and thus the Vikings were largely motivated by a desire to colonise. Peter Sawyer, for example, in 1971, said that the first raids on Britain, by the Norwegians, were a byproduct of the colonisation of the Orkneys and the Shetlands, and that the Norwegians were more interested in settlement than in plunder. More recently, however, a couple of problems have emerged with this explanation. For a start, Sawyer in 1982 reneged somewhat by saying that no good evidence exists for any population pressure in the eighth century. Patrick Wormald added that what has been taken for overpopulation was just population concentration due to economic expansion and the mining of iron ore. In a further point, Wormald states that no clear evidence has been found for any Viking settlement until the mid-9th century, some 50\u201360 years after the raids began. Thus, colonisation seems to have been a secondary feature of Viking activity; the success of the raids opened the way for settlement, but were not motivated by it, at least not initially.[http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 \"The Vikings&nbsp;\u2013 Why They Did It, from the edited  h2g2, the Unconventional Guide to Life, the Universe and Everything\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101335/http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 |date=18 May 2015 }} (3 July 2000).

The connection of the Scandinavians to larger and richer trade networks lured the Vikings into Western Europe, and soon the rest of Europe and parts of the Middle East. In England, hoards of Viking silver, such as the [[Cuerdale Hoard]] and the [[Vale of York Hoard]], offer good insight to this phenomenon.\n\n;Ideological model: This era coincided with the [[Medieval Warm Period]] (800\u20131300) and stopped with the start of the [[Little Ice Age]] (about 1250\u20131850). The start of the Viking Age, with the sack of Lindisfarne, also coincided with [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Saxon Wars]], or Christian wars with pagans in [[Old Saxony|Saxony]].

As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. The second case is the internal \"Push\" factor, which coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization of power in the modern-day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being eaten up by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.<ref>Barrett, James H. What Caused the Viking Age?

From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the ''[[Culdee|C\u00e9li D\u00e9]]'' Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.\n[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|upright=1.45|Viking expeditions (blue line): depicting the immense breadth of their voyages through most of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Northern [[Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Arctic]], and [[North America]].

Near the end of Charlemagne's reign (and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons), a string of Norse raids began, culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as [[History of Normandy#Scandinavian invasions|Normandy]].\n\nThe [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built [[longship]]s used by the Scandinavians were uniquely suited to both deep and shallow waters. They extended the reach of Norse raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western Europe. [[Rurik]] also expanded to the east, and in 859 became ruler either by conquest or invitation by local people of the city of [[Novgorod]] (which means \"new city\") on the [[Volkhov River]]. [[Rurik Dynasty|His successors]] moved further, founding the early East Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] with the capital in [[Kiev]]. This persisted until 1240, when the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols invaded Russia]].\n\nOther Norse people continued south to the [[Black Sea]] and then on to [[Constantinople]]. Whenever these Viking ships ran aground in shallow waters, the Vikings  reportedly turned them on their sides and dragged them across the shallows into deeper waters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The eastern connections of these \"[[Varangians]]\" brought [[Byzantine silk]], a [[cowrie shell]] from the Red Sea, and even coins from [[Samarkand]], to [[Jorvik|Viking York]].\n\nIn 884, an army of Danish Vikings was defeated at the [[Battle of Norditi]] (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic [[North Sea]] coast by a [[Frisians|Frisian]] army under Archbishop [[Rimbert]] of Bremen-Hamburg, which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the Vikings from [[East Frisia]].\n\nIn 911, French King [[Charles the Simple]] was able to make an agreement with the Viking warleader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], a chieftain of disputed Norwegian or Danish origins.<ref>The material suggesting a Norwegian origin identifies him with [[Rollo|Hrolf the Ganger]], also known as \"Rolf the Walker\"</ref> Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted  his followers and him possession of Normandy. In return, Rollo swore [[fealty]] to Charles, converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of France against the incursions of other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as Norman, but also carried the [[Norman language]] (a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language with Germanic influence), and their Norman culture, into England in 1066. With the [[Norman Conquest]], they became the ruling aristocracy of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo\u2013Saxon England]].\n\nIn Scandinavia, the Viking age is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking era in Norway is marked by the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] in 1030. Although Olafr Haraldsson's (later known as [[Olaf II of Norway|Olav the Holy]]) army lost the battle, Christianity spread, partly on the strength of rumours of miraculous signs after his death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Norwegians would no longer be called Vikings. In Sweden, the reign of king [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung|Olov Sk\u00f6tkonung]] ({{circa|995\u20131020}}) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, and he is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted until the 12th century. Olof being the last king in Scandinavia to adopt a Christianity marked a definite end to the [[viking age]].  \n\nThe end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III ([[Harald Hardrada|Haraldr Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i]]), who was defeated by Saxon King [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066 at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]; in Ireland, the capture of [[Dublin]] by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] and his [[Normans in Ireland|Hiberno-Norman]] forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson]] at the [[Battle of Largs]] by troops loyal to [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by another Viking descendant, [[William I of England|William]], Duke of [[Normandy]].

The raiders killed the monks and captured the valuables. The raid marks the beginning of the \"Viking Age of Invasion\", made possible by the Viking longship. Great but sporadic violence occurred from the last decade of the eighth century on England's northern and eastern shores; Viking raids continued on a small scale across coastal England. While the initial raiding groups were small, a great amount of planning is believed to have been  involved. The Norwegians raided during the winter of 840\u2013841, rather than the usual summer, having waited on an island off Ireland. In 850, Vikings overwintered for the first time in England, on the [[Isle of Thanet|island of Thanet]], [[Kent]]. In 854, a raiding party overwintered a second time, at the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in the Thames estuary. In 864, they reverted to Thanet for their winter encampment.<ref>[[#Hall|Hall]], p. 13</ref>\n\n[[File:England diocese map pre-925.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Anglo-Saxon [[diocese]]s before 925: Normal diocesan life was greatly disrupted in England during the Viking Age.]]\nThe following year, the [[Great Heathen Army]], led by brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]] ([[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] and [[Ubba]]), and also by another Viking [[Guthrum]], arrived in East Anglia. They proceeded to cross England into Northumbria and captured York, establishing the Viking community of Jorvik, where some settled as farmers and craftsmen. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings. In 867, Northumbria became the northern kingdom of the coalescing [[Danelaw]], after its conquest by the brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, who installed an Englishman, [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht]], as a puppet king. By 870, the \"Great Summer Army\" arrived in England, led by a Viking leader called [[Bagsecg]] and his five [[earl]]s. Aided by the Great Heathen Army (which had already overrun much of England from its base in Jorvik), Bagsecg's forces, and Halfdan's forces (through an alliance), the combined Viking forces raided much of England until 871, when they planned an invasion of Wessex. On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] along with his earls. As a result, many of the Vikings returned to northern England, where Jorvic had become the centre of the Viking kingdom, but [[Alfred the Great|Alfred of Wessex]] managed to keep them out of his country. Alfred and his successors continued to drive back the Viking frontier and take York. A new wave of Norwegian Vikings appeared in England in 947 when [[Eric Bloodaxe]] captured York.\n\n[[File:07Kbh Mus Drachenkopf 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Fire-gilded [[European dragon|dragon's head]] from Ireland, found in a Viking grave at [[Stavanger]], Norway ([[Nationalmuseet]], Copenhagen)]]\nIn 1003, the Danish King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] started a series of raids against England.

The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. By 830, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence. In some cases, they became allies and married each other.\n\nIn 832, a Viking fleet of about 120 invaded kingdoms on Ireland's northern and eastern coasts. Some believe that the increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland, as opposed to just touching the coasts. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations dispersed throughout Ireland.\n\nIn 838, a small Viking fleet entered the [[River Liffey]] in eastern Ireland. The Vikings set up a base, which the Irish called a [[longphort]]. This longphort eventually became Dublin. After this interaction, the Irish experienced Viking forces for about 40 years. The Vikings also established longphorts in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Wexford. The Vikings could sail through on the main river and branch off into different areas of the country.\n\nNorwegian Vikings and other Scandinavians conducted extensive raids in Ireland. They founded [[Limerick]] in 812, then established [[Waterford]] in 853, founded the only Viking capital city in the world outside the Nordic countries in [[Dublin]], and founded trading ports in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the 9th century. Predominantly Norwegians, and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians, settled down and intermixed with the Irish. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected West Norse culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin and solidified Dublin as an important city. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia, and central Asia. Dublin became so crowded by the 11th century that houses were constructed outside the town walls.\n\nOne of the last major battles involving Vikings was the [[Battle of Clontarf]] on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king [[Brian Boru]]'s army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of this world and the supernatural, including witches, goblins, and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live and who would die.\n\n=== Scotland ===\n{{Main|Scandinavian Scotland}}\nWhile  few records are known, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria.\n\nIn 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the [[River Tay]] and [[River Earn]], both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the [[Picts|Pictish kingdom]] of [[Fortriu]]. They defeated [[Uen of the Picts|Eog\u00e1n mac \u00d3engusa]], king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of [[D\u00e1l Riata]], [[\u00c1ed mac Boanta]], along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than 100 years since the time of [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (The accession of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn]] as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).\n\nIn 870, the [[Hen Ogledd|Britons of the Old North]] around the [[Firth of Clyde]] came under Viking attack as well. The fortress atop [[Alt Clut]] (\"Rock of the Clyde,\" the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] name for [[Dumbarton Rock]], which had become the [[metonym]] for their kingdom) was besieged by the Viking kings [[Amla\u00edb]] and [[\u00cdmar]]. After four months, its water supply failed, and the fortress fell. The Vikings are recorded to have transported a vast prey of British, Pictish, and English captives back to Ireland. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king [[Arthgal ap Dyfnwal]], who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. The fall of Alt Clut marked a watershed in the history of the realm. Afterwards, the capital of the restructured kingdom was relocated about 12 miles (20 km) up the River Clyde to the vicinity of [[Govan]] and [[Partick]] (within present-day [[Glasgow]]), and became known as the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], which persisted as a major regional political player for another 150 years.\n\nThe land that now comprises most of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] had previously been the northernmost part of the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]], which fell apart with its Viking conquest; these lands were never regained by the Anglo-Saxons, or England.  The upheaval and pressure of Viking raiding, occupation, conquest and settlement resulted in alliances among the formerly enemy peoples that comprised what would become present-day Scotland. Over the subsequent 300 years, this Viking upheaval and pressure led to the unification of the previously contending Gaelic, Pictish, British, and English kingdoms, first into the [[kingdom of Alba]], and finally into the greater Kingdom of Scotland. <ref>The Makers of Scotland: Picts, Romans, Gaels and Vikings, by Tim Clarkson, Birlinn Ltd, Edinburgh, 2013.\"</ref> The Viking Age in Scotland came to an end after another 100 years. The last vestiges of Norse power in the Scottish seas and islands were completely relinquished after another 200 years. \n\n==== Earldom of Orkney ====\nBy the mid-9th century, the Norsemen had settled in Shetland, Orkney (the Nordreys- ''[[Nor\u00f0reyjar]]''), the Hebrides and Isle of Man, (the Sudreys- ''[[Kingdom of the Isles|Su\u00f0reyjar]]''\u2014this survives in the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]]) and parts of mainland Scotland. The Norse settlers were to some extent integrating with the local [[Gael]]ic population (see [[Norse-Gaels]]) in the Hebrides and Man. These areas were ruled over by local [[Jarl (title)|Jarls]], originally captains of ships or ''[[hersir]]s''. [[Earl of Orkney|The Jarl of Orkney]] and Shetland, however, claimed supremacy.\n\nIn 875, King Harald Fairhair led a fleet from Norway to Scotland. In his attempt to unite Norway, he found that many of those opposed to his rise to power had taken refuge in the Isles. From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. He organised a fleet and was able to subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but also the Isles, Man, and parts of Scotland.\n\n==== Kings of the Isles ====\n{{Main|Kingdom of the Isles}}\nIn 876, the Norse-Gaels of Mann and the Hebrides rebelled against Harald. A fleet was sent against them led by [[Ketil Flatnose]] to regain control. On his success, Ketil was to rule the Sudreys as a vassal of [[Harald Fairhair|King Harald]]. His grandson, [[Thorstein the Red]], and [[Sigurd Eysteinsson|Sigurd the Mighty]], Jarl of Orkney, invaded Scotland and were able to exact tribute from nearly half the kingdom until their deaths in battle. Ketil declared himself King of the Isles. Ketil was eventually outlawed and, fearing the bounty on his head, fled to Iceland.\n\nThe Norse-Gaelic Kings of the Isles continued to act semi independently, in 973 forming a defensive pact with the Kings of Scotland and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]. In 1095, the [[King of Mann and the Isles]] [[Godred Crovan]] was killed by [[Magnus Barelegs]], King of Norway. Magnus and King [[Edgar of Scotland]] agreed on a treaty. The islands would be controlled by Norway, but mainland territories would go to Scotland. The King of Norway nominally continued to be king of the Isles and Man. However, in 1156, The kingdom was split into two. The Western Isles and Man continued as to be called the \"Kingdom of Man and the Isles\", but the [[Inner Hebrides]] came under the influence of [[Somerled]], a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker, who was styled 'King of the Hebrides'. His kingdom was to develop latterly into the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]].\n\nIn eastern [[Aberdeenshire]], the Danes invaded at least as far north as the area near [[Cruden Bay]].<ref>Hogan, C. Michael (2008) [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes \"'Catto Long Barrow fieldnotes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118120409/http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes#fieldnotes |date=18 January 2009 }}. ''The Modern Antiquarian''</ref>\n\nThe Jarls of Orkney continued to rule much of northern Scotland until 1196, when [[Harald Maddadsson]] agreed to pay tribute to [[William the Lion]], King of Scots, for his territories on the [[mainland]].\n\nThe end of the Viking age ''proper'' in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to [[Skye]], arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked up with those of [[Magnus Olafsson|King Magnus of Man]] and [[Dubhghall mac Ruaidhri|King Dougal of the Hebrides]]. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at [[Battle of Largs|Largs]], in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the Law-mender]] ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the [[Treaty of Perth]].\n\nOrkney and Shetland continued to be ruled as autonomous Jarldoms under Norway until 1468, when King [[Christian I]] pledged them as security on the [[dowry]] of his daughter, who was betrothed to [[James III of Scotland]].

A contemporary reference to Kvenland is provided in an [[Old English]] account written in the 9th century. It used the information provided by the Norwegian adventurer and traveller named [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland|Ohthere]]. Kvenland, in that or close to that spelling, is also known from [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] sources, primarily Icelandic, but also one that was possibly written in the modern-day area of Norway.\n\nAll the remaining Nordic sources discussing Kvenland, using that or close to that spelling, date to the 12th and 13th centuries, but some of them\u2014in part at least\u2014are believed to be rewrites of older texts.

The incursions in 841 caused severe damage to [[Rouen]] and [[Jumi\u00e8ges]].

The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare as well as at sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates.\n\nThe Vikings used their longships to travel vast distances and attain certain tactical advantages in battle. They could perform highly efficient hit-and-run attacks, in which they quickly approached a target, then left as rapidly as possible before a counter-offensive could be launched. Because of the ships' negligible draft, the Vikings could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers. The ships were agile, and light enough to be carried over land from one river system to another. \"Under sail, the same boats could tackle open water and cross the unexplored wastes of the North Atlantic.\"<ref>Tignor, Robert; Adelman, Jeremy; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin; Kotkin, Stephen; Prakash, Gyan; Shaw, Brent; Aron, Stephen; Liu, Xinru; Marchand, Suzanne; Pittman, Holly; Tsin, Michael.

Kindle Edition.</ref> The ships' speed was also prodigious for the time, estimated at a maximum of {{convert|14|-|15|kn|km/h}}. The use of the longships ended when technology changed, and ships began to be constructed using saws instead of axes, resulting in inferior vessels.\n\nWhile battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship could be easily boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.<ref>Foote, P. and Wilson, D.M. (1970)''The Viking Achievement''. Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd. {{ISBN|0-283-35499-2}}. pp. 282\u201385.</ref>\n\nTogether with an increasing centralisation of government in the Scandinavian countries, the old system of ''[[leidang]]'' \u2014 a fleet mobilisation system, where every ''skipreide'' (ship community) had to maintain one ship and a crew \u2014 was discontinued as a purely military institution, as the duty to build and man a ship soon was converted into a tax. The Norwegian leidang was called under Haakon Haakonson for his 1263 expedition to Scotland during the Scottish\u2013Norwegian War, and the last recorded calling of it was in 1603. However, already by the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships. This led to the defeat of longship navies in most subsequent naval engagements--e.g., with the Hanseatic League.\n\nExactly how the Vikings navigated the open seas with such success is unclear. While some evidence points to the use of [[Sunstone (medieval)|calcite \"sunstones\"]] to find the sun's location, modern reproductions of Viking \"sky-polarimetric\" navigation have found these sun compasses to be highly inaccurate, and not usable in cloudy or foggy weather.<ref>Horv\u00e0th, G. et al.

Close to the border with the Franks, it was effectively a crossroads between the cultures, until its eventual destruction by the Norwegians in an internecine dispute around 1050. [[York]] was the centre of the kingdom of [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] from 866, and discoveries there (e.g., a silk cap, a counterfeit of a coin from Samarkand and a cowry shell from the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Persian Gulf]]) suggest that Scandinavian trade connections in the 10th century reached beyond [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. However, those items could also have been Byzantine imports, and there is no reason to assume that the [[Varangian]]s travelled significantly beyond Byzantium and the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\n==Genetics==\nA genetic study published at [[bioRxiv]] in July 2019 examined the population genomics of the Viking Age. 442 ancient humans from across [[Europe]] and the [[North Atlantic]] were surveyed, stretching from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Early Modern Period]]. It was found that there was a notable foreign gene flow into Scandinavia in the years preceding the Viking Age and during the Viking Age itself. This gene flow entered [[Denmark]] and eastern [[Sweden]], from which it spread into the rest of [[Scandinavia]]. The study also found that despite close cultural similarities, there were distinct genetic differences between regional populations in the Viking Age. These differences have persisted into modern times. Inland areas were found to be more genetically homogenous than coastal areas and islands such as [[\u00d6land]] and [[Gotland]]. These islands were probably important trade settlements. The Vikings were found to have left a profound genetic imprint in the areas they settled, which has persisted into modern times. The genetic data from these areas affirmed conclusions previously drawn from historical and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Margaryan|2019}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n== Scandinavia ==\n{{Main|History_of_Scandinavia}}\nDuring, and as a result of the Viking Age, Scandinavia moved from a loose coexistence of tribes and petty kingdoms to the three Nordic countries that still exist today. \n\n== Settlements outside Scandinavia ==\n;British Isles\n\nEngland\n* [[Danelaw]]\n* [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] ([[York]])\n* [[Cumbria]]\n\nIreland\n* [[Arklow]]\n* [[Early Scandinavian Dublin|Dyflin]] ([[Dublin]])\n* Hlymrekr ([[Limerick]])\n* [[History of Waterford|Ve\u00f0rafj\u01ebr\u00f0r]] ([[Waterford]])\n* V\u00edkingr-l\u00f3 ([[Wicklow]])<ref>Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names</ref>\n* Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r ([[Wexford]])\n\nIsle of Man\n* [[Isle of Man|Mann]]\n\nScotland\n* [[Caithness]]\n* [[Galloway]]\n* [[Kintyre]]\n* [[Nor\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]])\n* [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]]\n* [[Su\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Hebrides]])\n* [[Sutherland]]\n\n;Western Europe\n* [[Normandy]]\n\n;Eastern Europe\n* [[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]] (Russia)\n\n;Northern Europe\n* [[Grobi\u0146a|Seeburg]]\n\n;Atlantic\n* [[Faroe Islands]]\n* [[Iceland]]\n* [[Greenland]]\n\n;North America\n* [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse colonisation of the Americas]]\n* [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] (and possibly a larger area called [[Vinland]])\n\n== Old Norse influence on the English language ==\nThe long-term linguistic effect of the Viking settlements in England was threefold: [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|over a thousand Old Norse words]] eventually became part of [[Standard English]]; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin.<ref name=\"Crystal\">Crystal, David, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'', CUP, 2001 edition, {{ISBN|0-521-59655-6}}, pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Scandinavian words that entered the English language included ''landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting'' and ''steersman''.<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used ''sk-'' sounds, such as ''skirt, sky,'' and ''skin''; other words appearing in written sources at this time included ''again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak'' and ''window'' from Old Norse meaning \"wind-eye\".<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> Some of the words that came into use are among the most common in English, such as ''to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get'' and ''give''.

The word 'Viking' did not come into general use in the English language until the middle of the nineteenth Century - at about the same time that it was introduced into serious academic literature in Scandinavia - and has since then changed its meaning and been much abused. It must, however, be accepted that the term is today used throughout the world as a descriptor of the peoples of Scandinavia in the period from the late eighth Century until the mid-eleventh Century. To the general public, however, it has apparently two meanings; both are respectable and hallowed in the English language by two centuries of usage. The first is in the sense of 'raider' or 'pirate', the second in the sense of the activities of the Scandinavians outside their own country in that period. It is the latter meaning that has given rise to the useful term 'the Viking Age'. Disregarding the ultimate philology of the word and the history of its use over the centuries, which has been much discussed, it is now in such everyday use by both specialists and non-specialists - however improperly - to describe the Scandinavians of the Viking Age, that it almost impossible to avoid its use in this generic sense. Although it is often appropriate and necessary to use such terms as 'Scandinavian' or 'Norse', as I have done in this book, it is often simpler and less confusing to label something as 'Viking' rather than deal in scholastic circumlocution to placate purists, however justified they may be in their arguments.\" |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1= |first1= |date=2010 |orig-year= |chapter=Vikings |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195334036.001.0001/acref-9780195334036-e-0957?rskey=8P9rGR&result=3 |editor1-last=Rogers |editor1-first=Clifford J. |editor1-link=Clifford J.

Lindisfarne was different. The Viking devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island was reported by the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]], who wrote: \"Never before in Britain has such a terror appeared\".<ref>[[#Jones|Jones]], p. 195. Simeon of Durham recorded the raid in these terms:\n<blockquote>And they came to the church of Lindisfarne, laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy places with polluted feet, dug up the altars, and seized all the treasures of the holy church. They killed some of the brothers; some they took away with them in fetters; many they drove out, naked and loaded with insults; and some they drowned in the sea.\"</blockquote>\nMagnus Magnusson, ''Vikings!'', p. 32.</ref>\n\nVikings were portrayed as wholly violent and bloodthirsty by their enemies. In medieval English chronicles, they are described as \"wolves among sheep\".\n\nThe first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age reached a small readership in Britain. Linguistics traced the Viking Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. New dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled more Victorians to read the Icelandic Sagas.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and Swedish scholar [[Olaus Rudbeck]] were the first to use runic inscriptions and Icelandic Sagas as primary historical sources. During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and Nordic Renaissance, historians such as the Icelandic-Norwegian [[Thormodus Torf\u00e6us]], Danish-Norwegian [[Ludvig Holberg]], and Swedish [[Olof von Dalin]] developed a more \"rational\" and \"pragmatic\" approach to historical scholarship.\n\nBy the latter half of the 18th century, while the [[Icelandic saga]]s were still used as important historical sources, the Viking Age had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the Nordic countries.\n\nScholars outside Scandinavia did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the Vikings until the 1890s, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Northern Shores: a history of the Baltic Sea and its peoples |last=Palmer |first=Alan Warwick |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7195-6299-0 |oclc=63398802}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, the history of the Viking Age had largely been based on Icelandic Sagas, the history of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] written by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], the [[Kievan Rus']]<nowiki/>s ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', and ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]''.

They also settled in the [[Faroe Islands]], Ireland, Iceland, peripheral Scotland ([[Caithness]], the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Northern Isles]]), Greenland, and Canada.\n\nTheir [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], [[Old Norse]], became the mother-tongue of present-day Scandinavian languages. By 801, a strong central authority appears to have been established in [[Jutland]], and the Danes were beginning to look beyond their own territory for land, trade, and plunder.\n\nIn Norway, mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. Communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in lowland Denmark. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway.\n\nThe sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century, Scandinavians began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the Viking Age. The [[North Sea]] rovers were traders, colonisers, explorers, and plunderers.\n\n== Probable causes of Norse expansion ==\n{{Norse people sidebar}}\n{{Main|Viking expansion}}\nMany theories are posited for the cause of the Viking invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role. At the time, England, Wales, and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Overpopulation, especially near the [[Scandinavian Mountains|Scandes]], was possibly influential (this theory regarding overpopulation is disputed).<ref>\"One of the most popular explanations offered for the Viking phenomenon is that overpopulation created a need for more land\u2014especially in mountainous Norway\u2014and thus the Vikings were largely motivated by a desire to colonise. Peter Sawyer, for example, in 1971, said that the first raids on Britain, by the Norwegians, were a byproduct of the colonisation of the Orkneys and the Shetlands, and that the Norwegians were more interested in settlement than in plunder. More recently, however, a couple of problems have emerged with this explanation. For a start, Sawyer in 1982 reneged somewhat by saying that no good evidence exists for any population pressure in the eighth century. Patrick Wormald added that what has been taken for overpopulation was just population concentration due to economic expansion and the mining of iron ore. In a further point, Wormald states that no clear evidence has been found for any Viking settlement until the mid-9th century, some 50\u201360 years after the raids began. Thus, colonisation seems to have been a secondary feature of Viking activity; the success of the raids opened the way for settlement, but were not motivated by it, at least not initially.[http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 \"The Vikings&nbsp;\u2013 Why They Did It, from the edited  h2g2, the Unconventional Guide to Life, the Universe and Everything\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101335/http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 |date=18 May 2015 }} (3 July 2000).

Wickham. ''The Long Eighth Century: Production, Distribution, and Demand.'' Leiden: Brill, 2000.</ref> The Scandinavians, like many other Europeans, were drawn to these wealthier \"urban\" centres, which soon became frequent targets of Viking raids. The connection of the Scandinavians to larger and richer trade networks lured the Vikings into Western Europe, and soon the rest of Europe and parts of the Middle East. In England, hoards of Viking silver, such as the [[Cuerdale Hoard]] and the [[Vale of York Hoard]], offer good insight to this phenomenon.\n\n;Ideological model: This era coincided with the [[Medieval Warm Period]] (800\u20131300) and stopped with the start of the [[Little Ice Age]] (about 1250\u20131850). The start of the Viking Age, with the sack of Lindisfarne, also coincided with [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Saxon Wars]], or Christian wars with pagans in [[Old Saxony|Saxony]].

As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. The second case is the internal \"Push\" factor, which coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization of power in the modern-day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being eaten up by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.<ref>Barrett, James H. What Caused the Viking Age?

From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the ''[[Culdee|C\u00e9li D\u00e9]]'' Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.\n[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|upright=1.45|Viking expeditions (blue line): depicting the immense breadth of their voyages through most of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Northern [[Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Arctic]], and [[North America]].

Near the end of Charlemagne's reign (and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons), a string of Norse raids began, culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as [[History of Normandy#Scandinavian invasions|Normandy]].\n\nThe [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built [[longship]]s used by the Scandinavians were uniquely suited to both deep and shallow waters. They extended the reach of Norse raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western Europe. [[Rurik]] also expanded to the east, and in 859 became ruler either by conquest or invitation by local people of the city of [[Novgorod]] (which means \"new city\") on the [[Volkhov River]]. [[Rurik Dynasty|His successors]] moved further, founding the early East Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] with the capital in [[Kiev]]. This persisted until 1240, when the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols invaded Russia]].\n\nOther Norse people continued south to the [[Black Sea]] and then on to [[Constantinople]]. Whenever these Viking ships ran aground in shallow waters, the Vikings  reportedly turned them on their sides and dragged them across the shallows into deeper waters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The eastern connections of these \"[[Varangians]]\" brought [[Byzantine silk]], a [[cowrie shell]] from the Red Sea, and even coins from [[Samarkand]], to [[Jorvik|Viking York]].\n\nIn 884, an army of Danish Vikings was defeated at the [[Battle of Norditi]] (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic [[North Sea]] coast by a [[Frisians|Frisian]] army under Archbishop [[Rimbert]] of Bremen-Hamburg, which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the Vikings from [[East Frisia]].\n\nIn 911, French King [[Charles the Simple]] was able to make an agreement with the Viking warleader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], a chieftain of disputed Norwegian or Danish origins.<ref>The material suggesting a Norwegian origin identifies him with [[Rollo|Hrolf the Ganger]], also known as \"Rolf the Walker\"</ref> Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted  his followers and him possession of Normandy. In return, Rollo swore [[fealty]] to Charles, converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of France against the incursions of other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as Norman, but also carried the [[Norman language]] (a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language with Germanic influence), and their Norman culture, into England in 1066. With the [[Norman Conquest]], they became the ruling aristocracy of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo\u2013Saxon England]].\n\nIn Scandinavia, the Viking age is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking era in Norway is marked by the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] in 1030. Although Olafr Haraldsson's (later known as [[Olaf II of Norway|Olav the Holy]]) army lost the battle, Christianity spread, partly on the strength of rumours of miraculous signs after his death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Norwegians would no longer be called Vikings. In Sweden, the reign of king [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung|Olov Sk\u00f6tkonung]] ({{circa|995\u20131020}}) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, and he is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted until the 12th century. Olof being the last king in Scandinavia to adopt a Christianity marked a definite end to the [[viking age]].  \n\nThe end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III ([[Harald Hardrada|Haraldr Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i]]), who was defeated by Saxon King [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066 at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]; in Ireland, the capture of [[Dublin]] by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] and his [[Normans in Ireland|Hiberno-Norman]] forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson]] at the [[Battle of Largs]] by troops loyal to [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by another Viking descendant, [[William I of England|William]], Duke of [[Normandy]]. Scotland took its present form when it regained territory from the [[Norsemen|Norse]] between the 13th and the 15th centuries; the [[Western Isles]] and the [[Isle of Man]] remained under Scandinavian authority until 1266.

The raiders killed the monks and captured the valuables. The raid marks the beginning of the \"Viking Age of Invasion\", made possible by the Viking longship. Great but sporadic violence occurred from the last decade of the eighth century on England's northern and eastern shores; Viking raids continued on a small scale across coastal England. While the initial raiding groups were small, a great amount of planning is believed to have been  involved. The Norwegians raided during the winter of 840\u2013841, rather than the usual summer, having waited on an island off Ireland. In 850, Vikings overwintered for the first time in England, on the [[Isle of Thanet|island of Thanet]], [[Kent]]. In 854, a raiding party overwintered a second time, at the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in the Thames estuary. In 864, they reverted to Thanet for their winter encampment.<ref>[[#Hall|Hall]], p. 13</ref>\n\n[[File:England diocese map pre-925.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Anglo-Saxon [[diocese]]s before 925: Normal diocesan life was greatly disrupted in England during the Viking Age.]]\nThe following year, the [[Great Heathen Army]], led by brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]] ([[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] and [[Ubba]]), and also by another Viking [[Guthrum]], arrived in East Anglia. They proceeded to cross England into Northumbria and captured York, establishing the Viking community of Jorvik, where some settled as farmers and craftsmen. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings. In 867, Northumbria became the northern kingdom of the coalescing [[Danelaw]], after its conquest by the brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, who installed an Englishman, [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht]], as a puppet king. By 870, the \"Great Summer Army\" arrived in England, led by a Viking leader called [[Bagsecg]] and his five [[earl]]s. Aided by the Great Heathen Army (which had already overrun much of England from its base in Jorvik), Bagsecg's forces, and Halfdan's forces (through an alliance), the combined Viking forces raided much of England until 871, when they planned an invasion of Wessex. On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] along with his earls. As a result, many of the Vikings returned to northern England, where Jorvic had become the centre of the Viking kingdom, but [[Alfred the Great|Alfred of Wessex]] managed to keep them out of his country. Alfred and his successors continued to drive back the Viking frontier and take York. A new wave of Norwegian Vikings appeared in England in 947 when [[Eric Bloodaxe]] captured York.\n\n[[File:07Kbh Mus Drachenkopf 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Fire-gilded [[European dragon|dragon's head]] from Ireland, found in a Viking grave at [[Stavanger]], Norway ([[Nationalmuseet]], Copenhagen)]]\nIn 1003, the Danish King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] started a series of raids against England.

The death in the battle of King [[Harald Hardrada]] of Norway ended any hope of reviving Cnut's [[North Sea Empire]]; it is because of this, rather than the Norman conquest, that 1066 is often taken as the end of the Viking Age.  Nineteen days later, the Normans, themselves descended from Norsemen, [[Norman conquest of England|invaded England]] and defeated the weakened English army at the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\nIn 1152, [[Eystein II of Norway]] led a plundering raid down the east coast of Britain.<ref>[[#Forte|Forte]], p. 216</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{main|History of Ireland (800\u20131169)|Early Scandinavian Dublin|Norse-Gaels}}\n\nThe Vikings pillaged monasteries on Ireland's west coast in 795, and then spread out to cover the rest of the coastline. The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. By 830, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence. In some cases, they became allies and married each other.\n\nIn 832, a Viking fleet of about 120 invaded kingdoms on Ireland's northern and eastern coasts. Some believe that the increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland, as opposed to just touching the coasts. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations dispersed throughout Ireland.\n\nIn 838, a small Viking fleet entered the [[River Liffey]] in eastern Ireland. The Vikings set up a base, which the Irish called a [[longphort]]. This longphort eventually became Dublin. After this interaction, the Irish experienced Viking forces for about 40 years. The Vikings also established longphorts in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Wexford. The Vikings could sail through on the main river and branch off into different areas of the country.\n\nNorwegian Vikings and other Scandinavians conducted extensive raids in Ireland. They founded [[Limerick]] in 812, then established [[Waterford]] in 853, founded the only Viking capital city in the world outside the Nordic countries in [[Dublin]], and founded trading ports in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the 9th century. Predominantly Norwegians, and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians, settled down and intermixed with the Irish. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected West Norse culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin and solidified Dublin as an important city. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia, and central Asia. Dublin became so crowded by the 11th century that houses were constructed outside the town walls.\n\nOne of the last major battles involving Vikings was the [[Battle of Clontarf]] on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king [[Brian Boru]]'s army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of this world and the supernatural, including witches, goblins, and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live and who would die.\n\n=== Scotland ===\n{{Main|Scandinavian Scotland}}\nWhile  few records are known, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria.\n\nIn 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the [[River Tay]] and [[River Earn]], both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the [[Picts|Pictish kingdom]] of [[Fortriu]]. They defeated [[Uen of the Picts|Eog\u00e1n mac \u00d3engusa]], king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of [[D\u00e1l Riata]], [[\u00c1ed mac Boanta]], along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than 100 years since the time of [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (The accession of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn]] as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).\n\nIn 870, the [[Hen Ogledd|Britons of the Old North]] around the [[Firth of Clyde]] came under Viking attack as well. The fortress atop [[Alt Clut]] (\"Rock of the Clyde,\" the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] name for [[Dumbarton Rock]], which had become the [[metonym]] for their kingdom) was besieged by the Viking kings [[Amla\u00edb]] and [[\u00cdmar]]. After four months, its water supply failed, and the fortress fell. The Vikings are recorded to have transported a vast prey of British, Pictish, and English captives back to Ireland. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king [[Arthgal ap Dyfnwal]], who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. The fall of Alt Clut marked a watershed in the history of the realm. Afterwards, the capital of the restructured kingdom was relocated about 12 miles (20 km) up the River Clyde to the vicinity of [[Govan]] and [[Partick]] (within present-day [[Glasgow]]), and became known as the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], which persisted as a major regional political player for another 150 years.\n\nThe land that now comprises most of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] had previously been the northernmost part of the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]], which fell apart with its Viking conquest; these lands were never regained by the Anglo-Saxons, or England.  The upheaval and pressure of Viking raiding, occupation, conquest and settlement resulted in alliances among the formerly enemy peoples that comprised what would become present-day Scotland. Over the subsequent 300 years, this Viking upheaval and pressure led to the unification of the previously contending Gaelic, Pictish, British, and English kingdoms, first into the [[kingdom of Alba]], and finally into the greater Kingdom of Scotland. <ref>The Makers of Scotland: Picts, Romans, Gaels and Vikings, by Tim Clarkson, Birlinn Ltd, Edinburgh, 2013.\"</ref> The Viking Age in Scotland came to an end after another 100 years. The last vestiges of Norse power in the Scottish seas and islands were completely relinquished after another 200 years. \n\n==== Earldom of Orkney ====\nBy the mid-9th century, the Norsemen had settled in Shetland, Orkney (the Nordreys- ''[[Nor\u00f0reyjar]]''), the Hebrides and Isle of Man, (the Sudreys- ''[[Kingdom of the Isles|Su\u00f0reyjar]]''\u2014this survives in the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]]) and parts of mainland Scotland. The Norse settlers were to some extent integrating with the local [[Gael]]ic population (see [[Norse-Gaels]]) in the Hebrides and Man. These areas were ruled over by local [[Jarl (title)|Jarls]], originally captains of ships or ''[[hersir]]s''. [[Earl of Orkney|The Jarl of Orkney]] and Shetland, however, claimed supremacy.\n\nIn 875, King Harald Fairhair led a fleet from Norway to Scotland. In his attempt to unite Norway, he found that many of those opposed to his rise to power had taken refuge in the Isles. From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. He organised a fleet and was able to subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but also the Isles, Man, and parts of Scotland.\n\n==== Kings of the Isles ====\n{{Main|Kingdom of the Isles}}\nIn 876, the Norse-Gaels of Mann and the Hebrides rebelled against Harald. A fleet was sent against them led by [[Ketil Flatnose]] to regain control. On his success, Ketil was to rule the Sudreys as a vassal of [[Harald Fairhair|King Harald]]. His grandson, [[Thorstein the Red]], and [[Sigurd Eysteinsson|Sigurd the Mighty]], Jarl of Orkney, invaded Scotland and were able to exact tribute from nearly half the kingdom until their deaths in battle. Ketil declared himself King of the Isles. Ketil was eventually outlawed and, fearing the bounty on his head, fled to Iceland.\n\nThe Norse-Gaelic Kings of the Isles continued to act semi independently, in 973 forming a defensive pact with the Kings of Scotland and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]. In 1095, the [[King of Mann and the Isles]] [[Godred Crovan]] was killed by [[Magnus Barelegs]], King of Norway. Magnus and King [[Edgar of Scotland]] agreed on a treaty. The islands would be controlled by Norway, but mainland territories would go to Scotland. The King of Norway nominally continued to be king of the Isles and Man. However, in 1156, The kingdom was split into two. The Western Isles and Man continued as to be called the \"Kingdom of Man and the Isles\", but the [[Inner Hebrides]] came under the influence of [[Somerled]], a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker, who was styled 'King of the Hebrides'. His kingdom was to develop latterly into the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]].\n\nIn eastern [[Aberdeenshire]], the Danes invaded at least as far north as the area near [[Cruden Bay]].<ref>Hogan, C. Michael (2008) [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes \"'Catto Long Barrow fieldnotes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118120409/http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes#fieldnotes |date=18 January 2009 }}. ''The Modern Antiquarian''</ref>\n\nThe Jarls of Orkney continued to rule much of northern Scotland until 1196, when [[Harald Maddadsson]] agreed to pay tribute to [[William the Lion]], King of Scots, for his territories on the [[mainland]].\n\nThe end of the Viking age ''proper'' in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to [[Skye]], arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked up with those of [[Magnus Olafsson|King Magnus of Man]] and [[Dubhghall mac Ruaidhri|King Dougal of the Hebrides]]. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at [[Battle of Largs|Largs]], in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the Law-mender]] ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the [[Treaty of Perth]].\n\nOrkney and Shetland continued to be ruled as autonomous Jarldoms under Norway until 1468, when King [[Christian I]] pledged them as security on the [[dowry]] of his daughter, who was betrothed to [[James III of Scotland]].

They were carried out primarily in the summer, as the Vikings wintered in Scandinavia. Several coastal areas were lost to [[Francia]] during the reign of [[Louis the Pious]] (814\u2013840).

The incursions in 841 caused severe damage to [[Rouen]] and [[Jumi\u00e8ges]].

The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare as well as at sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates.\n\nThe Vikings used their longships to travel vast distances and attain certain tactical advantages in battle. They could perform highly efficient hit-and-run attacks, in which they quickly approached a target, then left as rapidly as possible before a counter-offensive could be launched. Because of the ships' negligible draft, the Vikings could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers. The ships were agile, and light enough to be carried over land from one river system to another. \"Under sail, the same boats could tackle open water and cross the unexplored wastes of the North Atlantic.\"<ref>Tignor, Robert; Adelman, Jeremy; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin; Kotkin, Stephen; Prakash, Gyan; Shaw, Brent; Aron, Stephen; Liu, Xinru; Marchand, Suzanne; Pittman, Holly; Tsin, Michael.

Kindle Edition.</ref> The ships' speed was also prodigious for the time, estimated at a maximum of {{convert|14|-|15|kn|km/h}}. The use of the longships ended when technology changed, and ships began to be constructed using saws instead of axes, resulting in inferior vessels.\n\nWhile battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship could be easily boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.<ref>Foote, P. and Wilson, D.M. (1970)''The Viking Achievement''. Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd. {{ISBN|0-283-35499-2}}. pp. 282\u201385.</ref>\n\nTogether with an increasing centralisation of government in the Scandinavian countries, the old system of ''[[leidang]]'' \u2014 a fleet mobilisation system, where every ''skipreide'' (ship community) had to maintain one ship and a crew \u2014 was discontinued as a purely military institution, as the duty to build and man a ship soon was converted into a tax. The Norwegian leidang was called under Haakon Haakonson for his 1263 expedition to Scotland during the Scottish\u2013Norwegian War, and the last recorded calling of it was in 1603. However, already by the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships. This led to the defeat of longship navies in most subsequent naval engagements--e.g., with the Hanseatic League.\n\nExactly how the Vikings navigated the open seas with such success is unclear. While some evidence points to the use of [[Sunstone (medieval)|calcite \"sunstones\"]] to find the sun's location, modern reproductions of Viking \"sky-polarimetric\" navigation have found these sun compasses to be highly inaccurate, and not usable in cloudy or foggy weather.<ref>Horv\u00e0th, G. et al.

This is a model of the town of ''Aros'' about 950. The town is now known as [[Aarhus]]]]\n[[File:Model of viking age Aarhus 05.JPG|alt=|thumb|The fortified Viking Age town of Aros]]\nSome of the most important trading ports founded by the Norse during the period include both existing and former cities such as [[Aarhus]] (Denmark), [[Ribe]] (Denmark), Hedeby (Germany), Vineta (Pomerania), Truso (Poland), [[Bj\u00f8rgvin]] (Norway), [[Kaupang]] (Norway), [[Skiringssal]] (Norway), [[Birka]] (Sweden), [[Bordeaux]] (France), [[Jorvik|York]] (England), Dublin (Ireland) and [[Staraya Ladoga|Aldeigjuborg]] (Russia).\n\nOne important centre of trade was at [[Hedeby]]. Close to the border with the Franks, it was effectively a crossroads between the cultures, until its eventual destruction by the Norwegians in an internecine dispute around 1050. [[York]] was the centre of the kingdom of [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] from 866, and discoveries there (e.g., a silk cap, a counterfeit of a coin from Samarkand and a cowry shell from the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Persian Gulf]]) suggest that Scandinavian trade connections in the 10th century reached beyond [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. However, those items could also have been Byzantine imports, and there is no reason to assume that the [[Varangian]]s travelled significantly beyond Byzantium and the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\n==Genetics==\nA genetic study published at [[bioRxiv]] in July 2019 examined the population genomics of the Viking Age. 442 ancient humans from across [[Europe]] and the [[North Atlantic]] were surveyed, stretching from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Early Modern Period]]. It was found that there was a notable foreign gene flow into Scandinavia in the years preceding the Viking Age and during the Viking Age itself. This gene flow entered [[Denmark]] and eastern [[Sweden]], from which it spread into the rest of [[Scandinavia]]. The study also found that despite close cultural similarities, there were distinct genetic differences between regional populations in the Viking Age. These differences have persisted into modern times. Inland areas were found to be more genetically homogenous than coastal areas and islands such as [[\u00d6land]] and [[Gotland]]. These islands were probably important trade settlements. The Vikings were found to have left a profound genetic imprint in the areas they settled, which has persisted into modern times. The genetic data from these areas affirmed conclusions previously drawn from historical and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Margaryan|2019}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n== Scandinavia ==\n{{Main|History_of_Scandinavia}}\nDuring, and as a result of the Viking Age, Scandinavia moved from a loose coexistence of tribes and petty kingdoms to the three Nordic countries that still exist today. \n\n== Settlements outside Scandinavia ==\n;British Isles\n\nEngland\n* [[Danelaw]]\n* [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] ([[York]])\n* [[Cumbria]]\n\nIreland\n* [[Arklow]]\n* [[Early Scandinavian Dublin|Dyflin]] ([[Dublin]])\n* Hlymrekr ([[Limerick]])\n* [[History of Waterford|Ve\u00f0rafj\u01ebr\u00f0r]] ([[Waterford]])\n* V\u00edkingr-l\u00f3 ([[Wicklow]])<ref>Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names</ref>\n* Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r ([[Wexford]])\n\nIsle of Man\n* [[Isle of Man|Mann]]\n\nScotland\n* [[Caithness]]\n* [[Galloway]]\n* [[Kintyre]]\n* [[Nor\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]])\n* [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]]\n* [[Su\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Hebrides]])\n* [[Sutherland]]\n\n;Western Europe\n* [[Normandy]]\n\n;Eastern Europe\n* [[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]] (Russia)\n\n;Northern Europe\n* [[Grobi\u0146a|Seeburg]]\n\n;Atlantic\n* [[Faroe Islands]]\n* [[Iceland]]\n* [[Greenland]]\n\n;North America\n* [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse colonisation of the Americas]]\n* [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] (and possibly a larger area called [[Vinland]])\n\n== Old Norse influence on the English language ==\nThe long-term linguistic effect of the Viking settlements in England was threefold: [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|over a thousand Old Norse words]] eventually became part of [[Standard English]]; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin.<ref name=\"Crystal\">Crystal, David, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'', CUP, 2001 edition, {{ISBN|0-521-59655-6}}, pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Scandinavian words that entered the English language included ''landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting'' and ''steersman''.<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used ''sk-'' sounds, such as ''skirt, sky,'' and ''skin''; other words appearing in written sources at this time included ''again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak'' and ''window'' from Old Norse meaning \"wind-eye\".<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> Some of the words that came into use are among the most common in English, such as ''to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get'' and ''give''. The system of personal pronouns was affected, with ''they, them'' and ''their'' replacing the earlier forms. Old Norse influenced the verb ''to be''; the replacement of ''sindon'' by ''are'' is almost certainly Scandinavian in origin, as is the third-person-singular ending ''-s'' in the present tense of verbs.<ref name=\"Crystal\" />\n\nThere are more than 1,500 Scandinavian place names in England, mainly in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (within the former boundaries of the ''Danelaw''): over 600 end in ''-by'', the Scandinavian word for \"village\"\u2014for example ''Grimsby, Naseby'' and ''Whitby'';<ref>\"The ''-by'' ending is almost entirely confined to the area of the Danelaw, supporting a theory of Scandinavian origin, despite the existence of the word ''by'' \"dwelling\" in Old English.\" Crystal, p 25.</ref> many others end in ''-thorpe'' (\"farm\"), ''-thwaite'' (\"clearing\"), and ''-toft'' (\"homestead\").<ref name=\"Crystal\" />\n\nThe distribution of family names showing Scandinavian influence is still, as an analysis of names ending in ''-son'' reveals, concentrated in the north and east, corresponding to areas of former Viking settlement.

For a few years, he had been living in New York, driving a taxicab, and running a small business repairing typewriters, when he managed to sign a deal with a [[Czechoslovakia]]n company to manufacture their designs in Canada. He moved to Toronto to start production. By the late 1950s, a wave of Japanese machines forced most North American typewriter companies to cease business, but Tramiel instead turned to [[adding machine]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/9/2936643/commodore-founder-jack-tramiel-dies|title=Commodore founder Jack Tramiel dies |work= The verge |date=April 9, 2012|access-date= December 8, 2017 |last=Sottek |first=T.C.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the company was formally incorporated as Commodore Business Machines, Inc. (CBM) in Canada. In 1962 Commodore went public on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), under the name of Commodore International Limited. In the late 1960s, history repeated itself when Japanese firms started producing and exporting adding machines. The company's main investor and chairman, [[Irving Gould]], suggested that Tramiel travel to Japan to understand how to compete.

It did so by buying a small startup company called [[Amiga Corporation]] in February 1984, for $25 million ($12.8 million in cash and 550,000 in common shares) which became a subsidiary of Commodore, called Commodore-Amiga, Inc.<ref>David Needle. \"Special Report\" p.90 Personal Computing, (August 1985)</ref> Commodore brought this new [[32-bit]] computer design (initially codenamed \"Lorraine\") from 1979, and had been called High-Toro from 1980 to 1981 then later dubbed the Amiga, under Amiga Inc. in early 1982. There were three unsuccessful attempts to release the Amiga by [[Jay Miner]] and company. These were: 1982, 1983 and one more after Commodore bought Amiga in 1984, after which it was released only to the local public. Then in 1985 Commodore re-released it to the world. Cost was $1000-$1300.\n\nBut Tramiel had beaten Commodore to the punch. His design was 95% completed by June. In July 1984 he bought the consumer side of Atari Inc. from [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]] which allowed him to strike back and release the [[Atari ST]] earlier in 1985 for about $800. The Atari ST was technology-wise almost out, however the Amiga was out sooner.\n\nDuring development in 1981, Amiga had exhausted venture capital and was desperate for more financing.

Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for his new computer, he approached Atari and entered negotiations. After several on-again/off-again talks with Atari in May and June 1984, Tramiel had secured his funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July.\n\nAs more execs and researchers left Commodore after the announcement to join up with Tramiel's new company [[Atari Corp.]], Commodore followed by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets in late July. This was intended, in effect, to bar Tramiel from releasing his new computer.\n\nOne of Tramiel's first acts after forming Atari Corp. was to fire most of Atari's remaining staff, and to cancel almost all ongoing projects, in order to review their continued viability. In late July/early August, Tramiel representatives discovered the original Amiga contract from the previous fall. Seeing a chance to gain some leverage, Tramiel immediately used the contract to counter-sue Commodore through its new subsidiary, Amiga, on August 13.\n\nThe Amiga crew, still suffering serious financial problems, had sought more monetary support from investors that entire spring. At around the same time that Tramiel was in negotiations with Atari, Amiga entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions ultimately led to Commodore's intentions to purchase Amiga outright, which would (from Commodore's viewpoint) cancel any outstanding contracts - including Atari Inc.'s. This \"interpretation\" is what Tramiel used to counter-sue, and sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing any resembling technology. This was an attempt to render Commodore's new acquisition (and the source for its next generation of computers) useless. The resulting court case lasted for several years, with both companies releasing their respective products. In the end, the Amiga computer outlasted the Atari.<ref name=\"Jay Miner\">Jay Miner</ref>\n\n[[File:Amiga500 system1.jpg|270px|thumb|right|Amiga 500 (1987)]]\n\nThroughout the life of the ST and Amiga platforms, a ferocious Atari-Commodore rivalry raged. While this rivalry was in many ways a holdover from the days when the Commodore 64 had first challenged the Atari 800 (among others) in a series of scathing television commercials, the events leading to the launch of the ST and Amiga only served to further alienate fans of each computer, who fought vitriolic [[Flame war#Holy wars|holy wars]] on the question of which platform was superior.

This was addressed with the VIC-20 in 1981, which was introduced at a cost of US$299 and sold in retail stores. Commodore bought aggressive advertisements featuring [[William Shatner]] asking consumers \"Why buy just a video game?\" The strategy worked and the VIC-20 became the first computer to ship more than one million units.

Thanks to a well-designed set of [[integrated circuit|chips]] designed by MOS Technology, the Commodore 64, (also referred to as C64), possessed remarkable sound and graphics for its time and is often credited with starting the computer [[demo scene]]. Its US$595 price was high compared with that of the VIC-20, but it was still much less expensive than any other 64K computer on the market. Early C64 advertisements boasted, \"You can't buy a better computer at twice the price.\" Australian adverts in the mid-1980s used a tune speaking the words \"Are you keeping up with the Commodore?

TI responded by cutting prices on its [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]], which had been introduced in 1981. Soon there was an all-out price war involving Commodore, TI, [[Atari]], and practically every vendor other than [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. Commodore began selling the VIC-20 and C64 through mass-market retailers such as [[Kmart|K-Mart]], in addition to traditional computer stores. By the end of this conflict, Commodore had shipped somewhere around 22 million C64s, making the C64 the best selling computer of all time.\n[[File:C16pi.jpg|right|thumb|<span style=\"font-size:85%\">The \"heart\" of Commodore's philosophy: Early [[Commodore 16]] main PCB (prototype), not used in regular series model.

It did so by buying a small startup company called [[Amiga Corporation]] in February 1984, for $25 million ($12.8 million in cash and 550,000 in common shares) which became a subsidiary of Commodore, called Commodore-Amiga, Inc.<ref>David Needle. \"Special Report\" p.90 Personal Computing, (August 1985)</ref> Commodore brought this new [[32-bit]] computer design (initially codenamed \"Lorraine\") from 1979, and had been called High-Toro from 1980 to 1981 then later dubbed the Amiga, under Amiga Inc. in early 1982. There were three unsuccessful attempts to release the Amiga by [[Jay Miner]] and company. These were: 1982, 1983 and one more after Commodore bought Amiga in 1984, after which it was released only to the local public. Then in 1985 Commodore re-released it to the world. Cost was $1000-$1300.\n\nBut Tramiel had beaten Commodore to the punch. His design was 95% completed by June. In July 1984 he bought the consumer side of Atari Inc. from [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]] which allowed him to strike back and release the [[Atari ST]] earlier in 1985 for about $800. The Atari ST was technology-wise almost out, however the Amiga was out sooner.\n\nDuring development in 1981, Amiga had exhausted venture capital and was desperate for more financing. Jay Miner and company had approached former employer [[Atari]], and the Warner-owned Atari had paid Amiga to continue development work.<ref>{{cite web|title=TOP SECRET: Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/mickey.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723091215/http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/mickey.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-23 |date=November 1981 |work=Atari Historical Society |accessdate=2006-07-23 }}</ref> In return Atari was to get one-year exclusive use of the design as a video game console.

Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for his new computer, he approached Atari and entered negotiations. After several on-again/off-again talks with Atari in May and June 1984, Tramiel had secured his funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July.\n\nAs more execs and researchers left Commodore after the announcement to join up with Tramiel's new company [[Atari Corp.]], Commodore followed by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets in late July. This was intended, in effect, to bar Tramiel from releasing his new computer.\n\nOne of Tramiel's first acts after forming Atari Corp. was to fire most of Atari's remaining staff, and to cancel almost all ongoing projects, in order to review their continued viability. In late July/early August, Tramiel representatives discovered the original Amiga contract from the previous fall. Seeing a chance to gain some leverage, Tramiel immediately used the contract to counter-sue Commodore through its new subsidiary, Amiga, on August 13.\n\nThe Amiga crew, still suffering serious financial problems, had sought more monetary support from investors that entire spring. At around the same time that Tramiel was in negotiations with Atari, Amiga entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions ultimately led to Commodore's intentions to purchase Amiga outright, which would (from Commodore's viewpoint) cancel any outstanding contracts - including Atari Inc.'s. This \"interpretation\" is what Tramiel used to counter-sue, and sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing any resembling technology. This was an attempt to render Commodore's new acquisition (and the source for its next generation of computers) useless. The resulting court case lasted for several years, with both companies releasing their respective products. In the end, the Amiga computer outlasted the Atari.<ref name=\"Jay Miner\">Jay Miner</ref>\n\n[[File:Amiga500 system1.jpg|270px|thumb|right|Amiga 500 (1987)]]\n\nThroughout the life of the ST and Amiga platforms, a ferocious Atari-Commodore rivalry raged. While this rivalry was in many ways a holdover from the days when the Commodore 64 had first challenged the Atari 800 (among others) in a series of scathing television commercials, the events leading to the launch of the ST and Amiga only served to further alienate fans of each computer, who fought vitriolic [[Flame war#Holy wars|holy wars]] on the question of which platform was superior. This was reflected in sales numbers for the two platforms until the release of the [[Amiga 500]] in 1987, which led the Amiga sales to exceed the ST by about 1.5 to 1,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} despite reaching the market later.
