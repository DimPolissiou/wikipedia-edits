''Draconomicon'' (Wizards of the Coast, 2003).</ref> For example, a commonly presented species of dragon is the red dragon, which is named for its red scales, and known for its evil and greedy nature, as well as its ability to [[fire breathing|breathe fire]].<ref>Monster Manual</ref> In the game, dragons are usually adversaries of [[player character]]s, and less commonly, allies or helpers. Even though dragons are iconic for the ''D&D'' game, they are rarely encountered as part of official scenarios due to dragons typically being too powerful for low-level players. An exception to this is the [[Dragonlance]] game world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Classification ==\nIn the ''D&D'' universe, there are many different species of dragons. However, despite their variety, a number of traits are common to nearly all types of dragons. All species appear to be generally [[reptile|reptilian]] or serpentine in their natural form. Except for the youngest dragons, they tend to be quite large\u2014usually at least as big as a horse, and often much larger. Most species depicted have wings and are able to fly, and nearly all are [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]]. Almost all species of dragon are highly intelligent (at least as intelligent as a human being) and are able to speak. Essentially all species of dragon are said to be magical in nature, and in most species this nature is expressed as an affinity for some type of elemental power; some dragon species are naturally able to cast magical spells, as well. Most dragons have the ability to breathe or expel one or more types of energy associated with their elemental affinity, as well as bearing some resistance to damage or injury from any other sources of such energy. Dragons are egg-layers, and most have sharp teeth, horns, and claws. A ''D&D'' dragon is protected by its scaly hide, the color of which is determined by the dragon's species, and which also offers a visual clue to the specific elemental nature of each species of dragon. Each species of dragon has a particular temperament associated with it, as well as a deeply rooted moral outlook derived from that temperament; these factors underlie the personality and behavior of each individual dragon. Typically, dragons do not vary widely in appearance or personality within a species, although exceptions are possible, especially in certain ''D&D'' settings, such as Eberron. \n\nBecause ''D&D'' dragons are essentially monstrous creatures designed to antagonize player characters, the majority of dragons in ''D&D'' are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|evil]] by default. This was particularly the case in the original Dungeon and Dragons releases (such as the [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|''Dungeons & Dragons'' \"white box\" set]] (1974) and [[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]) where only the gold dragon was lawful good while all other colors were chaotic evil (red, green, black) or neutral evil (blue, white).<ref>[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], and [[Dave Arneson]]. ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (3-Volume Set) (TSR, 1974)</ref> \n\nSome dragons (particularly metallic dragons) have two different kinds of breath, usually a lethal one (fire, ice, acid, electricity, etc.) and another that is typically non-lethal (paralysis, repulsion, confusion, etc.).\n\nIn the [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition|second edition of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'']] (''AD&D''), dragons were completely reworked from their first edition counterparts, and were much more powerful. For example, they had magic resistance, could no longer be subdued, and had physical attack forms besides just claws and bites.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\">{{cite web| url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp| title = ''Dungeons & Dragons'' FAQ| accessdate = 2008-10-03| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081002132129/http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp| archivedate = 2008-10-02| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n''AD&D'' 2nd edition and [[Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition|''D&D'' 3rd edition]] divided true dragons further into three main categories: ''chromatic dragons'', such as green and black dragons, which are evil-[[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|aligned]]; ''metallic dragons'', such as gold and [[Metallic dragon#Silver dragon|silver]] dragons, which are good; and neutral-aligned ''gem dragons'', rare creatures that possess [[Psionics (role-playing games)|psionic]] abilities. In addition, there were other sub-species of true dragons that did not fit into the three main categories. For example, mercury and steel dragons would seem to be metallic dragons, but in the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' world they are considered to be outside of the main family of metallic dragons because of various biological differences (though the book ''Dragons of Faer\u00fbn'' did list them as metallic dragons). The \"lung dragons\" or spirit-dragons of ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' are also true dragons.\n\nThe third edition of ''D&D'' classifies dragon as a type of creature, simply defined as \"a reptilelike creature, usually winged, with magical or unusual abilities\".<ref>Andy Collins, Skip Williams, and James Wyatt. ''Monster Manual'' (Wizards of the Coast, 2000).</ref>  The dragon type is broken down into several classifications. True dragons are dragons which increase in power by age categories (wyrmling to great wyrm). Lesser dragons do not improve in age categories and may lack all of the abilities of true dragons. Examples of lesser dragons include [[Dragon turtle (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragon turtles]] and [[Wyvern (Dungeons & Dragons)|wyverns]]. Other creatures with the dragon type include drakes, felldrakes, elemental drakes, landwyrms, [[Lindworm|linnorms]] and wurms.  (An unrelated creature called a dragonne is named for its coincidental resemblance to a brass dragon.)\n\nHowever, with [[Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition|''D&D'' 4th edition]], the classifications were changed: chromatic dragons became not strictly evil, and metallic dragons became not necessarily good. Also, there are several new categories (although the gem dragons have not yet returned): \"planar dragons\" which are defined as dragons that were warped by living on a plane of existence other than the Material Plane, \"catastrophe dragons\", which take on the aspects of natural disasters which are chaotic evil and cause chaos for its own sake, and \"scourge dragons\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20081020b |title=Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Official Home Page - Article (Excerpts: Origins) |publisher=Wizards.com |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref> Chromatic dragons are presented in the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons''. Metallic dragons are presented in the ''Monster Manual 2'' and ''Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons''. Catastrophe dragons are presented in ''Monster Manual 3''. Planar dragons have been presented in both ''Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons'' and ''Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons''.\n\nDetailed information about ''D&D'' dragonkind in second, third, or fourth editions may be found in their respective editions of the ''[[Draconomicon]]'', a ''D&D'' supplement book designed especially for draconic information. No such book was published for the first edition, although the Basic game had a ''[[Bestiary of Dragons and Giants]]'' ([[Adventure (D&D)#Module Codes|coded]] AC10).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/miscpages/ac.html|title=Accessory Modules|website=Acaeum.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nFive evil-aligned dragons (white dragon, black dragon, green dragon, blue dragon, and red dragon), and the lawful-good aligned golden dragon (in ascending order of magic power and capabilities) first appeared in the original [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|''Dungeons & Dragons'' \"white box\" set]] (1974).<ref>[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], and [[Dave Arneson]]. ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (3-Volume Set) (TSR, 1974)</ref> The [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk Campaign supplement]] (1975) added the copper dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, and silver dragon, along with the Platinum Dragon ([[Bahamut (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bahamut]]) and the Chromatic Dragon ([[Tiamat (Dungeons & Dragons)|Tiamat]]).\n\nThe white dragon, black dragon, red dragon and brass dragon reappeared in the original ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' (1977). The six dragons from the 1974 boxed set appeared in the ''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Rulebook'' (1981), and again in the 1983 version of the ''Basic Set'' (1983). These six appeared along with the gemstone dragons (crystal dragon, onyx dragon, jade dragon, sapphire dragon, ruby dragon and amber dragon), and the dragon rulers (Pearl (the Moon Dragon), Ruler of all Chaotic Dragons; Diamond (the Star Dragon), Ruler of all Lawful Dragons; Opal (the Sun Dragon), Ruler of all Neutral Dragons; and the Great One, Ruler of All Dragonkind) in the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'' (1991).\n\nThe five chaotic-aligned dragon types from the 1974 boxed set, as well as the gold dragon and the four new dragon types from the ''Greyhawk'' supplement (the copper dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, and silver dragon) appeared in first edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' in the original ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (1977), along with Bahamut and Tiamat. The former five dragon types were given as evil-aligned, while the latter five dragon types were given as good-aligned. The ten dragon types were given pseudoscientific names as follows: black (''draco causticus sputem''), blue (''draco electricus''), brass (''draco impudentus gallus''), bronze (''draco gerus bronzo''), copper (''draco comes stabuli''), gold (''draco orientalus sino dux''), green (''draco chlorinous nauseous respiratorus''), red (''draco conflagratia horriblus''), silver (''draco nobilis argentum''), and white (''draco rigidus frigidus'').<ref>[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (TSR, 1977)</ref> The Oriental dragons appeared in the original ''[[Fiend Folio]]'' (1981), including the li lung (earth dragon), the lung wang (sea dragon), the pan lung (coiled dragon), the shen lung (spirit dragon), the t'ien lung (celestial dragon), and the yu lung (carp dragon).  The cloud dragon, the faerie dragon, the mist dragon, and the shadow dragon appeared in the original ''Monster Manual II'' (1983).\n\nThe black dragon, blue dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, green dragon, red dragon, silver dragon, and white dragon appeared in second edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' in the ''Monstrous Compendium Volume One'' (1989).<ref>[[David \"Zeb\" Cook|Cook, David]], et al.

The chromatic dragons (black dragon, blue dragon, green dragon, red dragon, and white dragon), the gem dragons (amethyst dragon, crystal dragon, emerald dragon, sapphire dragon, and topaz dragon), metallic dragons (brass dragon, bronze dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, and silver dragon), brown dragon, cloud dragon, deep dragon, mercury dragon, mist dragon, shadow dragon, steel dragon, and yellow dragon appeared in the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993).<ref>Stewart, Doug, ed. ''[[Monster Manual|Monstrous Manual]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1993)</ref> The onyx dragon, jade dragon, ruby dragon and amber dragon appeared in the ''Monstrous Compendium Mystara Appendix'' (1994).\n\nThe chromatic dragons (black, blue, green, red, and white), and the metallic dragons (brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver) appeared in the third edition in the ''Monster Manual'' (2000),<ref>[[Skip Williams|Williams, Skip]], [[Jonathan Tweet]], and [[Monte Cook]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2000)</ref> and in the revised 3.5 ''Monster Manual'' (2003). The Gem dragons appeared in the third edition in the ''Monster Manual II''.\n\nThe five chromatic dragon types  (black, blue, green, red, and white) appeared in young, adult, elder, and ancient variants in the fourth edition ''Monster Manual'' (2008). Three more chromatic dragon types appeared in ''Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons'': the brown dragon (aka, sand dragon), the grey dragon (aka, fang dragon), and the purple dragon (aka, deep dragon). The adamantine dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, iron dragon, and silver dragon appeared in the ''Monster Manual 2'' (2009).\n\n== Abilities ==\nIn ''D&D'', true dragons continue to become more powerful as they mature and age; they grow bigger and stronger, become more resistant to damage and magic, their breath weapon become increasingly dangerous and their knowledge and magical abilities improves. Old dragons can cast ''draconic magic'' which is a special form of ''D&D'' magic; dragons can cast spells with just a few words, rather than a sometimes long and complex ritual involving words, gestures and preparations like other ''D&D'' wizards. In 3 and 3.5 editions dragons cast spells spontaneously like [[Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons)|sorcerers]] do, sometimes having a wider choice of spells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/dragonTrue.htm |title=Dragon, True |publisher=d20srd.org |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref> Dragons also radiate a mystical ''fear aura'' around them. After a [[millennium]] or two, a dragon reaches his maximum development. In the ''Draconomicon'', there is also an article about Advanced Dragons, dragons that have reached their oldest age category but can still advance \"virtual age categories\", and become larger and stronger.\n\nMany ''D&D'' dragons have some innate magical abilities, but they vary from race to race. Metallic dragons are often able to [[shapechange]] into small animals or human forms, and use this ability to secretly help or watch over humans. Dragons also have some innate powers over the element they are linked to. For example, a red dragon (fire) will have some control over fires. Like all other draconic powers, they gain more as they grow older. Lesser dragons, for example [[Wyvern (Dungeons & Dragons)|wyverns]], halfdragons or dragonwrought kobolds may lack innate magical abilities, while still counting as dragons for purpose of all other effects.\n\n===Breath weapon===\n\nA '''breath weapon''' is the cone or line shaped weapon exhaled by dragons in ''D&D''.  Each type of dragon has a different breath weapon.  The [[chromatic dragon]]s (evil) have one breath weapon and the [[metallic dragon]]s (good) have two.  Other dragons and semi-dragons frequently have breath weapons.  One example is the [[Dragon turtle (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragon turtle's]] cone of steam breath weapon.\n\n====Form====\n\nBreath weapons typically come in one of three forms.\n* Line: Does damage in a straight line.  For example, the blue dragon's line of lightning.\n* Cone: Does damage in a wide cone shape.  For example, the [[Red dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|red dragon]]'s cone of fire.\n* Cloud: Does damage with a cloud of gas.  For example, the green dragon's cloud of chlorine gas.\n\n====Composition====\n\nBreath weapons typically are composed of one of several materials.\n* Fire: Magical fire is used by [[Gold dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|gold dragon]]s, brass dragons and red dragons.\n* Electricity: Lightning is exhaled by blue dragons and bronze dragons.\n* Acid: The black and copper dragon exhale a powerful acid.\n* Poison: The green dragon's breath weapon is a cloud of chlorine gas.\n* Cold: The white and silver dragons both release a cone of sub zero air and ice.\n\n=== Magic ===\n{{expand section|date=November 2019}}\nTrue dragons are born with a natural flair for magic, but they need to practise and hone their skills and come of age before they are able to use it to any meaningful effect.<ref>{{cite book|title=Draconomicon - The Book of Dragons|publisher=WotC|author=Collins, Williams og Wyatt|date=November 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Dragon Magic|publisher=WotC|author=Stephens and Thompson|date=September 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Biology ==\n''D&D'' dragons are able to eat almost everything, but each race has a preferred diet (some prefer flesh, other prefer to eat precious metals or gems, and so forth).\n\nDragons are inherently magical beings, and are cold blooded reptiles. They have no biological relationship to mammals.\n\nThe number of eggs laid each time depends on the race of the dragon, but is usually low (between one and ten). Dragons can also cross-breed with virtually any other creature, creating a [[half-dragon]]. The most commonly heard of are in the humanoid races, particularly with human and elves. Any combination is possible, however, even with [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]] or [[Angel (Dungeons & Dragons)|angels]].\n\nAs far as senses, which vary slightly depending on species, they are superior in most ways to other creatures; like any predator, they have exceptionally acute senses, which only increase with age. Like avian creatures, they have excellent depth perception and comparingly good peripheral vision, able to see twice as well as a human in daylight; unlike avians, they have great night vision, and are able to see even when conditions have no light to offer, although in such conditions they cannot discern between colors.\n\nIn some editions,{{Vague|date=January 2011}} dragons can also pick up scents very well, utilizing both their sensitive nose and (often forked) tongue, much like a snake. In the 3.5 edition ''Monster Manual'' they do not have the Scent extraordinary ability [q.v.], so that a dragon's sense of smell does not markedly excel a human's.\n\nAlso, a dragon's hearing is roughly on par with human hearing, although a dragon's mind can filter what noise it hears. They are capable of \"blindsense\", the sense in which eyes, ears, and other senses are used to detect invisible persons or objects. Dragon taste is also refined, although they do not respond well to sweet flavors, and most dragons do not discuss the matter as to why. Of all its senses, a dragon's sense of touch is the only one to decrease throughout age, thanks mostly to the development of thick, hard scales.\n\n== Dragon personalities ==\nAll true dragons in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' are depicted as intelligent beings, and most of them exceedingly so. A dragon's personality varies by individual, but dragons of the same subrace tend to have similar mindsets. This is not always true; several exceptions exist in official ''D&D'' material. In the Forgotten Realms, a good-aligned red dragon is involved against his will in the Fall of the [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elven]] city of [[Myth Drannor]].\n\nDragon subraces encompass all ''D&D'' [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignments]], going from [[Lawful Good|lawful good]] paladin-like gold dragons to the cruel and very greedy [[Chaotic Evil|chaotic evil]] red dragons.\n\nAll dragons share a common desire to collect treasure, be it precious, beautiful, magical or just shiny\u2014indeed, the treasure in question needn't always be gold, and may sometimes be aesthetic in nature, ranging from popular artwork or sculptures or even rare books and tomes that might otherwise have an overwhelming monetary value. For [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|evil-aligned]] dragons, this generally directs a greedy attitude to achieve such wealth by whatever means suit them.  For [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|good]] dragons this lust for treasure is tempered, although they are certainly not averse to earning such wealth, and still appreciate gifts (while being insulted if offered an obvious bribe).\n\nBeing stronger, faster, generally smarter, and possessing longer life than humans and most other races, dragons tend to consider themselves superior creatures. For good-aligned dragons, this may only mean they often consider humanoid races as children, trying to take care of them and educate them; for evil-aligned dragons, they consider humanoids as mere animals, or as toys to play with; at best, they are minions and slaves.\n\nThe longevity of dragons is evident in their often lackadaisical attitudes. Good-aligned dragons, while concerned with defeating evil, are able to see a much broader scope of the world, and although certain crises arise that may seem extremely important to good-aligned humans, their dragon counterparts are able to see the event as an unimportant hiccup that will pass in mere centuries; even those that adventure with others tend show a sense of incredible patience, even in situations where all others feel they've not a second to lose. Similarly, evil-aligned dragons that are crossed by belligerent adventurers may plot for dozens of generations before exacting revenge on the trespasser's line\u2014it is not uncommon for those descended from the mentioned adventurer to find themselves the target of a dragon based simply on their lineage.\n\n== In campaign settings ==\nIn many settings, the [[god]]-[[monarch|king]] of the metallic dragons is [[Bahamut (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bahamut]], the Platinum Dragon, and the [[goddess]] and [[monarch|queen]] of the chromatic dragons is [[Tiamat (Dungeons & Dragons)|Tiamat]], the Five-Headed Dragon. She is based on the [[Tiamat]] from [[Babylonian mythology]], who was considered the evil mother of dragons, though the appearances of the fictional deity differs greatly from its model.<ref name=\"DV\"/>\n\nThe progenitor and supreme deity of all dragons in the game is known as Io. Other deities often included in the draconic pantheon of gods include [[Aasterinian]], [[Chronepsis]], and [[Faluzure]].  Other draconic gods may be present in different campaign settings.\n\n=== Dragonlance setting ===\nThe ''[[Dragonlance]]'' [[novel]]s and [[campaign setting]] helped popularize the ''D&D''-derived perspective on dragons. Here the Platinum Dragon is called Paladine, and the Dragon Queen is called [[Takhisis]].  Dragons are divided up into good and evil groups, known as the Metallic Dragons and the Chromatic Dragons, respectively.  Paladine leads the Metallic Dragons and Takhisis the Chromatic.  The Metallic Dragons rarely became involved in the world other than to oppose the actions of Chromatic Dragons, who often joined into war as their goddess Takhisis instructed.  However, in the \"Fifth Age\", massive Chromatic Dragons who were not native to Krynn emerged and took over many of the humanoid-controlled nations of Krynn, as well as slaying many of the native dragons.  They are known as Dragon Overlords.  There was one from each race of Chromatic Dragons; red, green, black, white, and blue.\n\n=== Dark Sun setting ===\nIn the world of [[Athas]] of the [[Dark Sun]] [[campaign setting]], normal D&D dragons do not exist. Dragon-like ''drake'' races exist, one for each [[classical element]], but for most people the word ''dragon'' refers to the Dragon of Tyr, who is a very powerful ''sorcerer-king'' (the tyrannic leaders of Athasian cities, who are both masters of magic and [[Psionics (Dungeons & Dragons)|psi]] abilities) who transformed himself into a dragon-like creature using very powerful (and painful) magic. However, this dragon (Bors or Borys) was eventually killed in [[Troy Denning]]'s book ''The Cerulean Storm'' by his former master, the sorcerer Rajaat. Several other sorcerer kings had been rumored to be dragons, but all others were only in a process of being transformed into a dragon type being, unique to the Athas world, which took several long stages to complete, but became greatly powerful if achieved.\n\n=== Forgotten Realms setting ===\nIn the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' [[campaign setting]], dragons are very close to the ones in [[Dragonlance]]. A sect of cultists called the ''Cult of the Dragon'' believes that dragons, particularly [[Undead (Dungeons & Dragons)|undead]] ones, will rule the world, and are trying to persuade evil dragons to become ''[[dracolich]]es'' -- undead [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]]-like dragons, which are partially bound to the cult by the [[ritual]]s which grant them their undead status. Additionally, in the ''D&D'' supplement book ''The Draconomicon'', several other undead varieties of the dragon \u2013 ghost, skeleton, vampire, and zombie dragons \u2013 are described.\n\nA series called Wyrms of the North ran in ''Dragon'' magazine issues #230 through #259 and was later updated to third edition rules on Wizards of the Coast's website (see external links).  Each article detailed an individual dragon of significance in [[Faer\u00fbn]].\n\nLately an ancient affliction that attacks dragons, rendering them mad; the Dracorage, was invoked causing countless dragons to rampage throughout Faer\u00fbn. A novel trilogy, ''[[The Year of Rogue Dragons]]'' set (''The Rage'', ''The Rite'', and ''The Ruin'') by [[Richard Lee Byers]], as well as a game accessory, ''[[Dragons of Faer\u00fbn]]'', details the exploits and deeds of several dragons as the Dracorage swept the continent.\n\n=== World of Greyhawk setting ===\n[[Steel dragon]]s, originally known as Greyhawk dragons, are those originating in the ''[[World of Greyhawk]]'' [[campaign setting]], later appearing in other settings like the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. They have hair-like spines around their heads, cat-like bodies with vaguely human-like faces, and scales resembling steel armor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mm/20040328a|title=Steel Dragon (conversion for 3.5 edition D&D)|author=Sean K Reynolds and Skip Williams|publisher=Wizards of the Coast}}</ref> They are much like the other races of metallic dragon with one primary exception: they prefer to maintain the form of another sentient race in order to mingle with, infiltrate, and study the cultures of men and their ilk. Few people know when they are interacting with a Steel Dragon, but they always have a feature which betrays them by resembling their natural complexion. Within the Greyhawk setting, such dragons are known to have made journeys into other material planes where they have come to be called steel dragons.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Sean K.

(The ''Draconomicon'' introduces rules for dragon PCs in standard ''Dungeons & Dragons''.) The setting is based around a society of dragons and their servitors and uses the standard ''D&D'' dragon races and dragon gods. It has detailed rules for creating and playing dragon PCs and NPCs, including various draconic [[character class]]es.\n\n=== Eberron setting ===\nIn the ''[[Eberron]]'' [[campaign setting]], three dragon gods have created the world: Siberys, Eberron and Khyber. Siberys and Eberron waged war against Khyber and imprisoned it within the depths of the earth. In the end, all three dragons merged with the land: Siberys becoming the sky, Eberron the continents and Khyber the underground world.\n\nDragons are apart from civilization, which is mostly concentrated on the continent of Khorvaire. They live on the continent of Argonnessen, a rather unknown place, since dragons are very territorial, it makes exploration often hazardous. The dragons used to rule over Eberron many centuries ago, but at the end of the Dragon-Fiend war, against the demons and devils of Khyber, they departed from Khorvaire to go to Argonnessen.\n\nDragons are immersed in the Draconic Prophecy, a legend which all bits of information are scattered throughout the world and that the outcome is unknown. They see every event as an important event in the Prophecy, and they even form an organization called the Chamber, where they send their brethren in search of clues. They can be of any alignment, like any creature in Eberron, so a good red dragon (usually evil) is as common as an evil gold dragon (usually good). This rule might throw some players off-balance. Dragons also consider themselves superior, treating all other races as inferior. Furthermore, any half-dragon spotted by these dragons is vowed to be hunted, as they treat these half-breeds as a disgrace to their image.\n\n=== Birthright setting ===\nThe [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]] [[campaign setting]] had its own version of a Dragon, named Cerilian Dragon, Cerilia being the main continent in the setting. They resemble more the eastern-type dragons being long and serpentine with leathery wings. Their backs are protected by iron-hard scales, their bellies by layers of thick, leathery skin. Their color ranges from reddish rust-brown to iron gray, with their bellies usually of a paler tone than their scales. Cerilian dragons are among the most ancient inhabitants of the continent, predating even elves and dwarves. Perhaps once there were many, but over the years, in-fighting and fighting the younger races have taken their toll. There are only a half dozen dragons known to be left. All living dragons are of the Old age or higher. Dragons are extremely intelligent and knowledgeable, conserving much lore that has been lost to the younger races. They speak their own language; some also speak Elven or Dwarven. Some of these dragons took part in the Battle of Deismaar, the only verified alive and awake dragons right now are the dragon of Vstaive Peaks in Vosgaard, also known as Vore Lekiniskiy and Kappenkriaucheran who inhabits the Drachenward mountains and controls their magic. The most famous of the dragons is Tarazin the Grey who has not been seen for several decades when the official campaign begins. The only known Dracolich is Komassa who lives in the Shadow World. Dragons in Birthright are meant to be rare and powerful beings and only rarely if ever appear in any adventure.\n\n==True dragons==\nIn most descriptions, true dragons only comprise the two families of chromatic dragons and metallic dragons. There are, however, many more families among the true dragons, and some kinds exists outside any specific category.\n\n===Chromatic dragons===\nA Chromatic dragon is a classification of fictional [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragon]]. Chromatic dragons are typically of evil [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]], in contrast to the [[metallic dragon]]s, which are typically of good alignment. Chromatic dragons have played a large role in various ''D&D'' monster compilation books: white, black, green, blue and red dragons being the classic chromatic dragons.<ref>{{Cite book | last = DeKirk | first = Ash | authorlink = Oberon_Zell-Ravenheart#Bibliography |author2=Oberon Zell  | title = Dragonlore: From the Archives of the Grey School of Wizardry | publisher = New Page Books | series =  | volume =  | edition = 1 | year = 2006 | location =  | pages = 224 | doi = | id =  | isbn = 978-1-56414-868-1 | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = }}</ref> [[Tiamat (Dungeons & Dragons)|Tiamat]] is the queen of chromatic dragons, based on the evil [[Tiamat|mother of all dragons]] from [[Babylonian mythology]].<ref name=\"DV\"/>\n====Publication history====\nThe classification of \"chromatic dragons\" was used in the ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' second edition ''Monstrous Manual'' (1993),<ref>Stewart, Doug, ed.

They are large with a wide wingspan. They have two swept back horns on their heads. They smell of smoke and sulphur. The eggs of a red dragon must be kept in open flame at all times while incubating. Incubation takes approximately 660 days. After the eggs are laid, the younger of the two parents remains behind to guard the eggs and keep the nest of flames burning. Once they hatch, the wyrmlings are left to fend for themselves. A red wyrmling is roughly human-sized at hatching and dangerous. They are capable of breathing fire, and revel in wreaking destruction and havoc on almost anything that moves. The latter trait is carried fully into adulthood. They regard all other Chromatic dragons as inferiors, with the amount of disdain proportional to the variety's general power level. All other chromatic dragons that red dragons encounter are either killed, driven away, or bullied into servitude depending on the red dragon's mood and personality, with the except of white dragons who are allowed to leave since red dragons do not consider them worth the effort to kill. Due to their choice of living space, they cross paths with many of the [[Metallic dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|metallic dragons]], most notably the silver dragons who are their worst enemies, and holding the greatest disdain for copper dragons whom they clash with them often. Red dragons have an eye for value, and can determine the monetary worth of any object at a glance. The gaining and keeping of treasure is the focus of a red dragon's adult life, and they tend to amass incredible hoards with amazing rapidity. At any given moment, a red dragon will be able to tell the precise monetary value of all the objects in its hoard, down to the last fraction of a coin. Red dragons prefer to make their homes inside active volcanoes. If a volcano is not available, they will reside in any mountain, provided that it has a good ledge from which the dragon can survey its territory. A red dragon's lair may have only one entrance, high above ground level. The entrance leads to a narrow tunnel, which drops off into a pit. At the bottom of the pit lies a pool of water, surrounded by several chambers. One is the dragon's sleeping quarters, another contains its hoard.Red dragons are very dangerous in combat. Proficient in magic, they are also fast in the air, but clumsy, so prefer to fight on the ground. They spend years designing battle strategies, and wait until the best moment to call upon them. Their blasts of fire end most battles before they begin. As a result, red dragons use their powerful breath weapons first, followed by physical strikes, then magical attacks. Red dragons may hoard women and children in their lairs along with their wealth. In some genres they have the 'power of persuasion' over weaker minds. They sometimes use this to persuade the chieftains of villages to sacrifice young girls to them.\n|-\n|Blue dragon\n|\n*Breath weapon: Line of lightning\n*Habitat: Sandy deserts or coastal areas\n*Diet: Meat from large animals such as camels, snakes, lizards, and also plants\n*Preferred Treasure: Sapphires\n*Alignment: [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Lawful Evil|Lawful Evil]]\n*Image: [http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG72.jpg Wizards.com image]\n*Stats: [http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/dragonTrue.htm#blueDragon OGL stats]\n|Blue dragons are the second most powerful of the classic chromatic dragons. They have single large horns protruding from their heads<ref name=\"Envoyer\" /> and large, frilled ears. The tail is thick and bumpy. The wings are more pronounced than most other species. They smell like ozone or sand. They are more likely to be mocking and manipulative than outrightly cruel or murderous to 'lesser' creatures, aided by their natural talents for hallucination. They trick desert travelers into drinking sand or going miles out of their way. Blue dragons are mostly carnivorous though they will eat plants on occasion. Camels are the preferred food. They are enemies of brass dragons. Blue dragons are unusual for chromatics in that they keep fairly well-ordered, hierarchical societies. Despite their evil nature, they are excellent parents to their young, and rarely leave their eggs unattended. Blue dragon eggs must be buried in warm sand to incubate. Blue wyrmlings are quick to taunt any other creature. They hunt small desert creatures for food. The typical blue dragon lair is dug into desert rock formations with two entrances: one at ground level, hidden by the sand, and one opening onto a high ledge on which it can perch and survey its territory. Each lair also has a cavern with a pool of water and sandy beach, which its inhabitant will use for drinking and relaxation. The blue dragon excels at aerial combat. They discharge lightning at aerial foes, or at creatures on the ground. They are powerful at spell craft and adept at burrowing in sand. They often lie in wait just below the surface of the desert for prey. When they are so burrowed, their large horns can be mistaken for pointed desert rocks.\n|-\n|Green dragon\n|\n*Breath weapon: Cloud of chlorine gas (changed to cone of acidic mist in Edition 3.5)\n*Habitat: Forests with tall trees\n*Diet: Small humanoids such as [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnomes]] are preferred, but prize elves and sprites most.

They have a large, waving crest or fin that starts at the dragon's nose and runs the length of the dragon's body. They also have long, slender forked tongues and smell like chlorine gas. They are highly adept at magic. Green dragons are reasonably good parents, with both mother and father typically staying close to their eggs while they are incubating. Females either keep their eggs in a solution of acid or bury them in leaves moistened with rainwater. The green wyrmling may be mistaken for a black, due to their nearly black scales. As the wyrmling matures, its scales lighten in color. The wyrmlings typically stay with both parents until they reach adulthood (approximately 100 years). A green dragon lair will be a complex of caves and tunnels, with its main entrance hidden behind a waterfall. The dragons prefer caves high up on a cliff. The territories of Green and Black dragons frequently overlap, but as greens are more powerful, they typically hold the upper hand. Greens may allow a Black dragon to remain in their forest, as long as the lesser dragon remains in the swamps. Green dragons revel in combat, and will often attack for no apparent reason. They are territorial, and may view any intrusion into their domain as an affront. They are cunning and duplicitous foes, and love to double-cross. A traveler who stumbles into a green dragon's territory may be able to bribe the dragon for safe passage, but the dragon may pretend to agree and then attack the unsuspecting offender once their guard is down. Though aggressive, green dragons prefer to use magic before attacking physically.\n|-\n|Black dragon\n|\n*Breath weapon: Line of acid\n* Habitat: Boggy swamps\n* Diet: Fish, mollusks, aquatic creatures, some red meat from terrestrial animals\n* Preferred Treasure: Gold coins\n* Alignment: [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|Chaotic Evil]]\n* Image: [http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG71.jpg Wizards.com image]\n|Black dragons are the most vile-tempered and cruel of all chromatic dragons, apart from their love of bargaining. Black dragons are distinguished by their horns, which protrude from the sides of their heads and wrap around, projecting forward, a longer body and thinner tail.<ref name=\"Envoyer\" /> A large frill adorns the upper part of the neck. They smell like rotting vegetation and foul water, or like the powerful acid they can breathe. Black dragons are fierce hunters that will normally attack from the water. They will often prey on fish, crabs, birds, turtles, crocodiles, lizardfolk, chuuls, hydras, and green dragons that are smaller and younger than they are. Their enemies include green dragons and swamp landwyrms. Black dragons are not noted as good parents, relying more upon disguise and hiding to protect their eggs than upon guarding them. Black dragon eggs must be submerged in strong acid while incubating. Their wyrmlings (babies) are exceptionally cruel with insatiable appetites for nearly anything organic. As a black dragon matures, its scales gradually grow lighter. The oldest black dragons appear almost purple in color; hence the name of [[Cormyr]]'s Purple Dragon knights stems from the legend of the great black dragon Thauglor, who once dominated the area encompassed by the present kingdom. A black dragon typically lairs in a large cave or underground chamber next to a swamp or murky pond. Their lairs always have two entrances: one underwater through the adjacent swamp/pond, and one above-ground, disguised amidst the undergrowth. In combat, black dragons prefer ambushes to straightforward fighting. They are vicious and ruthless adversaries, and their acidic bile can easily work its way under the heaviest armor. Their heavily wooded habitats prevent them from flying very high in combat.\n|-\n|White dragon\n|\n*Breath weapon: Cone of cold\n* Habitat: Arctic mountains\n* Diet: Anything that moves, but must be frozen first\n* Preferred Treasure: Diamonds\n* Alignment: [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|Chaotic Evil]]\n* Image: [http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG78.jpg Wizards.com image]\n* Stats: [http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/dragonTrue.htm#whiteDragon OGL stats]\n|White dragons are the weakest and the most feral of the classic chromatic dragons. Though dimmer than other dragons, they are still powerful enough to overwhelm most humans and have good long-term memories. Their heads and necks blend seamlessly into one another, and their wings are frayed along the edges. They have a flap of skin (dewlap) lined with spines under their chins. They have a high crest atop a streamlined head and a crisp, vaguely chemical odor. White dragon eggs must be buried in snow or encased in ice to incubate. The parents do not tend or protect the eggs in any way, although they lay them near their lairs. A newly hatched white wyrmling has clear scales, which become white as the dragon matures. They are expected to survive on their own after hatching, although some white dragon parents will permit their young to live in their lair until they reach adulthood. Adult white dragons have several abilities well suited to their arctic habitat. They can climb ice cliffs with ease, fly high and fast, and are exceptional swimmers. They love to swim in cold water. Much of their diet consists of aquatic creatures. White dragons are always hungry, and tend to become more savage as they mature. Knowing that they are the smallest and weakest of dragons, many whites harbor inferiority complexes. They take any opportunity to bully beings such as giants and younger dragons of other species. White dragons lair in ice caves dug into mountains. Their lairs contain many more tunnels and chambers than those of other chromatic dragons. More powerful white dragons may turn a large iceberg into a floating lair. Such lairs have an underwater entrance as well as one to the open air. White dragons are not strong combatants compared to other dragons. Their icy breath can freeze a foe solid. They avoid fights with more powerful dragons, but will take any opportunity to take their frustrations out on 'lesser' creatures. Whites also have exceptional memories, and will hunt down those who cross them, no matter how long it takes.\n|}\n\n====Other chromatic dragons====\nThis is a list of other dragons which are based on colors, but are not truly related to other chromatic dragons. In 4th edition, the gray, brown, and purple dragons were released in Draconomicon, but the grey and purple dragons were different.

They have a strong mercenary streak and often agree to serve as guardians or battle champions for anyone willing to pay suitably well.\n\nPhysically, the brass dragon is highly distinctive. From below, its outstretched wings form a triangular shape, as they are attached to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. The wings are longest at the shoulder and taper gently as they reach the tail. Their scales seem to radiate heat and light. The shape of the head is quite unusual, as it includes a large, curved plate that extends from the dragon's eyes and cheeks on either side and curves upwards into two points, much like a plowshare. They have two sharp horns on the chin, which become steadily pointier as the dragon ages. They smell like hot, oiled metal.\n\nBrass dragon eggs must be incubated in a nest of open flames. Incubation takes approximately 480 days. The eggs are typically tended by both parents so that they can talk together as they maintain their vigil. A newly hatched brass wyrmling is not remarkable in appearance; its scales are a dull brown. The scales become lighter and more brilliant as the dragon matures. Brass wyrmlings probably learn to talk more quickly than the young of any other sentient species. They talk constantly about anything and everything, and they will talk to anybody: friends, family, enemies, small creatures that cannot talk back, or even to themselves if nobody else is near. When exposed to a new language, a brass wyrmling will usually become fluent in under an hour. Though they have an extremely deadly breath weapon, they are more fragile than other dragons. As a result, they make alliances with small groups of intelligent creatures, such as tribes of nomadic Dragonborn.\n\nAs it matures, a brass dragon adds a love of fire to its love of speech. They can stare into burning flames for hours, entranced by their beauty. Older brass dragons often become discouraged with the world, believing that others are ruining it. Yet as they mature, they seem to accept the follies of the world, and may even donate some of their treasures to aid a cause they believe to be worthy. Ancient brass dragons are some of the best - and most willing - sources of advice in the entire [[Prime Material Plane]].\n\nThe brass dragon prefers to dig its lair inside a desert peak or spire. They also prefer to have their lairs face eastwards, so that the rising sun will warm the lair for the bulk of the day. A brass dragon's lair is well-constructed and quite extensive, with many twisting corridors and dead ends to confuse and discourage hostile intruders. The centerpiece of any brass dragon's lair is the Grand Conversation Hall, where it spends the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors. A typical lair will also contain an elegant foyer, a gallery for the artwork the dragon has collected, a sleeping chamber, and a storage room. All brass dragon lairs have several small entrances, known as bolt holes. These multiple entrances allow a brass dragon to easily escape an attack by a blue dragon or other predator.\n\nThe brass dragon was an example of content misrepresented by the game's detractors, by whom it was described erroneously as the worst of dragons.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zvz9BQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PAxii#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Dangerous Games: What the Moral Panic over Role-Playing Games Says about Play, Religion, and Imagined Worlds|last1=Laycock|first1=Joseph P.|date=2015|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520960565|page=xii|language=en|accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Brass Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Chaotic Good\n}}\n|-\n|Bronze dragon\n|\n*Maximum Height: 15 feet\n* Maximum Weight: 160,000 pounds\n* Maximum Wingspan: 80 feet\n* Breath weapon: repulsion gas, lightning\n* Habitat: Aquatic, Tropical Islands\n* Diet: Aquatic plants, shark meat, crustaceans, sahuagin.\n* Preferred Treasure: Ceramics, statuary and gemstones.\n|Duty-bound and honorable to a fault, bronze dragons commit themselves to order and are among the greatest and most devout champions of that ideal. As order's sworn servants, bronze dragons can seem arrogant and haughty, with an inflated sense of self, a tendency that can put them at odds with those they meet. In rare cases, this self-righteousness grows into something far more sinister, and the bronze dragon takes over what it sees as lesser races, ruling as a cruel tyrant to its subjects. Bronze dragons claim coastlines, inlets, and islands as their own, constructing lairs in coastal caves that have access to the sea. More aggressive bronze dragons purposely choose lairs near shipping lanes so they can claim tribute from merchant vessels as those craft pass by. All bronze dragons share a deep and abiding hatred for blue dragons, and they are vigilant in protecting their homes from these interlopers.\n\nPhysically, the bronze dragon is quite fierce in appearance, despite its good nature. While most of its body is a reflective copper color, the wings are often tipped with green. The eyes of a bronze dragon begin with a green iris and as they age the eye slowly becomes a solid green with no distinct iris. The dragon has three main large horns protruding from each cheek, pointing back towards the tail. It also has a couple of smaller horns. The tips of these points are black and very sharp, and are often used for grooming. The tongue is purple-gray, long and pointed, and not forked. A large frill runs down the upper part of its neck. They smell like sea-spray.\n\nBronze dragons mate for life and take their duties as parents with the utmost seriousness. They will protect their eggs and their wyrmlings at any cost. Although bronze dragons always live near water, they lay their eggs in a dry cave. Apart from a dry, relatively warm environment, bronze dragon eggs require no special conditions for incubation like those of most dragons. Upon hatching, the wyrmlings are raised, taught, and protected by their parents. A newly hatched bronze wyrmling appears yellow with a tinge of green, and the scales will gradually shift to bronze as it matures. Bronze wyrmlings hold a strong sense of responsibility from the moment it leaves the egg- one that causes it to seek out purpose as thoroughly as it hunts for sustenance.\n\nGiven its exceptional abilities as a swimmer, the entrance to a bronze dragon's lair is quite naturally underwater, and often disguised with seaweed and coral. The bulk of the lair is above water level, however, consisting of multiple tunnels and large chambers, some as much as a thousand feet above sea level. They prefer to make their lairs in an island volcano, if possible.\n\nWhile bronze dragons are often fascinated with battles, especially fighting to defeat evil, they have strong moral compunctions against killing living beings unless absolutely necessary. They will often join good-aligned armies to fight the forces of evil, either in human form or their own. In battle, their weapon of choice is to breathe repulsion gas, which is so putrid that it forces absolutely everything away. They also like to relocate a foe to a remote location where it can do no harm when possible. When forced to kill, the bronze dragon is a deadly combatant, roasting enemies with bursts of lightning or ripping them open with its clawed forelegs.\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Bronze Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Lawful Good\n}}\n|-\n|Copper dragon\n|\n*Maximum Height: 12 feet\n* Maximum Weight: 160,000 pounds\n* Maximum Wingspan: 80 feet\n* Breath weapon: Cone of Slow Gas, Line of acid\n* Habitat: Dry, rocky mountains or desert\n* Diet: Scorpions and other venomous creatures\n* Preferred Treasure: Valuables from the earth: metals, precious stones, finely crafted sculptures, well-made ceramics, ''et cetera''\n|Copper dragons are the second weakest of the metallic dragons. They are born tricksters and jokesters. They are quite devious and clever, but their intent is purely benign. They do not seek to harm 'lesser' creatures, but merely wish to impress them with superior intelligence and wit, and to fool them with clever pranks.\n\nPhysically, the copper dragon is very striking, with scales of a warm copper color tinged with blue. Like the brass dragon, the copper dragon's wings connect to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. However, its wings have a pronounced bend to them, giving them the appearance of a \"V\" from below, rather than the brass dragon's triangular appearance. Copper dragons are powerful jumpers and climbers, with massive thigh and shoulder muscles. Their two horns are broad and flat, pointing backwards towards the tail from the top of their heads. They also have a distinctive frill protruding from either jaw. When the mouth is closed, the teeth are completely hidden. They exude a stony odor.\n\nCopper dragons lay their eggs in a nest of cool sand or clay. Both parents watch over the eggs and raise the wyrmling until it reaches adulthood, whereupon the parents separate. When new hatched, the scales of a copper wyrmling are a muddy brown in color, which gradually shifts to a glowing copper as it matures. Adult copper dragons are quite social, mainly due to the desire to play tricks upon each other. A visitor to a copper dragon's lair can expect to be entertained at length, although the dragon will become angry if the visitor does not appear impressed with their tricks, riddles, and stories.\n\nA typical copper dragon's lair is a cave, whose entrance is concealed by rocks and boulders. Upon entering, visitors find themselves in a huge labyrinth of tunnels. Copper dragons compete amongst themselves to see who can design the most confusing layout. If a friendly visitor becomes hopelessly lost (which is rather common), the copper dragon will rescue them before they are actually endangered. Once through the labyrinth, visitors find themselves in a spacious foyer, beyond which is the Main Entertaining Chamber, where the dragon will spend the bulk of its time. Opening off the MEC is a much more straightforward escape tunnel, whose outside entrance is often fiendishly difficult to locate even when one knows exactly where it is. The copper dragon will know, however, and often uses its 'back door' to get into its lair instead of taking the time to navigate the maze. Obviously, it is far easier for a visitor to enter via the secret door if they can find it, but doing so is considered impolite, especially if they are a first-time visitor.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, copper dragons prefer to avoid it. Rather than fighting openly, they prefer to taunt, humiliate, and tease their opponents until they simply give up and run away. Their ability to dramatically slow opponents often gives them ample time to run away. When forced, however, a copper dragon will fight to the very end, and is an incredibly devious antagonist. Their acid breath is not to be taken lightly.\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Copper Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Chaotic Good\n}}\n|-\n|Gold dragon\n|\n*Maximum Height: 22 feet\n* Maximum Weight: 1,280,000 pounds<ref name=\"pgtd\">{{cite book|title=A Practical Guide to Dragons|last=Trumbauer|first=Lisa|date=2006-09-26|publisher=Mirrorstone|isbn=0-7869-4164-2|location=Washington|pages=80|authorlink=Lisa Trutkoff Trumbauer}}</ref>\n* Maximum Wingspan: 135 feet\n* Breath weapon: \tCone of fire, weakening gas\n* Habitat: Anywhere, although they prefer secluded lairs\n* Diet: Small gems and pearls; they do not eat any living creatures\n* Preferred Treasure: Art, especially paintings and sculptures\n|Gold dragons are based on [[Chinese dragon|creatures]] from [[Chinese mythology]].<ref name=\"DV\"/> In the game they are the most powerful of the metallic dragons (in some versions they are the strongest of all dragons), and the most dedicated to defeating evil. They spend the bulk of their lives in human form, seeking out evil and punishing wrongdoers to the best of its considerable abilities. Its typical mode of operation runs roughly along the lines of a [[sting operation]]: the dragon will listen for stories of dangerous or evil creatures or persons, then reveal its true form and mete out punishment. They prefer to turn villains over to law enforcement if available, but will ultimately take whatever actions they deem necessary in order to see justice served. They are best summarized as the paladins of the draconic world.\n\nPhysically, gold dragons are quite spectacular. Several large horns tipped with umber shoot sideways from their cheeks, and two very prominent horns point backwards along their heads. The most obvious feature is probably the tentacle whiskers that sprout from the top and bottom of the gold dragon's jaw, giving the appearance of a beard of sorts. Their wings, like those of brass and copper dragons, connect to the body all the way to the tip of the tail. From below, the overall shape resembles that of a brass dragon, but the different coloring and dramatic difference in size enables easy differentiation. When in flight, the gold dragon's wings ripple, giving the appearance of swimming rather than flying. They smell of saffron and incense.\n\nGold dragon eggs must be incubated in a nest of open flames. A newly hatched gold wyrmling appears similar to an adult, except that it lacks horns or tentacle whiskers. Both parents tend the eggs, and then take intense interest in their wyrmlings' care and education. At some point, however, the biological parents may send the wyrmling to live with foster parents; this allows the parents to undertake their own quests, as well as exposing the wyrmling to new experiences.\n\nUnlike many species of dragons, gold dragons have a very firm and hierarchical social structure, encompassing all members of the species. This structure always has one gold dragon as its leader who is given the title \"your resplendence\", who serves until he/she either dies or steps down. At that time, all gold dragons congregate and choose the next leader of their kind. Sometimes two dragons may be chosen; in such cases, the two will share the duties of leadership. The position of leader, or 'top dragon,' does not so much involve the maintenance of order - gold dragons are famous for their good behavior - so much as the dispensing of advice and wisdom to any dragons who ask for it. Gold dragons are voracious learners, and they tend to become very wise and worldly as they age. They freely share their knowledge and experience to anyone who asks, dragon or not. In fact, it is not unknown for a gold Great Wyrm to take the form of a scholarly professor in order to spread its knowledge at some human center of higher education.\n\nUnlike most other species of dragons, gold dragons devote immense time and energy to the construction of their lairs. The layout of their lairs often resemble those of elegant human mansions, albeit buried underground. Rooms are well-constructed and elegantly decorated with the many art treasures the gold dragon has collected over its lifetime. Typical rooms in a gold dragon's lair include a main hall, a banquet hall, a resting chamber, a study, a kitchen, a lobby, a storage room, and perhaps even a lavatory. Many gold dragons even have a glass-walled observatory, especially if they live underwater.\n\nGold dragons prefer to talk rather than to fight. They will never engage in combat if they believe it is unnecessary. Once they believe it ''is'' necessary, however, they are amazingly powerful opponents. Their ability to breathe fire rivals that of the eldest red dragons, and they will pour their entire being into a battle against evil. Gold dragons dislike killing, but they do not hesitate to do so if it is necessary in order to defeat an evil foe.\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Gold Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Lawful Good\n}}\n|-\n|Silver dragon\n|\n*Maximum Height: 22 feet\n* Maximum Weight: 1,280,000 pounds<ref name=\"pgtd\" />\n* Maximum Wingspan: 150 feet\n* Breath weapon: Cone of Cold, Paralyzation Gas\n* Habitat: High Mountains (the colder the better)\n* Diet: Almost anything; love tasting new things\n* Preferred Treasure: Beautifully crafted jewelry or finely woven fabrics\n|Silver dragons are the second most powerful of the metallic dragons, and are true friends to all. The silver dragon enjoys the company of humans and elves so much that it will often take the form of a human or elf and live among them for the majority of its life. Silvers, like all dragons, believe themselves the most superior creatures in the world. However, apart from the ability to fly, which they enjoy greatly, they tend to prefer the physical forms of humanoids for everyday life.\n\nAt first glance, the silver dragon appears very similar to the White dragon. The wings are more curved than a White's though, and the silver has two talons on its wings rather than the single talon of most dragons. The silver dragon also has a beautiful frill that begins at the top of its head and flows all the way down its neck and body to the tip of the tail. The frill is silver towards the body, fading to a purple hue at the edge. They have two long, smooth silver horns with black tips, pointing up and back from the head. They also have a pronounced sharp frill under the chin, which has the rough appearance of a goatee. They smell like rain.\n\nSilver dragons lay their eggs in a bed of snow. A new hatched silver wyrmling has scales of a bluish gray, which change to silver over time. Silver wyrmlings are intelligent, kind, extremely curious, and adorable.\n\nUnlike the gold or bronze dragon, the silver dragon does not usually go out of its way to bring justice to the world. Instead, it waits for others to ask for help. Silver dragons will attempt to right an injustice if they see one, but they have no inclination to intentionally seek evil out and destroy it. They are more interested in protecting the humans or elves they have come to care for than in looking for evil. Like most metallic dragons, silvers do not enjoy combat, and are averse to killing. If forced to fight, however, they are as deadly as any other dragon.\n\nA silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until the individual scales are scarcely visible. The pupils of the oldest silver dragons resemble orbs of molten mercury.\n\nThey are very intelligent, more so than most humans, extremely powerful, breathtakingly beautiful, and have lifespans which can extend to 4,200 years (as stated in ''draconomicon, the book of dragons'').\n\nThe silver dragon is regal and statuesque. An unusual trait they offer is the love of human dining, and will use the ability of alternate form to take part in large feasts.\n\nSilver dragons employ a [[Breath Weapon|breath weapon]] of extreme cold similar to that of white dragons. They also have a second breath weapon, a cone of paralyzing gas.\n\nSilver dragons are extremely rare and elusive, preferring to take the guise of kind and [[elderly]] humanoids or very attractive and young humanoids. They very much like to associate with [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]] and [[Human (Dungeons & Dragons)|humans]], not necessarily because they prefer their company over other races, but because they try to learn from the shorter-lived humans.\n\nSilver dragons' favored enemy are red dragons because these chromatic dragons are almost always evil and have a talent for destruction. Additionally, silvers and Reds favor the same sort of mountainous terrain for lairs, which leads to territorial disputes on top of having attitudes and philosophies at odds with the others'.\n\nDragons may live for millennia, while humans only live a few decades. This vast difference in time leads to inherent psychological differences concerning time. Dragons tend to think things through for years at a time, using their razor-sharp intellects to hone a plan to perfection, solve near-impossible puzzles, or engage in other intellectual pursuits. Silver dragons, however, note that humans are able to accomplish much in their short life spans because of their drive for success. When a silver dragon can combine its own long-term perspective with the ambition and drive of humans, the benefit is undeniable.\n\nMost silvers group together in \"clans,\" a loose organization of dragons who choose to live together as a family. Clans take communal responsibility for protecting and raising their wyrmlings. A senior member of the clan may act as a leader, but no true leader actually exists. Silver dragons do not feel the need for a strict social structure, since they are most content to live as honestly as possible. However, many silver dragons leave their clans for long periods of time to live among nondragons. They tend to live for many years with the same group of humans or elves, having grown attached to them. As members of the family die, the silver dragon, grieved by the loss, often chooses to stay with the family, remaining a true and loyal friend and champion through many generations. If the dragon feels comfortable enough around these nondragons, it might even decide to reveal its true self.\n\nA silver dragon's lair is typically found within an icy mountain, with the main entrance only accessible by air. The lair itself is similar to the gold dragon's in its sophistication and design, although the silver dragon's lair tends to be far less intricate. A typical lair will contain a main entertaining area, a storage room, a vault, a sleeping chamber, study, library, shrine, and two clinic rooms where the dragon can offer help and protection to those who need it. The lair will also have a concealed back entrance for use in emergencies.\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Silver Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Lawful Good\n}}\n|}\n\n====Rare types====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Description\n|-\n|Adamantine dragon\n|[[Adamant]]ine dragons are tacticians that supplement their melee abilities with blasts of thunderous power. They can be found anywhere, but prefer to lair in huge caverns.\n\nRegarding tactics, an adamantine dragon favors frontal assaults against a single target that it can take down quickly. When working with a group of allies, an adamantine dragon doesn't hesitate to bear the brunt of enemies' attacks. When fighting alone, an adamantine dragon attempts to isolate weaker foes first and finish them off quickly.\n|-\n|Cobalt dragon\n|Midnight blue dragons that could fire a breath weapon of pulsing, barely perceptible energy. These dragons, like the chromium dragons, were foul of temper but subservient to iron dragons and their lord.\n|-\n|Mercury dragon\n|Mercury dragons are fast, relatively small (by dragon standards) creatures with long tails. They are very whimsical and make and change decisions quite often. At birth, its scales are dull silver. As the dragon ages they become brighter, and at adulthood they take on a mirror finish.\nMercury dragons have one breath weapon, a line of superheated yellow light. Upon adulthood, however, they have a secondary attack of reflecting light at their opponent, changing it into a brilliant burst of dazzling brightness.\nIn combat, they are unpredictable except that they will never attack good-aligned creatures unless provoked. They always use spells in combat, finding new and creative ways to use them.\n|-\n|Mithral dragon\n|Mithral dragons are among the rarest and most potent of the dragons. They claim themselves as the pursuers of Io's final vision. Choosing to live in the Astral Sea amongst the gods and angels, these dragons nevertheless pursue agendas and plots that put them into contact with creatures of the mortal world. Mithrals seek to further their own plans at any cost, and woe to the lesser creature that tries to thwart them. These dragons have visions of other times and spaces. Being native to the Astral Sea, mithral dragons are immortal and will not die unless slain in battle.\n|-\n|Orium dragon\n|Orium dragons live in jungles and rainforests in the ruins of past civilizations. They command lesser beings to rebuild the glories of the past and obtain the long-forgotten magic of fallen empires. To those under its protection, the orium dragon treat them as a monarch, wise but harsh. Those who threaten the dragon and his dreams of rebuilding his empire find themselves choking on its corrosive breath. This same breath coalesces into a smoky serpent that attacks at the dragon's command.\n|-\n|Steel dragon\n|The steel dragon's body seems somewhat feline, but its face has a humanlike quality. Spines that vaguely resemble hair and a beard ring its head and its scales shine like burnished steel.\nSteel dragons prefer human form to their own, so they're rarely seen in their natural forms. They routinely use their special abilities to infiltrate human society, typically masquerading as sages, scholars, wizards, and other intellectuals. Endlessly curious about the art, culture, history, and politics of civilized races, steel dragons live among humans and similar beings. Though they keep their true nature secret from the people with whom they mingle, they can always recognize each other.\n\nWhen a steel dragon hatches, its scales are a deep blue-gray color with steely highlights. As it grows to adulthood, its color lightens to a lustrous burnished steel, and its shine increases as it continues to age. In human form, a steel dragon always has one steel-gray feature, such as hair, eyes, or nails. In rare cases, this feature may be a ring, tattoo, or other ornamentation. In its natural form, a steel dragon smells of wet steel.\n\nSince they prefer human form, steel dragons rarely live in caves. Instead, they choose human dwellings such as mansions or castles. Such a home need not be opulent, but it must be large enough to accommodate a strongroom that will hold all the dragon's treasure. Steel dragons also prefer to dine in human form, but since they need to eat much more than humans do to maintain their true body mass, they make monthly trips to hunt in dragon form. These absences are always explained away in terms consistent with the roles they take in human society. For example, a steel dragon in the guise of a historian might claim to be exploring records in another city's library.\n\nSteel dragons prefer treasure that they can carry in their human forms, such as jewelry, valuable coins, and magic items usable by medium-sized creatures. They hate creatures that disrupt normal life in cities or despoil natural hunting grounds. Within a city, they usually rely on local authorities to deal with troublemakers, though they are quite capable of dealing out their own justice when such authorities cannot be relied upon to do so. Steel dragons tend to prefer swifter forms of justice in the wilderness.\n|}\n\n=== Gem dragons ===\nGem dragons are typically of neutral alignment with respect to good and evil, but some kinds are quite egoistic and awful company nevertheless. The Gem dragon family comprise Amethyst Dragons, Crystal Dragons, Emerald Dragons, Sapphire Dragons, and Topaz Dragons.  [[Sardior]] is the deity of gem dragons. Although Obsidian Dragons are also technically gem dragons, they are opposed to Sardior and most other gem dragons.\n\nThe following is a list of the '''gem dragons''', a classification of [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragon]] found in the [[role playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. In this setting, gem dragons are typically of neutral alignment. [[Sardior]] is the deity of gem dragons.\n\n====Publication history====\nThe gem dragons (the amethyst dragon, the crystal dragon, the emerald dragon, the sapphire dragon and the topaz dragon) and [[Sardior]] the Ruby Dragon first appeared in the first edition in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #37 (May 1980).<ref>Arthur W. Collins, \"That's Not In the Monster Manual!\" ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #37 ([[TSR, Inc|TSR]], 1980)</ref>\n\nThe gem dragons appeared in the second edition in the ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix]]'' (1992),<ref>[[Skip Williams]] et al., ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix]]'' (TSR, 1992)</ref> and the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993).<ref>Doug Stewart, ed.

''[[Council of Wyrms]]'' (TSR, 1994)</ref> and the ''Campaign Option: Council of Wyrms'' book (1999).<ref>[[Bill Slavicsek|Slavicsek, Bill]]. ''Campaign Option: Council of Wyrms Setting'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 1999)</ref>\n\nThe gem dragons appeared in the third edition in ''[[Monster Manual II]]'' (2002).<ref>Ed Bonny, [[Jeff Grubb]], Rich Redman, [[Skip Williams]] and [[Steve Winter]], ''[[Monster Manual II]]''  (Wizards of the Coast, 2002)</ref>\n\n====Types====\n;Amethyst dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Line of force (prior to edition 3.5 an explosive lozenge)\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, underground\n* '''Alignment:''' Always neutral\n\nThe most powerful of the neutral gem dragons, amethyst dragons are honorable, regal creatures. They inhabit the mountains of the northern islands, living on the shores of isolated lakes and pools. At birth, these dragons have lavender skin with fine, translucent-purple scales. These scales darken as the creature grows older, eventually reaching a sparkling lavender color.\nThese creatures approach life with a detached air, ignoring the conflicts of good and evil, law and chaos. At best, they see these conflicts as petty squabbles over inconsequential points of view, and not worthy of their time or consideration. These majestic dragons consider themselves to be the leaders of the gem dragons, and most of the lesser gem dragons acquiesce to this leadership \u2013 in everyday life and in the Council Aerie.\n\nWhile amethyst dragons consider their silver and copper cousins to be foolish and have an active dislike of red and white dragons, they do not consider any life form to be their inherent enemies. They prefer to reason out a settlement through discussion and negotiation rather than through combat, but they can and will fight if they must. Being honourable and noble, these dragons never hide or attempt to ambush foes. To them, even retreating is a dishonourable action, but they will flee if faced with certain death.\nAmethyst dragons eat large quantities of fish and gems. They keep vassals to attend to their needs, though they do not place as many restrictions or requirements on them as other dragon lords do. Most keep at least one hidden, underwater cave for seclusion and secrecy.\nAmethyst dragons approach mating in a very logical manner, seeking the optimum partner to produce the best offspring. Love and pleasure rarely, if ever, enter the equation.\n\n;Crystal dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Line of blinding light\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, temperate and cold mountains\n* '''Alignment:''' Always chaotic neutral\n\nThe friendly crystal dragons of Io's Blood's northern isles spend much time trying to learn about world around them. They value friendship over all else and the treasures tend to be sentimental rather than valuable, they welcome visitors who come to them with good intentions.\n\nHatchlings have glossy white scales that become more and more translucent with age. By the time they reach adulthood, these scales become luminescent in moonlight. In the full light of the day they glow with a dazzling, almost unbearable brilliance.\n\nFun-loving and mischievous, crystal dragons tend to be irresponsible rulers. For the daily running of their domains, these dragons rely on their vassals to keep things going. They establish domains in the cold, open northern reaches, building castles out of snow and ice. They leave these castles open to the sky, for they love to watch the stars on clear, cold nights. The white dragon clans consider crystal dragons to be nothing more than prey, so the two types are almost always in conflict. The crystal dragons also have little love for the tribes of giants that live beyond the Ice Sea and often come south to enslave the small, relatively weak gem dragons.\n\nLike other benevolent dragons, the crystal dragons prefer to talk rather than fight. Even without special abilities, they can be charming and engaging to an extreme. Gems and metal ores are their foods of choice.\nThey mate with willing partners whenever they want, as desire and need move them. It has also been known for crystal dragons to adopt white dragon hatchlings.\n\n;Emerald dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Powerful burst of wind.\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, underground (prefers inactive or extinct volcanoes)\n* '''Alignment:''' Always lawful neutral\n\nEmerald dragons live among the tropical islands in the Io's Blood chain's southern waters. They are a curious species, taken to keeping track of history, lore and customs. They tend to be very reclusive, suspicious that others covet their treasure hoards and territory.\n\nHatchlings have translucent green scales, which harden and take on many shades of green as they age. These scales are scintillating in the light, giving an emerald dragon's hide the appearance of being in constant motion.\n\nA desire for privacy runs through the emerald clans, going so far as to determine where the dragon lords and their spawn establish lairs. In the southern islands, emerald dragons built their domains around the inactive volcano range that stretches across the tropical isles. Only their most trusted vassals are permitted to serve them within the main lairs. The others tend to duties throughout the rest of the domain.\n\nThe primary lairs consist of traps and alarms designed to warn the dragon of visitor and other threats. Emerald dragons prefer to quietly observe intruders and rarely emerge from hiding. If parlay is called for, they send their kindred or chief vassals to handle such duties while they watch, hidden, from cover. When forced into combat, emerald dragons prefer to attack by ambush, using stealth and surprise attacks to quickly disable their enemies. If the threat prove to be too great to handle, an emerald dragon will not hesitate to retreat. However, it will plan revenge, and its patience can last for centuries if need be.\n\nEmerald dragons have no compunctions about what they eat. They prefer lizards and giants, but they will eat anything in a pinch. Of all the other type of dragonkind, emerald dragons get along best with the sapphire dragons, often controlling parallel domains (emerald dragons taking the surface, sapphire dragon the subterranean areas below). They fear the red dragon clans because of their well-known greed, and they are usually in open conflict with the fire giants from beyond the Burning Sea. Emeralds like the security and protection offered by a trusted partner and will take a single mate for a long time.\n\n;Sapphire dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Cone of panicking sound\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, underground\n* '''Alignment:''' Always lawful neutral\n\nThe sapphire dragons of the Io's Blood Isles control subterranean domains beneath two of the larger southern islands. While most of the territory above their realms belongs to the emerald dragons, they keep a small portion of the surface area as their own as well as the extensive caverns beneath the tropical jungles.\n\nFrom birth, sapphire dragons are beautiful, with scale ranging from light to dark blue in color, which sparkle in the light. Because of their coloration, they are sometimes mistaken for blue dragons.\n\nOf all dragonkind, perhaps the sapphire dragon clans are the most militaristic. They fervently protect their territory from outsiders, going so far as to distrust anyone who even gets close to their borders. They work to keep their vassals in peak fighting condition, maintaining some of the best-trained armies in the isles. As most of the territory that interests the sapphire clans is below the ground, they rarely come into conflict with other dragon clans unless they attempt to take caverns currently in use. Only the black dragons compete with them for the tropical underground, and even they are wary of going into direct conflict with the armies of the sapphire clans.\n\nMost of the demihuman vassals serving the sapphire dragons are either dwarves or gnomes, as these races have no problems living and working beneath the ground. Also, elves are too much like drow, whom these dragons consider to be one of their natural enemies. Dwarven vassals are treated little better than slaves, as the two species were once at war, and they are almost never granted the kindred bond. This honour is usually reserved for gnome only.\n\nGiant spiders make up most of a sapphire dragon's diet, and great hunts are conducted in the tunnels to find these delicacies. When a dragon lord feeling particularly lazy, it will send its dwarven vassals into the tunnels in search of the spiders. Of course, they must capture the spiders alive.\n\nWhile militaristic and warlike, the sapphire dragons are not quick to attack. They prefer to observe intruders (all visitors are intruders) so that they can plan how to deal with them. If drow or dwarves from another clan approach, they are immediately attacked. Others can often at least make some gesture of friendship or parlay before being told to leave. If a sapphire dragon or its treasure is ever threatened, it attacks immediately with its breath weapon, spells, and physical attacks. It uses psionics and special abilities to escape if faced with a more powerful foe. Sapphire dragons take a single mate for long periods of time, however sapphires seek to possess a mate to enhance their prestige and status more than other reasons\n\n;Topaz dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Cone of dehydration\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, any aquatic\n* '''Alignment:''' Always chaotic neutral\n\nTopaz dragons inhabit the coastal regions of the temperate islands, building lairs below the waterline, though constructing them so they remain dry. Clannish and self-seeking, these gem dragons usually want little to do with the other inhabitants of the isles. They keep vassals to fill their domain and make them appear as prosperous as their neighbors, and they participate in the Council activities on occasion, but for the most part these dragons neither seek company nor welcome it.\n\nOut of the egg, a topaz dragon is a dull yellow-orange in color. With the age, its scales harden and become translucent and faceted. When it reaches adulthood, a topaz dragon sparkles in the light of the sun.\n\nWhile topaz dragons enjoy the feel of sea wind and spray on their faceted-scale hides, they do not particularly like the water. They swim to hunt, attack, or reach their lairs, but not for enjoyment. They do love to eat fish and other sea creatures, especially the tasty giant squids that live in the Coral Sea.\n\nWhile not malicious, topaz dragons are not the best of company or particularly pleasant to deal with. Besides caring little for social graces, they display erratic behavior that is unsettling and very confusing. They dislike visitors, but tend to avoid combat if they can help it. If combat is unavoidable, they use tricks and promises to distract their foes before striking with teeth and claws (which they enjoy using).\n\nUnless it specifically interests or affect them, topaz dragons tend to be indifferent to the causes and concerns that occupy the rest of dragonkind. They dislike bronze dragons and usually oppose the interests of those clans.\n\nIt takes time for a topaz dragon to accept another dragon's friendship, but once it does it remains a friend for life. Once another dragon gets past its outer defenses and gruff exterior, it finds a loyal companion and ready protector in the topaz dragon.\n\n====Other gem dragons====\n;Obsidian dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Cone of fire\n* '''Terrain:''' Warm mountains and underground, demiplanes\n* '''Alignment:''' Always neutral\n\nObsidian dragons, while the most intelligent of the gem dragons, are also the most vicious. They are extremely haughty, anger easily, and like to toy with prey before finishing it off.\n\nAn obsidian dragon has smooth black skin with razor edges where joints come together. When first hatched, their scales are gray, rough to touch, and well defined. As they get older, the scales darken, become smoother, and begin to blend together.\n\nMost obsidian dragons prefer to make their lairs around volcanoes or in one of the mountains of coal found on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Most great wyrms, though, make use of the genesis power to create their own demiplane.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Scott Brocius|author2=Mark Jindra|title=Obsidian Dragon|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psb/20030124b|website=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213210236/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2Fpsb%2F20030124b|archivedate=February 13, 2014|access-date=December 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Catastrophic dragons ===\nCatastrophic dragons are typically of neutral alignment. They are Avalanche Dragon, the Blizzard Dragon, the Earthquake dragon, the Tornado Dragon, the Typhoon Dragon, Volcanic Dragon, and the Wildfire Dragon.  Catastrophic dragons pay their homage to the Primordials as opposed to any other dragon deity.  After the defeat of Io, there was a group of dragons that defected to the side of Primordials. The Primordials transformed these dragons into beings imbued with the elemental chaos.  Metallic and Chromatic Dragons view Catastrophic dragons as aberrations.<ref name=\"Monster Manual 3\">{{cite book |last1=Mearls |first1=Mike |authorlink1=Mike Mearls |last2=Bilsland |first2=Greg |last3=Schwalb |first3=Robert J. |authorlink3=Robert J.

They are the Iron Dragon, the Nickel Dragon, the Tungsten Dragon, the Cobalt Dragon, and the Chromium Dragon. They originated in Dragon Magazine. All Ferrous dragons can sense ordinary metals and the lawful ferrous dragons have a strict hierarchy, with the higher dragons dictating the laws to the lower ones. The hierarchy, from highest to lowest, is iron, chromium, cobalt, tungsten, and nickel. Gruaghlothor is the supreme ruler of the ferrous dragons.\n\n====Chromium Dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Line of solid ice (cold damage) and cone of freezing crystals (Dexterity damage)\n* '''Terrain:''' Subterranean or mountainous arctic climes\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Evil\n* '''Appears in:''' ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] #356''\nShining, dull silver dragons that did not seem to match up in description to silver, steel, or mithril dragons were mentioned.

This form of dragon has metallic scales that are a dull green with grey.\n\n=== Planar dragons ===\n{{See also|Fiendish dragon}}\nPlanar dragons inhabit the [[Outer Plane|outer planes]].\n\n====Shadow dragon====\n\n{{Main|Shadow dragon}}\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Energy-draining shadows\n* '''Terrain:''' Underground, Shadow Material Plane\n* '''Alignment:''' Always Chaotic evil\n* '''Appears in:''' ''AD&D 1st Edition'' ''[[Monster Manual II]]'' (1983) and reprinted on several other occasions, including: ''AD&D'' 2nd Edition adventure ''[[Night Below]]''; computer game ''[[Baldur's Gate II]]''. A shadow dragon called Shimmergloom is the ruler of a clan of Duergar in the second book of the Icewind Dale Trilogy, ''Streams of Silver''; Erevis Cale and his companions encounter a shadow dragon named Furlinastis on several occasions in the Twilight war trilogy. Also appeared in the ''D&D'' 5th Edition ''[[Monster Manual]]''.\n\n====Adamantite dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' White-hot fire, Hold monster gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Twin Paradises of [[Bytopia]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Good\n* '''Notes:''' Oversized natural weapons, Can destroy Adamantium fortresses. Also, they look like they are made of jet-black metal.\n\nAdamantite dragons are perhaps the mightiest of dragonkind. They are the epitome of good, sacrificing whatever is necessary for the common good of intelligent creatures everywhere. These other-planar creatures are strange among dragonkind, since they are born with their shining coats of adamantite fully developed (explaining their very high armor class even when hatchlings). This mighty coat is a shining silver color that reflects light in brilliant, scintillating beams and rainbows-refreshing to those who can bask in its goodness, painful to those who hide in the shadows of evil.\n\nAdamantite dragons speak their own tongue and the language of all good dragons. By their juvenile years (age category 4), they will speak common. By the time they are adults (age, category 6), they are 50% likely to speak any language of dragonkind.\n\n'''Combat:''' Due to the adamantite dragons strong taste for physical battle, they may use the extra attack forms of dragons (wing buffet, foot stomp, etc.) one age category earlier than other dragons.\n\nBreath weapon/special abilities: An adamantite dragon has two breath weapons, one of which can only be used at certain times. The common form of breath weapon is a cone of flame 110' long, 10'wide at the dragon's mouth, and 45'wide at the end- This is a magical flame and will ignite even nonflammable materials.\n\nThe adamantite dragon's second breath weapon projects an area of time stop. It has the same dimensions as the cone of flame. Anyone caught in the area must save vs., spells or be affected as if by a time stop spell cast at 20th level of magic use - This breath weapon may only be used on the dragon's home plane (Twin Paradises), when the dragons are defending the plane, and even then only one time per day.\n\nAdamantite dragons may use the following spell-like abilities: \n* polymorph self, 3 times per day, permanent, may revert to dragon form without restriction \n* magic missile, (adults and older), five missiles per round \n* blink, (mature adults and older)\n\nDue to their extra-planar nature, all adamantite dragons are immune to non-magical weapons.\n\n'''Habitat/Society:''' The adamantite dragons are the self-appointed guardians of the Twin Paradises. These great creatures are extremely powerful and will come to the aid of any intelligent creature. They are unconcerned with law or chaos, but only the protection of sentient lifeforms.\n\nEcology: Adamantite dragons have little place in the ecosystem of the Twin Paradises, They can, however, be avaricious hunters with huge appetites. Adamantite dragons have no moral objection to hunting unintelligent life forms.\n\n====Arboreal dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Razor-sharp thorns\n* '''Terrain:''' Olympian Glades of [[Arborea (Dungeons & Dragons)|Arborea]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Good\n\n====Astral dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Dismissal effect, scouring dust\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Astral Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|Astral Plane]]\n* '''Alignment:''' True Neutral\n\n====Axial dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Force\n* '''Terrain:''' Clockwork Nirvana of [[Mechanus]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Neutral\n* '''Notes:''' Immune to a vast number of things, including acid, fire, cold, poison, and nonlethal damage.\n\n====Battle dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Sonic energy, Fear gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Heroic Domains of [[Ysgard]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Good\n\n====Beast dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Lightning\n* '''Terrain:''' Wilderness of the [[Beastlands]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Good or Neutral Good\n\n====Chaos dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Random elemental blast (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sound, etc.), Confusion gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Ever-Changing Chaos of [[Limbo (Dungeons & Dragons)|Limbo]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Any Chaotic\n\n====Chole dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Poisonous insanity vapors\n* '''Terrain:''' Infinite Layers of the [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|Abyss]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Evil\n\n====Concordant dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Antithetical energy\n* '''Terrain:''' Concordant Domain of the [[Outlands (Dungeons & Dragons)|Outlands]]\n* '''Alignment:''' True Neutral\n\n====Ectoplasmic dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Whitefire, sticky ectoplasm.\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Astral Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|Astral Plane]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Neutral\n\n====Elysian dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Sonic energy, inebriation gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Blessed Fields of [[Elysium (Dungeons & Dragons)|Elysium]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Good\n\n====Ethereal dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Force\n* '''Terrain:''' Ethereal Plane\n* '''Alignment:''' True Neutral\n\n====Gloom dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Apathy gas\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Gray Waste|Gray Waste of Hades]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Evil\n\n====Howling dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Howling sound, Maddening wails\n* '''Terrain:''' Windswept Depths of [[Pandemonium (Dungeons & Dragons)|Pandemonium]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Evil or Chaotic Neutral\n\n====Kodragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Shrinking, reverse shrinking\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Astral Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|Astral Plane]]\n\n====Oceanus dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Lightning, Tranquility gas\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Outer planes#Standard D&D cosmology|Upper Planes]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Good\n\n====Pyroclastic dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' cone of superheated ash accompanied by waves of crushing sonic force, Disintegrating line\n* '''Terrain:''' Bleak Eternity of [[Gehenna (Dungeons & Dragons)|Gehenna]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Evil or Neutral Evil\n\n====Radiant dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Force, Light\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Mount Celestia|Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Good\n\n====Rust dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Acid, rusting liquid\n* '''Terrain:''' Infernal Battlefield of [[Acheron (Dungeons & Dragons)|Acheron]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Neutral or Lawful Evil\n\n====Styx dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Acid, stupefying gas\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Outer planes#Standard D&D cosmology|Lower Planes]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Evil\n\n====Tarterian dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Line of disruptive force, cone of will-sapping gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Tarterian Depths of [[Carceri (Dungeons & Dragons)|Carceri]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Evil or Chaotic Evil\n* '''Current Source:''' (3.5) Draconomicon 189\n\n====Hellfire Wyrm====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Cone of Infernal Flame\n* '''Terrain:''' The Nine Hells of [[Baator]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Always Lawful Evil\n* '''Current Source:''' (3.5) Monster Manual II 125\n\n=== Faer\u00fbnian dragons ===\n\n====Brown dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Sludge\n* '''Terrain:''' Bogs\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral\n* '''Appears in:''' ''Monsters of Faer\u00fbn''\n\n====Deep dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Flesh-corrosive gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Underground - Underdark\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic evil\n* '''Appears in:''' ''Monsters of Faer\u00fbn'' and reprinted in ''[[Fantastic Locations: Fane of the Drow|Fane of the Drow]]'' as well as the ''Legacy of the Drow'' series.

''Draconomicon'' (Wizards of the Coast, 2003).</ref> For example, a commonly presented species of dragon is the red dragon, which is named for its red scales, and known for its evil and greedy nature, as well as its ability to [[fire breathing|breathe fire]].<ref>Monster Manual</ref> In the game, dragons are usually adversaries of [[player character]]s, and less commonly, allies or helpers. Even though dragons are iconic for the ''D&D'' game, they are rarely encountered as part of official scenarios due to dragons typically being too powerful for low-level players. An exception to this is the [[Dragonlance]] game world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Classification ==\nIn the ''D&D'' universe, there are many different species of dragons. However, despite their variety, a number of traits are common to nearly all types of dragons. All species appear to be generally [[reptile|reptilian]] or serpentine in their natural form. Except for the youngest dragons, they tend to be quite large\u2014usually at least as big as a horse, and often much larger. Most species depicted have wings and are able to fly, and nearly all are [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]]. Almost all species of dragon are highly intelligent (at least as intelligent as a human being) and are able to speak. Essentially all species of dragon are said to be magical in nature, and in most species this nature is expressed as an affinity for some type of elemental power; some dragon species are naturally able to cast magical spells, as well. Most dragons have the ability to breathe or expel one or more types of energy associated with their elemental affinity, as well as bearing some resistance to damage or injury from any other sources of such energy. Dragons are egg-layers, and most have sharp teeth, horns, and claws. A ''D&D'' dragon is protected by its scaly hide, the color of which is determined by the dragon's species, and which also offers a visual clue to the specific elemental nature of each species of dragon. Each species of dragon has a particular temperament associated with it, as well as a deeply rooted moral outlook derived from that temperament; these factors underlie the personality and behavior of each individual dragon. Typically, dragons do not vary widely in appearance or personality within a species, although exceptions are possible, especially in certain ''D&D'' settings, such as Eberron. \n\nBecause ''D&D'' dragons are essentially monstrous creatures designed to antagonize player characters, the majority of dragons in ''D&D'' are [[alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|evil]] by default. This was particularly the case in the original Dungeon and Dragons releases (such as the [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|''Dungeons & Dragons'' \"white box\" set]] (1974) and [[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]) where only the gold dragon was lawful good while all other colors were chaotic evil (red, green, black) or neutral evil (blue, white).<ref>[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], and [[Dave Arneson]]. ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (3-Volume Set) (TSR, 1974)</ref> \n\nSome dragons (particularly metallic dragons) have two different kinds of breath, usually a lethal one (fire, ice, acid, electricity, etc.) and another that is typically non-lethal (paralysis, repulsion, confusion, etc.).\n\nIn the [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition|second edition of ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'']] (''AD&D''), dragons were completely reworked from their first edition counterparts, and were much more powerful. For example, they had magic resistance, could no longer be subdued, and had physical attack forms besides just claws and bites.<ref name=\"D&Dfaq\">{{cite web| url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp| title = ''Dungeons & Dragons'' FAQ| accessdate = 2008-10-03| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081002132129/http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp| archivedate = 2008-10-02| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n''AD&D'' 2nd edition and [[Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition|''D&D'' 3rd edition]] divided true dragons further into three main categories: ''chromatic dragons'', such as green and black dragons, which are evil-[[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|aligned]]; ''metallic dragons'', such as gold and [[Metallic dragon#Silver dragon|silver]] dragons, which are good; and neutral-aligned ''gem dragons'', rare creatures that possess [[Psionics (role-playing games)|psionic]] abilities. In addition, there were other sub-species of true dragons that did not fit into the three main categories. For example, mercury and steel dragons would seem to be metallic dragons, but in the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' world they are considered to be outside of the main family of metallic dragons because of various biological differences (though the book ''Dragons of Faer\u00fbn'' did list them as metallic dragons). The \"lung dragons\" or spirit-dragons of ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' are also true dragons.\n\nThe third edition of ''D&D'' classifies dragon as a type of creature, simply defined as \"a reptilelike creature, usually winged, with magical or unusual abilities\".<ref>Andy Collins, Skip Williams, and James Wyatt. ''Monster Manual'' (Wizards of the Coast, 2000).</ref>  The dragon type is broken down into several classifications. True dragons are dragons which increase in power by age categories (wyrmling to great wyrm). Lesser dragons do not improve in age categories and may lack all of the abilities of true dragons. Examples of lesser dragons include [[Dragon turtle (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragon turtles]] and [[Wyvern (Dungeons & Dragons)|wyverns]]. Other creatures with the dragon type include drakes, felldrakes, elemental drakes, landwyrms, [[Lindworm|linnorms]] and wurms.  (An unrelated creature called a dragonne is named for its coincidental resemblance to a brass dragon.)\n\nHowever, with [[Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition|''D&D'' 4th edition]], the classifications were changed: chromatic dragons became not strictly evil, and metallic dragons became not necessarily good. Also, there are several new categories (although the gem dragons have not yet returned): \"planar dragons\" which are defined as dragons that were warped by living on a plane of existence other than the Material Plane, \"catastrophe dragons\", which take on the aspects of natural disasters which are chaotic evil and cause chaos for its own sake, and \"scourge dragons\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4ex/20081020b |title=Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Official Home Page - Article (Excerpts: Origins) |publisher=Wizards.com |date=2012-06-08 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref> Chromatic dragons are presented in the ''Monster Manual'' and ''Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons''. Metallic dragons are presented in the ''Monster Manual 2'' and ''Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons''. Catastrophe dragons are presented in ''Monster Manual 3''. Planar dragons have been presented in both ''Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons'' and ''Draconomicon: Metallic Dragons''.\n\nDetailed information about ''D&D'' dragonkind in second, third, or fourth editions may be found in their respective editions of the ''[[Draconomicon]]'', a ''D&D'' supplement book designed especially for draconic information. No such book was published for the first edition, although the Basic game had a ''[[Bestiary of Dragons and Giants]]'' ([[Adventure (D&D)#Module Codes|coded]] AC10).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/miscpages/ac.html|title=Accessory Modules|website=Acaeum.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nFive evil-aligned dragons (white dragon, black dragon, green dragon, blue dragon, and red dragon), and the lawful-good aligned golden dragon (in ascending order of magic power and capabilites) first appeared in the original [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|''Dungeons & Dragons'' \"white box\" set]] (1974).<ref>[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], and [[Dave Arneson]]. ''Dungeons & Dragons'' (3-Volume Set) (TSR, 1974)</ref> The [[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk Campaign supplement]] (1975) added the copper dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, and silver dragon, along with the Platinum Dragon ([[Bahamut (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bahamut]]) and the Chromatic Dragon ([[Tiamat (Dungeons & Dragons)|Tiamat]]).\n\nThe white dragon, black dragon, red dragon and brass dragon reappeared in the original ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'' (1977). The six dragons from the 1974 boxed set appeared in the ''Dungeons & Dragons Basic Rulebook'' (1981), and again in the 1983 version of the ''Basic Set'' (1983). These six appeared along with the gemstone dragons (crystal dragon, onyx dragon, jade dragon, sapphire dragon, ruby dragon and amber dragon), and the dragon rulers (Pearl (the Moon Dragon), Ruler of all Chaotic Dragons; Diamond (the Star Dragon), Ruler of all Lawful Dragons; Opal (the Sun Dragon), Ruler of all Neutral Dragons; and the Great One, Ruler of All Dragonkind) in the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]'' (1991).\n\nThe five chaotic-aligned dragon types from the 1974 boxed set, as well as the gold dragon and the four new dragon types from the ''Greyhawk'' supplement (the copper dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, and silver dragon) appeared in first edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' in the original ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (1977), along with Bahamut and Tiamat. The former five dragon types were given as evil-aligned, while the latter five dragon types were given as good-aligned. The ten dragon types were given pseudoscientific names as follows: black (''draco causticus sputem''), blue (''draco electricus''), brass (''draco impudentus gallus''), bronze (''draco gerus bronzo''), copper (''draco comes stabuli''), gold (''draco orientalus sino dux''), green (''draco chlorinous nauseous respiratorus''), red (''draco conflagratia horriblus''), silver (''draco nobilis argentum''), and white (''draco rigidus frigidus'').<ref>[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (TSR, 1977)</ref> The Oriental dragons appeared in the original ''[[Fiend Folio]]'' (1981), including the li lung (earth dragon), the lung wang (sea dragon), the pan lung (coiled dragon), the shen lung (spirit dragon), the t'ien lung (celestial dragon), and the yu lung (carp dragon).  The cloud dragon, the faerie dragon, the mist dragon, and the shadow dragon appeared in the original ''Monster Manual II'' (1983).\n\nThe black dragon, blue dragon, brass dragon, bronze dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, green dragon, red dragon, silver dragon, and white dragon appeared in second edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' in the ''Monstrous Compendium Volume One'' (1989).<ref>[[David \"Zeb\" Cook|Cook, David]], et al.

The radiant dragon appeared in the ''[[Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space]]'' boxed set (1989). The dragons of Krynn', the amphi dragon, the astral dragon, the kodragon, the othlorx dragon, and the sea dragon appeared in the ''Monstrous Compendium Dragonlance Appendix (1990)''. The cloud  dragon, the Greyhawk dragon, the mist dragon, and the shadow dragon appeared in the ''Monstrous Compendium Greyhawk Appendix'' (1990). The adamantite dragon appeared in the ''Monstrous Compendium Outer Planes Appendix'' (1991).<ref>LaFountain, J. Paul. ''Monstrous Compendium Outer Planes Appendix''. ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1991)</ref> The moon dragon, the sun dragon, and the stellar dragon appeared in the ''Monstrous Compendium Spelljammer Appendix'' (1991). The deep dragon appeared in the ''Monstrous Compendium Forgotten Realms Appendix II'' (1991). The gem dragons (the amethyst dragon, the crystal dragon, the emerald dragon, the sapphire dragon, and the topaz dragon) appeared in the ''Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix'' (1992). The chromatic dragons (black dragon, blue dragon, green dragon, red dragon, and white dragon), the gem dragons (amethyst dragon, crystal dragon, emerald dragon, sapphire dragon, and topaz dragon), metallic dragons (brass dragon, bronze dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, and silver dragon), brown dragon, cloud dragon, deep dragon, mercury dragon, mist dragon, shadow dragon, steel dragon, and yellow dragon appeared in the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993).<ref>Stewart, Doug, ed. ''[[Monster Manual|Monstrous Manual]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1993)</ref> The onyx dragon, jade dragon, ruby dragon and amber dragon appeared in the ''Monstrous Compendium Mystara Appendix'' (1994).\n\nThe chromatic dragons (black, blue, green, red, and white), and the metallic dragons (brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver) appeared in the third edition in the ''Monster Manual'' (2000),<ref>[[Skip Williams|Williams, Skip]], [[Jonathan Tweet]], and [[Monte Cook]]. ''[[Monster Manual]]'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 2000)</ref> and in the revised 3.5 ''Monster Manual'' (2003). The Gem dragons appeared in the third edition in the ''Monster Manual II''.\n\nThe five chromatic dragon types  (black, blue, green, red, and white) appeared in young, adult, elder, and ancient variants in the fourth edition ''Monster Manual'' (2008). Three more chromatic dragon types appeared in ''Draconomicon: Chromatic Dragons'': the brown dragon (aka, sand dragon), the grey dragon (aka, fang dragon), and the purple dragon (aka, deep dragon). The adamantine dragon, copper dragon, gold dragon, iron dragon, and silver dragon appeared in the ''Monster Manual 2'' (2009).\n\n== Abilities ==\nIn ''D&D'', true dragons continue to become more powerful as they mature and age; they grow bigger and stronger, become more resistant to damage and magic, their breath weapon become increasingly dangerous and their knowledge and magical abilities improves. Old dragons can cast ''draconic magic'' which is a special form of ''D&D'' magic; dragons can cast spells with just a few words, rather than a sometimes long and complex ritual involving words, gestures and preparations like other ''D&D'' wizards. In 3 and 3.5 editions dragons cast spells spontaneously like [[Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons)|sorcerers]] do, sometimes having a wider choice of spells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/dragonTrue.htm |title=Dragon, True |publisher=d20srd.org |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref> Dragons also radiate a mystical ''fear aura'' around them. After a [[millennium]] or two, a dragon reaches his maximum development. In the ''Draconomicon'', there is also an article about Advanced Dragons, dragons that have reached their oldest age category but can still advance \"virtual age categories\", and become larger and stronger.\n\nMany ''D&D'' dragons have some innate magical abilities, but they vary from race to race. Metallic dragons are often able to [[shapechange]] into small animals or human forms, and use this ability to secretly help or watch over humans. Dragons also have some innate powers over the element they are linked to. For example, a red dragon (fire) will have some control over fires. Like all other draconic powers, they gain more as they grow older. Lesser dragons, for example [[Wyvern (Dungeons & Dragons)|wyverns]], halfdragons or dragonwrought kobolds may lack innate magical abilities, while still counting as dragons for purpose of all other effects.\n\n===Breath weapon===\n\nA '''breath weapon''' is the cone or line shaped weapon exhaled by dragons in ''D&D''.  Each type of dragon has a different breath weapon.  The [[chromatic dragon]]s (evil) have one breath weapon and the [[metallic dragon]]s (good) have two.  Other dragons and semi-dragons frequently have breath weapons.  One example is the [[Dragon turtle (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragon turtle's]] cone of steam breath weapon.\n\n====Form====\n\nBreath weapons typically come in one of three forms.\n* Line: Does damage in a straight line.  For example, the blue dragon's line of lightning.\n* Cone: Does damage in a wide cone shape.  For example, the [[Red dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|red dragon]]'s cone of fire.\n* Cloud: Does damage with a cloud of gas.  For example, the green dragon's cloud of chlorine gas.\n\n====Composition====\n\nBreath weapons typically are composed of one of several materials.\n* Fire: Magical fire is used by [[Gold dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|gold dragon]]s, brass dragons and red dragons.\n* Electricity: Lightning is exhaled by blue dragons and bronze dragons.\n* Acid: The black and copper dragon exhale a powerful acid.\n* Poison: The green dragon's breath weapon is a cloud of chlorine gas.\n* Cold: The white and silver dragons both release a cone of sub zero air and ice.\n\n=== Magic ===\n{{expand section|date=November 2019}}\nTrue dragons are born with a natural flair for magic, but they need to practise and hone their skills and come of age before they are able to use it to any meaningful effect.<ref>{{cite book|title=Draconomicon - The Book of Dragons|publisher=WotC|author=Collins, Williams og Wyatt|date=November 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Dragon Magic|publisher=WotC|author=Stephens and Thompson|date=September 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Biology ==\n''D&D'' dragons are able to eat almost everything, but each race has a preferred diet (some prefer flesh, other prefer to eat precious metals or gems, and so forth).\n\nDragons are inherently magical beings, and are cold blooded reptiles. They have no biological relationship to mammals.\n\nThe number of eggs laid each time depends on the race of the dragon, but is usually low (between one and ten). Dragons can also cross-breed with virtually any other creature, creating a [[half-dragon]]. The most commonly heard of are in the humanoid races, particularly with human and elves. Any combination is possible, however, even with [[Devil (Dungeons & Dragons)|devils]] or [[Angel (Dungeons & Dragons)|angels]].\n\nAs far as senses, which vary slightly depending on species, they are superior in most ways to other creatures; like any predator, they have exceptionally acute senses, which only increase with age. Like avian creatures, they have excellent depth perception and comparingly good peripheral vision, able to see twice as well as a human in daylight; unlike avians, they have great night vision, and are able to see even when conditions have no light to offer, although in such conditions they cannot discern between colors.\n\nIn some editions,{{Vague|date=January 2011}} dragons can also pick up scents very well, utilizing both their sensitive nose and (often forked) tongue, much like a snake. In the 3.5 edition ''Monster Manual'' they do not have the Scent extraordinary ability [q.v.], so that a dragon's sense of smell does not markedly excel a human's.\n\nAlso, a dragon's hearing is roughly on par with human hearing, although a dragon's mind can filter what noise it hears. They are capable of \"blindsense\", the sense in which eyes, ears, and other senses are used to detect invisible persons or objects. Dragon taste is also refined, although they do not respond well to sweet flavors, and most dragons do not discuss the matter as to why. Of all its senses, a dragon's sense of touch is the only one to decrease throughout age, thanks mostly to the development of thick, hard scales.\n\n== Dragon personalities ==\nAll true dragons in ''Dungeons & Dragons'' are depicted as intelligent beings, and most of them exceedingly so. A dragon's personality varies by individual, but dragons of the same subrace tend to have similar mindsets. This is not always true; several exceptions exist in official ''D&D'' material. In the Forgotten Realms, a good-aligned red dragon is involved against his will in the Fall of the [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elven]] city of [[Myth Drannor]].\n\nDragon subraces encompass all ''D&D'' [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignments]], going from [[Lawful Good|lawful good]] paladin-like gold dragons to the cruel and very greedy [[Chaotic Evil|chaotic evil]] red dragons.\n\nAll dragons share a common desire to collect treasure, be it precious, beautiful, magical or just shiny\u2014indeed, the treasure in question needn't always be gold, and may sometimes be aesthetic in nature, ranging from popular artwork or sculptures or even rare books and tomes that might otherwise have an overwhelming monetary value. For [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|evil-aligned]] dragons, this generally directs a greedy attitude to achieve such wealth by whatever means suit them.  For [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|good]] dragons this lust for treasure is tempered, although they are certainly not averse to earning such wealth, and still appreciate gifts (while being insulted if offered an obvious bribe).\n\nBeing stronger, faster, generally smarter, and possessing longer life than humans and most other races, dragons tend to consider themselves superior creatures. For good-aligned dragons, this may only mean they often consider humanoid races as children, trying to take care of them and educate them; for evil-aligned dragons, they consider humanoids as mere animals, or as toys to play with; at best, they are minions and slaves.\n\nThe longevity of dragons is evident in their often lackadaisical attitudes. Good-aligned dragons, while concerned with defeating evil, are able to see a much broader scope of the world, and although certain crises arise that may seem extremely important to good-aligned humans, their dragon counterparts are able to see the event as an unimportant hiccup that will pass in mere centuries; even those that adventure with others tend show a sense of incredible patience, even in situations where all others feel they've not a second to lose. Similarly, evil-aligned dragons that are crossed by belligerent adventurers may plot for dozens of generations before exacting revenge on the trespasser's line\u2014it is not uncommon for those descended from the mentioned adventurer to find themselves the target of a dragon based simply on their lineage.\n\n== In campaign settings ==\nIn many settings, the [[god]]-[[monarch|king]] of the metallic dragons is [[Bahamut (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bahamut]], the Platinum Dragon, and the [[goddess]] and [[monarch|queen]] of the chromatic dragons is [[Tiamat (Dungeons & Dragons)|Tiamat]], the Five-Headed Dragon. She is based on the [[Tiamat]] from [[Babylonian mythology]], who was considered the evil mother of dragons, though the appearances of the fictional deity differs greatly from its model.<ref name=\"DV\"/>\n\nThe progenitor and supreme deity of all dragons in the game is known as Io. Other deities often included in the draconic pantheon of gods include [[Aasterinian]], [[Chronepsis]], and [[Faluzure]].  Other draconic gods may be present in different campaign settings.\n\n=== Dragonlance setting ===\nThe ''[[Dragonlance]]'' [[novel]]s and [[campaign setting]] helped popularize the ''D&D''-derived perspective on dragons. Here the Platinum Dragon is called Paladine, and the Dragon Queen is called [[Takhisis]].  Dragons are divided up into good and evil groups, known as the Metallic Dragons and the Chromatic Dragons, respectively.  Paladine leads the Metallic Dragons and Takhisis the Chromatic.  The Metallic Dragons rarely became involved in the world other than to oppose the actions of Chromatic Dragons, who often joined into war as their goddess Takhisis instructed.  However, in the \"Fifth Age\", massive Chromatic Dragons who were not native to Krynn emerged and took over many of the humanoid-controlled nations of Krynn, as well as slaying many of the native dragons.  They are known as Dragon Overlords.  There was one from each race of Chromatic Dragons; red, green, black, white, and blue.\n\n=== Dark Sun setting ===\nIn the world of [[Athas]] of the [[Dark Sun]] [[campaign setting]], normal D&D dragons do not exist. Dragon-like ''drake'' races exist, one for each [[classical element]], but for most people the word ''dragon'' refers to the Dragon of Tyr, who is a very powerful ''sorcerer-king'' (the tyrannic leaders of Athasian cities, who are both masters of magic and [[Psionics (Dungeons & Dragons)|psi]] abilities) who transformed himself into a dragon-like creature using very powerful (and painful) magic. However, this dragon (Bors or Borys) was eventually killed in [[Troy Denning]]'s book ''The Cerulean Storm'' by his former master, the sorcerer Rajaat. Several other sorcerer kings had been rumored to be dragons, but all others were only in a process of being transformed into a dragon type being, unique to the Athas world, which took several long stages to complete, but became greatly powerful if achieved.\n\n=== Forgotten Realms setting ===\nIn the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' [[campaign setting]], dragons are very close to the ones in [[Dragonlance]]. A sect of cultists called the ''Cult of the Dragon'' believes that dragons, particularly [[Undead (Dungeons & Dragons)|undead]] ones, will rule the world, and are trying to persuade evil dragons to become ''[[dracolich]]es'' -- undead [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]]-like dragons, which are partially bound to the cult by the [[ritual]]s which grant them their undead status. Additionally, in the ''D&D'' supplement book ''The Draconomicon'', several other undead varieties of the dragon \u2013 ghost, skeleton, vampire, and zombie dragons \u2013 are described.\n\nA series called Wyrms of the North ran in ''Dragon'' magazine issues #230 through #259 and was later updated to third edition rules on Wizards of the Coast's website (see external links).  Each article detailed an individual dragon of significance in [[Faer\u00fbn]].\n\nLately an ancient affliction that attacks dragons, rendering them mad; the Dracorage, was invoked causing countless dragons to rampage throughout Faer\u00fbn. A novel trilogy, ''[[The Year of Rogue Dragons]]'' set (''The Rage'', ''The Rite'', and ''The Ruin'') by [[Richard Lee Byers]], as well as a game accessory, ''[[Dragons of Faer\u00fbn]]'', details the exploits and deeds of several dragons as the Dracorage swept the continent.\n\n=== World of Greyhawk setting ===\n[[Steel dragon]]s, originally known as Greyhawk dragons, are those originating in the ''[[World of Greyhawk]]'' [[campaign setting]], later appearing in other settings like the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. They have hair-like spines around their heads, cat-like bodies with vaguely human-like faces, and scales resembling steel armor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mm/20040328a|title=Steel Dragon (conversion for 3.5 edition D&D)|author=Sean K Reynolds and Skip Williams|publisher=Wizards of the Coast}}</ref> They are much like the other races of metallic dragon with one primary exception: they prefer to maintain the form of another sentient race in order to mingle with, infiltrate, and study the cultures of men and their ilk. Few people know when they are interacting with a Steel Dragon, but they always have a feature which betrays them by resembling their natural complexion. Within the Greyhawk setting, such dragons are known to have made journeys into other material planes where they have come to be called steel dragons.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Sean K.

(The ''Draconomicon'' introduces rules for dragon PCs in standard ''Dungeons & Dragons''.) The setting is based around a society of dragons and their servitors and uses the standard ''D&D'' dragon races and dragon gods. It has detailed rules for creating and playing dragon PCs and NPCs, including various draconic [[character class]]es.\n\n=== Eberron setting ===\nIn the ''[[Eberron]]'' [[campaign setting]], three dragon gods have created the world: Siberys, Eberron and Khyber. Siberys and Eberron waged war against Khyber and imprisoned it within the depths of the earth. In the end, all three dragons merged with the land: Siberys becoming the sky, Eberron the continents and Khyber the underground world.\n\nDragons are apart from civilization, which is mostly concentrated on the continent of Khorvaire. They live on the continent of Argonnessen, a rather unknown place, since dragons are very territorial, it makes exploration often hazardous. The dragons used to rule over Eberron many centuries ago, but at the end of the Dragon-Fiend war, against the demons and devils of Khyber, they departed from Khorvaire to go to Argonnessen.\n\nDragons are immersed in the Draconic Prophecy, a legend which all bits of information are scattered throughout the world and that the outcome is unknown. They see every event as an important event in the Prophecy, and they even form an organization called the Chamber, where they send their brethren in search of clues. They can be of any alignment, like any creature in Eberron, so a good red dragon (usually evil) is as common as an evil gold dragon (usually good). This rule might throw some players off-balance. Dragons also consider themselves superior, treating all other races as inferior. Furthermore, any half-dragon spotted by these dragons is vowed to be hunted, as they treat these half-breeds as a disgrace to their image.\n\n=== Birthright setting ===\nThe [[Birthright (campaign setting)|Birthright]] [[campaign setting]] had its own version of a Dragon, named Cerilian Dragon, Cerilia being the main continent in the setting. They resemble more the eastern-type dragons being long and serpentine with leathery wings. Their backs are protected by iron-hard scales, their bellies by layers of thick, leathery skin. Their color ranges from reddish rust-brown to iron gray, with their bellies usually of a paler tone than their scales. Cerilian dragons are among the most ancient inhabitants of the continent, predating even elves and dwarves. Perhaps once there were many, but over the years, in-fighting and fighting the younger races have taken their toll. There are only a half dozen dragons known to be left. All living dragons are of the Old age or higher. Dragons are extremely intelligent and knowledgeable, conserving much lore that has been lost to the younger races. They speak their own language; some also speak Elven or Dwarven. Some of these dragons took part in the Battle of Deismaar, the only verified alive and awake dragons right now are the dragon of Vstaive Peaks in Vosgaard, also known as Vore Lekiniskiy and Kappenkriaucheran who inhabits the Drachenward mountains and controls their magic. The most famous of the dragons is Tarazin the Grey who has not been seen for several decades when the official campaign begins. The only known Dracolich is Komassa who lives in the Shadow World. Dragons in Birthright are meant to be rare and powerful beings and only rarely if ever appear in any adventure.\n\n==True dragons==\nIn most descriptions, true dragons only comprise the two families of chromatic dragons and metallic dragons. There are, however, many more families among the true dragons, and some kinds exists outside any specific category.\n\n===Chromatic dragons===\nA Chromatic dragon is a classification of fictional [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragon]]. Chromatic dragons are typically of evil [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)|alignment]], in contrast to the [[metallic dragon]]s, which are typically of good alignment. Chromatic dragons have played a large role in various ''D&D'' monster compilation books: white, black, green, blue and red dragons being the classic chromatic dragons.<ref>{{Cite book | last = DeKirk | first = Ash | authorlink = Oberon_Zell-Ravenheart#Bibliography |author2=Oberon Zell  | title = Dragonlore: From the Archives of the Grey School of Wizardry | publisher = New Page Books | series =  | volume =  | edition = 1 | year = 2006 | location =  | pages = 224 | doi = | id =  | isbn = 978-1-56414-868-1 | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = }}</ref> [[Tiamat (Dungeons & Dragons)|Tiamat]] is the queen of chromatic dragons, based on the evil [[Tiamat|mother of all dragons]] from [[Babylonian mythology]].<ref name=\"DV\"/>\n====Publication history====\nThe classification of \"chromatic dragons\" was used in the ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' second edition ''Monstrous Manual'' (1993),<ref>Stewart, Doug, ed.

They are large with a wide wingspan. They have two swept back horns on their heads. They smell of smoke and sulphur. The eggs of a red dragon must be kept in open flame at all times while incubating. Incubation takes approximately 660 days. After the eggs are laid, the younger of the two parents remains behind to guard the eggs and keep the nest of flames burning. Once they hatch, the wyrmlings are left to fend for themselves. A red wyrmling is roughly human-sized at hatching and dangerous. They are capable of breathing fire, and revel in wreaking destruction and havoc on almost anything that moves. The latter trait is carried fully into adulthood. They regard all other Chromatic dragons as inferiors, with the amount of disdain proportional to the variety's general power level. All other chromatic dragons that red dragons encounter are either killed, driven away, or bullied into servitude depending on the red dragon's mood and personality, with the except of white dragons who are allowed to leave since red dragons do not consider them worth the effort to kill. Due to their choice of living space, they cross paths with many of the [[Metallic dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|metallic dragons]], most notably the silver dragons who are their worst enemies, and holding the greatest disdain for copper dragons whom they clash with them often. Red dragons have an eye for value, and can determine the monetary worth of any object at a glance. The gaining and keeping of treasure is the focus of a red dragon's adult life, and they tend to amass incredible hoards with amazing rapidity. At any given moment, a red dragon will be able to tell the precise monetary value of all the objects in its hoard, down to the last fraction of a coin. Red dragons prefer to make their homes inside active volcanoes. If a volcano is not available, they will reside in any mountain, provided that it has a good ledge from which the dragon can survey its territory. A red dragon's lair may have only one entrance, high above ground level. The entrance leads to a narrow tunnel, which drops off into a pit. At the bottom of the pit lies a pool of water, surrounded by several chambers. One is the dragon's sleeping quarters, another contains its hoard.Red dragons are very dangerous in combat. Proficient in magic, they are also fast in the air, but clumsy, so prefer to fight on the ground. They spend years designing battle strategies, and wait until the best moment to call upon them. Their blasts of fire end most battles before they begin. As a result, red dragons use their powerful breath weapons first, followed by physical strikes, then magical attacks. Red dragons may hoard women and children in their lairs along with their wealth. In some genres they have the 'power of persuasion' over weaker minds. They sometimes use this to persuade the chieftains of villages to sacrifice young girls to them.\n|-\n|Blue dragon\n|\n*Breath weapon: Line of lightning\n*Habitat: Sandy deserts or coastal areas\n*Diet: Meat from large animals such as camels, snakes, lizards, and also plants\n*Preferred Treasure: Sapphires\n*Alignment: [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Lawful Evil|Lawful Evil]]\n*Image: [http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG72.jpg Wizards.com image]\n*Stats: [http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/dragonTrue.htm#blueDragon OGL stats]\n|Blue dragons are the second most powerful of the classic chromatic dragons. They have single large horns protruding from their heads<ref name=\"Envoyer\" /> and large, frilled ears. The tail is thick and bumpy. The wings are more pronounced than most other species. They smell like ozone or sand. They are more likely to be mocking and manipulative than outrightly cruel or murderous to 'lesser' creatures, aided by their natural talents for hallucination. They trick desert travelers into drinking sand or going miles out of their way. Blue dragons are mostly carnivorous though they will eat plants on occasion. Camels are the preferred food. They are enemies of brass dragons. Blue dragons are unusual for chromatics in that they keep fairly well-ordered, hierarchical societies. Despite their evil nature, they are excellent parents to their young, and rarely leave their eggs unattended. Blue dragon eggs must be buried in warm sand to incubate. Blue wyrmlings are quick to taunt any other creature. They hunt small desert creatures for food. The typical blue dragon lair is dug into desert rock formations with two entrances: one at ground level, hidden by the sand, and one opening onto a high ledge on which it can perch and survey its territory. Each lair also has a cavern with a pool of water and sandy beach, which its inhabitant will use for drinking and relaxation. The blue dragon excels at aerial combat. They discharge lightning at aerial foes, or at creatures on the ground. They are powerful at spell craft and adept at burrowing in sand. They often lie in wait just below the surface of the desert for prey. When they are so burrowed, their large horns can be mistaken for pointed desert rocks.\n|-\n|Green dragon\n|\n*Breath weapon: Cloud of chlorine gas (changed to cone of acidic mist in Edition 3.5)\n*Habitat: Forests with tall trees\n*Diet: Small humanoids such as [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnomes]] are preferred, but prize elves and sprites most.

They have a large, waving crest or fin that starts at the dragon's nose and runs the length of the dragon's body. They also have long, slender forked tongues and smell like chlorine gas. They are highly adept at magic. Green dragons are reasonably good parents, with both mother and father typically staying close to their eggs while they are incubating. Females either keep their eggs in a solution of acid or bury them in leaves moistened with rainwater. The green wyrmling may be mistaken for a black, due to their nearly black scales. As the wyrmling matures, its scales lighten in color. The wyrmlings typically stay with both parents until they reach adulthood (approximately 100 years). A green dragon lair will be a complex of caves and tunnels, with its main entrance hidden behind a waterfall. The dragons prefer caves high up on a cliff. The territories of Green and Black dragons frequently overlap, but as greens are more powerful, they typically hold the upper hand. Greens may allow a Black dragon to remain in their forest, as long as the lesser dragon remains in the swamps. Green dragons revel in combat, and will often attack for no apparent reason. They are territorial, and may view any intrusion into their domain as an affront. They are cunning and duplicitous foes, and love to double-cross. A traveler who stumbles into a green dragon's territory may be able to bribe the dragon for safe passage, but the dragon may pretend to agree and then attack the unsuspecting offender once their guard is down. Though aggressive, green dragons prefer to use magic before attacking physically.\n|-\n|Black dragon\n|\n*Breath weapon: Line of acid\n* Habitat: Boggy swamps\n* Diet: Fish, mollusks, aquatic creatures, some red meat from terrestrial animals\n* Preferred Treasure: Gold coins\n* Alignment: [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|Chaotic Evil]]\n* Image: [http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG71.jpg Wizards.com image]\n|Black dragons are the most vile-tempered and cruel of all chromatic dragons, apart from their love of bargaining. Black dragons are distinguished by their horns, which protrude from the sides of their heads and wrap around, projecting forward, a longer body and thinner tail.<ref name=\"Envoyer\" /> A large frill adorns the upper part of the neck. They smell like rotting vegetation and foul water, or like the powerful acid they can breathe. Black dragons are fierce hunters that will normally attack from the water. They will often prey on fish, crabs, birds, turtles, crocodiles, lizardfolk, chuuls, hydras, and green dragons that are smaller and younger than they are. Their enemies include green dragons and swamp landwyrms. Black dragons are not noted as good parents, relying more upon disguise and hiding to protect their eggs than upon guarding them. Black dragon eggs must be submerged in strong acid while incubating. Their wyrmlings (babies) are exceptionally cruel with insatiable appetites for nearly anything organic. As a black dragon matures, its scales gradually grow lighter. The oldest black dragons appear almost purple in color; hence the name of [[Cormyr]]'s Purple Dragon knights stems from the legend of the great black dragon Thauglor, who once dominated the area encompassed by the present kingdom. A black dragon typically lairs in a large cave or underground chamber next to a swamp or murky pond. Their lairs always have two entrances: one underwater through the adjacent swamp/pond, and one above-ground, disguised amidst the undergrowth. In combat, black dragons prefer ambushes to straightforward fighting. They are vicious and ruthless adversaries, and their acidic bile can easily work its way under the heaviest armor. Their heavily wooded habitats prevent them from flying very high in combat.\n|-\n|White dragon\n|\n*Breath weapon: Cone of cold\n* Habitat: Arctic mountains\n* Diet: Anything that moves, but must be frozen first\n* Preferred Treasure: Diamonds\n* Alignment: [[Alignment (Dungeons & Dragons)#Chaotic Evil|Chaotic Evil]]\n* Image: [http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG78.jpg Wizards.com image]\n* Stats: [http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/dragonTrue.htm#whiteDragon OGL stats]\n|White dragons are the weakest and the most feral of the classic chromatic dragons. Though dimmer than other dragons, they are still powerful enough to overwhelm most humans and have good long-term memories. Their heads and necks blend seamlessly into one another, and their wings are frayed along the edges. They have a flap of skin (dewlap) lined with spines under their chins. They have a high crest atop a streamlined head and a crisp, vaguely chemical odor. White dragon eggs must be buried in snow or encased in ice to incubate. The parents do not tend or protect the eggs in any way, although they lay them near their lairs. A newly hatched white wyrmling has clear scales, which become white as the dragon matures. They are expected to survive on their own after hatching, although some white dragon parents will permit their young to live in their lair until they reach adulthood. Adult white dragons have several abilities well suited to their arctic habitat. They can climb ice cliffs with ease, fly high and fast, and are exceptional swimmers. They love to swim in cold water. Much of their diet consists of aquatic creatures. White dragons are always hungry, and tend to become more savage as they mature. Knowing that they are the smallest and weakest of dragons, many whites harbor inferiority complexes. They take any opportunity to bully beings such as giants and younger dragons of other species. White dragons lair in ice caves dug into mountains. Their lairs contain many more tunnels and chambers than those of other chromatic dragons. More powerful white dragons may turn a large iceberg into a floating lair. Such lairs have an underwater entrance as well as one to the open air. White dragons are not strong combatants compared to other dragons. Their icy breath can freeze a foe solid. They avoid fights with more powerful dragons, but will take any opportunity to take their frustrations out on 'lesser' creatures. Whites also have exceptional memories, and will hunt down those who cross them, no matter how long it takes.\n|}\n\n====Other chromatic dragons====\nThis is a list of other dragons which are based on colors, but are not truly related to other chromatic dragons. In 4th edition, the gray, brown, and purple dragons were released in Draconomicon, but the grey and purple dragons were different.

Only a malevolent brass dragon would choose to devour an intelligent creature.\n* Preferred Treasure: Handcrafted work in materials such as bone, wood, stone, or fabric (particularly weaving).\n|Although weaker than many other varieties of dragonkind, brass dragons are still powerful creatures by any measure. They have a strong mercenary streak and often agree to serve as guardians or battle champions for anyone willing to pay suitably well.\n\nPhysically, the brass dragon is highly distinctive. From below, its outstretched wings form a triangular shape, as they are attached to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. The wings are longest at the shoulder and taper gently as they reach the tail. Their scales seem to radiate heat and light. The shape of the head is quite unusual, as it includes a large, curved plate that extends from the dragon's eyes and cheeks on either side and curves upwards into two points, much like a plowshare. They have two sharp horns on the chin, which become steadily pointier as the dragon ages. They smell like hot, oiled metal.\n\nBrass dragon eggs must be incubated in a nest of open flames. Incubation takes approximately 480 days. The eggs are typically tended by both parents so that they can talk together as they maintain their vigil. A newly hatched brass wyrmling is not remarkable in appearance; its scales are a dull brown. The scales become lighter and more brilliant as the dragon matures. Brass wyrmlings probably learn to talk more quickly than the young of any other sentient species. They talk constantly about anything and everything, and they will talk to anybody: friends, family, enemies, small creatures that cannot talk back, or even to themselves if nobody else is near. When exposed to a new language, a brass wyrmling will usually become fluent in under an hour. Though they have an extremely deadly breath weapon, they are more fragile than other dragons. As a result, they make alliances with small groups of intelligent creatures, such as tribes of nomadic Dragonborn.\n\nAs it matures, a brass dragon adds a love of fire to its love of speech. They can stare into burning flames for hours, entranced by their beauty. Older brass dragons often become discouraged with the world, believing that others are ruining it. Yet as they mature, they seem to accept the follies of the world, and may even donate some of their treasures to aid a cause they believe to be worthy. Ancient brass dragons are some of the best - and most willing - sources of advice in the entire [[Prime Material Plane]].\n\nThe brass dragon prefers to dig its lair inside a desert peak or spire. They also prefer to have their lairs face eastwards, so that the rising sun will warm the lair for the bulk of the day. A brass dragon's lair is well-constructed and quite extensive, with many twisting corridors and dead ends to confuse and discourage hostile intruders. The centerpiece of any brass dragon's lair is the Grand Conversation Hall, where it spends the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors. A typical lair will also contain an elegant foyer, a gallery for the artwork the dragon has collected, a sleeping chamber, and a storage room. All brass dragon lairs have several small entrances, known as bolt holes. These multiple entrances allow a brass dragon to easily escape an attack by a blue dragon or other predator.\n\nThe brass dragon was an example of content misrepresented by the game's detractors, by whom it was described erroneously as the worst of dragons.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zvz9BQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PAxii#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Dangerous Games: What the Moral Panic over Role-Playing Games Says about Play, Religion, and Imagined Worlds|last1=Laycock|first1=Joseph P.|date=2015|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520960565|page=xii|language=en|accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Brass Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Chaotic Good\n}}\n|-\n|Bronze dragon\n|\n*Maximum Height: 15 feet\n* Maximum Weight: 160,000 pounds\n* Maximum Wingspan: 80 feet\n* Breath weapon: repulsion gas, lightning\n* Habitat: Aquatic, Tropical Islands\n* Diet: Aquatic plants, shark meat, crustaceans, sahuagin.\n* Preferred Treasure: Ceramics, statuary and gemstones.\n|Duty-bound and honorable to a fault, bronze dragons commit themselves to order and are among the greatest and most devout champions of that ideal. As order's sworn servants, bronze dragons can seem arrogant and haughty, with an inflated sense of self, a tendency that can put them at odds with those they meet. In rare cases, this self-righteousness grows into something far more sinister, and the bronze dragon takes over what it sees as lesser races, ruling as a cruel tyrant to its subjects. Bronze dragons claim coastlines, inlets, and islands as their own, constructing lairs in coastal caves that have access to the sea. More aggressive bronze dragons purposely choose lairs near shipping lanes so they can claim tribute from merchant vessels as those craft pass by. All bronze dragons share a deep and abiding hatred for blue dragons, and they are vigilant in protecting their homes from these interlopers.\n\nPhysically, the bronze dragon is quite fierce in appearance, despite its good nature. While most of its body is a reflective copper color, the wings are often tipped with green. The eyes of a bronze dragon begin with a green iris and as they age the eye slowly becomes a solid green with no distinct iris. The dragon has three main large horns protruding from each cheek, pointing back towards the tail. It also has a couple of smaller horns. The tips of these points are black and very sharp, and are often used for grooming. The tongue is purple-gray, long and pointed, and not forked. A large frill runs down the upper part of its neck. They smell like sea-spray.\n\nBronze dragons mate for life and take their duties as parents with the utmost seriousness. They will protect their eggs and their wyrmlings at any cost. Although bronze dragons always live near water, they lay their eggs in a dry cave. Apart from a dry, relatively warm environment, bronze dragon eggs require no special conditions for incubation like those of most dragons. Upon hatching, the wyrmlings are raised, taught, and protected by their parents. A newly hatched bronze wyrmling appears yellow with a tinge of green, and the scales will gradually shift to bronze as it matures. Bronze wyrmlings hold a strong sense of responsibility from the moment it leaves the egg- one that causes it to seek out purpose as thoroughly as it hunts for sustenance.\n\nGiven its exceptional abilities as a swimmer, the entrance to a bronze dragon's lair is quite naturally underwater, and often disguised with seaweed and coral. The bulk of the lair is above water level, however, consisting of multiple tunnels and large chambers, some as much as a thousand feet above sea level. They prefer to make their lairs in an island volcano, if possible.\n\nWhile bronze dragons are often fascinated with battles, especially fighting to defeat evil, they have strong moral compunctions against killing living beings unless absolutely necessary. They will often join good-aligned armies to fight the forces of evil, either in human form or their own. In battle, their weapon of choice is to breathe repulsion gas, which is so putrid that it forces absolutely everything away. They also like to relocate a foe to a remote location where it can do no harm when possible. When forced to kill, the bronze dragon is a deadly combatant, roasting enemies with bursts of lightning or ripping them open with its clawed forelegs.\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Bronze Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Lawful Good\n}}\n|-\n|Copper dragon\n|\n*Maximum Height: 12 feet\n* Maximum Weight: 160,000 pounds\n* Maximum Wingspan: 80 feet\n* Breath weapon: Cone of Slow Gas, Line of acid\n* Habitat: Dry, rocky mountains or desert\n* Diet: Scorpions and other venomous creatures\n* Preferred Treasure: Valuables from the earth: metals, precious stones, finely crafted sculptures, well-made ceramics, ''et cetera''\n|Copper dragons are the second weakest of the metallic dragons. They are born tricksters and jokesters. They are quite devious and clever, but their intent is purely benign. They do not seek to harm 'lesser' creatures, but merely wish to impress them with superior intelligence and wit, and to fool them with clever pranks.\n\nPhysically, the copper dragon is very striking, with scales of a warm copper color tinged with blue. Like the brass dragon, the copper dragon's wings connect to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. However, its wings have a pronounced bend to them, giving them the appearance of a \"V\" from below, rather than the brass dragon's triangular appearance. Copper dragons are powerful jumpers and climbers, with massive thigh and shoulder muscles. Their two horns are broad and flat, pointing backwards towards the tail from the top of their heads. They also have a distinctive frill protruding from either jaw. When the mouth is closed, the teeth are completely hidden. They exude a stony odor.\n\nCopper dragons lay their eggs in a nest of cool sand or clay. Both parents watch over the eggs and raise the wyrmling until it reaches adulthood, whereupon the parents separate. When new hatched, the scales of a copper wyrmling are a muddy brown in color, which gradually shifts to a glowing copper as it matures. Adult copper dragons are quite social, mainly due to the desire to play tricks upon each other. A visitor to a copper dragon's lair can expect to be entertained at length, although the dragon will become angry if the visitor does not appear impressed with their tricks, riddles, and stories.\n\nA typical copper dragon's lair is a cave, whose entrance is concealed by rocks and boulders. Upon entering, visitors find themselves in a huge labyrinth of tunnels. Copper dragons compete amongst themselves to see who can design the most confusing layout. If a friendly visitor becomes hopelessly lost (which is rather common), the copper dragon will rescue them before they are actually endangered. Once through the labyrinth, visitors find themselves in a spacious foyer, beyond which is the Main Entertaining Chamber, where the dragon will spend the bulk of its time. Opening off the MEC is a much more straightforward escape tunnel, whose outside entrance is often fiendishly difficult to locate even when one knows exactly where it is. The copper dragon will know, however, and often uses its 'back door' to get into its lair instead of taking the time to navigate the maze. Obviously, it is far easier for a visitor to enter via the secret door if they can find it, but doing so is considered impolite, especially if they are a first-time visitor.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, copper dragons prefer to avoid it. Rather than fighting openly, they prefer to taunt, humiliate, and tease their opponents until they simply give up and run away. Their ability to dramatically slow opponents often gives them ample time to run away. When forced, however, a copper dragon will fight to the very end, and is an incredibly devious antagonist. Their acid breath is not to be taken lightly.\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Copper Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Chaotic Good\n}}\n|-\n|Gold dragon\n|\n*Maximum Height: 22 feet\n* Maximum Weight: 1,280,000 pounds<ref name=\"pgtd\">{{cite book|title=A Practical Guide to Dragons|last=Trumbauer|first=Lisa|date=2006-09-26|publisher=Mirrorstone|isbn=0-7869-4164-2|location=Washington|pages=80|authorlink=Lisa Trutkoff Trumbauer}}</ref>\n* Maximum Wingspan: 135 feet\n* Breath weapon: \tCone of fire, weakening gas\n* Habitat: Anywhere, although they prefer secluded lairs\n* Diet: Small gems and pearls; they do not eat any living creatures\n* Preferred Treasure: Art, especially paintings and sculptures\n|Gold dragons are based on [[Chinese dragon|creatures]] from [[Chinese mythology]].<ref name=\"DV\"/> In the game they are the most powerful of the metallic dragons (in some versions they are the strongest of all dragons), and the most dedicated to defeating evil. They spend the bulk of their lives in human form, seeking out evil and punishing wrongdoers to the best of its considerable abilities. Its typical mode of operation runs roughly along the lines of a [[sting operation]]: the dragon will listen for stories of dangerous or evil creatures or persons, then reveal its true form and mete out punishment. They prefer to turn villains over to law enforcement if available, but will ultimately take whatever actions they deem necessary in order to see justice served. They are best summarized as the paladins of the draconic world.\n\nPhysically, gold dragons are quite spectacular. Several large horns tipped with umber shoot sideways from their cheeks, and two very prominent horns point backwards along their heads. The most obvious feature is probably the tentacle whiskers that sprout from the top and bottom of the gold dragon's jaw, giving the appearance of a beard of sorts. Their wings, like those of brass and copper dragons, connect to the body all the way to the tip of the tail. From below, the overall shape resembles that of a brass dragon, but the different coloring and dramatic difference in size enables easy differentiation. When in flight, the gold dragon's wings ripple, giving the appearance of swimming rather than flying. They smell of saffron and incense.\n\nGold dragon eggs must be incubated in a nest of open flames. A newly hatched gold wyrmling appears similar to an adult, except that it lacks horns or tentacle whiskers. Both parents tend the eggs, and then take intense interest in their wyrmlings' care and education. At some point, however, the biological parents may send the wyrmling to live with foster parents; this allows the parents to undertake their own quests, as well as exposing the wyrmling to new experiences.\n\nUnlike many species of dragons, gold dragons have a very firm and hierarchical social structure, encompassing all members of the species. This structure always has one gold dragon as its leader who is given the title \"your resplendence\", who serves until he/she either dies or steps down. At that time, all gold dragons congregate and choose the next leader of their kind. Sometimes two dragons may be chosen; in such cases, the two will share the duties of leadership. The position of leader, or 'top dragon,' does not so much involve the maintenance of order - gold dragons are famous for their good behavior - so much as the dispensing of advice and wisdom to any dragons who ask for it. Gold dragons are voracious learners, and they tend to become very wise and worldly as they age. They freely share their knowledge and experience to anyone who asks, dragon or not. In fact, it is not unknown for a gold Great Wyrm to take the form of a scholarly professor in order to spread its knowledge at some human center of higher education.\n\nUnlike most other species of dragons, gold dragons devote immense time and energy to the construction of their lairs. The layout of their lairs often resemble those of elegant human mansions, albeit buried underground. Rooms are well-constructed and elegantly decorated with the many art treasures the gold dragon has collected over its lifetime. Typical rooms in a gold dragon's lair include a main hall, a banquet hall, a resting chamber, a study, a kitchen, a lobby, a storage room, and perhaps even a lavatory. Many gold dragons even have a glass-walled observatory, especially if they live underwater.\n\nGold dragons prefer to talk rather than to fight. They will never engage in combat if they believe it is unnecessary. Once they believe it ''is'' necessary, however, they are amazingly powerful opponents. Their ability to breathe fire rivals that of the eldest red dragons, and they will pour their entire being into a battle against evil. Gold dragons dislike killing, but they do not hesitate to do so if it is necessary in order to defeat an evil foe.\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Gold Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Lawful Good\n}}\n|-\n|Silver dragon\n|\n*Maximum Height: 22 feet\n* Maximum Weight: 1,280,000 pounds<ref name=\"pgtd\" />\n* Maximum Wingspan: 150 feet\n* Breath weapon: Cone of Cold, Paralyzation Gas\n* Habitat: High Mountains (the colder the better)\n* Diet: Almost anything; love tasting new things\n* Preferred Treasure: Beautifully crafted jewelry or finely woven fabrics\n|Silver dragons are the second most powerful of the metallic dragons, and are true friends to all. The silver dragon enjoys the company of humans and elves so much that it will often take the form of a human or elf and live among them for the majority of its life. Silvers, like all dragons, believe themselves the most superior creatures in the world. However, apart from the ability to fly, which they enjoy greatly, they tend to prefer the physical forms of humanoids for everyday life.\n\nAt first glance, the silver dragon appears very similar to the White dragon. The wings are more curved than a White's though, and the silver has two talons on its wings rather than the single talon of most dragons. The silver dragon also has a beautiful frill that begins at the top of its head and flows all the way down its neck and body to the tip of the tail. The frill is silver towards the body, fading to a purple hue at the edge. They have two long, smooth silver horns with black tips, pointing up and back from the head. They also have a pronounced sharp frill under the chin, which has the rough appearance of a goatee. They smell like rain.\n\nSilver dragons lay their eggs in a bed of snow. A new hatched silver wyrmling has scales of a bluish gray, which change to silver over time. Silver wyrmlings are intelligent, kind, extremely curious, and adorable.\n\nUnlike the gold or bronze dragon, the silver dragon does not usually go out of its way to bring justice to the world. Instead, it waits for others to ask for help. Silver dragons will attempt to right an injustice if they see one, but they have no inclination to intentionally seek evil out and destroy it. They are more interested in protecting the humans or elves they have come to care for than in looking for evil. Like most metallic dragons, silvers do not enjoy combat, and are averse to killing. If forced to fight, however, they are as deadly as any other dragon.\n\nA silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until the individual scales are scarcely visible. The pupils of the oldest silver dragons resemble orbs of molten mercury.\n\nThey are very intelligent, more so than most humans, extremely powerful, breathtakingly beautiful, and have lifespans which can extend to 4,200 years (as stated in ''draconomicon, the book of dragons'').\n\nThe silver dragon is regal and statuesque. An unusual trait they offer is the love of human dining, and will use the ability of alternate form to take part in large feasts.\n\nSilver dragons employ a [[Breath Weapon|breath weapon]] of extreme cold similar to that of white dragons. They also have a second breath weapon, a cone of paralyzing gas.\n\nSilver dragons are extremely rare and elusive, preferring to take the guise of kind and [[elderly]] humanoids or very attractive and young humanoids. They very much like to associate with [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]] and [[Human (Dungeons & Dragons)|humans]], not necessarily because they prefer their company over other races, but because they try to learn from the shorter-lived humans.\n\nSilver dragons' favored enemy are red dragons because these chromatic dragons are almost always evil and have a talent for destruction. Additionally, silvers and Reds favor the same sort of mountainous terrain for lairs, which leads to territorial disputes on top of having attitudes and philosophies at odds with the others'.\n\nDragons may live for millennia, while humans only live a few decades. This vast difference in time leads to inherent psychological differences concerning time. Dragons tend to think things through for years at a time, using their razor-sharp intellects to hone a plan to perfection, solve near-impossible puzzles, or engage in other intellectual pursuits. Silver dragons, however, note that humans are able to accomplish much in their short life spans because of their drive for success. When a silver dragon can combine its own long-term perspective with the ambition and drive of humans, the benefit is undeniable.\n\nMost silvers group together in \"clans,\" a loose organization of dragons who choose to live together as a family. Clans take communal responsibility for protecting and raising their wyrmlings. A senior member of the clan may act as a leader, but no true leader actually exists. Silver dragons do not feel the need for a strict social structure, since they are most content to live as honestly as possible. However, many silver dragons leave their clans for long periods of time to live among nondragons. They tend to live for many years with the same group of humans or elves, having grown attached to them. As members of the family die, the silver dragon, grieved by the loss, often chooses to stay with the family, remaining a true and loyal friend and champion through many generations. If the dragon feels comfortable enough around these nondragons, it might even decide to reveal its true self.\n\nA silver dragon's lair is typically found within an icy mountain, with the main entrance only accessible by air. The lair itself is similar to the gold dragon's in its sophistication and design, although the silver dragon's lair tends to be far less intricate. A typical lair will contain a main entertaining area, a storage room, a vault, a sleeping chamber, study, library, shrine, and two clinic rooms where the dragon can offer help and protection to those who need it. The lair will also have a concealed back entrance for use in emergencies.\n|{{Infobox fictional race\n| name                = Silver Dragon\n| first               = \n| based_on            = [[Dragon]]\n| type                = [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dragon]]\n| alignment           = Lawful Good\n}}\n|}\n\n====Rare types====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Description\n|-\n|Adamantine dragon\n|[[Adamant]]ine dragons are tacticians that supplement their melee abilities with blasts of thunderous power. They can be found anywhere, but prefer to lair in huge caverns.\n\nRegarding tactics, an adamantine dragon favors frontal assaults against a single target that it can take down quickly. When working with a group of allies, an adamantine dragon doesn't hesitate to bear the brunt of enemies' attacks. When fighting alone, an adamantine dragon attempts to isolate weaker foes first and finish them off quickly.\n|-\n|Cobalt dragon\n|Midnight blue dragons that could fire a breath weapon of pulsing, barely perceptible energy. These dragons, like the chromium dragons, were foul of temper but subservient to iron dragons and their lord.\n|-\n|Mercury dragon\n|Mercury dragons are fast, relatively small (by dragon standards) creatures with long tails. They are very whimsical and make and change decisions quite often. At birth, its scales are dull silver. As the dragon ages they become brighter, and at adulthood they take on a mirror finish.\nMercury dragons have one breath weapon, a line of superheated yellow light. Upon adulthood, however, they have a secondary attack of reflecting light at their opponent, changing it into a brilliant burst of dazzling brightness.\nIn combat, they are unpredictable except that they will never attack good-aligned creatures unless provoked. They always use spells in combat, finding new and creative ways to use them.\n|-\n|Mithral dragon\n|Mithral dragons are among the rarest and most potent of the dragons. They claim themselves as the pursuers of Io's final vision. Choosing to live in the Astral Sea amongst the gods and angels, these dragons nevertheless pursue agendas and plots that put them into contact with creatures of the mortal world. Mithrals seek to further their own plans at any cost, and woe to the lesser creature that tries to thwart them. These dragons have visions of other times and spaces. Being native to the Astral Sea, mithral dragons are immortal and will not die unless slain in battle.\n|-\n|Orium dragon\n|Orium dragons live in jungles and rainforests in the ruins of past civilizations. They command lesser beings to rebuild the glories of the past and obtain the long-forgotten magic of fallen empires. To those under its protection, the orium dragon treat them as a monarch, wise but harsh. Those who threaten the dragon and his dreams of rebuilding his empire find themselves choking on its corrosive breath. This same breath coalesces into a smoky serpent that attacks at the dragon's command.\n|-\n|Steel dragon\n|The steel dragon's body seems somewhat feline, but its face has a humanlike quality. Spines that vaguely resemble hair and a beard ring its head and its scales shine like burnished steel.\nSteel dragons prefer human form to their own, so they're rarely seen in their natural forms. They routinely use their special abilities to infiltrate human society, typically masquerading as sages, scholars, wizards, and other intellectuals. Endlessly curious about the art, culture, history, and politics of civilized races, steel dragons live among humans and similar beings. Though they keep their true nature secret from the people with whom they mingle, they can always recognize each other.\n\nWhen a steel dragon hatches, its scales are a deep blue-gray color with steely highlights. As it grows to adulthood, its color lightens to a lustrous burnished steel, and its shine increases as it continues to age. In human form, a steel dragon always has one steel-gray feature, such as hair, eyes, or nails. In rare cases, this feature may be a ring, tattoo, or other ornamentation. In its natural form, a steel dragon smells of wet steel.\n\nSince they prefer human form, steel dragons rarely live in caves. Instead, they choose human dwellings such as mansions or castles. Such a home need not be opulent, but it must be large enough to accommodate a strongroom that will hold all the dragon's treasure. Steel dragons also prefer to dine in human form, but since they need to eat much more than humans do to maintain their true body mass, they make monthly trips to hunt in dragon form. These absences are always explained away in terms consistent with the roles they take in human society. For example, a steel dragon in the guise of a historian might claim to be exploring records in another city's library.\n\nSteel dragons prefer treasure that they can carry in their human forms, such as jewelry, valuable coins, and magic items usable by medium-sized creatures. They hate creatures that disrupt normal life in cities or despoil natural hunting grounds. Within a city, they usually rely on local authorities to deal with troublemakers, though they are quite capable of dealing out their own justice when such authorities cannot be relied upon to do so. Steel dragons tend to prefer swifter forms of justice in the wilderness.\n|}\n\n=== Gem dragons ===\nGem dragons are typically of neutral alignment with respect to good and evil, but some kinds are quite egoistic and awful company nevertheless. The Gem dragon family comprise Amethyst Dragons, Crystal Dragons, Emerald Dragons, Sapphire Dragons, and Topaz Dragons.  [[Sardior]] is the deity of gem dragons. Although Obsidian Dragons are also technically gem dragons, they are opposed to Sardior and most other gem dragons.\n\nThe following is a list of the '''gem dragons''', a classification of [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragon]] found in the [[role playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. In this setting, gem dragons are typically of neutral alignment. [[Sardior]] is the deity of gem dragons.\n\n====Publication history====\nThe gem dragons (the amethyst dragon, the crystal dragon, the emerald dragon, the sapphire dragon and the topaz dragon) and [[Sardior]] the Ruby Dragon first appeared in the first edition in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #37 (May 1980).<ref>Arthur W. Collins, \"That's Not In the Monster Manual!\" ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #37 ([[TSR, Inc|TSR]], 1980)</ref>\n\nThe gem dragons appeared in the second edition in the ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix]]'' (1992),<ref>[[Skip Williams]] et al., ''[[Monstrous Compendium|Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix]]'' (TSR, 1992)</ref> and the ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' (1993).<ref>Doug Stewart, ed.

''Campaign Option: Council of Wyrms Setting'' ([[Wizards of the Coast]], 1999)</ref>\n\nThe gem dragons appeared in the third edition in ''[[Monster Manual II]]'' (2002).<ref>Ed Bonny, [[Jeff Grubb]], Rich Redman, [[Skip Williams]] and [[Steve Winter]], ''[[Monster Manual II]]''  (Wizards of the Coast, 2002)</ref>\n\n====Types====\n;Amethyst dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Line of force (prior to edition 3.5 an explosive lozenge)\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, underground\n* '''Alignment:''' Always neutral\n\nThe most powerful of the neutral gem dragons, amethyst dragons are honorable, regal creatures. They inhabit the mountains of the northern islands, living on the shores of isolated lakes and pools. At birth, these dragons have lavender skin with fine, translucent-purple scales. These scales darken as the creature grows older, eventually reaching a sparkling lavender color.\nThese creatures approach life with a detached air, ignoring the conflicts of good and evil, law and chaos. At best, they see these conflicts as petty squabbles over inconsequential points of view, and not worthy of their time or consideration. These majestic dragons consider themselves to be the leaders of the gem dragons, and most of the lesser gem dragons acquiesce to this leadership \u2013 in everyday life and in the Council Aerie.\n\nWhile amethyst dragons consider their silver and copper cousins to be foolish and have an active dislike of red and white dragons, they do not consider any life form to be their inherent enemies. They prefer to reason out a settlement through discussion and negotiation rather than through combat, but they can and will fight if they must. Being honourable and noble, these dragons never hide or attempt to ambush foes. To them, even retreating is a dishonourable action, but they will flee if faced with certain death.\nAmethyst dragons eat large quantities of fish and gems. They keep vassals to attend to their needs, though they do not place as many restrictions or requirements on them as other dragon lords do. Most keep at least one hidden, underwater cave for seclusion and secrecy.\nAmethyst dragons approach mating in a very logical manner, seeking the optimum partner to produce the best offspring. Love and pleasure rarely, if ever, enter the equation.\n\n;Crystal dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Line of blinding light\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, temperate and cold mountains\n* '''Alignment:''' Always chaotic neutral\n\nThe friendly crystal dragons of Io's Blood's northern isles spend much time trying to learn about world around them. They value friendship over all else and the treasures tend to be sentimental rather than valuable, they welcome visitors who come to them with good intentions.\n\nHatchlings have glossy white scales that become more and more translucent with age. By the time they reach adulthood, these scales become luminescent in moonlight. In the full light of the day they glow with a dazzling, almost unbearable brilliance.\n\nFun-loving and mischievous, crystal dragons tend to be irresponsible rulers. For the daily running of their domains, these dragons rely on their vassals to keep things going. They establish domains in the cold, open northern reaches, building castles out of snow and ice. They leave these castles open to the sky, for they love to watch the stars on clear, cold nights. The white dragon clans consider crystal dragons to be nothing more than prey, so the two types are almost always in conflict. The crystal dragons also have little love for the tribes of giants that live beyond the Ice Sea and often come south to enslave the small, relatively weak gem dragons.\n\nLike other benevolent dragons, the crystal dragons prefer to talk rather than fight. Even without special abilities, they can be charming and engaging to an extreme. Gems and metal ores are their foods of choice.\nThey mate with willing partners whenever they want, as desire and need move them. It has also been known for crystal dragons to adopt white dragon hatchlings.\n\n;Emerald dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Powerful burst of wind.\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, underground (prefers inactive or extinct volcanoes)\n* '''Alignment:''' Always lawful neutral\n\nEmerald dragons live among the tropical islands in the Io's Blood chain's southern waters. They are a curious species, taken to keeping track of history, lore and customs. They tend to be very reclusive, suspicious that others covet their treasure hoards and territory.\n\nHatchlings have translucent green scales, which harden and take on many shades of green as they age. These scales are scintillating in the light, giving an emerald dragon's hide the appearance of being in constant motion.\n\nA desire for privacy runs through the emerald clans, going so far as to determine where the dragon lords and their spawn establish lairs. In the southern islands, emerald dragons built their domains around the inactive volcano range that stretches across the tropical isles. Only their most trusted vassals are permitted to serve them within the main lairs. The others tend to duties throughout the rest of the domain.\n\nThe primary lairs consist of traps and alarms designed to warn the dragon of visitor and other threats. Emerald dragons prefer to quietly observe intruders and rarely emerge from hiding. If parlay is called for, they send their kindred or chief vassals to handle such duties while they watch, hidden, from cover. When forced into combat, emerald dragons prefer to attack by ambush, using stealth and surprise attacks to quickly disable their enemies. If the threat prove to be too great to handle, an emerald dragon will not hesitate to retreat. However, it will plan revenge, and its patience can last for centuries if need be.\n\nEmerald dragons have no compunctions about what they eat. They prefer lizards and giants, but they will eat anything in a pinch. Of all the other type of dragonkind, emerald dragons get along best with the sapphire dragons, often controlling parallel domains (emerald dragons taking the surface, sapphire dragon the subterranean areas below). They fear the red dragon clans because of their well-known greed, and they are usually in open conflict with the fire giants from beyond the Burning Sea. Emeralds like the security and protection offered by a trusted partner and will take a single mate for a long time.\n\n;Sapphire dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Cone of panicking sound\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, underground\n* '''Alignment:''' Always lawful neutral\n\nThe sapphire dragons of the Io's Blood Isles control subterranean domains beneath two of the larger southern islands. While most of the territory above their realms belongs to the emerald dragons, they keep a small portion of the surface area as their own as well as the extensive caverns beneath the tropical jungles.\n\nFrom birth, sapphire dragons are beautiful, with scale ranging from light to dark blue in color, which sparkle in the light. Because of their coloration, they are sometimes mistaken for blue dragons.\n\nOf all dragonkind, perhaps the sapphire dragon clans are the most militaristic. They fervently protect their territory from outsiders, going so far as to distrust anyone who even gets close to their borders. They work to keep their vassals in peak fighting condition, maintaining some of the best-trained armies in the isles. As most of the territory that interests the sapphire clans is below the ground, they rarely come into conflict with other dragon clans unless they attempt to take caverns currently in use. Only the black dragons compete with them for the tropical underground, and even they are wary of going into direct conflict with the armies of the sapphire clans.\n\nMost of the demihuman vassals serving the sapphire dragons are either dwarves or gnomes, as these races have no problems living and working beneath the ground. Also, elves are too much like drow, whom these dragons consider to be one of their natural enemies. Dwarven vassals are treated little better than slaves, as the two species were once at war, and they are almost never granted the kindred bond. This honour is usually reserved for gnome only.\n\nGiant spiders make up most of a sapphire dragon's diet, and great hunts are conducted in the tunnels to find these delicacies. When a dragon lord feeling particularly lazy, it will send its dwarven vassals into the tunnels in search of the spiders. Of course, they must capture the spiders alive.\n\nWhile militaristic and warlike, the sapphire dragons are not quick to attack. They prefer to observe intruders (all visitors are intruders) so that they can plan how to deal with them. If drow or dwarves from another clan approach, they are immediately attacked. Others can often at least make some gesture of friendship or parlay before being told to leave. If a sapphire dragon or its treasure is ever threatened, it attacks immediately with its breath weapon, spells, and physical attacks. It uses psionics and special abilities to escape if faced with a more powerful foe. Sapphire dragons take a single mate for long periods of time, however sapphires seek to possess a mate to enhance their prestige and status more than other reasons\n\n;Topaz dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Cone of dehydration\n* '''Terrain:''' Inner Planes, any aquatic\n* '''Alignment:''' Always chaotic neutral\n\nTopaz dragons inhabit the coastal regions of the temperate islands, building lairs below the waterline, though constructing them so they remain dry. Clannish and self-seeking, these gem dragons usually want little to do with the other inhabitants of the isles. They keep vassals to fill their domain and make them appear as prosperous as their neighbors, and they participate in the Council activities on occasion, but for the most part these dragons neither seek company nor welcome it.\n\nOut of the egg, a topaz dragon is a dull yellow-orange in color. With the age, its scales harden and become translucent and faceted. When it reaches adulthood, a topaz dragon sparkles in the light of the sun.\n\nWhile topaz dragons enjoy the feel of sea wind and spray on their faceted-scale hides, they do not particularly like the water. They swim to hunt, attack, or reach their lairs, but not for enjoyment. They do love to eat fish and other sea creatures, especially the tasty giant squids that live in the Coral Sea.\n\nWhile not malicious, topaz dragons are not the best of company or particularly pleasant to deal with. Besides caring little for social graces, they display erratic behavior that is unsettling and very confusing. They dislike visitors, but tend to avoid combat if they can help it. If combat is unavoidable, they use tricks and promises to distract their foes before striking with teeth and claws (which they enjoy using).\n\nUnless it specifically interests or affect them, topaz dragons tend to be indifferent to the causes and concerns that occupy the rest of dragonkind. They dislike bronze dragons and usually oppose the interests of those clans.\n\nIt takes time for a topaz dragon to accept another dragon's friendship, but once it does it remains a friend for life. Once another dragon gets past its outer defenses and gruff exterior, it finds a loyal companion and ready protector in the topaz dragon.\n\n====Other gem dragons====\n;Obsidian dragon\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Cone of fire\n* '''Terrain:''' Warm mountains and underground, demiplanes\n* '''Alignment:''' Always neutral\n\nObsidian dragons, while the most intelligent of the gem dragons, are also the most vicious. They are extremely haughty, anger easily, and like to toy with prey before finishing it off.\n\nAn obsidian dragon has smooth black skin with razor edges where joints come together. When first hatched, their scales are gray, rough to touch, and well defined. As they get older, the scales darken, become smoother, and begin to blend together.\n\nMost obsidian dragons prefer to make their lairs around volcanoes or in one of the mountains of coal found on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Most great wyrms, though, make use of the genesis power to create their own demiplane.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Scott Brocius|author2=Mark Jindra|title=Obsidian Dragon|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psb/20030124b|website=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213210236/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd%2Fpsb%2F20030124b|archivedate=February 13, 2014|access-date=December 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Catastrophic dragons ===\nCatastrophic dragons are typically of neutral alignment. They are Avalanche Dragon, the Blizzard Dragon, the Earthquake dragon, the Tornado Dragon, the Typhoon Dragon, Volcanic Dragon, and the Wildfire Dragon.  Catastrophic dragons pay their homage to the Primordials as opposed to any other dragon deity.  After the defeat of Io, there was a group of dragons that defected to the side of Primordials. The Primordials transformed these dragons into beings imbued with the elemental chaos.  Metallic and Chromatic Dragons view Catastrophic dragons as aberrations.<ref name=\"Monster Manual 3\">{{cite book |last1=Mearls |first1=Mike |authorlink1=Mike Mearls |last2=Bilsland |first2=Greg |last3=Schwalb |first3=Robert J. |authorlink3=Robert J.

They are the Iron Dragon, the Nickel Dragon, the Tungsten Dragon, the Cobalt Dragon, and the Chromium Dragon. They originated in Dragon Magazine. All Ferrous dragons can sense ordinary metals and the lawful ferrous dragons have a strict hierarchy, with the higher dragons dictating the laws to the lower ones. The hierarchy, from highest to lowest, is iron, chromium, cobalt, tungsten, and nickel. Gruaghlothor is the supreme ruler of the ferrous dragons.\n\n====Chromium Dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Line of solid ice (cold damage) and cone of freezing crystals (Dexterity damage)\n* '''Terrain:''' Subterranean or mountainous arctic climes\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Evil\n* '''Appears in:''' ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] #356''\nShining, dull silver dragons that did not seem to match up in description to silver, steel, or mithril dragons were mentioned.

This form of dragon has metallic scales that are a dull green with grey.\n\n=== Planar dragons ===\n{{See also|Fiendish dragon}}\nPlanar dragons inhabit the [[Outer Plane|outer planes]].\n\n====Shadow dragon====\n\n{{Main|Shadow dragon}}\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Energy-draining shadows\n* '''Terrain:''' Underground, Shadow Material Plane\n* '''Alignment:''' Always Chaotic evil\n* '''Appears in:''' ''AD&D 1st Edition'' ''[[Monster Manual II]]'' (1983) and reprinted on several other occasions, including: ''AD&D'' 2nd Edition adventure ''[[Night Below]]''; computer game ''[[Baldur's Gate II]]''. A shadow dragon called Shimmergloom is the ruler of a clan of Duergar in the second book of the Icewind Dale Trilogy, ''Streams of Silver''; Erevis Cale and his companions encounter a shadow dragon named Furlinastis on several occasions in the Twilight war trilogy. Also appeared in the ''D&D'' 5th Edition ''[[Monster Manual]]''.\n\n====Adamantite dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' White-hot fire, Hold monster gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Twin Paradises of [[Bytopia]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Good\n* '''Notes:''' Oversized natural weapons, Can destroy Adamantium fortresses. Also, they look like they are made of jet-black metal.\n\nAdamantite dragons are perhaps the mightiest of dragonkind. They are the epitome of good, sacrificing whatever is necessary for the common good of intelligent creatures everywhere. These other-planar creatures are strange among dragonkind, since they are born with their shining coats of adamantite fully developed (explaining their very high armor class even when hatchlings). This mighty coat is a shining silver color that reflects light in brilliant, scintillating beams and rainbows-refreshing to those who can bask in its goodness, painful to those who hide in the shadows of evil.\n\nAdamantite dragons speak their own tongue and the language of all good dragons. By their juvenile years (age category 4), they will speak common. By the time they are adults (age, category 6), they are 50% likely to speak any language of dragonkind.\n\n'''Combat:''' Due to the adamantite dragons strong taste for physical battle, they may use the extra attack forms of dragons (wing buffet, foot stomp, etc.) one age category earlier than other dragons.\n\nBreath weapon/special abilities: An adamantite dragon has two breath weapons, one of which can only be used at certain times. The common form of breath weapon is a cone of flame 110' long, 10'wide at the dragon's mouth, and 45'wide at the end- This is a magical flame and will ignite even nonflammable materials.\n\nThe adamantite dragon's second breath weapon projects an area of time stop. It has the same dimensions as the cone of flame. Anyone caught in the area must save vs., spells or be affected as if by a time stop spell cast at 20th level of magic use - This breath weapon may only be used on the dragon's home plane (Twin Paradises), when the dragons are defending the plane, and even then only one time per day.\n\nAdamantite dragons may use the following spell-like abilities: \n* polymorph self, 3 times per day, permanent, may revert to dragon form without restriction \n* magic missile, (adults and older), five missiles per round \n* blink, (mature adults and older)\n\nDue to their extra-planar nature, all adamantite dragons are immune to non-magical weapons.\n\n'''Habitat/Society:''' The adamantite dragons are the self-appointed guardians of the Twin Paradises. These great creatures are extremely powerful and will come to the aid of any intelligent creature. They are unconcerned with law or chaos, but only the protection of sentient lifeforms.\n\nEcology: Adamantite dragons have little place in the ecosystem of the Twin Paradises, They can, however, be avaricious hunters with huge appetites. Adamantite dragons have no moral objection to hunting unintelligent life forms.\n\n====Arboreal dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Razor-sharp thorns\n* '''Terrain:''' Olympian Glades of [[Arborea (Dungeons & Dragons)|Arborea]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Good\n\n====Astral dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Dismissal effect, scouring dust\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Astral Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|Astral Plane]]\n* '''Alignment:''' True Neutral\n\n====Axial dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Force\n* '''Terrain:''' Clockwork Nirvana of [[Mechanus]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Neutral\n* '''Notes:''' Immune to a vast number of things, including acid, fire, cold, poison, and nonlethal damage.\n\n====Battle dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Sonic energy, Fear gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Heroic Domains of [[Ysgard]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Good\n\n====Beast dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Lightning\n* '''Terrain:''' Wilderness of the [[Beastlands]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Good or Neutral Good\n\n====Chaos dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Random elemental blast (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sound, etc.), Confusion gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Ever-Changing Chaos of [[Limbo (Dungeons & Dragons)|Limbo]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Any Chaotic\n\n====Chole dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Poisonous insanity vapors\n* '''Terrain:''' Infinite Layers of the [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|Abyss]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Evil\n\n====Concordant dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Antithetical energy\n* '''Terrain:''' Concordant Domain of the [[Outlands (Dungeons & Dragons)|Outlands]]\n* '''Alignment:''' True Neutral\n\n====Ectoplasmic dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Whitefire, sticky ectoplasm.\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Astral Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|Astral Plane]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Neutral\n\n====Elysian dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Sonic energy, inebriation gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Blessed Fields of [[Elysium (Dungeons & Dragons)|Elysium]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Good\n\n====Ethereal dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Force\n* '''Terrain:''' Ethereal Plane\n* '''Alignment:''' True Neutral\n\n====Gloom dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Apathy gas\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Gray Waste|Gray Waste of Hades]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Evil\n\n====Howling dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Howling sound, Maddening wails\n* '''Terrain:''' Windswept Depths of [[Pandemonium (Dungeons & Dragons)|Pandemonium]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic Evil or Chaotic Neutral\n\n====Kodragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Shrinking, reverse shrinking\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Astral Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|Astral Plane]]\n\n====Oceanus dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Lightning, Tranquility gas\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Outer planes#Standard D&D cosmology|Upper Planes]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Good\n\n====Pyroclastic dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' cone of superheated ash accompanied by waves of crushing sonic force, Disintegrating line\n* '''Terrain:''' Bleak Eternity of [[Gehenna (Dungeons & Dragons)|Gehenna]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Evil or Neutral Evil\n\n====Radiant dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Force, Light\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Mount Celestia|Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Good\n\n====Rust dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Acid, rusting liquid\n* '''Terrain:''' Infernal Battlefield of [[Acheron (Dungeons & Dragons)|Acheron]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Lawful Neutral or Lawful Evil\n\n====Styx dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Acid, stupefying gas\n* '''Terrain:''' [[Outer planes#Standard D&D cosmology|Lower Planes]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Evil\n\n====Tarterian dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Line of disruptive force, cone of will-sapping gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Tarterian Depths of [[Carceri (Dungeons & Dragons)|Carceri]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral Evil or Chaotic Evil\n* '''Current Source:''' (3.5) Draconomicon 189\n\n====Hellfire Wyrm====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Cone of Infernal Flame\n* '''Terrain:''' The Nine Hells of [[Baator]]\n* '''Alignment:''' Always Lawful Evil\n* '''Current Source:''' (3.5) Monster Manual II 125\n\n=== Faer\u00fbnian dragons ===\n\n====Brown dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Sludge\n* '''Terrain:''' Bogs\n* '''Alignment:''' Neutral\n* '''Appears in:''' ''Monsters of Faer\u00fbn''\n\n====Deep dragon====\n\n* '''Breath weapon:''' Flesh-corrosive gas\n* '''Terrain:''' Underground - Underdark\n* '''Alignment:''' Chaotic evil\n* '''Appears in:''' ''Monsters of Faer\u00fbn'' and reprinted in ''[[Fantastic Locations: Fane of the Drow|Fane of the Drow]]'' as well as the ''Legacy of the Drow'' series.

It has been suggested that the enigmatic African fossil bird ''[[Eremopezus]]'' was a relative too, but the evidence for that is unconfirmed.

The [[Culmen (bird)|exposed culmen]] (or the measurement along the top of the upper mandible) is {{convert|18.8|to|24|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the third longest bill among extant birds after  [[pelican]]s and large [[stork]]s, and can outrival the pelicans in bill circumference, especially if the bill is considered as the hard, bony keratin portion.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> As in the [[pelican]]s, the upper mandible is strongly keeled, ending in a sharp nail. The dark coloured legs are fairly long, with a [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] length of {{convert|21.7|to|25.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The shoebill's feet are exceptionally large, with the middle toe reaching {{convert|16.8|to|18.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, likely assisting the species in its ability to stand on aquatic vegetation while hunting. The neck is relatively shorter and thicker than other long-legged wading birds such as [[heron]]s and [[crane (bird)|crane]]s. The wings are broad, with a [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord]] length of {{convert|58.8|to|78|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and well-adapted to [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]].\n\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - ZMA.AVES.26542 - Balaeniceps rex Gould, 1850 - Balaenicipitidae - skeleton (whole) specimen.jpeg|thumb|right|The skull]]\nThe plumage of adult birds is blue-grey with darker [[slaty]]-grey [[flight feather]]s. The breast presents some elongated feathers, which have dark shafts. The juvenile has a similar plumage colour, but is a darker grey with a brown tinge.<ref name=\"HBW1\"/> When they are first born, shoebills have a more modestly-sized bill, which is initially silvery-grey. The bill becomes more noticeably large when the chicks are 23 days old and becomes well developed by 43 days.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n===Flight pattern===\nIts wings are held flat while soaring and, as in the pelicans and the storks of the genus ''[[Leptoptilos]]'', the shoebill flies with its neck retracted. Its flapping rate, at an estimated 150 flaps per minute, is one of the slowest of any bird, with the exception of the larger [[stork]] species. The pattern is alternating flapping and gliding cycles of approximately seven seconds each, putting its gliding distance somewhere between the larger storks and the [[Andean condor]] (''Vultur gryphus''). When flushed, shoebills usually try to fly no more than {{convert|100|to|500|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Long flights of the shoebill are rare, and only a few flights beyond its minimum foraging distance of {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} have been recorded.\n\n===Identification===\nAt close range, it can be easily identified by its unique features. In flight, if its unique bill cannot be seen, the shoebill's silhouette resembles that of a stork or condor, but its feathers are a distinctive medium blue-grey. Also unusual, its tail is the same colour as its wings. Under poor viewing conditions, its size and wingspan can distinguish it from other birds in its habitat. Its legs, roughly the length of storks', extend straight back far past its tail when in flight. The wing to tail size cannot be used for identification; it is similar to those of several other birds.\n\n[[File:Shoebill-uenozoo2008.ogv|thumb|A shoebill at the [[Ueno Zoo]], [[Tokyo]], (video)]]\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe shoebill is distributed in freshwater swamps of central tropical Africa, from southern [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]] through parts of eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], western [[Tanzania]] and northern [[Zambia]]. The species is most numerous in the [[West Nile sub-region]] and South Sudan (especially the [[Sudd]], a main stronghold for the species); it is also significant in wetlands of Uganda and western Tanzania. More isolated records have been reported of shoebills in [[Kenya]], the [[Central African Republic]], northern [[Cameroon]], south-western [[Ethiopia]], [[Malawi]]. Vagrant strays to the [[Okavango Basin]], [[Botswana]] and the upper [[Congo River]] have also been sighted. The distribution of this species seems to largely coincide with that of [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] and [[Protopterus|lungfish]]. They are often found in areas of flood plain interspersed with undisturbed papyrus and reedbeds. When shoebill storks are in an area with deep water, a bed of floating vegetation is a requirement. They are also found where there is poorly oxygenated water. This causes the fish living in the water to surface for air more often, increasing the likelihood a shoebill stork will successfully capture it. <ref> \"Balaeniceps rex (shoebill)\". Animal Diversity Web. Retrieved 2020-03-02.</ref>The shoebill is non-migratory with limited seasonal movements due to habitat changes, food availability and disturbance by humans.<ref name=\"Hancock\">Hancock & Kushan, ''Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills of the World''. Princeton University Press (1992), {{ISBN|978-0-12-322730-0}}.</ref>\n\n[[Petroglyph]]s from [[Oued Djerat]], eastern [[Algeria]], show that the shoebill occurred during the [[Holocene|Early Holocene]] much more to the north, in the wetlands that covered the present-day [[Sahara]] [[Desert]] at that time.<ref name=\"oeschger2004\">{{cite journal |author=Oeschger, E. |year=2004 |title=Sahara - Algeria - Rock Art in Oued Derat and the Tefedest Region |language=English |journal=Adoranten |volume=2004 |pages=5\u201319 |url=http://www.rockartscandinavia.com/images/articles/a04oeschger.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe shoebill occurs in extensive, dense freshwater [[marshes]]. Almost all wetlands that attract the species have undisturbed ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' and [[reed bed]]s of ''[[Phragmites]]'' and ''[[Typha]]''. Although their distribution largely seems to correspond with the distribution of papyrus in central Africa, the species seems to avoid pure papyrus swamps and is often attracted to areas with mixed vegetation. More rarely, the species has been seen foraging in [[Paddy field|rice fields]] and flooded [[plantation]]s.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nThe shoebill is noted for its slow movements and tendency to stay still for long periods, resulting in descriptions of the species as \"statue-like\". They are quite sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon their nests if flushed by humans. However, while foraging, if dense vegetation stands between it and humans, this wader can be fairly tame. The shoebill is attracted to poorly oxygenated waters where fish frequently surface to breathe. Exceptionally for a bird this large, the shoebill often stands and perches on floating vegetation, making them appear somewhat like a giant [[Jacana (genus)|jacana]], although the similarly sized and occasionally sympatric [[Goliath heron]] (''Ardea goliath'') is also known to stand on aquatic vegetation. Shoebills typically feed in muddy waters and, being solitary, forage at {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more from one another even where relatively densely populated. This species stalks its prey patiently, in a slow and lurking fashion. While hunting, the shoebill strides very slowly and is frequently motionless. Unlike some other large waders, this species hunts entirely using vision and is not known to engage in [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] hunting. When prey is spotted, it launches a quick violent strike. However, depending on the size of the prey, handling time after the strike can exceed 10 minutes. Around 60% of strikes yield prey. Frequently water and vegetation is snatched up during the strike and is spilled out from the edges of the mandibles. The activity of [[hippopotamus]] may inadvertently benefit the shoebill, as submerged hippos occasionally force fish to the surface.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n[[File:Balaeniceps rex -Ueno Zoo, Tokyo, Japan-8a.jpg|thumb|right|A shoebill standing at [[Ueno Zoo]], [[Tokyo]]]]\nShoebills are largely [[piscivorous]] but are assured predators of a considerable range of wetland vertebrates. Preferred prey species have reportedly included [[marbled lungfish]] (''Protopterus aethiopicus'') and [[Polypterus senegalus|Senegal bichir]] (''Polypterus senegalus'') and various ''[[Tilapia (genus)|Tilapia]]'' species and [[catfish]], the latter mainly in the genus ''[[Clarias]]''. Other prey eaten by this species has included [[frog]]s, water [[snake]]s, [[Nile monitor]]s (''Varanus niloticus'') and baby [[crocodile]]s. More rarely, [[turtle]]s, [[snail]]s, [[rodent]]s and small [[waterfowl]] have reportedly been eaten. There is a single unconfirmed report of shoebills feeding on [[lechwe]] (''Kobus leche'') calves. Given its sharp-edged beak, huge bill and wide gape, the shoebill can hunt large prey, often targeting prey bigger than is taken by other large wading birds. Fish eaten by this species are commonly in the range of {{convert|15|to|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and weigh around {{convert|500|g|lb|abbr=on}}, though lungfish of as much as {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} have been attacked. Snakes preyed upon are commonly from {{convert|50|to|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. In the [[Bangweulu Swamps]] of [[Zambia]], the main prey items fed to young by the parents were the catfish ''[[Clarias gariepinus]]'' <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tomita|first1=Julie|title=Challenges and successes in the propagation of the Shoebill Balaeniceps rex: with detailed observations from Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo, Florida|journal=International Zoo Yearbook|volume=48|issue=1|pages=69\u201382|doi=10.1111/izy.12038|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1748-1090|year=2014}}</ref> ([[syn.]] ''C. mossambicus'') and water snakes. In [[Uganda]], lungfish and catfish were mainly fed to the young.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The big beak is sometimes used to dig into pond-bottom mud to extract [[lungfish]] from their [[aestivation]] burrows.\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Balaeniceps rex in Prague Zoo 03.JPG|thumb|left|A sitting shoebill in [[Prague Zoo]], Czech Republic]]\n\nThe solitary nature of shoebills extends to their breeding habits. Nests typically occur at less than three nests per square kilometre, unlike [[heron]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[pelican]]s and [[stork]]s which predominantly nest in colonies. The breeding pair of shoebills vigorously defends a territory of {{convert|2|to|4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} from [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]]. In the extreme north and south of the species' range, nesting starts right after the rains end. In more central regions of the range, it may nest near end of wet season in order to hatch around the beginning of the following wet season. Both parents engage in building the nest on floating platform, after clearing out an area of approximately {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} across. The large, flattish nesting platform is often partially submerged in water and can be as much as {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. The nest itself is about {{convert|1|to|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. Both the nest and platform are made of aquatic vegetation. In Sudan, the nests apparently were able to support the weight of an adult man, although this was not the case in Zambia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} From one to three white eggs are laid. These eggs measure {{convert|80|to|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|56|to|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} and weigh around {{convert|164|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Incubation lasts for approximately 30 days. Both parents actively brood, shade, guard and feed the nestling, though the females are perhaps slightly more attentive. Food items are regurgitated whole from the gullet straight into the bill of the young. Shoebills rarely raise more than one chick, but will hatch more. The younger chicks eventually die and are intended as \"back-ups\" in case the eldest chick dies or is weak. Fledging is reached at around 105 days and the young birds can fly well by 112 days. However, they are still fed for possibly a month or more after this. It will take the young shoebills three years before they become fully sexually mature.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n===Voice===\nThe shoebill is normally silent, but they perform bill-clattering displays at the nest.<ref name=\"HBW1\"/> When engaging in these displays, adult birds have also been noted to utter a [[Cattle|cow]]-like ''moo'' as well as high-pitched whines. Both nestlings and adults engage in bill-clattering during the nesting season as a means of communication. When young are begging for food, they call out with a sound uncannily like human hiccups. In one case, a flying adult bird was heard uttering hoarse croaks, apparently as a sign of aggression at a nearby [[marabou stork]] (''Leptoptilos crumeniferus'').<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n==Status and conservation==\nThe population is estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 individuals, the majority of which live in swamps in South Sudan, Uganda, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Gield Guide to the Birds of East Africa |first1=J.G |last1=Williams |first2=N |last2=Arlott |publisher=Collins |isbn=978-0-00-219179-1 |year=1980 |url=https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetobird00will }}</ref> There is also a viable population in the Malagarasi wetlands in Tanzania.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=John|first1=Jasson|last2=Nahonyo|first2=Cuthbert|last3=Lee|first3=Woo|last4=Msuya|first4=Charles|title=Observations on nesting of shoebill Balaeniceps rex and wattled crane Bugeranus carunculatus in Malagarasi wetlands, western Tanzania|journal=African Journal of Ecology|date=March 2013|volume=51|issue=1|pages=184\u2013187|doi=10.1111/aje.12023}}</ref> [[BirdLife International]] has classified it as [[vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] with the main threats being [[habitat destruction]], disturbance and hunting.

It has been suggested that the enigmatic African fossil bird ''[[Eremopezus]]'' was a relative too, but the evidence for that is unconfirmed. All that is known of ''Eremopezus'' is that it was a very large, probably flightless bird with a flexible foot, allowing it to handle either vegetation or prey.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Balaeniceps rex -Ueno Zoo, Tokyo, Japan -upper body-8a.jpg|left|thumb|The shoebill's conspicuous bill is its most well-known feature.]]\nThe shoebill is a tall bird, with a typical height range of {{convert|110|to|140|cm|in|abbr=on}} and some specimens reaching as much as {{convert|152|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Length from tail to beak can range from {{convert|100|to|140|cm|in|abbr=on}} and wingspan is {{convert|230|to|260|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}}.

The [[Culmen (bird)|exposed culmen]] (or the measurement along the top of the upper mandible) is {{convert|18.8|to|24|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the third longest bill among extant birds after  [[pelican]]s and large [[stork]]s, and can outrival the pelicans in bill circumference, especially if the bill is considered as the hard, bony keratin portion.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> As in the [[pelican]]s, the upper mandible is strongly keeled, ending in a sharp nail. The dark coloured legs are fairly long, with a [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] length of {{convert|21.7|to|25.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The shoebill's feet are exceptionally large, with the middle toe reaching {{convert|16.8|to|18.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, likely assisting the species in its ability to stand on aquatic vegetation while hunting. The neck is relatively shorter and thicker than other long-legged wading birds such as [[heron]]s and [[crane (bird)|crane]]s. The wings are broad, with a [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord]] length of {{convert|58.8|to|78|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and well-adapted to [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]].\n\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - ZMA.AVES.26542 - Balaeniceps rex Gould, 1850 - Balaenicipitidae - skeleton (whole) specimen.jpeg|thumb|right|The skull]]\nThe plumage of adult birds is blue-grey with darker [[slaty]]-grey [[flight feather]]s. The breast presents some elongated feathers, which have dark shafts. The juvenile has a similar plumage colour, but is a darker grey with a brown tinge.<ref name=\"HBW1\"/> When they are first born, shoebills have a more modestly-sized bill, which is initially silvery-grey. The bill becomes more noticeably large when the chicks are 23 days old and becomes well developed by 43 days.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n===Flight pattern===\nIts wings are held flat while soaring and, as in the pelicans and the storks of the genus ''[[Leptoptilos]]'', the shoebill flies with its neck retracted. Its flapping rate, at an estimated 150 flaps per minute, is one of the slowest of any bird, with the exception of the larger [[stork]] species. The pattern is alternating flapping and gliding cycles of approximately seven seconds each, putting its gliding distance somewhere between the larger storks and the [[Andean condor]] (''Vultur gryphus''). When flushed, shoebills usually try to fly no more than {{convert|100|to|500|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> Long flights of the shoebill are rare, and only a few flights beyond its minimum foraging distance of {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} have been recorded.\n\n===Identification===\nAt close range, it can be easily identified by its unique features. In flight, if its unique bill cannot be seen, the shoebill's silhouette resembles that of a stork or condor, but its feathers are a distinctive medium blue-grey. Also unusual, its tail is the same colour as its wings. Under poor viewing conditions, its size and wingspan can distinguish it from other birds in its habitat. Its legs, roughly the length of storks', extend straight back far past its tail when in flight. The wing to tail size cannot be used for identification; it is similar to those of several other birds.\n\n[[File:Shoebill-uenozoo2008.ogv|thumb|A shoebill at the [[Ueno Zoo]], [[Tokyo]], (video)]]\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe shoebill is distributed in freshwater swamps of central tropical Africa, from southern [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]] through parts of eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], western [[Tanzania]] and northern [[Zambia]]. The species is most numerous in the [[West Nile sub-region]] and South Sudan (especially the [[Sudd]], a main stronghold for the species); it is also significant in wetlands of Uganda and western Tanzania. More isolated records have been reported of shoebills in [[Kenya]], the [[Central African Republic]], northern [[Cameroon]], south-western [[Ethiopia]], [[Malawi]]. Vagrant strays to the [[Okavango Basin]], [[Botswana]] and the upper [[Congo River]] have also been sighted. The distribution of this species seems to largely coincide with that of [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] and [[Protopterus|lungfish]]. They are often found in areas of flood plain interspersed with undisturbed papyrus and reedbeds. When shoebill storks are in an area with deep water, a bed of floating vegetation is a requirement. They are also found where there is poorly oxygenated water. This causes the fish living in the water to surface for air more often, increasing the likelihood a shoebill stork will successfully capture it. <ref> \"Balaeniceps rex (shoebill)\". Animal Diversity Web. Retrieved 2020-03-02.</ref>The shoebill is non-migratory with limited seasonal movements due to habitat changes, food availability and disturbance by humans.<ref name=\"Hancock\">Hancock & Kushan, ''Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills of the World''. Princeton University Press (1992), {{ISBN|978-0-12-322730-0}}.</ref>\n\n[[Petroglyph]]s from [[Oued Djerat]], eastern [[Algeria]], show that the shoebill occurred during the [[Holocene|Early Holocene]] much more to the north, in the wetlands that covered the present-day [[Sahara]] [[Desert]] at that time.<ref name=\"oeschger2004\">{{cite journal |author=Oeschger, E. |year=2004 |title=Sahara - Algeria - Rock Art in Oued Derat and the Tefedest Region |language=English |journal=Adoranten |volume=2004 |pages=5\u201319 |url=http://www.rockartscandinavia.com/images/articles/a04oeschger.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe shoebill occurs in extensive, dense freshwater [[marshes]]. Almost all wetlands that attract the species have undisturbed ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' and [[reed bed]]s of ''[[Phragmites]]'' and ''[[Typha]]''. Although their distribution largely seems to correspond with the distribution of papyrus in central Africa, the species seems to avoid pure papyrus swamps and is often attracted to areas with mixed vegetation. More rarely, the species has been seen foraging in [[Paddy field|rice fields]] and flooded [[plantation]]s.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nThe shoebill is noted for its slow movements and tendency to stay still for long periods, resulting in descriptions of the species as \"statue-like\". They are quite sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon their nests if flushed by humans. However, while foraging, if dense vegetation stands between it and humans, this wader can be fairly tame. The shoebill is attracted to poorly oxygenated waters where fish frequently surface to breathe. Exceptionally for a bird this large, the shoebill often stands and perches on floating vegetation, making them appear somewhat like a giant [[Jacana (genus)|jacana]], although the similarly sized and occasionally sympatric [[Goliath heron]] (''Ardea goliath'') is also known to stand on aquatic vegetation. Shoebills typically feed in muddy waters and, being solitary, forage at {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more from one another even where relatively densely populated. This species stalks its prey patiently, in a slow and lurking fashion. While hunting, the shoebill strides very slowly and is frequently motionless. Unlike some other large waders, this species hunts entirely using vision and is not known to engage in [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] hunting. When prey is spotted, it launches a quick violent strike. However, depending on the size of the prey, handling time after the strike can exceed 10 minutes. Around 60% of strikes yield prey. Frequently water and vegetation is snatched up during the strike and is spilled out from the edges of the mandibles. The activity of [[hippopotamus]] may inadvertently benefit the shoebill, as submerged hippos occasionally force fish to the surface.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n[[File:Balaeniceps rex -Ueno Zoo, Tokyo, Japan-8a.jpg|thumb|right|A shoebill standing at [[Ueno Zoo]], [[Tokyo]]]]\nShoebills are largely [[piscivorous]] but are assured predators of a considerable range of wetland vertebrates. Preferred prey species have reportedly included [[marbled lungfish]] (''Protopterus aethiopicus'') and [[Polypterus senegalus|Senegal bichir]] (''Polypterus senegalus'') and various ''[[Tilapia (genus)|Tilapia]]'' species and [[catfish]], the latter mainly in the genus ''[[Clarias]]''. Other prey eaten by this species has included [[frog]]s, water [[snake]]s, [[Nile monitor]]s (''Varanus niloticus'') and baby [[crocodile]]s. More rarely, [[turtle]]s, [[snail]]s, [[rodent]]s and small [[waterfowl]] have reportedly been eaten. There is a single unconfirmed report of shoebills feeding on [[lechwe]] (''Kobus leche'') calves. Given its sharp-edged beak, huge bill and wide gape, the shoebill can hunt large prey, often targeting prey bigger than is taken by other large wading birds. Fish eaten by this species are commonly in the range of {{convert|15|to|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and weigh around {{convert|500|g|lb|abbr=on}}, though lungfish of as much as {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} have been attacked. Snakes preyed upon are commonly from {{convert|50|to|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. In the [[Bangweulu Swamps]] of [[Zambia]], the main prey items fed to young by the parents were the catfish ''[[Clarias gariepinus]]'' <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tomita|first1=Julie|title=Challenges and successes in the propagation of the Shoebill Balaeniceps rex: with detailed observations from Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo, Florida|journal=International Zoo Yearbook|volume=48|issue=1|pages=69\u201382|doi=10.1111/izy.12038|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1748-1090|year=2014}}</ref> ([[syn.]] ''C. mossambicus'') and water snakes. In [[Uganda]], lungfish and catfish were mainly fed to the young.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/> The big beak is sometimes used to dig into pond-bottom mud to extract [[lungfish]] from their [[aestivation]] burrows.\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Balaeniceps rex in Prague Zoo 03.JPG|thumb|left|A sitting shoebill in [[Prague Zoo]], Czech Republic]]\n\nThe solitary nature of shoebills extends to their breeding habits. Nests typically occur at less than three nests per square kilometre, unlike [[heron]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[pelican]]s and [[stork]]s which predominantly nest in colonies. The breeding pair of shoebills vigorously defends a territory of {{convert|2|to|4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} from [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]]. In the extreme north and south of the species' range, nesting starts right after the rains end. In more central regions of the range, it may nest near end of wet season in order to hatch around the beginning of the following wet season. Both parents engage in building the nest on floating platform, after clearing out an area of approximately {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} across. The large, flattish nesting platform is often partially submerged in water and can be as much as {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. The nest itself is about {{convert|1|to|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. Both the nest and platform are made of aquatic vegetation. In Sudan, the nests apparently were able to support the weight of an adult man, although this was not the case in Zambia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} From one to three white eggs are laid. These eggs measure {{convert|80|to|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|56|to|61|mm|in|abbr=on}} and weigh around {{convert|164|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Incubation lasts for approximately 30 days. Both parents actively brood, shade, guard and feed the nestling, though the females are perhaps slightly more attentive. Food items are regurgitated whole from the gullet straight into the bill of the young. Shoebills rarely raise more than one chick, but will hatch more. The younger chicks eventually die and are intended as \"back-ups\" in case the eldest chick dies or is weak. Fledging is reached at around 105 days and the young birds can fly well by 112 days. However, they are still fed for possibly a month or more after this. It will take the young shoebills three years before they become fully sexually mature.<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n===Voice===\nThe shoebill is normally silent, but they perform bill-clattering displays at the nest.<ref name=\"HBW1\"/> When engaging in these displays, adult birds have also been noted to utter a [[Cattle|cow]]-like ''moo'' as well as high-pitched whines. Both nestlings and adults engage in bill-clattering during the nesting season as a means of communication. When young are begging for food, they call out with a sound uncannily like human hiccups. In one case, a flying adult bird was heard uttering hoarse croaks, apparently as a sign of aggression at a nearby [[marabou stork]] (''Leptoptilos crumeniferus'').<ref name=\"Hancock\"/>\n\n==Status and conservation==\nThe population is estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 individuals, the majority of which live in swamps in South Sudan, Uganda, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Gield Guide to the Birds of East Africa |first1=J.G |last1=Williams |first2=N |last2=Arlott |publisher=Collins |isbn=978-0-00-219179-1 |year=1980 |url=https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetobird00will }}</ref> There is also a viable population in the Malagarasi wetlands in Tanzania.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=John|first1=Jasson|last2=Nahonyo|first2=Cuthbert|last3=Lee|first3=Woo|last4=Msuya|first4=Charles|title=Observations on nesting of shoebill Balaeniceps rex and wattled crane Bugeranus carunculatus in Malagarasi wetlands, western Tanzania|journal=African Journal of Ecology|date=March 2013|volume=51|issue=1|pages=184\u2013187|doi=10.1111/aje.12023}}</ref> [[BirdLife International]] has classified it as [[vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] with the main threats being [[habitat destruction]], disturbance and hunting.

Then he accepts an under-the-table commission on the outpost world of [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Nevarro|Nevarro]] from an enigmatic [[The Client (Star Wars)|client]] with apparent Imperial connections, directing him to track down and capture an unnamed fifty-year-old target. While the Client is indifferent to the target's well-being, his colleague [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Dr. Pershing|Dr. Pershing]] insists the target be brought back alive. The Mandalorian is given a down payment of a single bar of [[Beskar steel]], sacred to his people. He takes it to a covert Mandalorian enclave where an [[The Armorer (Star Wars)|armorer]] uses it to make him a [[pauldron]]. Arriving at the planet of the target's last reported location, the Mandalorian is aided by a vapor farmer named [[Kuiil]]. Tired of the chaos that bounty hunters bring to the area, Kuiil leads him to the target's location and departs. Entering the remote and heavily defended encampment, the Mandalorian reluctantly teams up with bounty hunting droid [[IG-11]] to clear the camp and find the quarry: a [[The Child (Star Wars)|child]] of [[Yoda's species]]. When IG-11 attempts to kill the infant per its bounty orders, the Mandalorian shoots and destroys the droid, taking the Child alive.\n |LineColor       = C4A574\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = [[Chapter 2: The Child]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Rick Famuyiwa]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jon Favreau\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|15}}\n |ShortSummary    = While returning to his ship with the Child, the Mandalorian fights and kills a group of rival bounty hunters who ambush him. Nearing his ship, he finds it being stripped by [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawas]] for parts, and violently confronts them. When he tries to attack their [[sandcrawler]], the Jawas stun him and drop him from its roof. The following day, Kuiil helps him locate the Jawas and negotiate for the return of his ship's components. The Mandalorian agrees to retrieve the egg of a rhinoceros-like Mudhorn in exchange for the stolen parts. He enters the Mudhorn's cave only to be hurled out by the angry beast inside, which attacks him repeatedly, damaging his armor. As the Mudhorn rushes in for the kill, the Child uses [[the Force]] to levitate the beast, allowing the surprised Mandalorian to stab and kill it. He collects the egg and takes it to the Jawas, who crack it open and eat its yellow insides. With the trade complete, the Mandalorian and Kuiil work together to repair the ship, allowing the Mandalorian to leave the planet with the Child.\n |LineColor       = C4A574\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = [[Chapter 3: The Sin]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Deborah Chow]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jon Favreau\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|22}}\n |ShortSummary    = The Mandalorian delivers the Child to the Client on Nevarro and collects the bounty of 20 bars of Beskar steel. Uncharacteristically, the Mandalorian asks about the Client's plans for the Child, but is told that it's none of his concern. He leaves before conflict arises. Returning to the Mandalorian enclave, the Mandalorian has his damaged armor replaced and weapons upgraded by the Armorer, who forges a full [[cuirass]] from most of the Beskar steel, while the remainder goes to support Mandalorian foundling children. The Mandalorian accepts a new job from Greef Karga and prepares his ship to depart. Feeling guilty for abandoning the Child to the Empire, he turns back to attack the Client's base, killing most of the stormtroopers guarding it. He rescues the Child from Dr. Pershing's laboratory where it was being experimented on, but chooses not to kill the doctor. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by other bounty hunters and Greef Karga, who demand that he hand over the Child. He refuses, and a firefight breaks out. Outnumbered and cornered, the Mandalorian is able to escape only when other Mandalorians arrive from the enclave, attacking the bounty hunters and allowing him to reach his ship with the Child.\n |LineColor       = C4A574\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = [[Chapter 4: Sanctuary]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Bryce Dallas Howard]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jon Favreau\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Arriving on the sparsely populated forest planet [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Sorgan|Sorgan]], the Mandalorian encounters ex-Rebel shock trooper-turned-mercenary [[Cara Dune]]. Following a short brawl, Dune explains that she is hiding after taking \"early retirement\", and asks the Mandalorian to leave. While he prepares his ship, two desperate fishermen approach, offering to hire him to drive off a band of [[List of Star Wars species|Klatoonian]] raiders. He accepts the job in exchange for lodging, using their credits to enlist Dune's help. At the village, they are housed by [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Omera|Omera]], a widowed mother. The Mandalorian confides in her that no one has seen him without his helmet since childhood, when his tribe took him in as an orphan. Despite discovering that the raiders have an old Imperial [[AT-ST]], the villagers refuse to leave, so the Mandalorian and Dune train them to defend themselves. They provoke the raiders at night, with Dune luring the AT-ST into a trap for the Mandalorian to blow up and forcing the remaining raiders to flee. With peace restored, the Mandalorian plans to leave the Child in the village, but a Guild bounty hunter tracks it down and is killed by Dune.

He seeks work in a cantina to pay for the repairs, meeting aspiring bounty hunter [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Toro Calican|Toro Calican]], who is tracking elite mercenary and assassin [[Fennec Shand]]. Calican needs to catch Shand to join the Guild, and the Mandalorian agrees to help when Calican offers to let him keep the money. They capture Shand in the desert, but she destroys one of their speeder bikes, so the Mandalorian goes to get a [[List of Star Wars species|dewback]] they passed for transportation. While Calican watches Shand, she tells him that the Mandalorian betrayed the guild, making the bounty on him and the Child worth more than hers. Shand offers to help Calican capture the Mandalorian if he sets her free, but he shoots her instead and rides the remaining speeder bike to the repair dock, taking Motto and the Child hostage. The Mandalorian arrives, uses a [[flare]] to disorient Calican, and kills him. He takes Calican's money to pay Motto for the repairs, thanking her before leaving Tatooine.

After infiltrating the prison ship, they fight through security droids and make it to the control room where the ship's security chief triggers a security beacon before being killed by Xi'an. The crew rescues Qin but double-crosses the Mandalorian. He escapes and defeats each crew member, then captures Qin. Q9-0 finds the Child after deciphering the archived transmission from Greef Karga, but is shot by the Mandalorian before he can harm him. The Mandalorian delivers Qin to Ran and departs with his payment. Ran immediately moves to launch a fighter to kill the Mandalorian, but discovers the New Republic beacon had been placed on Qin, leading a trio of [[X-wing fighter|X-wings]] to Ran's station where they attack.

Karga proposes that the Mandalorian use the Child as bait in order to kill the Client and free the town. In return, Karga will square things with the Guild, which would allow the Mandalorian and the Child to live in peace. Sensing a trap, the Mandalorian recruits Cara Dune and Kuiil to assist him, and Kuiil brings a rebuilt and reprogrammed IG-11 to protect the Child. They meet Karga and his associates, but are attacked by [[Mynock]]s. Karga is injured, but the Child uses the Force to heal his wound. In return, Karga kills his associates and confesses his original plan to shoot the Mandalorian and take the Child to the Client. Karga pretends that Dune has captured the Mandalorian, while Kuiil returns the Child to the ship. During the meeting, [[Moff Gideon]]'s troops open fire on the building and kill the Client and his bodyguards, trapping the Mandalorian, Karga, and Dune inside. Gideon arrives, demanding the Child.

Gideon warns Karga, Dune, and the Mandalorian that they face certain death unless they agree to assist him. IG-11 arrives and breaks the standoff but Gideon injures the Mandalorian. The Child uses the Force to deflect an attacking stormtrooper's flamethrower back on him. The Mandalorian sends the others through a sewer grate with the Child to find help from the Mandalorian enclave, while IG-11 removes his helmet to tend to a head injury. Joining the others, the Mandalorian finds the covert group of Mandalorians dead or escaped, except for the Armorer. She tasks him to care for the foundling Child like his own, discover its origins, and return it to its kind. The Armorer fashions the Mandalorian his own signet and gives him a jetpack. The group is ferried down an underground lava river, but when they are ambushed by stormtroopers, IG-11 self-destructs to eliminate the enemy.

name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he first leave the Child with the Client.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He does so again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan, who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first-season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nSeveral writers suggested the fact that the Mandalorian's face is concealed has a [[tabula rasa]] effect and his anonymity allows viewers to see and imagine themselves as parents.<ref name=\"Britt1129\" /><ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> Britt said this \"allow(s) us to dream about what arsenal we might deploy to protect our children\".<ref

Anthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no

as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that's left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger.

While the Client is indifferent to the target's well-being, his colleague [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Dr. Pershing|Dr. Pershing]] insists the target be brought back alive. The Mandalorian is given a down payment of a single bar of [[Beskar steel]], sacred to his people. He takes it to a covert Mandalorian enclave where an [[The Armorer (Star Wars)|armorer]] uses it to make him a [[pauldron]]. Arriving at the planet of the target's last reported location, the Mandalorian is aided by a vapor farmer named [[Kuiil]]. Tired of the chaos that bounty hunters bring to the area, Kuiil leads him to the target's location and departs. Entering the remote and heavily defended encampment, the Mandalorian reluctantly teams up with bounty hunting droid [[IG-11]] to clear the camp and find the quarry: a [[The Child (Star Wars)|child]] of [[Yoda's species]].

The following day, Kuiil helps him locate the Jawas and negotiate for the return of his ship's components. The Mandalorian agrees to retrieve the egg of a rhinoceros-like Mudhorn in exchange for the stolen parts. He enters the Mudhorn's cave only to be hurled out by the angry beast inside, which attacks him repeatedly, damaging his armor. As the Mudhorn rushes in for the kill, the Child uses [[the Force]] to levitate the beast, allowing the surprised Mandalorian to stab and kill it. He collects the egg and takes it to the Jawas, who crack it open and eat its yellow insides.

Returning to the Mandalorian enclave, the Mandalorian has his damaged armor replaced and weapons upgraded by the Armorer, who forges a full [[cuirass]] from most of the Beskar steel, while the remainder goes to support Mandalorian foundling children. The Mandalorian accepts a new job from Greef Karga and prepares his ship to depart. Feeling guilty for abandoning the Child to the Empire, he turns back to attack the Client's base, killing most of the stormtroopers guarding it. He rescues the Child from Dr. Pershing's laboratory where it was being experimented on, but chooses not to kill the doctor. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by other bounty hunters and Greef Karga, who demand that he hand over the Child. He refuses, and a firefight breaks out.

Despite discovering that the raiders have an old Imperial [[AT-ST]], the villagers refuse to leave, so the Mandalorian and Dune train them to defend themselves. They provoke the raiders at night, with Dune luring the AT-ST into a trap for the Mandalorian to blow up and forcing the remaining raiders to flee.

The Mandalorian sends the others through a sewer grate with the Child to find help from the Mandalorian enclave, while IG-11 removes his helmet to tend to a head injury. Joining the others, the Mandalorian finds the covert group of Mandalorians dead or escaped, except for the Armorer. She tasks him to care for the foundling Child like his own, discover its origins, and return it to its kind. The Armorer fashions the Mandalorian his own signet and gives him a jetpack. The group is ferried down an underground lava river, but when they are ambushed by stormtroopers, IG-11 self-destructs to eliminate the enemy. Gideon attacks in a [[TIE fighter]] and the Mandalorian uses the jetpack to bring the craft down, but the Moff survives and cuts himself out of the ship with the [[Darksaber (fictional weapon)|Darksaber]].<!-- The inclusion of the Darksaber in this plot summary, and the accompanying efn citation, were the result of a a consensus and compromise reached after an extensive talk page discussion.

parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref

be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nSeveral writers suggested the fact that the Mandalorian's face is concealed has a [[tabula rasa]] effect and his anonymity allows viewers to

The 14-year-old lived with his father, George Stinney Sr., mother Aim\u00e9, brothers  John, 17, and Charles, 12, and sisters Katherine, 10, and Aim\u00e9, 7. George Sr. worked at the town's sawmill, and the family resided in company housing. Alcolu was a small, working-class mill town, where white and black neighborhoods were separated by railroad tracks. The town was typical of small Southern towns of the time. Given segregated schools and churches for white and black residents, there was limited interaction between them. <ref name=mcveigh />\n\nThe bodies of Betty June Binnicker, age 11, and Mary Emma Thames, age 7, were found in a ditch on March 23, 1944, on the African American side of Alcolu, during a search after they had not returned home the night before.<ref name=collins /> George Stinney Sr. helped in the search.

Johnny was released by police, but George was held. He was not allowed to see his parents until after his trial and conviction.<ref name=mcveigh /> According to a handwritten statement, the arresting officer was H.S. Newman, a Clarendon County deputy, who stated, \"I arrested a boy by the name of George Stinney. He then made a confession and told me where to find a piece of iron about 15 inches were [sic] he said he put it in a ditch about six feet from the bicycle.\" No confession statement signed by Stinney is known to exist. The 14 year old claimed that the arresting officers starved him and then bribed him with food to confess.<ref name=mcveigh /><ref name=mclaughlin />\n\nGeorge was reported to have gotten into fights at school, including a fight where he scratched a girl with a knife. This assertion by Stinney's seventh-grade teacher, who was African American, was disputed by Aime Stinney Ruffner when it was reported in 1995. A local white woman who remembered Stinney from childhood said in 2014 that Stinney had threatened to kill her and her friend the day before the murder, and that he was known as a bully.<ref name=mcveigh /><ref name=behre>{{Cite web |last=Behre |first=Robert |date= January 17, 2014 |title=Family, friends of 1944 murder victim wary of reopening George Stinney\u2019s death penalty case |url= http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20140117/PC1610/140119506 |website=[[The Post and Courier]] |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603111624/http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20140117/PC1610/140119506 |url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nFollowing George's arrest, his father was fired from his job at the local sawmill, and the Stinney family had to immediately vacate their company housing. The family feared for their safety. The community as well as the police threatened to lynch their other children if they did not leave immediately.{{cn|date=December 2019}} His parents did not see George again before the trial. He had no support during his 81-day confinement and trial; he was detained at a jail in Columbia 50 miles from Alcolu, due to the risk of lynching.<ref name=collins /> Stinney was questioned alone, without his parents or an attorney.<ref name=bever /> Although the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] guarantees legal counsel, it was not until 1963 ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' that explicitly required representation through the course of criminal proceedings.<ref name=bever />\n\n==Trial==\nThe entire proceeding against Stinney, including jury selection, took one day. Stinney's court-appointed defense counsel was Charles Plowden, a tax commissioner campaigning for election to local office. Plowden did not challenge the three police officers who testified that Stinney confessed to the two murders, despite this being the only evidence against him.\n\nHe did not challenge the prosecution's presentation of two differing versions of Stinney's verbal confession. In one version, Stinney was attacked by the girls after he tried to help one girl who had fallen in the ditch, and he killed them in self defense. In the other version, he had followed the girls, first attacking Mary Emma and then Betty June. There was no physical evidence linking him to the murders.<ref name=mcveigh /> There is no written record of Stinney's confession apart from Deputy Newman's statement.<ref name=collins />\n\nStinney's trial had an [[all-white jury]], as was typical at the time. As most blacks were still [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] and prohibited from voting, they could not be selected as jurors. More than 1,000 whites crowded the courtroom, but no blacks were allowed.<ref name=collins />\n\nOther than the testimony of the three police officers, at trial prosecutors called three witnesses: Reverend Francis Batson, who discovered the bodies of the two girls, and the two doctors who performed the post-mortem examination. Conflicting confessions were reported to have been offered by the prosecution. The court allowed discussion of the \"possibility\" of rape although the medical examiner's report had no evidence to support this. Stinney's counsel did not call any witnesses, did not cross-examine witnesses, and offered little or no defense. The trial presentation lasted two and a half hours.<ref name=mcveigh />\n\nThe jury took less than ten minutes to [[jury deliberation|deliberate]], after which they returned with a guilty verdict. Judge [[Philip H. Stoll]] sentenced Stinney to death by electrocution. There is no transcript of the trial. No appeal was filed by his defense attorney.<ref name=collins />\n\nStinney's family, churches, and the [[NAACP]] appealed to Governor [[Olin D. Johnston]] for clemency, given the age of the boy. Others urged the governor to let the execution proceed, which he did.<ref name=jones /> Johnston wrote in a response to one appeal for clemency that \n\n<blockquote>It may be interesting for you to know that Stinney killed the smaller girl to rape the larger one. Then he killed the larger girl and raped her dead body. Twenty minutes later he returned and attempted to rape her again, but her body was too cold. All of this he admitted himself.</blockquote>\n\nBetween the time of Stinney's arrest and his execution, Stinney's parents were allowed to see him once, after the trial when he was held in the Columbia penitentiary. Under the threat of lynching, they were not allowed to see him any other time. <ref name=mcveigh />\n\n==Execution==\nGeorge Stinney was executed at the Central Correctional Institution in Columbia, South Carolina on June 16, 1944, at 7:30 p.m. At 7:25 pm, standing 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighing just over 90 lbs three police officers approached the cell where George was being held, one officer entered and took him out of his cell. The officers escorted him to the execution room where they placed him in the electric chair, using a Bible he was carrying as a booster seat because George was so small.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/george-stinney-jr-black-14-year-old-boy-exonerated-70-years-after-he-was-executed-9932429.html|title=He was 14 when he was executed.

George Sr. worked at the town's sawmill, and the family resided in company housing. Alcolu was a small, working-class mill town, where white and black neighborhoods were separated by railroad tracks. The town was typical of small Southern towns of the time. Given segregated schools and churches for white and black residents, there was limited interaction between them. <ref name=mcveigh />\n\nThe bodies of Betty June Binnicker, age 11, and Mary Emma Thames, age 7, were found in a ditch on March 23, 1944, on the African American side of Alcolu, during a search after they had not returned home the night before.<ref name=collins /> George Stinney Sr. helped in the search.

Johnny was released by police, but George was held.

The family feared for their safety. The community as well as the police threatened to lynch their other children if they did not leave immediately.{{cn|date=December 2019}} His parents did not see George again before the trial. He had no support during his 81-day confinement and trial; he was detained at a jail in Columbia 50 miles from Alcolu, due to the risk of lynching.<ref name=collins /> Stinney was questioned alone, without his parents or an attorney.<ref name=bever /> Although the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] guarantees legal counsel, it was not until 1963 ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' that explicitly required representation through the course of criminal proceedings.<ref name=bever />\n\n==Trial==\nThe entire proceeding against Stinney, including jury selection, took one day. Stinney's court-appointed defense counsel was Charles Plowden, a tax commissioner campaigning for election to local office. Plowden did not challenge the three police officers who testified that Stinney confessed to the two murders, despite this being the only evidence against him.\n\nHe did not challenge the prosecution's presentation of two differing versions of Stinney's verbal confession. In one version, Stinney was attacked by the girls after he tried to help one girl who had fallen in the ditch, and he killed them in self defense. In the other version, he had followed the girls, first attacking Mary Emma and then Betty June. There was no physical evidence linking him to the murders.<ref name=mcveigh /> There is no written record of Stinney's confession apart from Deputy Newman's statement.<ref name=collins />\n\nStinney's trial had an [[all-white jury]], as was typical at the time. As most blacks were still [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] and prohibited from voting, they could not be selected as jurors. More than 1,000 whites crowded the courtroom, but no blacks were allowed.<ref name=collins />\n\nOther than the testimony of the three police officers, at trial prosecutors called three witnesses: Reverend Francis Batson, who discovered the bodies of the two girls, and the two doctors who performed the post-mortem examination. Conflicting confessions were reported to have been offered by the prosecution. The court allowed discussion of the \"possibility\" of rape although the medical examiner's report had no evidence to support this. Stinney's counsel did not call any witnesses, did not cross-examine witnesses, and offered little or no defense. The trial presentation lasted two and a half hours.<ref name=mcveigh />\n\nThe jury took less than ten minutes to [[jury deliberation|deliberate]], after which they returned with a guilty verdict. Judge [[Philip H. Stoll]] sentenced Stinney to death by electrocution. There is no transcript of the trial. No appeal was filed by his defense attorney.<ref name=collins />\n\nStinney's family, churches, and the [[NAACP]] appealed to Governor [[Olin D. Johnston]] for clemency, given the age of the boy. Others urged the governor to let the execution proceed, which he did.<ref name=jones /> Johnston wrote in a response to one appeal for clemency that \n\n<blockquote>It may be interesting for you to know that Stinney killed the smaller girl to rape the larger one. Then he killed the larger girl and raped her dead body. Twenty minutes later he returned and attempted to rape her again, but her body was too cold. All of this he admitted himself.</blockquote>\n\nBetween the time of Stinney's arrest and his execution, Stinney's parents were allowed to see him once, after the trial when he was held in the Columbia penitentiary. Under the threat of lynching, they were not allowed to see him any other time. <ref name=mcveigh />\n\n==Execution==\nGeorge Stinney was executed at the Central Correctional Institution in Columbia, South Carolina on June 16, 1944, at 7:30 p.m. At 7:25 pm, standing 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighing just over 90 lbs three police officers approached the cell where George was being held, one officer entered and took him out of his cell. The officers escorted him to the execution room where they placed him in the electric chair, using a Bible he was carrying as a booster seat because George was so small.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/george-stinney-jr-black-14-year-old-boy-exonerated-70-years-after-he-was-executed-9932429.html|title=He was 14 when he was executed.

His father was allowed to approach George to say his final words to his son. An officer asked George if he had any last words to say, but George just shook his head. George Stinney could only whimper and take big deep breaths as one of the officers pulled a strap from the chair and placed it over his mouth, causing George to break into tears. They then placed the face mask over his face, which did not fit him, as George continued sobbing.
