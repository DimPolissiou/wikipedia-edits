(''{{lang-it|Notizie per l'Anno ...}}'')  From 1851, a department of the Holy See began producing a different publication called ''Hierarchy of the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church Worldwide'' (''{{lang-it|Gerarchia della Santa Chiesa Cattolica Apostolica Romana in Tutto L'Orbe}}''), which took the title ''Annuario Pontificio'' in 1860 but ceased publication in 1870. This was the first yearbook published by the Holy See itself, but its compilation was entrusted to the newspaper ''[[Giornale di Roma]]''. The Monaldi Brothers ({{lang-it|Fratelli Monaldi}}) began in 1872 to produce their own yearbook entitled ''The Catholic Hierarchy and the Papal Household for the Year ...'' (''{{lang-it|La Gerarchia Cattolica e la Famiglia Pontificia per l'Anno ...}}'').\n\nThe [[Holy See Press Office|Vatican Press]] took over the ''Gerarchia Cattolica'' in 1885, thus making it a semi-official publication.  It bore the indication \"official publication\" from 1899 to 1904, but this ceased when, giving the word \"official\" a more restricted sense, the ''Acta Sanctae Sedis'', forerunner of the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', was declared the only \"official\" publication of the Holy See. In 1912, it resumed the title ''Annuario Pontificio''. From 1912 to 1924, it included not only lists of names, but also brief illustrative notes on departments of the [[Roman Curia]] and on certain posts within the [[papal court]], a practice to which it returned in 1940.\n\nFor some years, beginning in 1898, the ''Maison de [[la Bonne Presse]]'' publishing house of [[Paris]] produced a similar yearbook in [[French language|French]] called ''Annuaire Pontifical Catholique'', not compiled by the Holy See. This contained much additional information, such as detailed historical articles on the [[Swiss Guards]] and the [[Apostolic Palace|Papal Palace]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].\n\n== List of popes ==\n\n{{See also|List of popes}}\n\nThe ''Annuario Pontificio'' provides the Catholic Church's list of [[pope]]s. As historical questions are reinterpreted by each successive pope, they are recognized in the ''Annuario Pontificio''. For example, the 1942 ''Annuario Pontificio'' recognized the decisions of the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409), listing three popes for the period: [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]] (1406\u20131409), [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] (1409\u20131410), and [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (1410\u20131415).<ref>{{cite book |title=Annuario pontificio per l'anno 1942 |date=1942 |location=Rome |page=21 |quote=205.

It lists the [[List of popes|popes in chronological order]] and all officials of the Holy See's [[dicastery|departments]]. It also provides names and contact information for all [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and [[Catholic bishop|bishops]]s, the [[diocese]]s (with statistics about each), the departments of the [[Roman Curia]], the [[List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See|Holy See's diplomatic mission]]s abroad, the [[embassy|embassies]] accredited to the Holy See, the headquarters of [[religious institute]]s (again with statistics on each), certain academic institutions, and other similar information.

(''{{lang-it|Notizie per l'Anno ...}}'')  From 1851, a department of the Holy See began producing a different publication called ''Hierarchy of the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church Worldwide'' (''{{lang-it|Gerarchia della Santa Chiesa Cattolica Apostolica Romana in Tutto L'Orbe}}''), which took the title ''Annuario Pontificio'' in 1860 but ceased publication in 1870. This was the first yearbook published by the Holy See itself, but its compilation was entrusted to the newspaper ''[[Giornale di Roma]]''. The Monaldi Brothers ({{lang-it|Fratelli Monaldi}}) began in 1872 to produce their own yearbook entitled ''The Catholic Hierarchy and the Papal Household for the Year ...'' (''{{lang-it|La Gerarchia Cattolica e la Famiglia Pontificia per l'Anno ...}}'').\n\nThe [[Holy See Press Office|Vatican Press]] took over the ''Gerarchia Cattolica'' in 1885, thus making it a semi-official publication.  It bore the indication \"official publication\" from 1899 to 1904, but this ceased when, giving the word \"official\" a more restricted sense, the ''Acta Sanctae Sedis'', forerunner of the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', was declared the only \"official\" publication of the Holy See. In 1912, it resumed the title ''Annuario Pontificio''. From 1912 to 1924, it included not only lists of names, but also brief illustrative notes on departments of the [[Roman Curia]] and on certain posts within the [[papal court]], a practice to which it returned in 1940.\n\nFor some years, beginning in 1898, the ''Maison de [[la Bonne Presse]]'' publishing house of [[Paris]] produced a similar yearbook in [[French language|French]] called ''Annuaire Pontifical Catholique'', not compiled by the Holy See. This contained much additional information, such as detailed historical articles on the [[Swiss Guards]] and the [[Apostolic Palace|Papal Palace]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].\n\n== List of popes ==\n\n{{See also|List of popes}}\n\nThe ''Annuario Pontificio'' provides the Catholic Church's list of [[pope]]s. As historical questions are reinterpreted by each successive pope, they are recognized in the ''Annuario Pontificio''. For example, the 1942 ''Annuario Pontificico'' recognized the decisions of the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409), listing three popes for the period: [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]] (1406\u20131409), [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] (1409\u20131410), and [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (1410\u20131415).<ref>{{cite book |title=Annuario pontificio per l'anno 1942 |date=1942 |location=Rome |page=21 |quote=205.
