For ten days in a [[speed dating]] format, the men and women date each other in different \"pods\" where they can talk to each other, but not see each other. Whenever they decided, the men were able to propose to the woman they want to marry. After the proposal, and meeting face to face for the first time, the engaged couples headed to a couples retreat in [[Playa del Carmen]], [[Mexico]]. During this trip they spent time getting to know their partners, and were able to meet the other couples participating in the experiment. \n\nFollowing the couples retreat, the engaged couples moved to the same apartment complex back in Atlanta. While at the apartments, they all met their partners' families and explored their partners' living conditions. At the altar on the day of the wedding, the engaged couples carried out wedding ceremonies and needed to make their final decisions at the altar about whether to split up or get married, answering the question \"Is love blind?\"\n\n==Season summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+Season 1 (February 13 \u2013 March 5, 2020) couples\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Couples\n! scope=\"col\"| Proposal\n! scope=\"col\"| Still together\n! scope=\"col\"| Relationship notes\n|-\n| Lauren Speed & Cameron Hamilton\n| {{yes}}\n| {{yes}}\n| The two got married in November 2018, during the filming of the 1st season of Love is Blind.

The shows we've done before, we've never had this much success. We prepared for five. Then we got eight engagements, so we had to pick who we were going to follow.' We got our phones back.

Comparing it to ''[[The Bachelor (American TV series)|The Bachelor]]'', Crimmins called the series \"the bizarre reality TV experiment you've been craving\". She comments that you never know what the couples will do next, even down to the altar at the wedding, making the series \"harmless, entertaining, and satisfying.\"<ref name=\"mashable review\"/>\n\nLucy Mangan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave ''Love Is Blind'' a rating of 2 out of 5 stars, calling it toxic, revolting, but extremely addictive. She says that ''Love Is Blind'' is the final nail in the coffin of humanity; however, in terms of reality television, she states that it is good because it \"exploits emotional frailties, profaning the sacred, making the private and precious public and worthless and turning it into voyeuristic ratings-bait.\" Despite all of this, she recommends the show as a casual reality television binge, similar to ''[[The Bachelor (American TV series)|The Bachelor]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mangan |first1=Lucy |title=Love Is Blind review: toxic, revolting \u2013 and totally addictive |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/13/love-is-blind-review-toxic-revolting-and-totally-addictive |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |language=English |date=February 13, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nKristen Baldwin of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the series \"intensely tragic yet riveting.\" She criticized the series, saying that the first four episodes in the pods feel new and fresh, but once the engaged couples enter the real world, it feels like just another bad dating reality television show. Baldwin also called it depressing, citing the contestants always saying, \"If I don't get married now, I never will.\" Overall, Baldwin gave ''Love Is Blind'' a [[Grading systems by country#United

For ten days in a [[speed dating]] format, the men and women date each other in different \"pods\" where they can talk to each other, but not see each other. Whenever they decided, the men were able to propose to the woman they want to marry. After the proposal, and meeting face to face for the first time, the engaged couples headed to a couples retreat in [[Playa del Carmen]], [[Mexico]]. During this trip they spent time getting to know their partners, and were able to meet the other couples participating in the experiment. \n\nFollowing the couples retreat, the engaged couples moved to the same apartment complex back in Atlanta. While at the apartments, they all met their partners' families and explored their partners' living conditions. At the altar on the day of the wedding, the engaged couples carried out wedding ceremonies and needed to make their final decisions at the altar about whether to split up or get married, answering the question \"Is love blind?\"\n\n==Season summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+Season 1 (February 13 \u2013 March 5, 2020) couples\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Couples\n! scope=\"col\"| Proposal\n! scope=\"col\"| Still together\n! scope=\"col\"| Relationship notes\n|-\n| Lauren Speed & Cameron Hamilton\n| {{yes}}\n| {{yes}}\n| The two got married in November 2018, during the filming of the 1st season of Love is Blind.

The shows we've done before, we've never had this much success. We prepared for five. Then we got eight engagements, so we had to pick who we were going to follow.' We got our phones back. They thanked us graciously and said, 'Sorry, we just don\u2019t have enough to cover everybody.'\"<ref name=\"failed engagements\"/>\n\nAfter getting engaged in the pods, Baer and Skipper continued to date for three months before breaking up.

It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on [[Historic England]]'s [[register of historic parks and gardens]]. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \"squalor and slovenly disorder\"{{sfn|Jenkins|2003|p=381}} into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017.\n\nThe gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of [[old garden rose]]s. The writer [[Anne Scott-James]] considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \"one of the finest collections in the world\".{{sfn|Scott-James|1974|p=73}} A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The [[garden design]] is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \"garden rooms\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \"garden rooms\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist [[Tony Lord]] describing it as \"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\"{{sfn|Lord|1995|p=147}}\n\nThe site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the [[Middle Ages]]. The present-day buildings began as a house built in the 1530s by [[John Baker (died 1558)|Sir John Baker]]. In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset]], an ancestor of Vita Sackville-West. By the 18th century the Baker's fortunes had waned, and the house, renamed Sissinghurst Castle, was leased to the government to act as a prisoner-of-war camp during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The prisoners caused great damage and by the 19th century much of Sir Richard's house had been demolished. In the mid-19th century, the remaining buildings were in use as a [[workhouse]], and by the 20th century Sissinghurst had declined to the status of a farmstead. In 1928 the castle was advertised for sale but remained unsold for two years.\n\nSackville-West was born in 1892 at [[Knole]], the ancestral home of the [[Duke of Dorset|Sackvilles]]. But for her sex, Sackville-West would have inherited Knole on the death of her father in 1928. Instead, following [[primogeniture]], the house and the title passed to her uncle, a loss she felt deeply. In 1930, after she and Nicolson became concerned that their home [[Long Barn]] was threatened by development, Sackville-West bought Sissinghurst Castle. On purchasing Sissinghurst, Sackville-West and Nicolson inherited little more than some oak and nut trees, a [[quince]], and a single old rose. Sackville-West planted the [[noisette rose]] 'Madame Alfred Carri\u00e8re' on the south face of the South Cottage even before the deeds to the property had been signed. Nicolson was largely responsible for planning the garden design, while Sackville-West undertook the planting. Over the next thirty years, working with her head gardeners, she cultivated some two hundred varieties of roses and large numbers of other flowers and shrubs. Decades after Sackville-West and Nicolson created \"a garden where none was\",{{sfn|Nicolson|2008|p=285}} Sissinghurst remains a major influence on [[horticultural]] thought and practice.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe site is ancient; \"hurst\" is the [[Saxons|Saxon]] term for an enclosed wood. [[Nigel Nicolson]], in his 1964 guide, ''Sissinghurst Castle: An Illustrated History'', records the earliest owners as the de Saxinhersts.{{efn|Nicolson notes that \"the spelling of the name fluctuat(es) at the will of the scribe\". The brief early records of the site use Saxinherst, Saxingherste and Saxenhurst.{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|p=4}} Adam Nicolson suggests that the name derives from, or is the origin of, Sissinghurst, perhaps meaning \"the wood of the Saxons\".{{sfn|Nicolson|2008b|p=36}}}} Stephen de Saxinherst is named in an 1180 charter about the nearby [[Combwell Priory]]. At the end of the 13th century the estate had passed, through marriage, to the de Berhams.{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|pp=4\u20135}} Nicolson suggested that the de Berhams constructed a moated house in stone, of an appearance similar to that of [[Ightham Mote]], which was later replaced by a brick manor.{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|pp=5\u20136}} More recent studies, including those of Nicolson's son, [[Adam Nicolson|Adam]], cast doubt on the existence of an earlier stone manor, suggesting instead that the brick house, or perhaps a timber construction of a slightly earlier date, occupying the corner of the orchard nearest the moat, was the earliest house on the site.{{sfn|Nicolson|2008|pp=173\u2013174}} [[Edward I]] is reputed to have stayed at this house in 1305.{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|p=5}}\n\n===Rise, decline, collapse: c.1490\u20131930===\n[[File:Sissinghurst Castle 10.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.6|alt=Model of Sissinghurst Castle in 1560. From right to left: gatehouse, tower, brick courtyard, wooden courtyard; moat front and left|Model displayed at Sissinghurst depicting Sir Richard Baker's house circa 1560]]\nIn 1490 the de Berhams sold the manor of Sissinghurst to Thomas Baker of [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]].{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|p=6}} The Bakers were cloth producers and in the following century, through marriage and careers at court and in the law, Thomas's successors greatly expanded their wealth and their estates in Kent and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Nicolson|2008|pp=171\u2013172}} In the 1530s Sir John Baker, one of [[Henry VIII]]'s [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], built a new brick gatehouse, the current West Range.{{sfn|Newman|2012|p=544}}{{efn|The construction of new homes on sites adjacent to older houses was a fairly common practice in [[Tudor period|Tudor England]]. Sir John's approach was followed, for example, by the [[Duke of Norfolk]] at [[Kenninghall]].{{sfn|Howard|1987|p=17}}}} In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, creating the earliest connection between the Sackville family and the house.{{sfn|Dennison|2015|p=204}} Sir John's son Richard undertook a massive [[Prodigy house|prodigy expansion]] in the 1560s. The Tower is part of that expansion, and formed the entrance to a very large courtyard house, of which the South Cottage and some walls are the only other remaining fragments.{{sfn|Newman|2012|pp=544\u2013545}} Sir Richard surrounded the mansion with an enclosed {{convert|700|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Deer park (England)|deer park]] and in August 1573 entertained [[Queen Elizabeth I]] at Sissinghurst.{{sfn|Greeves|2008|p=285}}\n\nAfter the collapse of the Baker family fortunes following the [[English Civil War|civil war]] (1642\u20131651), the building declined in importance. [[Horace Walpole]] visited in 1752: \"yesterday, after twenty mishaps, we got to Sissinghurst for dinner. There is a park in ruins and a house in ten times greater ruins.\"{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|p=24}} During the [[Seven Years' War]], it became a prisoner-of-war camp.{{sfn|Nicolson|2008b|p=44}}{{efn|An 18th century painting of the castle at this time was identified as being of Sissinghurst only in 2008.

There are many fights over our sunlight fields\".{{sfn|Nicolson|1967|p=110}}{{efn|Although Sissinghurst was undamaged, Knole was bombed in 1944.

Sackville-West herself had low enthusiasm for naming plants in this way, and she and Nicolson actually dug up and discarded a rose that was named 'Lady Sackville' after her mother.{{sfn|Lord|1995|p=158}} There are numerous plants that have been given trade names based on the gardens, including ''[[Tanacetum parthenium]]'' 'Rowallane' which has often been mislabelled as 'Sissinghurst',{{sfn|Lord|1995|pp=138\u2013139}} but there are several that are grown at or were discovered at Sissinghurst and were named to reflect the association.\n\nSackville-West made an exception to her dislike of naming plants in memory of people and purchased [[Viola (plant)|''Viola'']] 'Lady Sackville' late in her life, around 1960, planting it in the Delos. A few years after her death, a seedling appeared that seems to have been a spontaneous cross between 'Lady Sackville' and the variety 'Nellie Britton' that was growing alongside it. It had flowers of a rich pink that were larger than those of the parent varieties. The gardeners named it 'Vita'.{{sfn|Lord|1995|p=159}} Sackville-West had also grown a variety of [[rosemary]] (''Rosmarinus officinalis'') that self-seeded in the Tower steps, and differed from the common variety in having upright rather than trailing stems, and flowers of a deeper shade of blue.

It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on [[Historic England]]'s [[register of historic parks and gardens]]. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \"squalor and slovenly disorder\"{{sfn|Jenkins|2003|p=381}} into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017.\n\nThe gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of [[old garden rose]]s. The writer [[Anne Scott-James]] considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \"one of the finest collections in the world\".{{sfn|Scott-James|1974|p=73}} A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The [[garden design]] is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \"garden rooms\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \"garden rooms\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist [[Tony Lord]] describing it as \"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\"{{sfn|Lord|1995|p=147}}\n\nThe site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the [[Middle Ages]]. The present-day buildings began as a house built in the 1530s by [[John Baker (died 1558)|Sir John Baker]]. In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset]], an ancestor of Vita Sackville-West. By the 18th century the Baker's fortunes had waned, and the house, renamed Sissinghurst Castle, was leased to the government to act as a prisoner-of-war camp during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The prisoners caused great damage and by the 19th century much of Sir Richard's house had been demolished. In the mid-19th century, the remaining buildings were in use as a [[workhouse]], and by the 20th century Sissinghurst had declined to the status of a farmstead. In 1928 the castle was advertised for sale but remained unsold for two years.\n\nSackville-West was born in 1892 at [[Knole]], the ancestral home of the [[Duke of Dorset|Sackvilles]]. But for her sex, Sackville-West would have inherited Knole on the death of her father in 1928. Instead, following [[primogeniture]], the house and the title passed to her uncle, a loss she felt deeply. In 1930, after she and Nicolson became concerned that their home [[Long Barn]] was threatened by development, Sackville-West bought Sissinghurst Castle. On purchasing Sissinghurst, Sackville-West and Nicolson inherited little more than some oak and nut trees, a [[quince]], and a single old rose. Sackville-West planted the [[noisette rose]] 'Madame Alfred Carri\u00e8re' on the south face of the South Cottage even before the deeds to the property had been signed. Nicolson was largely responsible for planning the garden design, while Sackville-West undertook the planting. Over the next thirty years, working with her head gardeners, she cultivated some two hundred varieties of roses and large numbers of other flowers and shrubs. Decades after Sackville-West and Nicolson created \"a garden where none was\",{{sfn|Nicolson|2008|p=285}} Sissinghurst remains a major influence on [[horticultural]] thought and practice.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe site is ancient; \"hurst\" is the [[Saxons|Saxon]] term for an enclosed wood. [[Nigel Nicolson]], in his 1964 guide, ''Sissinghurst Castle: An Illustrated History'', records the earliest owners as the de Saxinhersts.{{efn|Nicolson notes that \"the spelling of the name fluctuat(es) at the will of the scribe\". The brief early records of the site use Saxinherst, Saxingherste and Saxenhurst.{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|p=4}} Adam Nicolson suggests that the name derives from, or is the origin of, Sissinghurst, perhaps meaning \"the wood of the Saxons\".{{sfn|Nicolson|2008b|p=36}}}} Stephen de Saxinherst is named in an 1180 charter about the nearby [[Combwell Priory]]. At the end of the 13th century the estate had passed, through marriage, to the de Berhams.{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|pp=4\u20135}} Nicolson suggested that the de Berhams constructed a moated house in stone, of an appearance similar to that of [[Ightham Mote]], which was later replaced by a brick manor.{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|pp=5\u20136}} More recent studies, including those of Nicolson's son, [[Adam Nicolson|Adam]], cast doubt on the existence of an earlier stone manor, suggesting instead that the brick house, or perhaps a timber construction of a slightly earlier date, occupying the corner of the orchard nearest the moat, was the earliest house on the site.{{sfn|Nicolson|2008|pp=173\u2013174}} [[Edward I]] is reputed to have stayed at this house in 1305.{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|p=5}}\n\n===Rise, decline, collapse: c.1490\u20131930===\n[[File:Sissinghurst Castle 10.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.6|alt=Model of Sissinghurst Castle in 1560. From right to left: gatehouse, tower, brick courtyard, wooden courtyard; moat front and left|Model displayed at Sissinghurst depicting Sir Richard Baker's house circa 1560]]\nIn 1490 the de Berhams sold the manor of Sissinghurst to Thomas Baker of [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]].{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|p=6}} The Bakers were cloth producers and in the following century, through marriage and careers at court and in the law, Thomas's successors greatly expanded their wealth and their estates in Kent and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Nicolson|2008|pp=171\u2013172}} In the 1530s Sir John Baker, one of [[Henry VIII]]'s [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], built a new brick gatehouse, the current West Range.{{sfn|Newman|2012|p=544}}{{efn|The construction of new homes on sites adjacent to older houses was a fairly common practice in [[Tudor period|Tudor England]]. Sir John's approach was followed, for example, by the [[Duke of Norfolk]] at [[Kenninghall]].{{sfn|Howard|1987|p=17}}}} In 1554 Sir John's daughter Cecily married Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset, creating the earliest connection between the Sackville family and the house.{{sfn|Dennison|2015|p=204}} Sir John's son Richard undertook a massive [[Prodigy house|prodigy expansion]] in the 1560s. The Tower is part of that expansion, and formed the entrance to a very large courtyard house, of which the South Cottage and some walls are the only other remaining fragments.{{sfn|Newman|2012|pp=544\u2013545}} Sir Richard surrounded the mansion with an enclosed {{convert|700|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Deer park (England)|deer park]] and in August 1573 entertained [[Queen Elizabeth I]] at Sissinghurst.{{sfn|Greeves|2008|p=285}}\n\nAfter the collapse of the Baker family fortunes following the [[English Civil War|civil war]] (1642\u20131651), the building declined in importance. [[Horace Walpole]] visited in 1752: \"yesterday, after twenty mishaps, we got to Sissinghurst for dinner. There is a park in ruins and a house in ten times greater ruins.\"{{sfn|Nicolson|1964|p=24}} During the [[Seven Years' War]], it became a prisoner-of-war camp.{{sfn|Nicolson|2008b|p=44}}{{efn|An 18th century painting of the castle at this time was identified as being of Sissinghurst only in 2008. Showing the house before its destruction, it is the most complete record of the house as built by Sir Richard Baker.

Sackville-West herself had low enthusiasm for naming plants in this way, and she and Nicolson actually dug up and discarded a rose that was named 'Lady Sackville' after her mother.{{sfn|Lord|1995|p=158}} There are numerous plants that have been given trade names based on the gardens, including ''[[Tanacetum parthenium]]'' 'Rowallane' which has often been mislabelled as 'Sissinghurst',{{sfn|Lord|1995|pp=138\u2013139}} but there are several that are grown at or were discovered at Sissinghurst and were named to reflect the association.\n\nSackville-West made an exception to her dislike of naming plants in memory of people and purchased [[Viola (plant)|''Viola'']] 'Lady Sackville' late in her life, around 1960, planting it in the Delos. A few years after her death, a seedling appeared that seems to have been a spontaneous cross between 'Lady Sackville' and the variety 'Nellie Britton' that was growing alongside it. It had flowers of a rich pink that were larger than those of the parent varieties. The gardeners named it 'Vita'.{{sfn|Lord|1995|p=159}} Sackville-West had also grown a variety of [[rosemary]] (''Rosmarinus officinalis'') that self-seeded in the Tower steps, and differed from the common variety in having upright rather than trailing stems, and flowers of a deeper shade of blue.

When Bequaert first examined the first three specimens from New Orleans around 1940, he at first thought them to be perhaps [[Polistes crinitus|''P. crinitus'']] or [[Polistes versicolor|''P. versicolor'']] introduced from the [[Caribbean]].<ref name=Bequaert1940/> Snelling examined the same population and classified it as ''P. exclamans'' var. ''exclamans'' in 1955.<ref name=Snelling1955/>\n\nIt has also been seen as very similar to [[Polistes annularis|''P. annularis'']], with which it shares a slender first [[metasoma]]l segment. It can be distinguished from this species by the yellow spot on the [[mesopleuron]], and almost always having a yellow apical band on the posterior (back) margin of the [[tergum|tergites]] and more developed yellow markings on the mesosoma.<ref name=BugGuide/>\n\n==Distribution==\nThe known range has expanded as certain populations of wasps were determined to be this species, and with the collection of more specimens. \n\n===Bahamas===\nThe first specimens were first collected on [[New Providence Island]] in 1909. Bequaert and Salt described the species in 1931 from specimens collected on [[Acklins]], [[Andros Island]], [[Cat Island, Bahamas|Cat Island]], [[Crooked Island, Bahamas|Crooked Island]], [[Eleuthera]], [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]], [[Mariguana]], New Providence Island, [[Rum Cay]] and [[Watlings Island]].<ref name=Bequaert1931/><ref name=Bequaert1940/><ref name=Snelling1955/> Specimens were first collected on [[Mayaguana]] in 1996, and the reported range was extended further to [[Great Inagua]] in 2011, with the species now believed to occur on all the major islands of the Bahamas,<ref name=Starr2011>{{cite journal |last=Starr |first=Christopher K. |last2=Sewlal |first2=Jo-Anne N. |date=2011 |title=A Range Extension of the Social Wasp ''Polistes bahamansis'' (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) |url=https://uwispace.sta.uwi.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2139/13082/2011-P.BAHAMENSIS.pdf;sequence=1 |journal=International Journal of Bahamian Studies |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=1\u20142 |doi= |access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===USA===\nSnelling first extended the range of this species to southern [[Florida]] when he identified a group of specimens of wasps collected there since the late 1930s as belonging to this species in a 1955 article. The ''louisianus'' colour form described by Bequaert in 1940, considered a synonym of the nominate taxon of ''P. exclamans'' by Snelling at the time, was initially only known from [[New Orleans]], but Snelling also described having seen a single individual in a nest of ''P. exclamans'' in [[Kansas]].<ref name=Snelling1955/> The taxon is included in the 1979 ''Catalog of Hymenoptera in America north of Mexico'', which for some reason does not include endemic varieties found in the Bahamas as found in America north of Mexico, as a subspecies of ''P. exclamans''.

''bahamensis'', and the distribution is given as from \"Louisiana to Florida\".<ref name=Krombein1979/>\n\nSnelling reported the presence of this taxon in the USA again in 1983, stating its range included Florida, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Louisiana]].<ref name=BugGuide/><ref name=Kons2017/> A photograph of a number of wasps building a nest in coastal [[North Carolina]] in 2017 has been identified as being of this species.<ref name=GBIF/>\n\n==Ecology==\nIt has usually been recorded nesting under [[eaves]] of roofs of buildings<ref name=Starr2011/><ref name=Kons2018nests>{{cite web |url=http://www.lepidopterabiodiversity.com/Vespidae/AppendixB.htm |title=APPENDIX B: Nest Mate Associations of Florida Polistinae Species |last=Kons |first=Hugo L.

By recognising the New Orleans specimens as ''bahamensis'' in 1983, Snelling effectively expanded the known distribution of this taxon hundreds of kilometres down the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref name=Snelling1983/> As of 2017 Kons and Rowan consider that all or at least part of the US population should be split off into a separate species, ''P. louisianus''; -these writers believe that many ''Polistes'' species should be split into numerous [[sympatric]] species based on small differences in their body colour.<ref name=Kons2017b/><ref name=Kons2017>{{cite web |url=http://www.lepidopterabiodiversity.com/Vespidae/CL/bahamensis.htm |title=''Polistes bahamensis'' specimen images in A Preliminary Illustrated Check List of the Paper Wasps and Hornets of Florida (Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Polistinae & Vespinae) |last=Kons |first=Hugo L.

When Bequaert first examined the first three specimens from New Orleans around 1940, he at first thought them to be perhaps [[Polistes crinitus|''P. crinitus'']] or [[Polistes versicolor|''P. versicolor'']] introduced from the [[Caribbean]].<ref name=Bequaert1940/> Snelling examined the same population and classified it as ''P. exclamans'' var. ''exclamans'' in 1955.<ref name=Snelling1955/>\n\nIt has also been seen as very similar to [[Polistes annularis|''P. annularis'']], with which it shares a slender first [[metasoma]]l segment. It can be distinguished from this species by the yellow spot on the [[mesopleuron]], and almost always having a yellow apical band on the posterior (back) margin of the [[tergum|tergites]] and more developed yellow markings on the mesosoma.<ref name=BugGuide/>\n\n==Distribution==\nThe known range has expanded as certain populations of wasps were determined to be this species, and with the collection of more specimens. \n\n===Bahamas===\nThe first specimens were first collected on [[New Providence Island]] in 1909. Bequaert and Salt described the species in 1931 from specimens collected on [[Acklins]], [[Andros Island]], [[Cat Island, Bahamas|Cat Island]], [[Crooked Island, Bahamas|Crooked Island]], [[Eleuthera]], [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]], [[Mariguana]], New Providence Island, [[Rum Cay]] and [[Watlings Island]].<ref name=Bequaert1931/><ref name=Bequaert1940/><ref name=Snelling1955/> Specimens were first collected on [[Mayaguana]] in 1996, and the reported range was extended further to [[Great Inagua]] in 2011, with the species now believed to occur on all the major islands of the Bahamas,<ref name=Starr2011>{{cite journal |last=Starr |first=Christopher K. |last2=Sewlal |first2=Jo-Anne N. |date=2011 |title=A Range Extension of the Social Wasp ''Polistes bahamansis'' (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) |url=https://uwispace.sta.uwi.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2139/13082/2011-P.BAHAMENSIS.pdf;sequence=1 |journal=International Journal of Bahamian Studies |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=1\u20142 |doi= |access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===USA===\nSnelling first extended the range of this species to southern [[Florida]] when he identified a group of specimens of wasps collected there since the late 1930s as belonging to this species in a 1955 article. The ''louisianus'' colour form described by Bequaert in 1940, considered a synonym of the nominate taxon of ''P. exclamans'' by Snelling at the time, was initially only known from [[New Orleans]], but Snelling also described having seen a single individual in a nest of ''P. exclamans'' in [[Kansas]].<ref name=Snelling1955/> The taxon is included in the 1979 ''Catalog of Hymenoptera in America north of Mexico'', which for some reason does not include endemic varieties found in the Bahamas as found in America north of Mexico, as a subspecies of ''P. exclamans''. In this work ''louisianus'' is considered a synonym of ''P. exclamans'' var. ''bahamensis'', and the distribution is given as from \"Louisiana to Florida\".<ref name=Krombein1979/>\n\nSnelling reported the presence of this taxon in the USA again in 1983, stating its range included Florida, [[Georgia (state)|Georgia]] and [[Louisiana]].<ref name=BugGuide/><ref name=Kons2017/> A photograph of a number of wasps building a nest in coastal [[North Carolina]] in 2017 has been identified as being of this species.<ref name=GBIF/>\n\n==Ecology==\nIt has usually been recorded nesting under [[eaves]] of roofs of buildings<ref name=Starr2011/><ref name=Kons2018nests>{{cite web |url=http://www.lepidopterabiodiversity.com/Vespidae/AppendixB.htm |title=APPENDIX B: Nest Mate Associations of Florida Polistinae Species |last=Kons |first=Hugo L.

The family moved to [[London]]. He began writing plays in 1985.\n\n===HAC Period===\nIn 1986 aged 19, Bancil joined Hounslow Arts Co-op. One of four professional British Asian theatre companies at the time, HAC was the only one to be telling stories from a 2nd generation British Asian perspective. While most were writing about partition, or leaving their homeland, Parv Bancil was writing about his world, and tackling issues that were affecting British Asian youth, such as gang culture, drugs, crime and identity. From 1986 to 1989 he wrote four plays: ''Curse Of The Dead Dog'' (1986), ''How's Your Skull Does It Fit'' (1987), ''Kings'' (1988) and ''Bad Company'' (1989). And he quickly gained a reputation as a dynamic, uncompromising and controversial writer, long before it was fashionable. He also acted in many plays, was the founder member of One Nation Under A Groove Innit, (an umbrella organization that produced comedy), was one half of a comic double act called The Khrai Twins, based on two bumbling drunken Southall gangsters, and a member of a comedy trio called the Sycophantic Sponge Bunch. He was also part of a spoof rock band called The Dead Jalebies. Formed in 1987, they toured nationally and opened for [[Asian Dub Foundation]] in 1991 at the Camden Underworld. They also supported the [[Voodoo Queens]] in 1993.\n\n===Nadir===\nIn 1991 he was the recipient of a [[BBC Radio 4]] Young Playwright Award for his play ''Nadir'', about a young second generation Asian man fresh out of prison. It was produced and directed by [[Frances-Anne Solomon]], and performed by actors [[Rita Wolf]], [[Nina Wadia]], Neran Persaud and Ravinder Gill. \"I wrote a play for BBC Radio set in the near future when Britain was being run by an extreme right-wing government. Everyone had to swear allegiance to the country and if they didn't adhere to British culture they were not welcome. The BBC tried to ban it until four producers stood by me and put their necks on the line for it. The critics said it was laughable, that it would never happen. But now we have an immigration policy and people do have to swear allegiance to the flag (the so-called Britishness test where applicants for citizenship have to demonstrate a knowledge and integration of British culture).\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+living+black+and+white;+THEATRE+Parv+Bancil+tells+Alison+Jones+how...-a0165993873|title=In living black and white; THEATRE Parv Bancil tells Alison Jones how events in Lozells inspired his latest play.|last=Jones|first=Alison|website=Free Online Library|access-date=2017-04-14}}</ref>\n\n===Ungrateful Dead===\nBy this point HAC had disbanded. But In 1993 Bancil wrote ''Ungrateful Dead'', a play about a young Sikh man's descent into a world of gangs, violence and drugs. The play had a huge impact on audiences, and lead to a residency at The Royal Court Theatre.\n\n===Papa Was A Bus Conductor===\nIn 1995 Bancil wrote ''Papa Was A Bus Conductor'', a comedy satire about a dysfunctional family that was an early flowering of the British Asian comedy boom that spawned Goodness Gracious Me. It was his first play to receive a TimeOut Critics Choice. And it was the first of its kind to spark a trend for a whole spate of Asian comedy that followed over the next 10 years.\n\n===Crazy Horse===\nBancil's next two plays were to define him as one of the 'In Yer Face' writers that dominated the 90s. In 1997 he wrote ''Crazy Horse''. It follows Jas, a young man trying to deal with the death of his mother by losing himself in a world of petty crime, until a tragic accident forces an estranged father and son to confront each other, but with sinister consequences. It was developed through 'Wild Lunch' with Sarah Kane and was directed by Vicky Featherstone, and received another Time Out Critics Choice. \n\n===Made In England===\nThe following year Bancil then wrote ''Made In England'', initially commissioned as a 15-minute piece by the Red Room. It was first performed as a full-length play in October 1998. Set against the backdrop of the music industry and \"cool Britannia\", it looked at the idea of trading your cultural identity for success. This play received Time Out Critics Choice twice.\n\n===Later Work===\n''Bollywood Or Bust'' (1999) a farcical comedy, and ''Recall'' (2000), a combined dance theatre piece with Darshan Singh Bhullar, followed. The next few years saw ''Papa'' and ''Made In England'' re staged and Bancil also began to become known as a cultural commentator, writing articles for magazines and newspapers, and often contributing to radio and television debate. He also began to write and present TV documentary and venture into film and screen writing. 2007 saw another collaboration with Bhullar for ''Find Me Amongst The Black''. And from 2008\u20132009 he was on an attachment with The Soho Theatre. In 2010 he had two new stage plays, ''Dead Leaves'' and ''Rude Boy'', ready to go into production. After taking a year out to study film-making, Bancil began writing screenplays. He also became known as a cultural commentator. In 2008 he asked \"what have multicultural arts policies done for us?\" in a piece for ''The Guardian''.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was married to actress [[Shivani Ghai]]. He died in London on 1 April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39488703|title=Tributes paid to 'hero' playwright Parv Bancil|date=4 April 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.aurorametro.com/product/black-and-asian-plays/]\n* [http://www.faber.co.uk/author/parv-bancil Parv Bancil | Authors | Faber & Faber ]\n* [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051607/bio IMDB]\n* [http://www.parvbancil.com/ Parv Bancil's website]\n* [https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/bushgreen/a-letter-to-parv-bancil-from-madani-younis-you-represented-the-spirit-and-the-fight-that-has-defined-our-struggle-as-artists/ A Letter to Parv Bancil from Madani Younis: \u201cYou represented the spirit and the fight that has defined our struggle as artists\u201d]\n* [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WPknBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT124&lpg=PT124&dq=parv+bancil&source=bl&ots=MjXr7OCgDd&sig=iWDHoJzI3_W7AYjwkfyMSHpiZgY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiiwd7a1pDTAhUj4oMKHT0fCcE4FBDoAQg3MAc#v=onepage&q=parv%20bancil&f=false British Asian Theatre: Dramaturgy, Process, and Performance, ]\n*[http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/music/lozells-race-riots-sparked-writers-42384 Race Riots Sparked Writer's Play]\n*[http://asianculturevulture.com/portfolios/parv-bancil-pioneer-playwright-paved-way-next-gen-obituary/ Parv Bancil \u2013 Pioneer playwright who paved the way for next gen \u2013 obituary by Suman Bhuchar]\n*[https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2017/obituary-parv-bancil/ The Stage: Obituary]\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08lk540 BBC Radio 4 \"Last Word\" obituary]\n*[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/gautam-malkani/parv-bancil-an-appreciati_1_b_16229178.html Parv Bancil: An Appreciation]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bancil, Parveen}}\n[[Category:1967 births]]\n[[Category:2017 deaths]]\n[[Category:British television presenters]]\n[[Category:British Asian writers]]\n[[Category:Moshi, Tanzania]]\n[[Category:People from Kilimanjaro Region]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}\n\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox person\n| honorific_prefix =\n| name = Parv Bancil\n| honorific_suffix =\n| image =\n| caption = ParvBancil1967-2017\n| birth_name =Parveen Singh Bancil\n| birth_date = {{Birth date|1967|02|07|df=yes}}\n| birth_place = [[Moshi, Tanzania]]\n| death_date ={{Death date and age | 2017| 4| 01|1967|3|30| df=yes}}\n| death_place = [[Camden, London]], United Kingdom\n| death_cause =\n| resting_place =\n| resting_place_coordinates = <!-- {{Coord|LAT|LONG|display=inline}} -->\n| monuments =\n| residence = [[London]] \n| nationality =British\n| other_names =\n| education =\n| alma_mater =\n| occupation = {{Unbulleted list| Playwright }}\n| years_active =\n| employer =\n| organization =\n| agent =\n| known_for =\n| notable_works =\n| style =\n| home_town =\n| television =\n| spouse =\n| partner =\n| children =\n| parents =\n| relatives =\n| awards =\n| website = <!-- {{URL|www.example.com}} -->\n| religion =\n}}\n\n'''Parv Bancil''' (7 February 1967 \u2013 1 April 2017) was a British-Asian playwright and actor.\n\n==Life and Career==\nParveen Singh Bancil was born in Tanzania in 1967, where his mother died when he was two years old.
