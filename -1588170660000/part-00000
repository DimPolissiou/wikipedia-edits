The history of China and its administrative divisions is long and convoluted; hence, this chart will cover only capitals after the completion of the Mongol conquest of China in 1279, because the modern province ({{lang|zh-Latn|sh\u011bng}} {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7701}}}}) was first created during the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]]. A selection of country subdivisions and their capitals before 1279 can be found in the article [[History of the political divisions of China]]. Years may not line up perfectly during periods of turmoil (e.g. at the end of each dynasty).\n\nThe list includes current and former provinces, as well as other first-level units that have been used over the course of China's recent history, such as [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], military command zones during the Qing dynasty, and so forth. Unless otherwise specified, a given administrative unit can be assumed to be a [[provinces of China|province]] with its present name. Historical names of provinces and entities that are not provinces will be specified as they arise.\n\nExcluded from the list:\n\n* units below the first level;\n* [[Direct-controlled municipalities of China]] and [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]];\n* subnational entities of short-lived regimes, such as the [[Taiping Rebellion|Heavenly Kingdom of Taiping]], the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]], [[Manchukuo]], [[Mengjiang]], [[Wang Jingwei Government]], etc. This is because their provinces were usually transitory in existence and tend to be smaller than usual.\n\nMany of the capitals given in this chart have had multiple historical names during different dynasties.

Boyett]], [[Thomas L. Miller]] and [[Chris Thompson (TV producer)|Chris Thompson]] ([[Miller-Boyett Productions|Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions]]). It aired for two seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from November 27, 1980, to March 27, 1982, and in reruns in the summer of 1984 on [[NBC]]. The show features the misadventures of two single men, working in creative advertising, struggling in their industry while disguising themselves as women in order to live in the one apartment they could afford. Gender stereotypes and male/female interpersonal relationships were frequent themes.\n\nThe show became known for its quirky humor and its frequent use of [[improvisation]], especially between stars Hanks and Scolari. Though the show started out with good ratings, it failed to hold the public's interest and was canceled after two seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nIn the pilot episode, after their own apartment is demolished (while they are still asleep in it), two men disguise themselves as women in order to live in the dirt-cheap Susan B. Anthony Hotel (which happens to be female-only). Kip Wilson (Hanks) is originally skeptical of the plan, but after meeting gorgeous resident model/dancer/nurse Sonny Lumet ([[Donna Dixon]]), he ends up convincing aspiring writer Henry Desmond (Scolari) that the experience will make a great book. Their co-worker, Amy Cassidy ([[Wendie Jo Sperber]]) [who's attracted to Henry] is the only resident in on the plan. The boys\u2019 deception includes outwitting the hotel manager, Darlene ([[Edie Adams]]), and fellow resident, Isabelle Hammond ([[Telma Hopkins]]), an aspiring singer. When the pilot sold to ABC, the character of Darlene was replaced by Lilly Sinclair ([[Lucille Benson]]).\n\nIn the first season, Kip, Henry, and Amy work for Ruth Dunbar ([[Holland Taylor]]) at the [[Manhattan]]-based advertising firm of Livingston, Gentry & Mishkin, where Kip is a graphic artist, Henry is a copy writer, and Amy is the receptionist. Ruth often takes credit for the boys\u2019 work when reporting to her (unseen) boss, Mr. Rubinowitz.\n\nThe show was barely renewed for a second season. In order to improve the mediocre ratings of the first season, revise the format, and at the same time, do some cost-cutting, it was decided that the part of Lilly Sinclair was superfluous and was written out. As a result, veteran actress Lucille Benson left the series and Telma Hopkins' character of Isabelle became the new hotel manager. Kip, Henry and Amy left Livingston, Gentry & Mishkin to start their own advertising firm, Sixty Seconds Street, with Ruth serving as a not-quite silent partner.\n\nIn the first episode of the second season, the male characters\u2019 ruse of living in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] is revealed, but they are allowed to continue living at the women-only hotel anyway. Sonny forgives Kip for the deception, and Isabelle, the new hotel manager, agrees to go along with the ruse rather than admit it to the other residents. From this point on, the drag element was de-emphasized and the show moved closer to the creators' original concept of a regular buddy comedy.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as Kip Wilson/Buffy (when in drag)\n*[[Peter Scolari]] as Henry Desmond/Hildegard (when in drag)\n*[[Wendie Jo Sperber]] as Amy Cassidy, co-worker and friend who knows their secret\n*[[Holland Taylor]] as Ruth Dunbar, their boss\n*[[Donna Dixon]] as Sonny Lumet, Kip's love interest and hotel resident\n*[[Telma Hopkins]] as Isabelle Hammond, hotel resident; hotel manager in season 2\n*[[Lucille Benson]] as Lilly Sinclair, hotel manager (season 1)\n\n==Production==\nThe series was conceived by [[Miller-Boyett Productions|Miller and Boyett]] as a male counterpart to their hit sitcom ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]''. They originally pitched it as a straightforward buddy comedy done in what they described as \"a sophisticated Billy Wilder kind of way.\" When ABC executives asked Miller and Boyett to explain what they meant by the comparison to Wilder, the producers mentioned ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ABC bought the show on condition that it would include men in women's clothing, just like that movie. \"We weren't there to pitch that,\" Miller recalled. \"And they jumped on it! We drove back to the studio in the car saying, 'Oh my God, what are we gonna do? We have to do something in drag.'\"<ref name=\"sonsky\">{{Citation|last =Sonsky| first= Steve |title= Do Not Adjust Your Set. This Is As Good As It Gets (A Critic Tells Why TV's Greatest Art May Always Be Carney)|newspaper= Miami Herald|date=August 3, 1986}}</ref>\n\nAfter the cast had been chosen, Miller and Boyett asked Chris Thompson, one of the writer-producers of ''Laverne & Shirley'', to write the pilot and be the series [[showrunner]]. Thompson (who would go on to executive-produce such shows as ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'') said later that he took the job purely for the money, but unexpectedly found it to be \"my completely favorite experience in show business\", because the network left him and his young cast free to experiment. \"We were left alone,\" he recalled. \"Nobody was paying attention to us. We were all really young, but it was like we had daddy's Porsche. We had $500,000 to play with every week.\"<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60house+rules'+exec+breaks+the+mold%3b+honesty+works+for+this+tv+guy-a083814230 ''House Rules'' Exec Breaks The Mold; Honesty Works For This TV Guy.{{spaced ndash}}Free Online Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n''Bosom Buddies'' was taped on Stage 25 at Paramount Pictures.  Stage 25 was also the home of ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', and its spin-off ''[[Frasier]]''.\n\nLike many other sitcoms that aired during the 1980-81 television season, ''Bosom Buddies'' felt the effects of a strike by the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] that occurred in 1980. As a result, the show had an abbreviated first season. At first, its ratings were strong. However, ABC kept switching the show's day and time slots, which hurt the first season's overall standing. The second season, with its revised premise, fared even worse, and after more time slot changes by the network, the show was canceled in the spring of 1982.\n\n''Bosom Buddies'' was one of the last shows to use the Miller-Milkis-Boyett production team due to Eddie Milkis leaving the company in 1984. This was also one of the last Miller-Boyett sitcoms to be produced by [[Paramount Television]] (now [[CBS Television Studios]]) before they moved their base of operations to [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar Productions]] (later [[Warner Bros. Television]]); ''[[Happy Days]]'' ended its run in 1984, making the latter the last program to meet cancellation before the Miller-Boyett move to Lorimar, with ''[[The Hogan Family|Valerie]]'' being the first since to debut.\n\n==Episodes==\nWhile the [[television pilot|pilot episode]] was shot on [[Film stock|film]], the rest of the series was shot on [[videotape]].\n\n{{Series overview\n|

Some reruns shown in syndication (such as when [[USA Network]] aired reruns, as well as its later runs on [[MeTV]]) and all home video and DVD releases use a vocal version of the show's end credit instrumental theme, \"Shake Me Loose\", performed by [[Stephanie Mills]], for the opening credits, replacing \"My Life\".\n\n==Syndication==\n''Bosom Buddies'' reruns aired briefly on NBC in the summer of 1984 after Tom Hanks had become a major film star that summer with ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' and ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]''. Ratings were good, however any chances of reviving the show were futile since Hanks would obviously not be available. Reruns also aired on USA Network up until November 18, 1995 as well as on TBS and TV Land up until the mid-2000s. Nickelodeon UK also aired reruns of ''Bosom Buddies'' from November 1, 1995 - February 4, 2001 as part of its nightly  Paramount Comedy Channel (originally The Paramount Channel) programming block until Paramount Comedy became its own 24/7 UK channel separate from Nickelodeon.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-bDbDhIrdo</ref> More recently, ''Bosom Buddies'' began airing on Me-TV on October 2, 2011 and again on Thursday nights beginning May 29, 2014, as part of the network's \"Summer of Me\" promotion.  As of April 6, 2020, the show is on [[Decades_(TV_network)|Decades]] during its \"Television Through the Decades\" morning/afternoon block.\n\n==Home media==\n[[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount]]) released both seasons of ''Bosom Buddies'' on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]]. The original theme song \"My Life\" by [[Billy Joel]] was replaced with \"Shake Me Loose\", a song penned by show creator Chris Thompson, which was used during the show's syndication run.  Many of the musical numbers featured during the show's run are edited or eliminated altogether from the DVD releases. Notable in this vein are the songs \"Yakkity Yak\" (from the episode \"Call Me Irresponsible\"), \"Chances Are\" (from \"All You Need is Love\") and \"Rock and Roll Heaven\" (from \"Hildy's Dirt Nap\"). \n\nOn February 6, 2018, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] released ''Bosom Buddies- The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.<ref>[http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Bosom-Buddies-The-Complete-Series/23800 Tom Hanks, Peter Scolari, Telma Hopkins in 'The Complete Series']</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Boyett]], [[Thomas L. Miller]] and [[Chris Thompson (TV producer)|Chris Thompson]] ([[Miller-Boyett Productions|Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions]]). It aired for two seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from November 27, 1980, to March 27, 1982, and in reruns in the summer of 1984 on [[NBC]]. The show features the misadventures of two single men, working in creative advertising, struggling in their industry while disguising themselves as women in order to live in the one apartment they could afford. Gender stereotypes and male/female interpersonal relationships were frequent themes.\n\nThe show became known for its quirky humor and its frequent use of [[improvisation]], especially between stars Hanks and Scolari. Though the show started out with good ratings, it failed to hold the public's interest and was canceled after two seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nIn the pilot episode, after their own apartment is demolished (while they are still asleep in it), two men disguise themselves as women in order to live in the dirt-cheap Susan B. Anthony Hotel (which happens to be female-only). Kip Wilson (Hanks) is originally skeptical of the plan, but after meeting gorgeous resident model/dancer/nurse Sonny Lumet ([[Donna Dixon]]), he ends up convincing aspiring writer Henry Desmond (Scolari) that the experience will make a great book. Their co-worker, Amy Cassidy ([[Wendie Jo Sperber]]) [who's attracted to Henry] is the only resident in on the plan. The boys\u2019 deception includes outwitting the hotel manager, Darlene ([[Edie Adams]]), and fellow resident, Isabelle Hammond ([[Telma Hopkins]]), an aspiring singer. When the pilot sold to ABC, the character of Darlene was replaced by Lilly Sinclair ([[Lucille Benson]]).\n\nIn the first season, Kip, Henry, and Amy work for Ruth Dunbar ([[Holland Taylor]]) at the [[Manhattan]]-based advertising firm of Livingston, Gentry & Mishkin, where Kip is a graphic artist, Henry is a copy writer, and Amy is the receptionist. Ruth often takes credit for the boys\u2019 work when reporting to her (unseen) boss, Mr. Rubinowitz.\n\nThe show was barely renewed for a second season. In order to improve the mediocre ratings of the first season, revise the format, and at the same time, do some cost-cutting, it was decided that the part of Lilly Sinclair was superfluous and was written out. As a result, veteran actress Lucille Benson left the series and Telma Hopkins' character of Isabelle became the new hotel manager. Kip, Henry and Amy left Livingston, Gentry & Mishkin to start their own advertising firm, Sixty Seconds Street, with Ruth serving as a not-quite silent partner.\n\nIn the first episode of the second season, the male characters\u2019 ruse of living in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] is revealed, but they are allowed to continue living at the women-only hotel anyway. Sonny forgives Kip for the deception, and Isabelle, the new hotel manager, agrees to go along with the ruse rather than admit it to the other residents. From this point on, the drag element was de-emphasized and the show moved closer to the creators' original concept of a regular buddy comedy.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as Kip Wilson/Buffy (when in drag)\n*[[Peter Scolari]] as Henry Desmond/Hildegard (when in drag)\n*[[Wendie Jo Sperber]] as Amy Cassidy, co-worker and friend who knows their secret\n*[[Holland Taylor]] as Ruth Dunbar, their boss\n*[[Donna Dixon]] as Sonny Lumet, Kip's love interest and hotel resident\n*[[Telma Hopkins]] as Isabelle Hammond, hotel resident; hotel manager in season 2\n*[[Lucille Benson]] as Lilly Sinclair, hotel manager (season 1)\n\n==Production==\nThe series was conceived by [[Miller-Boyett Productions|Miller and Boyett]] as a male counterpart to their hit sitcom ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]''. They originally pitched it as a straightforward buddy comedy done in what they described as \"a sophisticated Billy Wilder kind of way.\" When ABC executives asked Miller and Boyett to explain what they meant by the comparison to Wilder, the producers mentioned ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ABC bought the show on condition that it would include men in women's clothing, just like that movie. \"We weren't there to pitch that,\" Miller recalled. \"And they jumped on it! We drove back to the studio in the car saying, 'Oh my God, what are we gonna do? We have to do something in drag.'\"<ref name=\"sonsky\">{{Citation|last =Sonsky| first= Steve |title= Do Not Adjust Your Set. This Is As Good As It Gets (A Critic Tells Why TV's Greatest Art May Always Be Carney)|newspaper= Miami Herald|date=August 3, 1986}}</ref>\n\nAfter the cast had been chosen, Miller and Boyett asked Chris Thompson, one of the writer-producers of ''Laverne & Shirley'', to write the pilot and be the series [[showrunner]]. Thompson (who would go on to executive-produce such shows as ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'') said later that he took the job purely for the money, but unexpectedly found it to be \"my completely favorite experience in show business\", because the network left him and his young cast free to experiment. \"We were left alone,\" he recalled. \"Nobody was paying attention to us. We were all really young, but it was like we had daddy's Porsche. We had $500,000 to play with every week.\"<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%60house+rules'+exec+breaks+the+mold%3b+honesty+works+for+this+tv+guy-a083814230 ''House Rules'' Exec Breaks The Mold; Honesty Works For This TV Guy.{{spaced ndash}}Free Online Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n''Bosom Buddies'' was taped on Stage 25 at Paramount Pictures.  Stage 25 was also the home of ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', and its spin-off ''[[Frasier]]''.\n\nLike many other sitcoms that aired during the 1980-81 television season, ''Bosom Buddies'' felt the effects of a strike by the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] that occurred in 1980. As a result, the show had an abbreviated first season. At first, its ratings were strong. However, ABC kept switching the show's day and time slots, which hurt the first season's overall standing. The second season, with its revised premise, fared even worse, and after more time slot changes by the network, the show was canceled in the spring of 1982.\n\n''Bosom Buddies'' was one of the last shows to use the Miller-Milkis-Boyett production team due to Eddie Milkis leaving the company in 1984. This was also one of the last Miller-Boyett sitcoms to be produced by [[Paramount Television]] (now [[CBS Television Studios]]) before they moved their base of operations to [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar Productions]] (later [[Warner Bros. Television]]); ''[[Happy Days]]'' ended its run in 1984, making the latter the last program to meet cancellation before the Miller-Boyett move to Lorimar, with ''[[The Hogan Family|Valerie]]'' being the first since to debut.\n\n==Episodes==\nWhile the [[television pilot|pilot episode]] was shot on [[Film stock|film]], the rest of the series was shot on [[videotape]].\n\n{{Series overview\n|

Some reruns shown in syndication (such as when [[USA Network]] aired reruns, as well as its later runs on [[MeTV]]) and all home video and DVD releases use a vocal version of the show's end credit instrumental theme, \"Shake Me Loose\", performed by [[Stephanie Mills]], for the opening credits, replacing \"My Life\".\n\n==Syndication==\n''Bosom Buddies'' reruns aired briefly on NBC in the summer of 1984 after Tom Hanks had become a major film star that summer with ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'' and ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]''. Ratings were good, however any chances of reviving the show were futile since Hanks would obviously not be available. Reruns also aired on USA Network up until November 18, 1995 as well as on TBS and TV Land up until the mid-2000s. Nickelodeon UK also aired reruns of ''Bosom Buddies'' from November 1, 1995 - February 4, 2001 as part of its nightly  Paramount Comedy Channel (originally The Paramount Channel) programming block until Paramount Comedy became its own 24/7 UK channel separate from Nickelodeon.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-bDbDhIrdo</ref> More recently, ''Bosom Buddies'' began airing on Me-TV on October 2, 2011 and again on Thursday nights beginning May 29, 2014, as part of the network's \"Summer of Me\" promotion.  As of April 6, 2020, the show is on [[Decades_(TV_network)|Decades]] during its \"Television Through the Decades\" morning/afternoon block.\n\n==Home media==\n[[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount]]) released both seasons of ''Bosom Buddies'' on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]]. The original theme song \"My Life\" by [[Billy Joel]] was replaced with \"Shake Me Loose\", a song penned by show creator Chris Thompson, which was used during the show's syndication run.  Many of the musical numbers featured during the show's run are edited or eliminated altogether from the DVD releases. Notable in this vein are the songs \"Yakkity Yak\" (from the episode \"Call Me Irresponsible\"), \"Chances Are\" (from \"All You Need is Love\") and \"Rock and Roll Heaven\" (from \"Hildy's Dirt Nap\"). \n\nOn February 6, 2018, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] released ''Bosom Buddies- The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.<ref>[http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Bosom-Buddies-The-Complete-Series/23800 Tom Hanks, Peter Scolari, Telma Hopkins in 'The Complete Series']</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The theme song \"My Life\" by Billy Joel is actually sung by Joel instead of the sound-alike version used for the original TV series. In an extended mock \"making-of\" documentary preceding the opening credits remake, Hanks, Scolari, and Joel make cameo appearances. In Season 5 Episode 20 of the [[NBC]] comedy ''[[30 Rock]]'', Hanks makes a cameo appearance wherein he references ''Bosom Buddies'' by singing lines from that show's theme song, \"My Life\".<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2382106/trivia?tab=mc&ref_=tt_trv_cnn</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cross-dressing in film and television]]\n* ''[[Three's Company]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0080202}}\n* {{epguides|id=BosomBuddies}}\n\n{{MillerBoyett|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:1980 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1982 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1980s American workplace comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:Cross-dressing in television]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in New York City]]\n", "name_user": "SnapSnap", "label": "safe", "comment": "redundant", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosom_Buddies"}

'''Aliphatic amines''' contain only H and alkyl substituents. '''[[Aromatic amine]]s''' have the nitrogen atom connected to an [[aromaticity|aromatic]] ring.\n\n<!-- [[primary amine]] redirects to this section -->\nAmines, alkyl and aryl alike, are organized into three subcategories [[#amino_group_connectivity_table|<small>(see table)</small>]] based on the number of carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen:<ref name=OChemSmith3E />\n\n*'''Primary (1\u00b0) amines'''\u2014Primary amines arise when one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by an [[alkyl]] or [[aromatic]] group. Important primary alkyl amines include, [[methylamine]], most [[amino acid]]s,  and the [[buffering agent]] [[tris]], while primary aromatic amines include [[aniline]].\n*'''Secondary (2\u00b0) amines'''\u2014Secondary amines have two organic substituents (alkyl, aryl or both) bound to the nitrogen together with one hydrogen. Important representatives include [[dimethylamine]], while an example of an aromatic amine would be [[diphenylamine]].\n*'''Tertiary (3\u00b0) amines'''\u2014In tertiary amines, nitrogen has three organic substituents. Examples include [[trimethylamine]], which has a distinctively fishy smell, and [[EDTA]].\n\nA fourth subcategory is determined by the connectivity of the substituents attached to the nitrogen:\n*'''Cyclic amines'''\u2014[[Cyclic compound|Cyclic]] amines are either secondary or tertiary amines. Examples of cyclic amines include the 3-membered ring [[aziridine]] and the six-membered ring [[piperidine]]. ''N''-methylpiperidine and ''N''-phenylpiperidine are examples of cyclic tertiary amines.\n\nIt is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen. These species are not amines but are [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s and have a charged nitrogen center.  Quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions.\n\n==Naming conventions==\nAmines are named in several ways. Typically, the compound is given the prefix \"amino-\" or the suffix \"-amine\". The prefix \"''N''-\" shows substitution on the nitrogen atom. An organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine, triamine, tetraamine and so forth.\n\nSystematic names for some common amines:\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"\n| Lower amines are named with the suffix ''-amine''.<br>\n[[File:Methylamine.svg|100px]]<br>\n'''methylamine'''\n| Higher amines have the prefix ''amino'' as a functional group. IUPAC however does not recommend this convention,{{fact|date=July 2017}} but prefers the alkanamine form, e.g. pentan-2-amine. <br>\n[[File:2-amino-pentane.png|150px]]<br>\n'''2-aminopentane'''<br>(or sometimes: ''pent-2-yl-amine'' or ''pentan-2-amine'')\n|}\n\n==Physical properties==\n[[Hydrogen bonding]] significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines. For example, [[Methylamine|methyl]] and [[Ethylamine|ethyl]] amines are gases under standard conditions, whereas the corresponding [[Methanol|methyl]] and [[Ethanol|ethyl]] alcohols are liquids. Amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell, liquid amines have a distinctive \"fishy\" smell.\n\nThe nitrogen atom features a [[lone electron pair]] that can bind H<sup>+</sup> to form an [[ammonium ion]] R<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>+</sup>. The lone electron pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the N. The water [[solubility]] of simple amines is enhanced by [[hydrogen bonding]] involving these lone electron pairs.  Typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water: primary ammonium ({{chem|RNH|3|+}}) > secondary ammonium ({{chem|R|2|NH|2|+}}) > tertiary ammonium (R<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>+</sup>). Small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many [[solvent]]s, whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic. Aromatic amines, such as [[aniline]], have their lone pair electrons [[conjugated system|conjugated]] into the benzene ring, thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished. Their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low.\n\n===Spectroscopic identification===\nTypically the presence of an amine functional group is deduced by a combination of techniques, including mass spectrometry as well as NMR and IR spectroscopies.  <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals for amines disappear upon treatment of the sample with D<sub>2</sub>O.  In their [[infrared spectrum]] primary amines exhibit two N-H bands, whereas secondary amines exhibit only one.<ref name=OChemSmith3E />\n\n==Structure==\n===Alkyl amines===\nAlkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers.  C-N-C and C-N-H angles approach the idealized angle of 109\u00b0.  C-N distances are slightly shorter than C-C distances.  The energy barrier for the [[nitrogen inversion]] of the stereocenter is about 7&nbsp;[[kcal/mol]] for a trialkylamine. The interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind.\n\nAmines of the type NHRR\u2032 and NRR\u2032R\u2033 are [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]: the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair. Because of the low barrier to inversion, amines of the type NHRR\u2032 cannot be obtained in optical purity.  For chiral tertiary amines, NRR\u2032R\u2033 can only be resolved when the R, R\u2032, and R\u2033 groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as N-substituted [[aziridine]]s ([[quaternary ammonium salt]]s are resolvable).\n{|  style=\"width:272px; float:right; margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:1ex;\"\n |[[File:Amine R-N.svg|76px]]\n | style=\"font-size:200%\" |&nbsp;\u21cc&nbsp;\n |[[File:Amine N-R.svg|76px]]\n |-\n | colspan=3 style=\"font-size:small\" |Inversion of an amine. The pair of dots represents the lone electron pair on the nitrogen atom.\n|}\n\n===Aromatic amines===\nIn aromatic amines (\"anilines\"), nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent.  The C-N distance is correspondingly shorter.  In aniline, the C-N distance is the same as the C-C distances.<ref>G. M.

Correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects. Solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines (anilines). For anilines, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen delocalises into the ring, resulting in decreased basicity.  Substituents on the aromatic ring, and their positions relative to the amino group, also affect basicity as seen in the table.\n\n===Solvation effects===\nSolvation significantly affects the basicity of amines.  N-H groups strongly interact with water, especially in ammonium ions. Consequently, the basicity of ammonia is enhanced by 10<sup>11</sup> by solvation. The intrinsic basicity of amines, i.e. the situation where solvation is unimportant, has been evaluated in the gas phase.  In the gas phase, amines exhibit the basicities predicted from the electron-releasing effects of the organic substituents.  Thus tertiary amines are more basic than secondary amines, which are more basic than primary amines, and finally ammonia is least basic.  The order of pK<sub>b</sub>'s (basicities in water) does not follow this order.  Similarly aniline is more basic than ammonia in the gas phase, but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\nIn aprotic polar solvents such as [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]], and [[acetonitrile]]  the energy of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol.  For this reason, the basicity of amines in these aprotic solvents is almost solely governed by the electronic effects.\n\n== Synthesis ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->\n\n===From alcohols===\nAn industrially significant amines are prepared from ammonia by [[alkylation]] with alcohols:<ref name=Ullmann/>\n:ROH + NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 RNH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\nUnlike the reaction of amines with alkyl halides, the industrial method is [[green chemistry|green]] insofar that the coproduct is water.  The reaction of amines and ammonia with alkyl halides is used for synthesis in the laboratory:\n:RX + 2 R\u2032NH<sub>2</sub> \u2192 RR\u2032NH + [RR\u2032NH<sub>2</sub>]X\nSuch reactions, which are most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides, are rarely employed because the degree of alkylation is difficult to control.<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_001|title=Amines, Aliphatic|year=2000|last1= Eller|first1=Karsten|last2=Henkes|first2=Erhard|last3=Rossbacher|first3=Roland|last4=H\u00f6ke|first4=Hartmut|isbn=3527306730}}</ref> Selectivity can be improved via the [[Del\u00e9pine reaction]], although this is rarely employed on an industrial scale.\n\n===From alkenes===\nDisubstituted alkenes react with HCN in the presence of strong acids to give formamides, which can be decarbonylated.  This method, the [[Ritter reaction]], can be used industrially to produce tertiary amines such a tert-octylamine.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nHydroamination of alkenes is also widely practiced.  The reaction is catalyzed by zeolite-based [[solid acid]]s.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n===Reductive routes===\nVia the process of [[hydrogenation]], [[nitrile]]s are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst. Reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions, which can cause hydrolysis of the \u2013CN group. LiAlH<sub>4</sub> is more commonly employed for the reduction of nitriles on the laboratory scale. Similarly, LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reduces [[amide]]s to amines.

'''Aliphatic amines''' contain only H and alkyl substituents. '''[[Aromatic amine]]s''' have the nitrogen atom connected to an [[aromaticity|aromatic]] ring.\n\n<!-- [[primary amine]] redirects to this section -->\nAmines, alkyl and aryl alike, are organized into three subcategories [[#amino_group_connectivity_table|<small>(see table)</small>]] based on the number of carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen:<ref name=OChemSmith3E />\n\n*'''Primary (1\u00b0) amines'''\u2014Primary amines arise when one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by an [[alkyl]] or [[aromatic]] group. Important primary alkyl amines include, [[methylamine]], most [[amino acid]]s,  and the [[buffering agent]] [[tris]], while primary aromatic amines include [[aniline]].\n*'''Secondary (2\u00b0) amines'''\u2014Secondary amines have two organic substituents (alkyl, aryl or both) bound to the nitrogen together with one hydrogen. Important representatives include [[dimethylamine]], while an example of an aromatic amine would be [[diphenylamine]].\n*'''Tertiary (3\u00b0) amines'''\u2014In tertiary amines, nitrogen has three organic substituents. Examples include [[trimethylamine]], which has a distinctively fishy smell, and [[EDTA]].\n\nA fourth subcategory is determined by the connectivity of the substituents attached to the nitrogen:\n*'''Cyclic amines'''\u2014[[Cyclic compound|Cyclic]] amines are either secondary or tertiary amines. Examples of cyclic amines include the 3-membered ring [[aziridine]] and the six-membered ring [[piperidine]]. ''N''-methylpiperidine and ''N''-phenylpiperidine are examples of cyclic tertiary amines.\n\nIt is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen. These species are not amines but are [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s and have a charged nitrogen center.  Quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions.\n\n==Naming conventions==\nAmines are named in several ways. Typically, the compound is given the prefix \"amino-\" or the suffix \"-amine\". The prefix \"''N''-\" shows substitution on the nitrogen atom. An organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine, triamine, tetraamine and so forth.\n\nSystematic names for some common amines:\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"\n| Lower amines are named with the suffix ''-amine''.<br>\n[[File:Methylamine.svg|100px]]<br>\n'''methylamine'''\n| Higher amines have the prefix ''amino'' as a functional group. IUPAC however does not recommend this convention,{{fact|date=July 2017}} but prefers the alkanamine form, e.g. pentan-2-amine. <br>\n[[File:2-amino-pentane.png|150px]]<br>\n'''2-aminopentane'''<br>(or sometimes: ''pent-2-yl-amine'' or ''pentan-2-amine'')\n|}\n\n==Physical properties==\n[[Hydrogen bonding]] significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines. For example, [[Methylamine|methyl]] and [[Ethylamine|ethyl]] amines are gases under standard conditions, whereas the corresponding [[Methanol|methyl]] and [[Ethanol|ethyl]] alcohols are liquids. Amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell, liquid amines have a distinctive \"fishy\" smell.\n\nThe nitrogen atom features a [[lone electron pair]] that can bind H<sup>+</sup> to form an [[ammonium ion]] R<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>+</sup>. The lone electron pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the N. The water [[solubility]] of simple amines is enhanced by [[hydrogen bonding]] involving these lone electron pairs.  Typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water: primary ammonium ({{chem|RNH|3|+}}) > secondary ammonium ({{chem|R|2|NH|2|+}}) > tertiary ammonium (R<sub>3</sub>NH<sup>+</sup>). Small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many [[solvent]]s, whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic. Aromatic amines, such as [[aniline]], have their lone pair electrons [[conjugated system|conjugated]] into the benzene ring, thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished. Their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low.\n\n===Spectroscopic identification===\nTypically the presence of an amine functional group is deduced by a combination of techniques, including mass spectrometry as well as NMR and IR spectroscopies.  <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals for amines disappear upon treatment of the sample with D<sub>2</sub>O.  In their [[infrared spectrum]] primary amines exhibit two N-H bands, whereas secondary amines exhibit only one.<ref name=OChemSmith3E />\n\n==Structure==\n===Alkyl amines===\nAlkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers.  C-N-C and C-N-H angles approach the idealized angle of 109\u00b0.  C-N distances are slightly shorter than C-C distances.  The energy barrier for the [[nitrogen inversion]] of the stereocenter is about 7&nbsp;[[kcal/mol]] for a trialkylamine. The interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind.\n\nAmines of the type NHRR\u2032 and NRR\u2032R\u2033 are [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]: the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair. Because of the low barrier to inversion, amines of the type NHRR\u2032 cannot be obtained in optical purity.  For chiral tertiary amines, NRR\u2032R\u2033 can only be resolved when the R, R\u2032, and R\u2033 groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as N-substituted [[aziridine]]s ([[quaternary ammonium salt]]s are resolvable).\n{|  style=\"width:272px; float:right; margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:1ex;\"\n |[[File:Amine R-N.svg|76px]]\n | style=\"font-size:200%\" |&nbsp;\u21cc&nbsp;\n |[[File:Amine N-R.svg|76px]]\n |-\n | colspan=3 style=\"font-size:small\" |Inversion of an amine. The pair of dots represents the lone electron pair on the nitrogen atom.\n|}\n\n===Aromatic amines===\nIn aromatic amines (\"anilines\"), nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent.  The C-N distance is correspondingly shorter.  In aniline, the C-N distance is the same as the C-C distances.<ref>G. M.

Correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects. Solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines (anilines). For anilines, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen delocalises into the ring, resulting in decreased basicity.  Substituents on the aromatic ring, and their positions relative to the amino group, also affect basicity as seen in the table.\n\n===Solvation effects===\nSolvation significantly affects the basicity of amines.  N-H groups strongly interact with water, especially in ammonium ions. Consequently, the basicity of ammonia is enhanced by 10<sup>11</sup> by solvation. The intrinsic basicity of amines, i.e. the situation where solvation is unimportant, has been evaluated in the gas phase.  In the gas phase, amines exhibit the basicities predicted from the electron-releasing effects of the organic substituents.  Thus tertiary amines are more basic than secondary amines, which are more basic than primary amines, and finally ammonia is least basic.  The order of pK<sub>b</sub>'s (basicities in water) does not follow this order.  Similarly aniline is more basic than ammonia in the gas phase, but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\nIn aprotic polar solvents such as [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]], and [[acetonitrile]]  the energy of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol.  For this reason, the basicity of amines in these aprotic solvents is almost solely governed by the electronic effects.\n\n== Synthesis ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->\n\n===From alcohols===\nAn industrially significant amines are prepared from ammonia by [[alkylation]] with alcohols:<ref name=Ullmann/>\n:ROH + NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 RNH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\nUnlike the reaction of amines with alkyl halides, the industrial method is [[green chemistry|green]] insofar that the coproduct is water.

This method, the [[Ritter reaction]], can be used industrially to produce tertiary amines such a tert-octylamine.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nHydroamination of alkenes is also widely practiced.  The reaction is catalyzed by zeolite-based [[solid acid]]s.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n===Reductive routes===\nVia the process of [[hydrogenation]], [[nitrile]]s are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst. Reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions, which can cause hydrolysis of the \u2013CN group. LiAlH<sub>4</sub> is more commonly employed for the reduction of nitriles on the laboratory scale. Similarly, LiAlH<sub>4</sub> reduces [[amide]]s to amines. Many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via [[reductive amination]], which can either proceed catalytically or stoichiometrically.\n\n[[Aniline]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics. In industry, hydrogen is the preferred reductant, whereas, in the laboratory, tin and iron are often employed.\n\n===Specialized methods===\nMany methods exist for the preparation of amines, many of these methods being rather specialized.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background:white; float:center; margin:0 1em;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Reaction name !!

It is later revealed in episodes 12-13 that he saved a man from starvation but this man became obsessed with Maki and became a serial murder who murdered 28 boys while alive before committing suicide and hypnotizing ten other boys to commit suicide (though one survives) as these boys all looked like Maki and he wanted to torture and make them suffer the way he wanted to make Maki suffer because he loved and hated him. Despite being colder and more closed off after this incident, he still ultimately retains a kind heart and good sense of justice and is respected and retains the loyalty of his subordinates as a result. He is initially conscious of Aoki due to his similarities to Katsuhiro, his late best friend but also favors him among the newcomers and grows closer to him throughout the series.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Ikkou Aoki'''|\u9752\u6728\u4e00\u884c|Aoki Ikkou}} {{anime voices|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]}}, Played by: [[Masaki Okada]]\n\nThe main protagonist.

She is kind and playful and close friends with Maki. She reveals an ability of psychometry, or an ability to hear and feel emotions from objects of strong personal value.  She showed romantic interest in Aoki but nothing came of it as she is murdered in episode 23.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Yasufumi Okabe'''|\u5ca1\u90e8\u9756\u6587|Okabe Yasufumi}} {{anime voices|Kousuke Meguro}}, Played by: Yusuke Hirayama\n\nOne of the older members of Section Nine.

He is similar to Aoki in their earnest personalities and the air around them. It is revealed that in order to spare Maki the grief and guilt of having been indirectly responsible for inspiring a man to become a serial murderer, Katsuhiro decided to look at the criminal's mind. However, the mind was so warped with lust towards killing those boys that it drove Katsuhiro insane and, not wanting Maki to see this and be tainted and \"infected\", destroyed the MRI machine and begged for Maki to shoot him. It is revealed part of the data of Kainuma's memory is missing and it was these files that drove Suzuki insane because by seeing Kainuma's memories Kainuma was able to place a hypnosis spell on Suzuki and anyone who saw the footage, which Suzuki realized and decided must be destroyed so there would be no other victims.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Yukiko Miyoshi'''|\u4e09\u597d\u7531\u7d00\u5b50|Miyoshi Yukiko}} Played by: [[Chiaki Kuriyama]]\n\nSuzuki's lover prior to his death and friend to Maki.

She has bad luck with men. She takes a leave of absence after her carelessness leads her to be infected with a virus and she decides she is getting old and needs a break. She is strong, independent, stubborn to a fault and a formidable opponent with martial arts experience. She is nonetheless kind and devoted to helping others. Aoki falls in love with her but she rejects his advances despite being attracted to him as well due to wanting to treasure her memories of Suzuki.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Masachika Nagamine'''|\u9577\u5dba\u660c\u89aa|Nagamine Masachika}}\nA stuck up self-centered man who wishes to use MRI to his own benefit and vice Director of Section Nine and leader of the Committee and does not care about the well-being of others, even once sending criminals to suicide as part of an experiment.

It is later revealed in episodes 12-13 that he saved a man from starvation but this man became obsessed with Maki and became a serial murder who murdered 28 boys while alive before committing suicide and hypnotizing ten other boys to commit suicide (though one survives) as these boys all looked like Maki and he wanted to torture and make them suffer the way he wanted to make Maki suffer because he loved and hated him. Despite being colder and more closed off after this incident, he still ultimately retains a kind heart and good sense of justice and is respected and retains the loyalty of his subordinates as a result. He is initially conscious of Aoki due to his similarities to Katsuhiro, his late best friend but also favors him among the newcomers and grows closer to him throughout the series.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Ikkou Aoki'''|\u9752\u6728\u4e00\u884c|Aoki Ikkou}} {{anime voices|[[Daisuke Namikawa]]}}, Played by: [[Masaki Okada]]\n\nThe main protagonist.

He is similar to Aoki in their earnest personalities and the air around them. It is revealed that in order to spare Maki the grief and guilt of having been indirectly responsible for inspiring a man to become a serial murderer, Katsuhiro decided to look at the criminal's mind. However, the mind was so warped with lust towards killing those boys that it drove Katsuhiro insane and, not wanting Maki to see this and be tainted and \"infected\", destroyed the MRI machine and begged for Maki to shoot him. It is revealed part of the data of Kainuma's memory is missing and it was these files that drove Suzuki insane because by seeing Kainuma's memories Kainuma was able to place a hypnosis spell on Suzuki and anyone who saw the footage, which Suzuki realized and decided must be destroyed so there would be no other victims.\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Yukiko Miyoshi'''|\u4e09\u597d\u7531\u7d00\u5b50|Miyoshi Yukiko}} Played by: [[Chiaki Kuriyama]]\n\nSuzuki's lover prior to his death and friend to Maki.

She is strong, independent, stubborn to a fault and a formidable opponent with martial arts experience. She is nonetheless kind and devoted to helping others.

Returning to Montevideo in the late 1940s, he developed an interest in [[Afro-Uruguayan]] culture.<ref name=\":0\" /> Settling in Montevideo's primarily black neighbourhood of \"Mediomundo\" (\"Half-World\"), he studied the [[Candombe|Candomb\u00e9]] and [[Comparsa]] dances characteristic to the culture.<ref>[http://www.carlospaezvilaro.com/cpv/home/home/index.php?menu=sub1_2&t=secciones&secc=10257&sub=10260 Artist's bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911192328/http://www.carlospaezvilaro.com/cpv/home/home/index.php?menu=sub1_2&t=secciones&secc=10257&sub=10260 |date=September 11, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nHe composed numerous musical pieces in the two genres and conducted an orchestra. His group's [[conga]]s and [[Bongo drum|bongos]] were decorated with their leader's own thematic drawings, as well. His interest in the culture later led him to [[Brazil]], home to the western hemisphere's largest population of [[Afro-Brazilian|African descent]]. P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 was invited to exhibit some of this work by the Director of the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Modern Art Museum of Paris]], [[Jean Cassou]], in 1956. He traveled to [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], later that year - his first visit to Africa.<ref name=lanacion>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=537743 ''La Naci\u00f3n'' {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nHe was one of the \"Grupo de los 8\", a movement of Uruguayan artists formed in 1958 together with Oscar Garc\u00eda Reino, Miguel \u00c1ngel Pareja, Ra\u00fal Pavlovsky, Lincoln Presno, Am\u00e9rico Sposito, Alfredo Testoni and Julio Verdie in order to promote new tendencies in painting. In 1960 they were invited by art critic [[Rafael Squirru]] to join the international exhibition at the [[Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art]] (of which he was creator and first director) with artists such as [[Willem De Kooning]], [[Roger Hilton]] and [[Lucio Fontana]]. The experimental tendencies of the Grupo de los 8 have since gained a place of unquestionable relevance not only in the panorama of Uruguayan art but also at an international level, some of their works forming part of museums and collections worldwide.\n\nIncreasingly well-known, P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 was commissioned in 1959 to create a mural for a tunnel connecting a new annex to the [[Organization of American States]]' [[Washington, DC]] headquarters, the Pan American Union building. Originally intended to be no more than {{convert|15|m}} in length, the completed mural (''Roots of Peace'') measured {{convert|155|m}} long and nearly {{convert|2|m}} high when unveiled in 1960.

Returning to Montevideo in the late 1940s, he developed an interest in [[Afro-Uruguayan]] culture.<ref name=\":0\" /> Settling in Montevideo's primarily black neighbourhood of \"Mediomundo\" (\"Half-World\"), he studied the [[Candombe|Candomb\u00e9]] and [[Comparsa]] dances characteristic to the culture.<ref>[http://www.carlospaezvilaro.com/cpv/home/home/index.php?menu=sub1_2&t=secciones&secc=10257&sub=10260 Artist's bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911192328/http://www.carlospaezvilaro.com/cpv/home/home/index.php?menu=sub1_2&t=secciones&secc=10257&sub=10260 |date=September 11, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nHe composed numerous musical pieces in the two genres and conducted an orchestra. His group's [[conga]]s and [[Bongo drum|bongos]] were decorated with their leader's own thematic drawings, as well. His interest in the culture later led him to [[Brazil]], home to the western hemisphere's largest population of [[Afro-Brazilian|African descent]]. P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 was invited to exhibit some of this work by the Director of the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris|Modern Art Museum of Paris]], [[Jean Cassou]], in 1956. He traveled to [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], later that year - his first visit to Africa.<ref name=lanacion>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=537743 ''La Naci\u00f3n'' {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nHe was one of the \"Grupo de los 8\", a movement of Uruguayan artists formed in 1958 together with Oscar Garc\u00eda Reino, Miguel \u00c1ngel Pareja, Ra\u00fal Pavlovsky, Lincoln Presno, Am\u00e9rico Sposito, Alfredo Testoni and Julio Verdie in order to promote new tendencies in painting. In 1960 they were invited by art critic [[Rafael Squirru]] to join the international exhibition at the [[Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art]] (of which he was creator and first director) with artists such as [[Willem De Kooning]], [[Roger Hilton]] and [[Lucio Fontana]]. The experimental tendencies of the Grupo de los 8 have since gained a place of unquestionable relevance not only in the panorama of Uruguayan art but also at an international level, some of their works forming part of museums and collections worldwide.\n\nIncreasingly well-known, P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 was commissioned in 1959 to create a mural for a tunnel connecting a new annex to the [[Organization of American States]]' [[Washington, DC]] headquarters, the Pan American Union building. Originally intended to be no more than {{convert|15|m}} in length, the completed mural (''Roots of Peace'') measured {{convert|155|m}} long and nearly {{convert|2|m}} high when unveiled in 1960.
