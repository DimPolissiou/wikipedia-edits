Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Every one of the principals gets a musical moment that tells us who they are, both the protective outer shell developed to survive the savage jungle of high school, and the tender human core, yearning to connect... While the show's book outshines the score, the songs pack in their share of wit, both in Benjamin's nimble lyrics (recalling her work on the Legally Blonde musical) and Richmond's buoyant tunes, which borrow with a wink from a variety of styles.\"<ref>Rooney, David.

Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Caching improves performance by keeping recent or often-used data items in memory locations that are faster or computationally cheaper to access than normal memory stores. When the cache is full, the algorithm must choose which items to discard to make room for the new ones.\n\n==Overview==\nThe average memory reference time is<ref name=\"ajsmith\" />\n: <math>T = m \\times T_m + T_h + E</math>\nwhere\n: <math>m</math> = miss ratio = 1 - (hit ratio)\n: <math>T_m</math> = time to make a main memory access when there is a miss (or, with multi-level cache, average memory reference time for the next-lower cache)\n: <math>T_h</math>= the latency: the time to reference the cache (should be the same for hits and misses)\n: <math>E</math> = various secondary effects, such as queuing effects in multiprocessor systems\n\nThere are two primary figures of merit of a cache:\nThe latency, and the hit rate.\nThere are also a number of secondary factors affecting cache performance.<ref name=\"ajsmith\" >\nAlan Jay Smith.\n\"Design of CPU Cache Memories\".\nProc. IEEE TENCON, 1987.\n[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1987/CSD-87-357.pdf]\n</ref>\n\nThe \"hit ratio\" of a cache describes how often a searched-for item is actually found in the cache.\nMore efficient replacement policies keep track of more usage information in order to improve the hit rate (for a given cache size).\n\nThe \"latency\" of a cache describes how long after requesting a desired item the cache can return that item (when there is a hit).\nFaster replacement strategies typically keep track of less usage information\u2014or, in the case of direct-mapped cache, no information\u2014to reduce the amount of time required to update that information.\n\nEach replacement strategy is a compromise between hit rate and latency.\n\nHit rate measurements are typically performed on [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] applications.  The actual hit ratio varies widely from one application to another. In particular, video and audio streaming applications often have a hit ratio close to zero, because each bit of data in the stream is read once for the first time (a compulsory miss), used, and then never read or written again.  Even worse, many cache algorithms (in particular, LRU) allow this streaming data to fill the cache, pushing out of the cache information that will be used again soon ([[cache pollution]]).<ref>Paul V. Bolotoff.\n[http://alasir.com/articles/cache_principles/ \"Functional Principles of Cache Memory\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200150/http://alasir.com/articles/cache_principles/ |date=14 March 2012 }}.\n2007.</ref>\n\nOther things to consider:\n* Items with different cost: keep items that are expensive to obtain, e.g. those that take a long time to get.\n* Items taking up more cache: If items have different sizes, the cache may want to discard a large item to store several smaller ones.\n* Items that expire with time: Some caches keep information that expires (e.g. a news cache, a DNS cache, or a web browser cache). The computer may discard items because they are expired. Depending on the size of the cache no further caching algorithm to discard items may be necessary.\n\nVarious algorithms also exist to maintain [[cache coherency]]. This applies only to situation where ''multiple'' independent caches are used for the ''same'' data (for example multiple database servers updating the single shared data file).\n\n==Policies==\n===B\u00e9l\u00e1dy's algorithm===\nThe ''most'' efficient caching algorithm would be to always discard the information that will not be needed for the longest time in the future. This optimal result is referred to as [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e9l\u00e1dy|B\u00e9l\u00e1dy]]'s optimal algorithm/simply optimal replacement policy or [[Page replacement algorithm#The theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm|the clairvoyant algorithm]]. Since it is generally impossible to predict how far in the future information will be needed, this is generally not implementable in practice. The practical minimum can be calculated only after experimentation, and one can compare the effectiveness of the actually chosen cache algorithm.\n\n[[File:Beladysalgoworking.png|center|Optimal Working]]\n\nAt the moment when a [[page fault]] occurs, some set of pages is in memory. In the example, the sequence of '5', '0', '1' is accessed by Frame 1, Frame 2, Frame 3 respectively. Then when '2' is accessed, it replaces value '5', which is in frame 1 since it predicts that value '5' is not going to be accessed in the near future. Because a real-life general purpose operating system cannot actually predict when '5' will be accessed, B\u00e9l\u00e1dy's Algorithm cannot be implemented on such a system.\n\n===First in first out (FIFO)===\nUsing this algorithm the cache behaves in the same way as a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO queue]]. The cache evicts the blocks in the order they were added, without any regard to how often or how many times they were accessed before.\n\n===Last in first out (LIFO) or First in last out (FILO)===\nUsing this algorithm the cache behaves in the same way as a stack and exact opposite way as a FIFO queue. The cache evicts the block added most recently first without any regard to how often or how many times it was accessed before.\n\n==={{Anchor|LRU}}Least recently used (LRU)===\nDiscards the least recently used items first. This algorithm requires keeping track of what was used when, which is expensive if one wants to make sure the algorithm always discards the least recently used item. General implementations of this technique require keeping \"age bits\" for cache-lines and track the \"Least Recently Used\" cache-line based on age-bits. In such an implementation, every time a cache-line is used, the age of all other cache-lines changes. LRU is actually [[Page replacement algorithm#Variants on LRU|a family of caching algorithms]] with members including 2Q by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha,<ref>http://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P439.PDF</ref> and LRU/K by Pat O'Neil, Betty O'Neil and Gerhard Weikum.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The LRU-K Page Replacement Algorithm for Database Disk Buffering|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data|date = 1993|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-0-89791-592-2|pages = 297\u2013306|series = SIGMOD '93|doi = 10.1145/170035.170081|first = Elizabeth J.|last = O'Neil|authorlink=Elizabeth O'Neil|first2 = Patrick E.|last2 = O'Neil|first3 = Gerhard|last3 = Weikum|citeseerx = 10.1.1.102.8240}}</ref>\n\nThe access sequence for the below example is A B C D E D F.\n\n[[File:Lruexample.png|center|LRU working]]\n\nIn the above example once A B C D gets installed in the blocks with sequence numbers (Increment 1 for each new Access) and when E is accessed, it is a miss and it needs to be installed in one of the blocks. According to the LRU Algorithm, since A has the lowest Rank(A(0)), E will replace A.\n\n===Time aware least recently used (TLRU)===\nThe Time aware Least Recently Used (TLRU)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bilal, Muhammad|displayauthors=etal|title=Time Aware Least Recent Used (TLRU) Cache Management Policy in ICN|journal=IEEE 16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT) |pages=528\u2013532|bibcode=2018arXiv180100390B|year=2017|arxiv=1801.00390|doi=10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779016|isbn=978-89-968650-3-2}}</ref> is a variant of LRU designed for the situation where the stored contents in cache have a valid life time. The algorithm is suitable in network cache applications, such as [[Information-centric networking]] (ICN), [[Content delivery network|Content Delivery Networks]] (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. TLRU introduces a new term: TTU (Time to Use). TTU is a time stamp of a content/page which stipulates the usability time for the content based on the locality of the content and the content publisher announcement. Owing to this locality based time stamp, TTU provides more control to the local administrator to regulate in network storage.\nIn the TLRU algorithm, when a piece of content arrives, a cache node calculates the local TTU value based on the TTU value assigned by the content publisher. The local TTU value is calculated by using a locally defined function. Once the local TTU value is calculated the replacement of content is performed on a subset of the total content stored in cache node. The TLRU ensures that less popular and small life content should be replaced with the incoming content.\n\n===Most recently used (MRU)===\nDiscards, in contrast to LRU, the most recently used items first. In findings presented at the 11th [[VLDB conference]], Chou and DeWitt noted that \"When a file is being repeatedly scanned in a [Looping Sequential] reference pattern, MRU is the best [[page replacement algorithm|replacement algorithm]].\"<ref>Hong-Tai Chou and David J. DeWitt.

At the 5th access E, we see that the block which held D is now replaced with E as this block was used most recently. Another access to C and at the next access to D, C is replaced as it was the block accessed just before D and so on.\n\n===Pseudo-LRU (PLRU)===\n{{Details|Pseudo-LRU}}\nFor [[CPU caches]] with large [[CPU cache#Associativity|associativity]] (generally >4 ways), the implementation cost of LRU becomes prohibitive. In many CPU caches, a scheme that almost always discards one of the least recently used items is sufficient, so many CPU designers choose a PLRU algorithm which only needs one bit per cache item to work.\nPLRU typically has a slightly worse miss ratio, has a slightly better latency, uses slightly less power than LRU and lower overheads compared to LRU.\n\nThe following example shows how Bits work as a binary tree of 1-bit pointers that point to the less recently used subtree. Following the pointer chain to the leaf node identifies the replacement candidate. Upon an access all pointers in the chain from the accessed way's leaf node to the root node are set to point to subtree that does not contain the accessed way.\n\nThe access sequence is A B C D E.\n\n[[File:Plruexample.png|center|Pseudo LRU working]]\n\nThe principle here is simple to understand if we only look at the arrow pointers. When there is an access to a value say 'A' and the we cannot find it in the cache then load it from memory and '''place it at the block where the arrows are pointing''' go from top to bottom and when you place that block '''make the arrows point away''' from that block go from bottom to top. In the above example we see how 'A' was placed followed by 'B', 'C and 'D'. Then as the cache became full 'E' replaced 'A' as that was where the arrows were pointing at that time. On the next access, the block where 'B' is being held will be replaced.\n\n===Random replacement (RR)===\nRandomly selects a candidate item and discards it to make space when necessary. This algorithm does not require keeping any information about the access history. For its simplicity, it has been used in [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]].<ref>[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.set.cortexr/index.html ARM Cortex-R series processors manual]</ref> It admits efficient stochastic simulation.<ref>An Efficient Simulation Algorithm for Cache of Random Replacement Policy [https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-642-15672-4_13]</ref>\n\nThe access sequence for the below example is A B C D E B D F\n\n[[File:Randomreplexample.png|center|working of a Random Replacement algorithm]]\n\n==={{Anchor|SLRU}}Segmented LRU (SLRU)===\nSLRU cache is divided into two segments, a probationary segment and a protected segment. Lines in each segment are ordered from the most to the least recently accessed. Data from misses is added to the cache at the most recently accessed end of the probationary segment. Hits are removed from wherever they currently reside and added to the most recently accessed end of the protected segment. Lines in the protected segment have thus been accessed at least twice. The protected segment is finite, so migration of a line from the probationary segment to the protected segment may force the migration of the LRU line in the protected segment to the most recently used (MRU) end of the probationary segment, giving this line another chance to be accessed before being replaced. The size limit on the protected segment is an SLRU parameter that varies according to the I/O workload patterns. Whenever data must be discarded from the cache, lines are obtained from the LRU end of the probationary segment.<ref>Ramakrishna Karedla, J. Spencer Love, and Bradley G. Wherry. Caching Strategies to Improve Disk System Performance. In [[Computer (magazine)|Computer]], 1994.</ref>\n\n===Least-frequently used (LFU)===\n{{Details|Least-frequently used}}\nCounts how often an item is needed. Those that are used least often are discarded first. This works very similar to LRU except that instead of storing the value of how recently a block was accessed, we store the value of how many times it was accessed. So of course while running an access sequence we will replace a block which was used least number of times from our cache. E.g., if A was used (accessed) 5 times and B was used 3 times and others C and D were used 10 times each, we will replace B.\n\n===Least frequent recently used (LFRU)===\nThe Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bilal, Muhammad|displayauthors=etal|title=A Cache Management Scheme for Efficient Content Eviction and Replication in Cache Networks|journal=IEEE Access |volume=5|pages=1692\u20131701|arxiv=1702.04078|bibcode=2017arXiv170204078B|year=2017|doi=10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2669344}}</ref> cache replacement scheme combines the benefits of LFU and LRU schemes. LFRU  is suitable for \u2018in network\u2019 cache applications, such as [[Information-centric networking]] (ICN), [[Content Delivery Network]]s (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. In LFRU, the cache is divided into two partitions called privileged and unprivileged partitions. The privileged partition can be defined as a protected partition. If content is highly popular, it is pushed into the privileged partition. Replacement of the privileged partition is done as follows:  LFRU evicts content from the unprivileged partition, pushes content from privileged partition to unprivileged partition, and finally inserts new content into the privileged partition.  In the above procedure the LRU is used for the privileged partition and an approximated LFU (ALFU) scheme is used for the unprivileged partition, hence the abbreviation LFRU.\n\nThe basic idea is to filter out the locally popular contents with ALFU scheme and push the popular contents to one of the privileged partition.\n\n===LFU with dynamic aging (LFUDA)===\nA variant called LFU with Dynamic Aging (LFUDA) that uses dynamic aging to accommodate shifts in the set of popular objects. It adds a cache age factor to the reference count when a new object is added to the cache or when an existing object is re-referenced. LFUDA increments the cache ages when evicting blocks by setting it to the evicted object\u2019s key value. Thus, the cache age is always less than or equal to the minimum key value in the cache.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint = 1001.4135|last1 = Jayarekha|first1 = P.|title = An Adaptive Dynamic Replacement Approach for a Multicast based Popularity Aware Prefix Cache Memory System|last2 = Nair|first2 = T|class = cs.MM|year = 2010}}</ref> Suppose when an object was frequently accessed in the past and now it becomes unpopular, it will remain in the cache for a long time thereby preventing the newly or less popular objects from replacing it. So this Dynamic aging is introduced to bring down the count of such objects thereby making them eligible for replacement. The advantage of LFUDA is it reduces the [[cache pollution]] caused by LFU when cache sizes are very small. When Cache sizes are large few replacement decisions are sufficient and [[cache pollution]] will not be a problem.\n\n===Low inter-reference recency set (LIRS)===\n{{Details|LIRS caching algorithm}}\nA page replacement algorithm with an improved performance over LRU and many other newer replacement algorithms. This is achieved by using reuse distance as a metric for dynamically ranking accessed pages to make a replacement decision. LIRS effectively address the limits of LRU by using recency to evaluate Inter-Reference Recency (IRR) for making a replacement decision. The algorithm was developed by Song Jiang and Xiaodong Zhang.\n\n[[File:LIRSalgoworking.png|center|LIRS algorithm working]]\n\nIn the above figure, \"x\" represents that a block is accessed at time t. Suppose if block A1 is accessed at time 1 then Recency will become 0 since this is the first accessed block and IRR will be 1 since it predicts that A1 will be accessed again in time 3. In the time 2 since A4 is accessed, the recency will become 0 for A4 and 1 for A1 because A4 is the most recently accessed Object and IRR will become 4 and it will go on. At time 10, the LIRS algorithm will have two sets LIR set = {A1, A2} and HIR set = {A3, A4, A5}. Now at time 10 if there is access to A4, miss occurs. LIRS algorithm will now evict A5 instead of A2 because of its largest recency.\n\n===Adaptive replacement cache (ARC)===\n{{Details|Adaptive replacement cache}}\nConstantly balances between LRU and LFU, to improve the combined result.<ref name=megiddo>[[Nimrod Megiddo]] and Dharmendra S. Modha. [http://www.usenix.org/events/fast03/tech/full_papers/megiddo/megiddo.pdf ARC: A Self-Tuning, Low Overhead Replacement Cache.] FAST, 2003.</ref> ARC improves on SLRU by using information about recently evicted cache items to dynamically adjust the size of the protected segment and the probationary segment to make the best use of the available cache space. Adaptive replacement algorithm is explained with the example.<ref>http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/5329-Some-insight-into-the-read-cache-of-ZFS-or-The-ARC.html</ref>\n\n===Clock with adaptive replacement (CAR)===\n{{Details|Clock with adaptive replacement}}\nCombines the advantages of Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) and [[Page replacement algorithm#Clock|CLOCK]]. CAR has performance comparable to ARC, and substantially outperforms both LRU and CLOCK. Like ARC, CAR is self-tuning and requires no user-specified magic parameters. It uses 4 doubly linked lists: two clocks T1 and T2 and two simple LRU lists B1 and B2. T1 clock stores pages based on \"recency\" or \"short term utility\" whereas T2 stores pages with \"frequency\" or \"long term utility\". T1 and T2 contain those pages that are in the cache, while B1 and B2 contain pages that have recently been evicted from T1 and T2 respectively. The algorithm tries to maintain the size of these lists B1\u2248T2 and B2\u2248T1. New pages are inserted in T1 or T2. If there is a hit in B1 size of T1 is increased and similarly if there is a hit in B2 size of T1 is decreased. The adaptation rule used has the same principle as that in ARC, invest more in lists that will give more hits when more pages are added to it.\n\n===Multi queue (MQ)===\nThe multi queue algorithm or MQ was developed to improve the performance of second level buffer cache for e.g. a server buffer cache. It is introduced in a paper by Zhou, Philbin, and Li.<ref name=\"zhou\">[[Yuanyuan Zhou]], James Philbin, and Kai Li. [http://static.usenix.org/event/usenix01/zhou.html The Multi-Queue Replacement Algorithm for Second Level Buffer Caches.] USENIX, 2002.</ref> The MQ cache contains an ''m'' number of LRU queues: Q<sub>0</sub>, Q<sub>1</sub>, ..., Q<sub>''m''-1</sub>. Here, the value of ''m'' represents a hierarchy based on the lifetime of all blocks in that particular queue. For example, if ''j''>''i'', blocks in Q<sub>''j''</sub> will have a longer lifetime than those in Q<sub>''i''</sub>. In addition to these there is another history buffer Q<sub>out</sub>, a queue which maintains a list of all the Block Identifiers along with their access frequencies. When Q<sub>out</sub> is full the oldest identifier is evicted. Blocks stay in the LRU queues for a given lifetime, which is defined dynamically by the MQ algorithm to be the maximum temporal distance between two accesses to the same file or the number of cache blocks, whichever is larger. If a block has not been referenced within its lifetime, it is demoted from Q''<sub>i</sub>'' to Q<sub>''i''\u22121</sub> or evicted from the cache if it is in Q<sub>0</sub>. Each queue also has a maximum access count; if a block in queue Q''<sub>i</sub>'' is accessed more than 2''<sup>i</sup>'' times, this block is promoted to Q<sub>''i''+1</sub> until it is accessed more than 2<sup>''i''+1</sup> times or its lifetime expires. Within a given queue, blocks are ranked by the recency of access, according to LRU[[Cache algorithms?veaction=edit|.]]<ref>Eduardo Pinheiro, Ricardo Bianchini, Energy conservation techniques for disk array-based servers, Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Supercomputing, June 26-July 01, 2004, Malo, France</ref>\n\n[[File:MultiQueueReplacementAlgortithm.jpg|center|Multi Queue Replacement]]\n\nWe can see from Fig. how the ''m'' LRU queues are placed in the cache. Also see from Fig. how the Q<sub>out</sub>  stores the block identifiers and their corresponding access frequencies. ''a'' was placed in Q<sub>0</sub> as it was accessed only once recently and we can check in Q<sub>out</sub> how ''b'' and ''c'' were placed in Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> respectively as their access frequencies are 2 and 4. The queue in which a block is placed is dependent on access frequency(f) as log<sub>2</sub>(f). When the cache is full, the first block to be evicted will be the head of Q<sub>0</sub> in this case ''a''. If ''a'' is accessed one more time it will move to Q<sub>1</sub> below ''b''.\n\n===Pannier: Container-based caching algorithm for compound objects===\nPannier <ref name=Li>Cheng Li, Philip Shilane, Fred Douglis and Grant Wallace. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2814734 Pannier: A Container-based Flash Cache for Compound Objects.] ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware, 2015.</ref> is a container-based flash caching mechanism that identifies divergent (heterogeneous) containers where blocks held therein have highly varying access patterns. Pannier uses a priority-queue based survival queue structure to rank the containers based on their survival time, which is proportional to the live data in the container. Pannier is built based on Segmented LRU (S2LRU), which segregates hot and cold data. Pannier also uses a multi-step feedback controller to throttle flash writes to ensure flash lifespan.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cache-oblivious algorithm]]\n* [[Locality of reference]]\n* [[Distributed cache]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n<p>18.

Caching improves performance by keeping recent or often-used data items in memory locations that are faster or computationally cheaper to access than normal memory stores. When the cache is full, the algorithm must choose which items to discard to make room for the new ones.\n\n==Overview==\nThe average memory reference time is<ref name=\"ajsmith\" />\n: <math>T = m \\times T_m + T_h + E</math>\nwhere\n: <math>m</math> = miss ratio = 1 - (hit ratio)\n: <math>T_m</math> = time to make a main memory access when there is a miss (or, with multi-level cache, average memory reference time for the next-lower cache)\n: <math>T_h</math>= the latency: the time to reference the cache (should be the same for hits and misses)\n: <math>E</math> = various secondary effects, such as queuing effects in multiprocessor systems\n\nThere are two primary figures of merit of a cache:\nThe latency, and the hit rate.\nThere are also a number of secondary factors affecting cache performance.<ref name=\"ajsmith\" >\nAlan Jay Smith.\n\"Design of CPU Cache Memories\".\nProc. IEEE TENCON, 1987.\n[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1987/CSD-87-357.pdf]\n</ref>\n\nThe \"hit ratio\" of a cache describes how often a searched-for item is actually found in the cache.\nMore efficient replacement policies keep track of more usage information in order to improve the hit rate (for a given cache size).\n\nThe \"latency\" of a cache describes how long after requesting a desired item the cache can return that item (when there is a hit).\nFaster replacement strategies typically keep track of less usage information\u2014or, in the case of direct-mapped cache, no information\u2014to reduce the amount of time required to update that information.\n\nEach replacement strategy is a compromise between hit rate and latency.\n\nHit rate measurements are typically performed on [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] applications.  The actual hit ratio varies widely from one application to another. In particular, video and audio streaming applications often have a hit ratio close to zero, because each bit of data in the stream is read once for the first time (a compulsory miss), used, and then never read or written again.  Even worse, many cache algorithms (in particular, LRU) allow this streaming data to fill the cache, pushing out of the cache information that will be used again soon ([[cache pollution]]).<ref>Paul V. Bolotoff.\n[http://alasir.com/articles/cache_principles/ \"Functional Principles of Cache Memory\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314200150/http://alasir.com/articles/cache_principles/ |date=14 March 2012 }}.\n2007.</ref>\n\nOther things to consider:\n* Items with different cost: keep items that are expensive to obtain, e.g. those that take a long time to get.\n* Items taking up more cache: If items have different sizes, the cache may want to discard a large item to store several smaller ones.\n* Items that expire with time: Some caches keep information that expires (e.g. a news cache, a DNS cache, or a web browser cache). The computer may discard items because they are expired. Depending on the size of the cache no further caching algorithm to discard items may be necessary.\n\nVarious algorithms also exist to maintain [[cache coherency]]. This applies only to situation where ''multiple'' independent caches are used for the ''same'' data (for example multiple database servers updating the single shared data file).\n\n==Policies==\n===B\u00e9l\u00e1dy's algorithm===\nThe ''most'' efficient caching algorithm would be to always discard the information that will not be needed for the longest time in the future. This optimal result is referred to as [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00e9l\u00e1dy|B\u00e9l\u00e1dy]]'s optimal algorithm/simply optimal replacement policy or [[Page replacement algorithm#The theoretically optimal page replacement algorithm|the clairvoyant algorithm]]. Since it is generally impossible to predict how far in the future information will be needed, this is generally not implementable in practice. The practical minimum can be calculated only after experimentation, and one can compare the effectiveness of the actually chosen cache algorithm.\n\n[[File:Beladysalgoworking.png|center|Optimal Working]]\n\nAt the moment when a [[page fault]] occurs, some set of pages is in memory. In the example, the sequence of '5', '0', '1' is accessed by Frame 1, Frame 2, Frame 3 respectively. Then when '2' is accessed, it replaces value '5', which is in frame 1 since it predicts that value '5' is not going to be accessed in the near future. Because a real-life general purpose operating system cannot actually predict when '5' will be accessed, B\u00e9l\u00e1dy's Algorithm cannot be implemented on such a system.\n\n===First in first out (FIFO)===\nUsing this algorithm the cache behaves in the same way as a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO queue]]. The cache evicts the blocks in the order they were added, without any regard to how often or how many times they were accessed before.\n\n===Last in first out (LIFO) or First in last out (FILO)===\nUsing this algorithm the cache behaves in the same way as a stack and exact opposite way as a FIFO queue. The cache evicts the block added most recently first without any regard to how often or how many times it was accessed before.\n\n==={{Anchor|LRU}}Least recently used (LRU)===\nDiscards the least recently used items first. This algorithm requires keeping track of what was used when, which is expensive if one wants to make sure the algorithm always discards the least recently used item. General implementations of this technique require keeping \"age bits\" for cache-lines and track the \"Least Recently Used\" cache-line based on age-bits. In such an implementation, every time a cache-line is used, the age of all other cache-lines changes. LRU is actually [[Page replacement algorithm#Variants on LRU|a family of caching algorithms]] with members including 2Q by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha,<ref>http://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P439.PDF</ref> and LRU/K by Pat O'Neil, Betty O'Neil and Gerhard Weikum.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The LRU-K Page Replacement Algorithm for Database Disk Buffering|publisher = ACM|journal = Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data|date = 1993|location = New York, NY, USA|isbn = 978-0-89791-592-2|pages = 297\u2013306|series = SIGMOD '93|doi = 10.1145/170035.170081|first = Elizabeth J.|last = O'Neil|authorlink=Elizabeth O'Neil|first2 = Patrick E.|last2 = O'Neil|first3 = Gerhard|last3 = Weikum|citeseerx = 10.1.1.102.8240}}</ref>\n\nThe access sequence for the below example is A B C D E D F.\n\n[[File:Lruexample.png|center|LRU working]]\n\nIn the above example once A B C D gets installed in the blocks with sequence numbers (Increment 1 for each new Access) and when E is accessed, it is a miss and it needs to be installed in one of the blocks.

The algorithm is suitable in network cache applications, such as [[Information-centric networking]] (ICN), [[Content delivery network|Content Delivery Networks]] (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. TLRU introduces a new term: TTU (Time to Use). TTU is a time stamp of a content/page which stipulates the usability time for the content based on the locality of the content and the content publisher announcement. Owing to this locality based time stamp, TTU provides more control to the local administrator to regulate in network storage.\nIn the TLRU algorithm, when a piece of content arrives, a cache node calculates the local TTU value based on the TTU value assigned by the content publisher. The local TTU value is calculated by using a locally defined function. Once the local TTU value is calculated the replacement of content is performed on a subset of the total content stored in cache node. The TLRU ensures that less popular and small life content should be replaced with the incoming content.\n\n===Most recently used (MRU)===\nDiscards, in contrast to LRU, the most recently used items first. In findings presented at the 11th [[VLDB conference]], Chou and DeWitt noted that \"When a file is being repeatedly scanned in a [Looping Sequential] reference pattern, MRU is the best [[page replacement algorithm|replacement algorithm]].\"<ref>Hong-Tai Chou and David J.

At the 5th access E, we see that the block which held D is now replaced with E as this block was used most recently. Another access to C and at the next access to D, C is replaced as it was the block accessed just before D and so on.\n\n===Pseudo-LRU (PLRU)===\n{{Details|Pseudo-LRU}}\nFor [[CPU caches]] with large [[CPU cache#Associativity|associativity]] (generally >4 ways), the implementation cost of LRU becomes prohibitive. In many CPU caches, a scheme that almost always discards one of the least recently used items is sufficient, so many CPU designers choose a PLRU algorithm which only needs one bit per cache item to work.\nPLRU typically has a slightly worse miss ratio, has a slightly better latency, uses slightly less power than LRU and lower overheads compared to LRU.\n\nThe following example shows how Bits work as a binary tree of 1-bit pointers that point to the less recently used subtree. Following the pointer chain to the leaf node identifies the replacement candidate. Upon an access all pointers in the chain from the accessed way's leaf node to the root node are set to point to subtree that does not contain the accessed way.\n\nThe access sequence is A B C D E.\n\n[[File:Plruexample.png|center|Pseudo LRU working]]\n\nThe principle here is simple to understand if we only look at the arrow pointers. When there is an access to a value say 'A' and the we cannot find it in the cache then load it from memory and '''place it at the block where the arrows are pointing''' go from top to bottom and when you place that block '''make the arrows point away''' from that block go from bottom to top. In the above example we see how 'A' was placed followed by 'B', 'C and 'D'. Then as the cache became full 'E' replaced 'A' as that was where the arrows were pointing at that time. On the next access, the block where 'B' is being held will be replaced.\n\n===Random replacement (RR)===\nRandomly selects a candidate item and discards it to make space when necessary.

The protected segment is finite, so migration of a line from the probationary segment to the protected segment may force the migration of the LRU line in the protected segment to the most recently used (MRU) end of the probationary segment, giving this line another chance to be accessed before being replaced. The size limit on the protected segment is an SLRU parameter that varies according to the I/O workload patterns.

Those that are used least often are discarded first. This works very similar to LRU except that instead of storing the value of how recently a block was accessed, we store the value of how many times it was accessed. So of course while running an access sequence we will replace a block which was used least number of times from our cache. E.g., if A was used (accessed) 5 times and B was used 3 times and others C and D were used 10 times each, we will replace B.\n\n===Least frequent recently used (LFRU)===\nThe Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bilal, Muhammad|displayauthors=etal|title=A Cache Management Scheme for Efficient Content Eviction and Replication in Cache Networks|journal=IEEE Access |volume=5|pages=1692\u20131701|arxiv=1702.04078|bibcode=2017arXiv170204078B|year=2017|doi=10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2669344}}</ref> cache replacement scheme combines the benefits of LFU and LRU schemes. LFRU  is suitable for \u2018in network\u2019 cache applications, such as [[Information-centric networking]] (ICN), [[Content Delivery Network]]s (CDNs) and distributed networks in general. In LFRU, the cache is divided into two partitions called privileged and unprivileged partitions. The privileged partition can be defined as a protected partition. If content is highly popular, it is pushed into the privileged partition. Replacement of the privileged partition is done as follows:  LFRU evicts content from the unprivileged partition, pushes content from privileged partition to unprivileged partition, and finally inserts new content into the privileged partition.  In the above procedure the LRU is used for the privileged partition and an approximated LFU (ALFU) scheme is used for the unprivileged partition, hence the abbreviation LFRU.\n\nThe basic idea is to filter out the locally popular contents with ALFU scheme and push the popular contents to one of the privileged partition.\n\n===LFU with dynamic aging (LFUDA)===\nA variant called LFU with Dynamic Aging (LFUDA) that uses dynamic aging to accommodate shifts in the set of popular objects. It adds a cache age factor to the reference count when a new object is added to the cache or when an existing object is re-referenced. LFUDA increments the cache ages when evicting blocks by setting it to the evicted object\u2019s key value. Thus, the cache age is always less than or equal to the minimum key value in the cache.<ref>{{Cite arXiv |eprint = 1001.4135|last1 = Jayarekha|first1 = P.|title = An Adaptive Dynamic Replacement Approach for a Multicast based Popularity Aware Prefix Cache Memory System|last2 = Nair|first2 = T|class = cs.MM|year = 2010}}</ref> Suppose when an object was frequently accessed in the past and now it becomes unpopular, it will remain in the cache for a long time thereby preventing the newly or less popular objects from replacing it. So this Dynamic aging is introduced to bring down the count of such objects thereby making them eligible for replacement. The advantage of LFUDA is it reduces the [[cache pollution]] caused by LFU when cache sizes are very small. When Cache sizes are large few replacement decisions are sufficient and [[cache pollution]] will not be a problem.\n\n===Low inter-reference recency set (LIRS)===\n{{Details|LIRS caching algorithm}}\nA page replacement algorithm with an improved performance over LRU and many other newer replacement algorithms. This is achieved by using reuse distance as a metric for dynamically ranking accessed pages to make a replacement decision. LIRS effectively address the limits of LRU by using recency to evaluate Inter-Reference Recency (IRR) for making a replacement decision. The algorithm was developed by Song Jiang and Xiaodong Zhang.\n\n[[File:LIRSalgoworking.png|center|LIRS algorithm working]]\n\nIn the above figure, \"x\" represents that a block is accessed at time t. Suppose if block A1 is accessed at time 1 then Recency will become 0 since this is the first accessed block and IRR will be 1 since it predicts that A1 will be accessed again in time 3. In the time 2 since A4 is accessed, the recency will become 0 for A4 and 1 for A1 because A4 is the most recently accessed Object and IRR will become 4 and it will go on. At time 10, the LIRS algorithm will have two sets LIR set = {A1, A2} and HIR set = {A3, A4, A5}. Now at time 10 if there is access to A4, miss occurs. LIRS algorithm will now evict A5 instead of A2 because of its largest recency.\n\n===Adaptive replacement cache (ARC)===\n{{Details|Adaptive replacement cache}}\nConstantly balances between LRU and LFU, to improve the combined result.<ref name=megiddo>[[Nimrod Megiddo]] and Dharmendra S. Modha. [http://www.usenix.org/events/fast03/tech/full_papers/megiddo/megiddo.pdf ARC: A Self-Tuning, Low Overhead Replacement Cache.] FAST, 2003.</ref> ARC improves on SLRU by using information about recently evicted cache items to dynamically adjust the size of the protected segment and the probationary segment to make the best use of the available cache space. Adaptive replacement algorithm is explained with the example.<ref>http://www.c0t0d0s0.org/archives/5329-Some-insight-into-the-read-cache-of-ZFS-or-The-ARC.html</ref>\n\n===Clock with adaptive replacement (CAR)===\n{{Details|Clock with adaptive replacement}}\nCombines the advantages of Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) and [[Page replacement algorithm#Clock|CLOCK]]. CAR has performance comparable to ARC, and substantially outperforms both LRU and CLOCK. Like ARC, CAR is self-tuning and requires no user-specified magic parameters. It uses 4 doubly linked lists: two clocks T1 and T2 and two simple LRU lists B1 and B2. T1 clock stores pages based on \"recency\" or \"short term utility\" whereas T2 stores pages with \"frequency\" or \"long term utility\". T1 and T2 contain those pages that are in the cache, while B1 and B2 contain pages that have recently been evicted from T1 and T2 respectively. The algorithm tries to maintain the size of these lists B1\u2248T2 and B2\u2248T1. New pages are inserted in T1 or T2. If there is a hit in B1 size of T1 is increased and similarly if there is a hit in B2 size of T1 is decreased. The adaptation rule used has the same principle as that in ARC, invest more in lists that will give more hits when more pages are added to it.\n\n===Multi queue (MQ)===\nThe multi queue algorithm or MQ was developed to improve the performance of second level buffer cache for e.g. a server buffer cache. It is introduced in a paper by Zhou, Philbin, and Li.<ref name=\"zhou\">[[Yuanyuan Zhou]], James Philbin, and Kai Li. [http://static.usenix.org/event/usenix01/zhou.html The Multi-Queue Replacement Algorithm for Second Level Buffer Caches.] USENIX, 2002.</ref> The MQ cache contains an ''m'' number of LRU queues: Q<sub>0</sub>, Q<sub>1</sub>, ..., Q<sub>''m''-1</sub>. Here, the value of ''m'' represents a hierarchy based on the lifetime of all blocks in that particular queue. For example, if ''j''>''i'', blocks in Q<sub>''j''</sub> will have a longer lifetime than those in Q<sub>''i''</sub>. In addition to these there is another history buffer Q<sub>out</sub>, a queue which maintains a list of all the Block Identifiers along with their access frequencies. When Q<sub>out</sub> is full the oldest identifier is evicted. Blocks stay in the LRU queues for a given lifetime, which is defined dynamically by the MQ algorithm to be the maximum temporal distance between two accesses to the same file or the number of cache blocks, whichever is larger. If a block has not been referenced within its lifetime, it is demoted from Q''<sub>i</sub>'' to Q<sub>''i''\u22121</sub> or evicted from the cache if it is in Q<sub>0</sub>. Each queue also has a maximum access count; if a block in queue Q''<sub>i</sub>'' is accessed more than 2''<sup>i</sup>'' times, this block is promoted to Q<sub>''i''+1</sub> until it is accessed more than 2<sup>''i''+1</sup> times or its lifetime expires. Within a given queue, blocks are ranked by the recency of access, according to LRU[[Cache algorithms?veaction=edit|.]]<ref>Eduardo Pinheiro, Ricardo Bianchini, Energy conservation techniques for disk array-based servers, Proceedings of the 18th annual international conference on Supercomputing, June 26-July 01, 2004, Malo, France</ref>\n\n[[File:MultiQueueReplacementAlgortithm.jpg|center|Multi Queue Replacement]]\n\nWe can see from Fig. how the ''m'' LRU queues are placed in the cache. Also see from Fig. how the Q<sub>out</sub>  stores the block identifiers and their corresponding access frequencies. ''a'' was placed in Q<sub>0</sub> as it was accessed only once recently and we can check in Q<sub>out</sub> how ''b'' and ''c'' were placed in Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> respectively as their access frequencies are 2 and 4. The queue in which a block is placed is dependent on access frequency(f) as log<sub>2</sub>(f). When the cache is full, the first block to be evicted will be the head of Q<sub>0</sub> in this case ''a''. If ''a'' is accessed one more time it will move to Q<sub>1</sub> below ''b''.\n\n===Pannier: Container-based caching algorithm for compound objects===\nPannier <ref name=Li>Cheng Li, Philip Shilane, Fred Douglis and Grant Wallace. [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2814734 Pannier: A Container-based Flash Cache for Compound Objects.] ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware, 2015.</ref> is a container-based flash caching mechanism that identifies divergent (heterogeneous) containers where blocks held therein have highly varying access patterns. Pannier uses a priority-queue based survival queue structure to rank the containers based on their survival time, which is proportional to the live data in the container. Pannier is built based on Segmented LRU (S2LRU), which segregates hot and cold data. Pannier also uses a multi-step feedback controller to throttle flash writes to ensure flash lifespan.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cache-oblivious algorithm]]\n* [[Locality of reference]]\n* [[Distributed cache]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n18.

{"title_page": "Tax inversion", "text_new": "{{short description|Corporate relocation to a lower tax location}}\n{{Taxation}}\nA '''tax inversion''' or '''corporate tax inversion''' occurs when a corporation restructures itself so that the current parent is replaced by a foreign parent, and the original parent company becomes a subsidiary of the foreign parent, thus moving its tax residence to the foreign country.  Executives and operational headquarters can stay in the original country.  The US definition requires that the original shareholders remain a majority control of the post-inverted company.\n\n[[File:US tax inversions (1983 to 2016).jpg|thumb|Annual number of US corporate tax inversions (1983\u20132016). Source: [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]].<ref name=\"stlouis\">{{harvnb|Neely|Sherrer|2017}}</ref>]]\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the less than 100 material tax inversions recorded since 1993 have been of US corporations (85 inversions), seeking to pay less to the US corporate tax system.  The only other jurisdiction to experience a material outflow of tax inversions was the United Kingdom from 2007\u201310 (22 inversions); however, UK inversions largely ceased post the reform of the UK corporate tax code from 2009\u201312.\n\n[[File:US tax inversions (1994 to 2015).jpg|thumb|Assets of completed and aborted US inversions (1994\u20132015). Source: [[Congressional Budget Office]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2017|p=7}}</ref>]]\n\nThe first inversion was [[McDermott International]] in 1983.{{efn|name=\"McD\"|While some research lists the date of the McDermott International inversion as 1982, the Congressional Budget Office officially record its date as 1983.<ref name=\"CBO5\">{{harvnb|Hall|2017|p=5}}</ref>}}  Reforms by US Congress in 2004 halted \"naked inversions\", however, the size of individual \"merger inversions\" grew dramatically; in 2014 alone, they exceeded the cumulative value of all inversions since 1983. New US Treasury rules in 2014\u201316 blocked several major inversions (e.g. 2016 USD$160 billion [[Pfizer]]\u2013[[Allergan plc]] inversion, and the 2015 USD$54 billion [[AbbVie]]\u2013[[Shire plc]] inversion), and the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] (TCJA) further reduced the taxation incentives of inversions.  {{As of|June 2019}}, there have been no material US inversions post-2017, and notably, two large Irish-based tax inversion targets were acquired in non-tax inversion transactions, where the acquirer remained in their higher-tax jurisdiction:  [[Shire plc]] by Japanese pharma [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] for US$63 billion (announced in 2018, closed in 2019), and [[Allergan plc]] by U.S. pharma [[AbbVie]] for US$64 billion (announced in 2019, expected to close in 2020); in addition, [[Broadcom Inc.]] redomesticated to the United States.\n\n{{As of |June 2019}} the most popular destination in history for US corporate tax inversions is Ireland (with 22 inversions); Ireland was also the most popular destination for UK inversions.  The largest completed corporate tax inversion in history was the US$48 billion merger of [[Medtronic]] with [[Covidien plc]] in Ireland in 2015 (the vast majority of their merged revenues are still from the US).  The largest aborted tax inversion was the US$160 billion merger of [[Pfizer]] with [[Allergan plc]] in Ireland in 2016.  The largest hybrid-[[intellectual property]] (IP) tax inversion, was the US$300 billion acquisition of [[Apple Inc.]]'s IP by Apple Ireland in 2015.\n\n== Concept ==\n\nWhile the legal steps taken to execute a tax inversion can be complex as the corporations need to avoid both regulatory and IRS hurdles in re-locating their tax residence to a lower-tax jurisdiction, simplified examples are available; such as provided in August 2014, by Bloomberg journalist Matt Levine when reporting on the [[Burger King]] tax inversion to Canada.  Before the 2017 TCJA, U.S. companies paid a corporate tax rate of 35% on all income they earned in both the U.S., and abroad, but they obtained a credit against their U.S. tax liability for the amount of any foreign tax paid.  Given that the U.S. tax rate of 35% was one of the highest in the world, the corporate's maximum global tax liability should, therefore, have been 35%.  This pre-TCJA U.S. tax system, was referred to as a \"worldwide tax system\", as opposed to the \"territorial tax system\" used by almost all other developed countries. Levine explained: \"If we're incorporated in the U.S., we'll pay 35 percent taxes on our income in the U.S. and Canada and Mexico and Ireland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, but if we're incorporated in Canada [who operate a \"territorial tax system\"], we'll pay 35 percent on our income in the U.S. but 15 percent in Canada and 30 percent in Mexico and 12.5 percent in Ireland and zero percent in Bermuda and zero percent in the Cayman Islands.\" By changing its headquarters to another country with a territorial tax regime, the corporation typically pays taxes on its earnings in each of those countries at the specific rates of each country. In addition, the corporation executing the tax inversion may find additional tax avoidance strategies, called {{slink|#Earnings Stripping}} tools, that can ''shift'' untaxed profits from the higher-tax locations (e.g. the U.S.), to the new lower-tax country to which the corporation has now inverted to.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2014-08-25/burger-king-may-move-to-canada-for-the-donuts|title=Burger King May Move to Canada for the Donuts|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|author=Matt Levine|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe following are notable events in the history of US and non-US corporate tax inversions:\n\n===US experience===\n\n* 1983.{{efn|name=\"McD\"}} The first officially recognized US corporate tax inversion was of [[McDermott International]] from [[Texas]] to Panama.<ref name=\"LOUISFED1\">{{harvnb|Neely|Sherrer|2017|p=1}}</ref><ref name=\"CBO5\"/><ref name=\"bloomberg1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2014-12-18/i-hear-america-singing-never-pay-taxes-the-inversion-operetta|title=McDermott International: The Greatest Tax Story Ever Told|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|author=Zachary Mider|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=15 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415212039/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2014-12-18/i-hear-america-singing-never-pay-taxes-the-inversion-operetta|archive-date=15 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Academics refer to it as a 1st-generation inversion.<ref name=\"Hwang\">{{cite journal|url=https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Inversions-final.pdf|title=The New Corporate Migration: Tax Diversion Through Diversion | author=Kathy Hwang | journal=[[Brooklyn Law School|Brooklyn Law Review]] | volume=80 | issue=3 | p=807\u2013856 | accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Yale\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/reinterpreting-corporate-inversions|title=Reinterpreting Corporate Inversions: Non-Tax Competitions and Frictions|volume=126|issue=7|date=May 2017|accessdate=22 April 2019|author=Inho Andrew Mun|journal=[[Yale Law Journal]]|p=2152\u20132220|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712231056/http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/reinterpreting-corporate-inversions|archive-date=12 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* 1990.

These were mostly \"naked inversions\" where the company had little or no previous  \"substantial business activities\" in the location.  They also used debt-based ''earnings stripping'' tools to shift US profits to the new destination.

These inversions involved mergers with real companies that met the \"substantial business activities\" test of IRS Section 7874.  These destinations also had advanced IP-based BEPS tools (e.g. the Irish CAIA tool, the Double Irish tool, the UK [[Patent box]] tool) that could deliver an \"[[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rate]]\" closer to zero on profits ''shifted'' to the destination.<ref name=\"LOUISFED1\"/><ref name=\"Talley20151670\"/>\n\nThe destinations for the 85 US corporate tax inversions since 1983 are as follows:<ref name=\"Bloomberg\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" |Destinations of US Corporate Tax Inversions (1983\u20132018)\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left\"|Destination\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\"|Total\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left\"|Last inversion\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\"|Notable U.S. corporate tax inversions to the destination\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:right\"|Year\n!style=\"text-align:right\"|Name\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Ireland||21||2016||[[Johnson Controls]]||Largest U.S. inversion in history, Medtronic (2015); plus 3rd [[Johnson Controls|Johnson]] (2016),<br>4th [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] (2012), and 6th [[Perrigo]] (2013).<ref name=\"wplist\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/these-are-the-companies-abandoning-the-u-s-to-dodge-taxes/?noredirect=on|title=These are the companies abandoning the U.S. to dodge taxes|date=6 August 2014|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Danielle Douglas-Gabriel|access-date=16 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417143419/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/these-are-the-companies-abandoning-the-u-s-to-dodge-taxes/?noredirect=on|archive-date=17 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"medtronic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/slideshow/14222919/1/as-treasury-moves-to-bring-back-inversions-here-are-seven-of-the-biggest-recent-deals.html|title=As Treasury Moves to Bring Back Inversions, Here are 7 of the Biggest Recent Deals|author=Emily Stewart|date=22 July 2017|publisher=TheStreet|access-date=16 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417130416/https://www.thestreet.com/slideshow/14222919/1/as-treasury-moves-to-bring-back-inversions-here-are-seven-of-the-biggest-recent-deals.html|archive-date=17 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Bermuda||19||2015||[[C&J Energy Services]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|England||11||2016||[[CardTronics]]||Post 2009\u201312 overhaul of tax-code,<ref name=\"uk1\">{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/tax-reform-uk-reversed-tide-corporate-tax-inversions/#_ftn4|title=Tax Reform in the UK Reversed the Tide of Corporate Tax Inversions|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|author=William McBride|date=14 October 2014|access-date=16 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417155717/https://taxfoundation.org/tax-reform-uk-reversed-tide-corporate-tax-inversions/#_ftn4|archive-date=17 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> attracted the 2nd\u2013largest<br>U.S. inversion in history, [[Liberty Global]] (2013).<ref name=\"wplist\"/><ref name=\"medtronic\"/>\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Canada||8||2016||[[Waste Connections]]||Attracted the 5th\u2013largest U.S. inversion in history, [[Burger King]] (2014).<ref name=\"wplist\"/><ref name=\"medtronic\"/>\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Netherlands||7||2015||[[Mylan]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|The Cayman Islands||5||2014||[[Theravance Biopharma]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Luxembourg||4||2010||[[Trinseo]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Switzerland||3||2007||[[TE Connectivity]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Australia||1||2012||[[Tronox]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Israel||1||2012||[[Stratasys]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Denmark||1||2009||[[Invitel Holdings]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Jersey||1||2009||[[Delphi Automotive]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|British Virgin Islands||1||2003||[[Michael Kors (brand)|Michael Kors Ltd.]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Singapore||1||1990||[[Flextronics International]]||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"|Panama||1||1983||[[McDermott International]]||Attracted the first U.S. inversion in history, [[McDermott International]] (1983).<ref name=\"LOUISFED1\"/>\n|}\n\n===UK inversions===\n\nA 2012 article in ''Tax Notes'' listed the 22 tax inversions of UK companies to other destinations from 2006 to 2010, until UK tax reform ceased further material inversions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/united-kingdoms-move-territorial-taxation/|title=The United Kingdom's Move to Territorial Taxation|author=Editorial|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=15 April 2019|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|quote=From 2007 to 2010, a total of 22 companies inverted out of the UK.

inversion''' or '''corporate tax inversion''' occurs when a corporation restructures itself so that the current parent is replaced by a foreign parent, and the original parent company becomes a subsidiary of the foreign parent, thus moving its tax residence to the foreign country.  Executives and operational headquarters can stay in the original country.  The US definition requires that the original shareholders remain a majority control of the post-inverted company.\n\n[[File:US tax inversions (1983 to 2016).jpg|thumb|Annual number of US corporate tax inversions (1983\u20132016). Source: [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]].<ref name=\"stlouis\">{{harvnb|Neely|Sherrer|2017}}</ref>]]\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the less than 100 material tax inversions recorded since 1993 have been of US corporations (85 inversions), seeking to pay less to the US corporate tax system.  The only other jurisdiction to experience a material outflow of tax inversions was the United Kingdom from 2007\u201310 (22 inversions); however, UK inversions largely ceased post the reform of the UK corporate tax code from 2009\u201312.\n\n[[File:US tax inversions (1994 to 2015).jpg|thumb|Assets of completed and aborted US inversions (1994\u20132015). Source: [[Congressional Budget Office]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2017|p=7}}</ref>]]\n\nThe first inversion was [[McDermott International]] in 1983.{{efn|name=\"McD\"|While some research lists the date of the McDermott International inversion as 1982, the Congressional Budget Office officially record its date as 1983.<ref name=\"CBO5\">{{harvnb|Hall|2017|p=5}}</ref>}}  Reforms by US Congress in 2004 halted \"naked inversions\", however, the size of individual \"merger inversions\" grew dramatically; in 2014 alone, they exceeded the cumulative value of all inversions since 1983. New US Treasury rules in 2014\u201316 blocked several major inversions (e.g. 2016 USD$160 billion [[Pfizer]]\u2013[[Allergan plc]] inversion, and the 2015 USD$54 billion [[AbbVie]]\u2013[[Shire plc]] inversion), and the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] (TCJA) further reduced the taxation incentives of inversions.  {{As of|June 2019}}, there have been no material US inversions post-2017, and notably, two large Irish-based tax inversion targets were acquired in non-tax inversion transactions, where the acquirer remained in their higher-tax jurisdiction:  [[Shire plc]] by Japanese pharma [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] for US$63 billion (announced in 2018, closed in 2019), and [[Allergan plc]] by U.S. pharma [[AbbVie]] for US$64 billion (announced in 2019, expected to close in 2020); in addition, [[Broadcom Inc.]] redomesticated to the United States.\n\n{{As of |June 2019}} the most popular destination in history for US corporate tax inversions is Ireland (with 22 inversions); Ireland was also the most popular destination for UK inversions.  The largest completed corporate tax inversion in history was the US$48 billion merger of [[Medtronic]] with [[Covidien plc]] in Ireland in 2015 (the vast majority of their merged revenues are still from the US).  The largest aborted tax inversion was the US$160 billion merger of [[Pfizer]] with [[Allergan plc]] in Ireland in 2016.  The largest hybrid-[[intellectual property]] (IP) tax inversion, was the US$300 billion acquisition of [[Apple Inc.]]'s IP by Apple Ireland in 2015.\n\n== Concept ==\n\nWhile the legal steps taken to execute a tax inversion can be complex as the corporations need to avoid both regulatory and IRS hurdles in re-locating their tax residence to a lower-tax jurisdiction, simplified examples are available; such as provided in August 2014, by Bloomberg journalist Matt Levine when reporting on the [[Burger King]] tax inversion to Canada.  Before the 2017 TCJA, U.S. companies paid a corporate tax rate of 35% on all income they earned in both the U.S., and abroad, but they obtained a credit against their U.S. tax liability for the amount of any foreign tax paid.  Given that the U.S. tax rate of 35% was one of the highest in the world, the corporate's maximum global tax liability should, therefore, have been 35%.  This pre-TCJA U.S. tax system, was referred to as a \"worldwide tax system\", as opposed to the \"territorial tax system\" used by almost all other developed countries. Levine explained: \"If we're incorporated in the U.S., we'll pay 35 percent taxes on our income in the U.S. and Canada and Mexico and Ireland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, but if we're incorporated in Canada [who operate a \"territorial tax system\"], we'll pay 35 percent on our income in the U.S. but 15 percent in Canada and 30 percent in Mexico and 12.5 percent in Ireland and zero percent in Bermuda and zero percent in the Cayman Islands.\" By changing its headquarters to another country with a territorial tax regime, the corporation typically pays taxes on its earnings in each of those countries at the specific rates of each country. In addition, the corporation executing the tax inversion may find additional tax avoidance strategies, called {{slink|#Earnings Stripping}} tools, that can ''shift'' untaxed profits from the higher-tax locations (e.g. the U.S.), to the new lower-tax country to which the corporation has now inverted to.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2014-08-25/burger-king-may-move-to-canada-for-the-donuts|title=Burger King May Move to Canada for the Donuts|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|author=Matt Levine|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe following are notable events in the history of US and non-US corporate tax inversions:\n\n===US experience===\n\n* 1983.{{efn|name=\"McD\"}} The first officially recognized US corporate tax inversion was of [[McDermott International]] from [[Texas]] to Panama.<ref name=\"LOUISFED1\">{{harvnb|Neely|Sherrer|2017|p=1}}</ref><ref name=\"CBO5\"/><ref name=\"bloomberg1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2014-12-18/i-hear-america-singing-never-pay-taxes-the-inversion-operetta|title=McDermott International: The Greatest Tax Story Ever Told|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|author=Zachary Mider|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=15 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415212039/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2014-12-18/i-hear-america-singing-never-pay-taxes-the-inversion-operetta|archive-date=15 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Academics refer to it as a 1st-generation inversion.<ref name=\"Hwang\">{{cite journal|url=https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Inversions-final.pdf|title=The New Corporate Migration: Tax Diversion Through Diversion | author=Kathy Hwang | journal=[[Brooklyn Law School|Brooklyn Law Review]] | volume=80 | issue=3 | p=807\u2013856 | accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Yale\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/reinterpreting-corporate-inversions|title=Reinterpreting Corporate Inversions: Non-Tax Competitions and Frictions|volume=126|issue=7|date=May 2017|accessdate=22 April 2019|author=Inho Andrew Mun|journal=[[Yale Law Journal]]|p=2152\u20132220|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712231056/http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/reinterpreting-corporate-inversions|archive-date=12 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* 1990.

The detaining authority passes the order of detention on subjective satisfaction\u2026 To prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous power the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed and meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards, however technical, is, in our opinion, mandatory and vital.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rekha vs State Of T.Nadu |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192877/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Lack of SOPs ====\n\nAn RTI application to the J&K Home Department filed by members of the J&K RTI Movement, reveled that the State Government of J&K has not made any Rules or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under PSA, during the four decades of its existence. <ref name=\"SOP\">{{cite web |title=NO RULES, SOPS FOR ORDERING PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS UNDER J&K PSA |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/no-rules-sops-for-ordering-preventive-detentions-under-jk-psa |website=HRI |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nEvery year the detaining authorities have been issuing hundreds and at times thousands of detention orders without any SOPs to guide them except the reports and dossiers prepared by the J&K Police.<ref name=\"SOP\"/>\n\n\n==== Failure to Scrutinize Evidence ====\n\nIn an interview to Amnesty International, a former District Magistrate said that the Magistrates do not have dedicated assistance available, which could verify and seriously examine the police version, thus the District Magistrate as to necessarily rely on the reports filed by the police. Thus reducing their role to mere rubber stamps.<ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\nAmnesty India observed a common flaw in the detention orders where the detaining authorities reproduced word-for-word the dossier given by the police which contained the allegations against the person detained.<ref name=\"AI India\"/> <br>\nMany such detention orders have been quashed by the High Court, for example in May 2017, a detention was quashed by the High Court, stating among other reasons: \u201cPerusal of grounds of detention would show that it is a verbatim copy of Dossier of Senior Superintendent of Police submitted by him to the Concerned Magistrate.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=Bashir Ahmad Mir vs State Of J&K |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/15456862/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n\n\n=== Role of Advisory Boards  ===\n\nSince the PSA does not make any provision for judicial review or any appeal process to detainees, under Section 14 of the PSA<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>, a non- judicial body, Advisory Board is set up to review detention orders and determine whether there is sufficient cause for detention. The Advisory Board examines the case only in the initial stages of the detention. There is no provision in the PSA to appeal against the decision of the Advisory Board.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/> \n\n==== Appointment  ====\n\nAdvisory Board consists of two members and a chairperson, which are appointed by the government. Prior to the Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018<ref name=\"Ord\"/>, the members of the Advisory Board were appointed by the Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\n\nBut the ordinance<ref name=\"Ord\">{{cite web |title=Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018 |url=http://jklaw.nic.in/pdf/preanative%20decation%20.pdf |website=JK Law Department |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>, changed the manner in which the members of the Advisory Board were selected, now the members \u2013 provided they were not sitting judges \u2013 would be appointed by the government on the recommendations of a 3-person committee made up of senior state bureaucrats.<ref name=\"Ord\"/> The ordinance removes the mandatory requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice of the J&K High Court. Thus enhancing the role that the executive play and reducing the independence of the Advisory Board. <ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\n\n\n==== Functioning ====\n\nThe Advisory Board is required to review the grounds of detention and the representation, if any, by the person detained.

The detaining authority passes the order of detention on subjective satisfaction\u2026 To prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous power the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed and meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards, however technical, is, in our opinion, mandatory and vital.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rekha vs State Of T.Nadu |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192877/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Lack of SOPs ====\n\nAn RTI application to the J&K Home Department filed by members of the J&K RTI Movement, reveled that the State Government of J&K has not made any Rules or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under PSA, during the four decades of its existence. <ref name=\"SOP\">{{cite web |title=NO RULES, SOPS FOR ORDERING PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS UNDER J&K PSA |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/no-rules-sops-for-ordering-preventive-detentions-under-jk-psa |website=HRI |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nEvery year the detaining authorities have been issuing hundreds and at times thousands of detention orders without any SOPs to guide them except the reports and dossiers prepared by the J&K Police.<ref name=\"SOP\"/>\n\n\n==== Failure to Scrutinize Evidence ====\n\nIn an interview to Amnesty International, a former District Magistrate said that the Magistrates do not have dedicated assistance available, which could verify and seriously examine the police version, thus the District Magistrate as to necessarily rely on the reports filed by the police. Thus reducing their role to mere rubber stamps.<ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\nAmnesty India observed a common flaw in the detention orders where the detaining authorities reproduced word-for-word the dossier given by the police which contained the allegations against the person detained.<ref name=\"AI India\"/> <br>\nMany such detention orders have been quashed by the High Court, for example in May 2017, a detention was quashed by the High Court, stating among other reasons: \u201cPerusal of grounds of detention would show that it is a verbatim copy of Dossier of Senior Superintendent of Police submitted by him to the Concerned Magistrate.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=Bashir Ahmad Mir vs State Of J&K |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/15456862/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n\n\n=== Role of Advisory Boards  ===\n\nSince the PSA does not make any provision for judicial review or any appeal process to detainees, under Section 14 of the PSA<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>, a non- judicial body, Advisory Board is set up to review detention orders and determine whether there is sufficient cause for detention. The Advisory Board examines the case only in the initial stages of the detention. There is no provision in the PSA to appeal against the decision of the Advisory Board.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/> \n\n==== Appointment  ====\n\nAdvisory Board consists of two members and a chairperson, which are appointed by the government.

Thus enhancing the role that the executive play and reducing the independence of the Advisory Board. <ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\n\n\n==== Functioning ====\n\nThe Advisory Board is required to review the grounds of detention and the representation, if any, by the person detained.

Soleimani was commander of the [[Quds Force]]\u2014which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., [[Canada]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Bahrain]]\u2014and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]]. Nine others were killed alongside Soleimani, including Iranian and [[Iraq]]i nationals such as deputy chairman of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] (PMF) and commander of the Iran-backed [[Kata'ib Hezbollah]] militia, [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]]\u2014a designated terrorist in the U.S. and in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).\n\nThe strike occurred during the [[2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis]], which began after the U.S. [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran]] in 2018, reimposed [[United States sanctions against Iran|sanctions]], and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region. On 27 December 2019, the [[K-1 Air Base]] in Iraq, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. personnel, was [[2019 K-1 Air Base attack|attacked]], killing an American contractor. The U.S. responded by launching [[December 2019 United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria|airstrikes across Iraq and Syria]], killing 25 Kata'ib Hezbollah militiamen. Days later, Shia militiamen and their supporters retaliated by [[Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad|attacking the U.S. embassy]] in the [[Green Zone]].\n\nU.S. officials justified the strike claiming it was necessary to stop an \"imminent attack\", though later clarifying the legal justification of the action as being taken \"in response to an escalating series of attacks...to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks...and to end Iran's strategic escalation of attacks...\" <ref>https://www.lawfareblog.com/white-house-releases-report-justifying-soleimani-strike</ref> Some critics of the strike questioned the legality of the attack with respect to [[international law]], as well as the domestic laws of the U.S. Iran called the strike an act of \"[[state terrorism]]\". The Iraqi government said the attack undermined its national sovereignty and considered it a breach of its bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and an act of aggression against its officials. On 5{{nbsp}}January 2020, the [[Iraqi parliament]] passed a non-binding resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory while, on the same day, Iran took the fifth and last step of reducing commitments to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|2015 international nuclear deal]].\n\nSoleimani's killing sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran and stoked fears of a military conflict. Iranian leaders vowed revenge, while U.S. officials said they would [[Preemptive war|preemptively]] attack any Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq that they perceived as a threat. Many in the international community reacted with concern and issued statements or declarations urging restraint and diplomacy. Five days after the airstrike, Iran launched a series of [[2020 Iranian attack on U.S. forces in Iraq|missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq]], the first direct engagement between Iran and the U.S. since [[Operation Praying Mantis]] in 1988. Following the shootdown of [[Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752]] amidst the escalation, leaders from both countries seemed reluctant to further escalate the crisis.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{Further|2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis|Iran\u2013United States relations}}\n\n=== Assassination as a policy consideration ===\n\nThe modern Middle East has seen a number of occasions in which the assassination of high-level government and military figures was attempted, or at least considered.

Soleimani was commander of the [[Quds Force]]\u2014which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., [[Canada]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Bahrain]]\u2014and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]]. Nine others were killed alongside Soleimani, including Iranian and [[Iraq]]i nationals such as deputy chairman of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] (PMF) and commander of the Iran-backed [[Kata'ib Hezbollah]] militia, [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]]\u2014a designated terrorist in the U.S. and in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).\n\nThe strike occurred during the [[2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis]], which began after the U.S. [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran]] in 2018, reimposed [[United States sanctions against Iran|sanctions]], and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region. On 27 December 2019, the [[K-1 Air Base]] in Iraq, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. personnel, was [[2019 K-1 Air Base attack|attacked]], killing an American contractor. The U.S. responded by launching [[December 2019 United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria|airstrikes across Iraq and Syria]], killing 25 Kata'ib Hezbollah militiamen. Days later, Shia militiamen and their supporters retaliated by [[Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad|attacking the U.S. embassy]] in the [[Green Zone]].\n\nU.S. officials justified the strike claiming it was necessary to stop an \"imminent attack\", though later clarifying the legal justification of the action as being taken \"in response to an escalating series of attacks...to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks...and to end Iran's strategic escalation of attacks...\" <ref>https://www.lawfareblog.com/white-house-releases-report-justifying-soleimani-strike</ref> Some critics of the strike questioned the legality of the attack with respect to [[international law]], as well as the domestic laws of the U.S. Iran called the strike an act of \"[[state terrorism]]\". The Iraqi government said the attack undermined its national sovereignty and considered it a breach of its bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and an act of aggression against its officials. On 5{{nbsp}}January 2020, the [[Iraqi parliament]] passed a non-binding resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory while, on the same day, Iran took the fifth and last step of reducing commitments to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|2015 international nuclear deal]].\n\nSoleimani's killing sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran and stoked fears of a military conflict. Iranian leaders vowed revenge, while U.S. officials said they would [[Preemptive war|preemptively]] attack any Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq that they perceived as a threat. Many in the international community reacted with concern and issued statements or declarations urging restraint and diplomacy. Five days after the airstrike, Iran launched a series of [[2020 Iranian attack on U.S. forces in Iraq|missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq]], the first direct engagement between Iran and the U.S. since [[Operation Praying Mantis]] in 1988. Following the shootdown of [[Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752]] amidst the escalation, leaders from both countries seemed reluctant to further escalate the crisis.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{Further|2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis|Iran\u2013United States relations}}\n\n=== Assassination as a policy consideration ===\n\nThe modern Middle East has seen a number of occasions in which the assassination of high-level government and military figures was attempted, or at least considered.

{"title_page": "Technological unemployment", "text_new": "{{short description|Unemployment primarily caused by technological change}}\n[[File:Pyxis Pharmacy Robot by Nurse Station.JPG|thumb|In the 21st century, robots are beginning to perform roles not just in manufacturing, but also in the service sector{{snd}} in healthcare, for example .]]\n'''Technological unemployment''' is the loss of jobs caused by [[technological change]]. It is a key type of [[structural unemployment]].\n\nTechnological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes ([[automation]]). Just as horses employed as prime movers were gradually made obsolete by the automobile, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout [[modern history]]. Historical examples include [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|artisan weavers]] reduced to poverty after the introduction of [[Power loom|mechanized looms]]. During [[World War II]], [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Bombe]] machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by [[Self-checkout|self-service tills]].\n\nThat technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. ''Optimists'' agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs,  whereas ''pessimists'' contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in the 1930s, who said it was a \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\".<ref>''[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm The Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren]'' (1930). E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(2)]</ref> Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least [[Aristotle]]'s time.\n\nPrior to the 18th century both the elite and [[common people]] would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern.  In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the [[classical economists]]. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"[[Luddite]] fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\n\nThe view that technology is unlikely to lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second decade of the 21st century,  a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may be increasing worldwide. Oxford Professors [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=114|pages=254\u2013280|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019|issn=0040-1625|last1=Frey|first1=Carl Benedikt|last2=Osborne|first2=Michael A|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.416}}</ref> However, their findings have frequently been misinterpreted, and on the PBS NewsHours they again made clear that their findings do not necessarily imply future technological unemployment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/brink-jobless-future|title=Are we on the brink of a jobless future?|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-15|date=31 August 2017}}</ref> While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acting-man.com/?p=32134|title=In the Future, Will Everyone Be Unemployed?|date=4 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/15/news/economy/zero-unemployment/|title=What 0% unemployment looks like|first=Annalyn|last=Censky|website=cnn.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/|title=A World Without Work|journal=The Atlantic|first=Derek|last=Thompson|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> A report in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist [[Gene Sperling]] and management professor [[Andrew McAfee]] on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a \"significant issue\".<ref name=\"Dreyfuss_2017-03-24\">{{Citation |last=Dreyfuss |first=Emily |date=2017-03-24 |title=Hate to break it to Steve Mnuchin, but AI's already taking jobs |journal=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/hate-break-steve-mnuchin-ais-already-taking-jobs/ |postscript=.}}</ref> Regarding a recent claim by Treasury Secretary [[Steve Mnuchin]] that automation is not \"going to have any kind of big effect on the economy for the next 50 or 100 years\", says McAfee, \"I don't talk to anyone in the field who believes that.\"<ref name=\"Dreyfuss_2017-03-24\"/> Recent technological innovations have the potential to render humans obsolete with the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other \"mental jobs\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/business/economy/a-future-without-jobs-two-views-of-the-changing-work-force.html|title=A Future Without Jobs?

And the general-purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever.|source=Lawrence Summers<ref name=\"summers\" />|quoted=1}}\n\nAll participants in the technological employment debates agree that temporary job losses can result from technological innovation.  Similarly, there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers. Disagreement focuses on whether it is possible for innovation to have a lasting negative impact on overall employment. Levels of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically, but the causes are subject to debate. Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation, yet claim that after a while, ''compensation effects'' will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed.  While this optimistic view has been continually challenged, it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90\">{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 77\u201390}}</ref><ref name = \"sympathy\"/> For example, labor economists [[Jacob Mincer]] and Stephan Danninger develop an empirical study using micro-data from the [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]], and find that although in the short run, technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment, it reduces unemployment in the long run. When they include a 5-year lag, however, the evidence supporting a short-run employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well, suggesting that technological unemployment \"appears to be a myth\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mincer|first=Jacob|last2=Danninger|first2=Stephan|date=July 2000|title=Technology, Unemployment, and Inflation|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w7817.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of [[structural unemployment]], a lasting level of joblessness that does not disappear even at the high point of the [[business cycle]], became popular in the 1960s. For pessimists, technological unemployment is one of the factors driving the wider phenomena of structural unemployment. Since the 1980s, even optimistic economists have increasingly accepted that structural unemployment has indeed risen in advanced economies (ref missing), but they have tended to blame this on [[globalisation]] and [[offshoring]] rather than technological change. Others claim a chief cause of the lasting increase in unemployment has been the reluctance of governments to pursue [[Expansionary Fiscal Policy|expansionary policies]] since the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] that occurred in the 1970s and early 80s.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90\"/><ref name=\"Effective Demand\"/><ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/> In the 21st century, and especially since 2013, pessimists have been arguing with increasing frequency that lasting worldwide technological unemployment is a growing threat.<ref name = \"sympathy\"/><ref name = \"replicants\"/><ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref>On the other hand, from a more positive perspective, some have argued that technological change will alter the structure of an organization in the sense that those in management roles will increasingly become more specialized to those roles as technology that assists collaboration and workflow management allows employees to manage themselves. The typical management role will, as a result, change to allow managers to concentrate on the task of supporting employees and improving their performance thus allowing them to add more, rather than less, value.</ref>\n\n===Compensation effects===\n[[File:BrownManchesterMuralJohnKay.jpg|thumb|''John Kay inventor of the Fly Shuttle AD 1753'', by [[Ford Madox Brown]], depicting the inventor [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] kissing his wife goodbye as men carry him away from his home to escape a mob angry about his labour-saving mechanical loom. Compensation effects were not widely understood at this time. ]]\nCompensation effects are labour-friendly consequences of innovation which \"compensate\" workers for job losses initially caused by new technology. In the 1820s, several compensation effects were described by [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]] in response to Ricardo's statement that long term technological unemployment could occur. Soon after, a whole system of effects was developed by [[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]].  The system was labelled \"compensation theory\" by [[Karl Marx|Marx]], who proceeded to attack the ideas, arguing that none of the effects were guaranteed to operate.  Disagreement over the effectiveness of compensation effects has remained a central part of academic debates on technological unemployment ever since.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/><ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\">{{Harvnb|Blaug|1997|loc= p182}}</ref>\n\nCompensation effects include: \n# By new machines. (The labour needed to build the new equipment that applied innovation requires.)\n# By new investments. (Enabled by the cost savings and therefore increased profits from the new technology.)\n#  By changes in wages. (In cases where unemployment does occur, this can cause a lowering of wages, thus allowing more workers to be re-employed at the now lower cost.  On the other hand, sometimes workers will enjoy wage increases as their profitability rises. This leads to increased income and therefore increased spending, which in turn encourages job creation.)\n# By lower prices.  (Which then lead to more demand, and therefore more employment.) Lower prices can also help offset wage cuts, as cheaper goods will increase workers' buying power.\n# By new products. (Where innovation directly creates new jobs.)\n\nThe \"by new machines\" effect is now rarely discussed by economists; it is often accepted that Marx successfully refuted it.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/> Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the \"by new products\" effect can sometimes have a positive effect on employment. An important distinction can be drawn between 'process'  and 'product' innovations.<ref group=\"note\">Labour-displacing technologies can be classified under the headings of [[mechanization]], [[automation]], and process improvement. The first two fundamentally involve transferring tasks from humans to machines. The third often involves the elimination of tasks altogether. The common theme of all three is that tasks are removed from the workforce, decreasing employment. In practice, the categories often overlap: a process improvement can include an automating or mechanizing achievement. The line between mechanization and automation is also subjective, as sometimes mechanization can involve sufficient [[control theory|control]] to be viewed as part of automation.</ref> Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level, more so than process innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Gustavo|last2=Tacsir|first2=Ezequiel|date=December 2012|title=Effects of Innovation on Employment in Latin America|url=|journal=Inter-American Development Bank|volume=|pages=}}</ref> The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics; the issue is still not resolved.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://ftp.iza.org/dp6291.pdf\n|title= Innovation, Employment and Skills in Advanced and Developing Countries: A Survey of the Literature\n|publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Labor]]\n|last= Vivarelli\n|first= Marco\n|date = January 2012\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref><ref name = \"Vivarelli2007\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://ftp.iza.org/dp2621.pdf\n|title= Innovation and Employment: : A Survey\n|publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Labor]]\n|last= Vivarelli\n|first= Marco\n|date = February 2007\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref> One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]]. According to research developed by Enrico Moretti, with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city, more than two jobs are created in the non-tradable sector. His findings suggest that technological growth and the resulting job-creation in high-tech industries might have a more significant [[spillover effect]] than we have anticipated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moretti|first=Enrico|date=May 2010|title=Local Multipliers|url=|journal=American Economic Review|volume=100|issue=2|pages=373\u2013377|doi=10.1257/aer.100.2.373}}</ref> Evidence from Europe also supports such a job multiplier effect, showing local high-tech jobs could create five additional low-tech jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goos|first=Maarten|last2=Konings|first2=Jozef|last3=Vandeweyer|first3=Marieke|date=September 2015|title=Employment Growth in Europe: The Roles of Innovation, Local Job Multipliers and Institutions.|url=|journal=Tjalling C. Koopmans Research Institute|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMany economists now pessimistic about technological unemployment accept that compensation effects did largely operate as the optimists claimed through most of the 19th and 20th century. Yet they hold that the advent of computerisation means that compensation effects are now less effective. An early example of this argument was made by [[Wassily Leontief]] in 1983. He conceded that after some disruption, the advance of [[mechanization]] during the Industrial Revolution actually increased the demand for labour as well as increasing pay due to effects that flow from increased [[productivity]]. While early machines lowered the demand for muscle power, they were unintelligent and needed large armies of human operators to remain productive. Yet since the introduction of computers into the workplace, there is now less need not just for muscle power but also for human brain power. Hence even as productivity continues to rise, the lower demand for human labour may mean less pay and employment.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/><ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref name = \"Advance\"/> However, this argument is not fully supported by more recent empirical studies. One research done by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Lorin Hitt|Lorin M. Hitt]] in 2003 presents direct evidence that suggests a positive short-term effect of computerization on firm-level measured productivity and output growth. In addition, they find the long-term productivity contribution of computerization and technological changes might even be greater.\n\n===The Luddite fallacy===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=If the Luddite fallacy were true we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries.|source=[[Alex Tabarrok]]<ref name=\"Tabarrok\">{{cite web |url=http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/12/productivity_an.html |title=Productivity and unemployment |accessdate=2007-03-11 |last=Tabarrok |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Tabarrok |date=2003-12-31 |work=Marginal Revolution}}</ref>|quoted=1}}\nThe term \"Luddite fallacy\" is sometimes used to express the view that those concerned about long term  technological unemployment are committing a fallacy, as they fail to account for compensation effects. People who use the term typically expect that technological progress will have no long-term impact on employment levels, and eventually will raise wages for all workers, because progress helps to increase the overall wealth of society. The term is based on the early 19th century example of the [[Luddite]]s. During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a [[fallacy]]. More recently, there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed.<ref name = \"sympathy\">\n{{cite news\n|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-for-the-luddites.html?_r=0\n|title= Sympathy for the Luddites\n|work= New York Times\n|last= Krugman\n|first= Paul\n|date = 2013-06-12\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Paul Krugman\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= Chpt 3, 'The Luddite Fallacy'}}</ref><ref name = \"Death\">{{cite web\n  |url= http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-skidelsky-revisits-the-luddites--claim-that-automation-depresses-real-wages\n  |title= Death to Machines?\n  |publisher= [[Project Syndicate]]\n  |author= Lord Skidelsky\n |date = 2013-06-12\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky\n }}\n</ref>\n\nThere are two underlying premises for why long-term difficulty could develop. The one that has traditionally been deployed is that ascribed to the Luddites (whether or not it is a truly accurate summary of their thinking), which is that there is a finite amount of work available and if machines do that work, there can be no other work left for humans to do. Economists call this the [[lump of labour fallacy]], arguing that in reality no such limitation exists. However, the other premise is that it is possible for long-term difficulty to arise that has nothing to do with any lump of labour. In this view, the amount of work that can exist is infinite, but (1) machines can do most of the \"easy\" work, (2) the definition of what is \"easy\" expands as information technology progresses, and (3) the work that lies beyond \"easy\" (the work that requires more skill, talent, knowledge, and insightful connections between pieces of knowledge) may require greater cognitive faculties than most humans are able to supply, as point 2 continually advances. This latter view is the one supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of long-term, systemic technological unemployment.\n\n===Skill levels and technological unemployment===\nA common view among those discussing the effect of innovation on the labour market has been that it mainly hurts those with low skills, while often benefiting  skilled workers. According to scholars such as [[Lawrence F.

Most existing firm-level research has found a labor-friendly nature of technological innovations. For example, German economists Stefan Lachenmaier and Horst Rottmann find that both product and process innovation have a positive effect on employment. They also find that process innovation has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lachenmaier|first=Stefan|last2=Rottmann|first2=Horst|title=May 2010|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=29|issue=2|pages=210\u2013220|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2010.05.004|year=2011|citeseerx=10.1.1.522.7577}}</ref> This result is supported by evidence in the United States as well, which shows that manufacturing firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs, not just limited to firm-specific behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coad|first=Alex|last2=Rao|first2=Rekha|date=May 2011|title=The firm-level employment effects of innovations in high-tech US manufacturing industries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=21|issue=2|pages=255\u2013283|doi=10.1007/s00191-010-0209-x}}</ref>\n\nAt the industry level, however, researchers have found mixed results with regard to the employment effect of technological changes. A 2017 study on manufacturing and service sectors in 11 European countries suggests that positive employment effects of technological innovations only exist in the medium- and high-tech sectors. There also seems to be a negative correlation between employment and capital formation, which suggests that technological progress could potentially be labor-saving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Piva|first=Mariacristina|last2=Vivarelli|first2=Marco|date=January 2017|title=Technological Change and Employment: Were Ricardo and Marx Right?|url=|journal=Institute of Labor Economics|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nLimited macroeconomic analysis has been done to study the relationship between technological shocks and unemployment. The small amount of existing research, however, suggests mixed results. Italian economist Marco Vivarelli finds that the labor-saving effect of process innovation seems to have affected the Italian economy more negatively than the United States. On the other hand, the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States, not Italy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Economics of Technology and Employment Theory and Empirical Evidence|last=Vivarelli|first=Marco|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=1995|isbn=978-1-85898-166-6|location=Italy}}</ref> Another study in 2013 finds a more transitory, rather than permanent, unemployment effect of technological change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Horst|date=November 2013|title=Technological unemployment in industrial countries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1099\u20131126|doi=10.1007/s00191-013-0308-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Measures of technological innovation ===\nThere have been four main approaches that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively. The first one, proposed by Jordi Gali in 1999 and further developed by Neville Francis and Valerie A. Ramey in 2005, is to use long-run restrictions in a Vector Autoregression (VAR) to identify technological shocks, assuming that only technology affects long-run productivity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gali|first=Jordi|date=1999|title=Technology, Employment, and the Business Cycle: Do Technology Shocks Explain Aggregate Fluctuations?|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/697e5bf9da0ea3193c2dc64460286bab36dd4b47|journal=American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=1|pages=249\u2013271|doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.249}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Neville|last2=Ramey|first2=Valerie|date=2005|title=Is the Technology-Driven Real Business Cycle Hypothesis Dead?

However, there are limitations with direct measures such as R&D. For example, since R&D only measures the input in innovation, the output is unlikely to be perfectly correlated with the input. In addition, R&D fails to capture the indeterminate lag between developing a new product or service, and bringing it to market.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Michelle|last2=Cohen|first2=Jon|date=2011|title=Volumes of evidence: examining technical change in the last century through a new lens.|url=https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/public/workingPapers/tecipa-392.pdf|journal=Canadian Journal of Economics|volume=44|issue=2|pages=413\u2013450|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5982.2011.01639.x}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth approach, constructed by Michelle Alexopoulos, looks at the number of new titles published in the fields of technology and computer science to reflect technological progress, which turns out to be consistent with R&D expenditure data.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Michelle|date=2011|title=Read All about It!!

It would assuredly bring them to ruin by depriving them of employment, thus making them beggars.\"  ]]\nIn Great Britain, the ruling elite began to take a less restrictive approach to innovation somewhat earlier than in much of continental Europe, which has been cited as a possible reason for Britain's early lead in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>E.g by [[Sir John Habakkuk]] in ''American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century'' (1962), [[Cambridge University Press]] \u2013 Habakkuk also went on to say that due to labour shortages, compared with their British counterparts there was far less resistance from U.S. workers  to the introduction of technology, leading to more update of innovation, and hence to the more efficient [[American system of manufacturing]]</ref>  Yet concern over the impact of innovation on employment remained strong through the 16th and early 17th century. A famous example of new technology being refused occurred when the inventor [[William Lee (inventor)|William Lee]] invited Queen Elizabeth I to view a labour saving knitting machine. The Queen declined to issue a patent on the grounds that the technology might cause unemployment among textile workers. After moving to France and also failing to achieve success in promoting his invention, Lee returned to England but was again refused by Elizabeth's successor [[James VI and I|James I]] for the same reason.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nEspecially after the [[Glorious Revolution]], authorities became less sympathetic to workers concerns about losing their jobs due to innovation. An increasingly influential strand of [[Mercantilism|Mercantilist]] thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment, as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition.  From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment. They would sometimes take [[direct action]], such as machine breaking, in attempts to protect themselves from disruptive innovation. [[Schumpeter]] notes that as the 18th century progressed, thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency, with [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|von Justi]] being a prominent example.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schumpeter|1987|loc= Chpt 4}}</ref> Yet Schumpeter also notes that the prevailing view among the elite solidified on the position that technological unemployment would not be a long-term problem.<ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref name=\"Schumpeter 1987 loc= Chpt 6\"/>\n\n===19th century===\nIt was only in the 19th century that debates over technological unemployment became intense, especially in Great Britain where many economic thinkers of the time were concentrated. Building on the work of [[Josiah Tucker|Dean Tucker]] and [[Adam Smith]], [[Political economy|political economists]] began to create what would become the modern discipline of [[economics]].<ref group=\"note\">Smith did not directly address the problem of technological unemployment, but the Dean had, saying in 1757 that in the long term, the introduction of machinery would allow more employment than would have been possible without them.</ref> While rejecting much of mercantilism, members of the new discipline largely agreed that technological unemployment would not be an enduring problem.  In the first few decades of the 19th century, several prominent political economists did, however, argue against the optimistic view, claiming that innovation could cause long-term unemployment. These included [[Jean Charles L\u00e9onard de Sismondi|Sismondi]],<ref name=\"Sowell_2006\">{{Citation |last=Sowell |first=T. |year=2006 |title=Chapter 5: Sismondi: A Neglected Pioneer |work=On Classical Economics}}</ref> [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[John Stuart Mill|J S Mill]], and from 1821, Ricardo himself.<ref>While initially of the view that innovation benefited the whole population,  Ricardo was persuaded by Malthus that technology could both push down wages for the working class, and cause long-term unemployment. He famously expressed these views in a chapter called  \"on Machinery\",  added to the third and final (1821) edition of [[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]</ref> As arguably the most respected political economist of his age, Ricardo's view was challenging to others in the discipline. The first major economist to respond was [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], who argued that no one would introduce machinery if they were going to reduce the amount of product,<ref group=\"note\">Typically the introduction of machinery would both increase output and lower cost per unit.</ref> and that as [[Say's Law]]  states that supply creates its own demand, any displaced workers would automatically find work elsewhere once the market had had time to adjust.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url= https://www.academia.edu/3465367\n|title= Is industrial innovation destroying jobs?   \n|journal= Academia.edu (Originally Published in the Cato Journal )\n|date = 18 Jan 2014\n|accessdate= 14 July 2015\n|last1= Bartlett \n|first1= Bruce \n}}</ref>   \n[[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]] expanded and formalised Say's optimistic views on technological unemployment, and was supported by others such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Nassau Senior]] and many other lesser known political economists.  Towards the middle of the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] joined the debates. Building on the work of Ricardo and Mill, Marx went much further, presenting a deeply pessimistic view of technological unemployment; his views attracted many followers and founded an enduring school of thought but mainstream economics was not dramatically changed.  By the 1870s,  at least in Great Britain, technological unemployment faded both as a popular concern and as an issue for academic debate. It had become increasingly apparent that innovation was increasing prosperity for all sections of British society, including the working class.  As the classical school of thought gave way to [[neoclassical economics]], mainstream thinking was tightened to take into account and refute the pessimistic arguments of Mill and Ricardo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 20\u201322}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:1980s computer worker, Centers for Disease Control.jpg|thumb|Critics of the view that innovation causes lasting unemployment argue that technology is used by workers and does not replace them on a large scale.]]\nFor the first two decades of the 20th century, mass unemployment was not the major problem it had been in the first half of the 19th. While the [[Marxian economics|Marxist school]] and a few other thinkers still challenged the optimistic view, technological unemployment was not a significant concern for mainstream economic thinking until the mid to late 1920s. In the 1920s mass unemployment re-emerged as a pressing issue within Europe.  At this time the U.S. was generally more prosperous, but even there urban unemployment had begun to increase from 1927. [[History of agriculture in the United States#1920s|Rural American workers had been suffering job losses]] from the start of the 1920s; many had been displaced by improved agricultural technology, such as the [[tractor]]. The centre of gravity for economic debates had by this time moved from Great Britain to the United States, and it was here that the 20th century's two great periods of debate over technological unemployment largely occurred.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 8\u201312}}</ref>\n\nThe peak periods for the two debates were in the 1930s and the 1960s.  According to economic historian Gregory R Woirol, the two episodes share several similarities.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12\">{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 8\u201312}}</ref>  In both cases academic debates were preceded by an outbreak of popular concern, sparked by recent rises in unemployment. In both cases the debates were not conclusively settled, but faded away as unemployment was reduced by an outbreak of war \u2013 World War II for the debate of the 1930s, and the [[Vietnam war]] for the 1960s episodes. In both cases, the debates were conducted within the prevailing paradigm at the time, with little reference to earlier thought. In the 1930s, optimists based their arguments largely on neo-classical beliefs in the self-correcting power of markets to automatically reduce any short-term unemployment via compensation effects. In the 1960s, faith in compensation effects was less strong, but the mainstream [[Keynesian economists]] of the time largely believed government intervention would be able to counter any persistent technological unemployment that was not cleared by market forces. Another similarity was the publication of a major Federal study towards the end of each episode, which broadly found that long-term technological unemployment was not occurring (though the studies did agree innovation was a major factor in the short term displacement of workers, and advised government action to provide assistance).<ref group=\"note\">In the 1930s, this study was \n''Unemployment and technological change''(Report no. G-70, 1940)  by Corrington Calhoun Gill  of the 'National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent changes in Industrial Techniques'. Some earlier Federal reports took a pessimistic view of technological unemployment, e.g.  ''Memorandum on Technological Unemployment'' (1933) by Ewan Clague  Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some authorities \u2013 e.g.   Udo Sautter in Chpt 5 of ''Three Cheers for the Unemployed: Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991) \u2013 say that in the early 1930s there was near consensus among US experts that technological unemployment was a major problem.  Other's though like [[Bruce Bartlett]] in [https://www.academia.edu/3465367/Is_Industrial_Innovation_Destroying_Jobs  Is Industrial Innovation Destroying Jobs (Cato Journal 1984)] argue that most economists remained optimistic even during the 1930s.  In the 1960s episode, the major Federal study that bookmarked the end of the period of intense debate was ''Technology and the American economy'' (1966) by the 'National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress' [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26449  established by president Lyndon Jonhson in 1964]</ref><ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12\"/>\n\nAs the [[golden age of capitalism]] came to a close in the 1970s, unemployment once again rose, and this time generally remained relatively high for the rest of the century, across most advanced economies.  Several economists once again argued that this may be due to innovation, with perhaps the most prominent being  [[Paul Samuelson]].<ref>{{cite journal \n|url= https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/scandj/v91y1989i1p47-62.html\n|title=Ricardo Was Right!\n|journal= [[The Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] \n|volume=91 \n|issue= 1 \n|pages= 47\u201362 \n|first= Paul |last=Samuelson|date=1989\n|doi=10.2307/3440162|jstor=3440162\n}}</ref> Overall, the closing decades of the 20th century saw most concern expressed over technological unemployment in Europe, though there were several examples in the U.S.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 143\u2013144}}</ref>  A number of popular works warning of technological unemployment were also published.

In his view, \"already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction, particularly for the less skilled, as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead.\"  Summers has also said that  \"[T]here are many reasons to think the software revolution will be even more profound than the agricultural revolution. This time around, change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy. [...] [T]here are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs. And the general-purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever.

Despite being the first person to create a formal system describing  compensation effects, Ramsey McCulloch and most other classical economists advocated government aid for those suffering from technological unemployment, as they understood that market adjustment to new technology was not instantaneous and that those displaced by labour-saving technology would not always be able to immediately obtain alternative employment through their own efforts.<ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\"/>\n\n=====Basic income=====\n{{Main|Basic income|Guaranteed minimum income}}\nSeveral commentators have argued that traditional forms of welfare payment may be inadequate as a response to the future challenges posed by technological unemployment, and have suggested a [[basic income]] as an alternative.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title = Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

Another objection is that funding it sustainably is a huge challenge. While new revenue-raising ideas have been proposed such as Martin Ford's wage recapture tax, how to fund a generous basic income remains a debated question, and skeptics have dismissed it as utopian. Even from a progressive viewpoint, there are concerns that a basic income set too low may not help the economically vulnerable, especially if financed largely from cuts to other forms of welfare.<ref name=\"paypressure\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= pp.162-168}}.</ref><ref name = \"MITRotman\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/538401/who-will-own-the-robots/\n|title= Who Will Own the Robots?\n|publisher= [[MIT]]\n|last= Rotman \n|first= David \n|date = 16 June 2015\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite magazine\n|url= https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1\n|title= Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income\n|magazine= [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]\n|last= Schneider\n|first= Nathan\n|date = January 2015\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Nathan Schneider\n}}\n</ref>\n\nTo better address both the funding concerns and concerns about government control, one alternative model is that the cost and control would be distributed across the private sector instead of the public sector. Companies across the economy would be required to employ humans, but the job descriptions would be left to private innovation, and individuals would have to compete to be hired and retained. This would be a for-profit sector analog of basic income, that is, a market-based form of basic income. It differs from a [[job guarantee]] in that the government is not the employer (rather, companies are) and there is no aspect of having employees who \"cannot be fired\", a problem that interferes with economic dynamism. The economic salvation in this model is not that every individual is guaranteed a job, but rather just that enough jobs exist that massive unemployment is avoided and employment is no longer solely the privilege of only the very smartest or highly trained 20% of the population. Another option for a market-based form of basic income has been proposed by the [[Center for Economic and Social Justice]] (CESJ) as part of \"a Just Third Way\" (a [[Third Way]] with greater justice) through widely distributed power and liberty. Called the Capital Homestead Act,<ref name=\"Capital_Homestead_Act\">{{Citation |publisher=[[Center for Economic and Social Justice]] |title=Capital Homestead Act Summary |url=http://www.cesj.org/learn/capital-homesteading/capital-homestead-act-summary/ }}</ref> it is reminiscent of [[James S.

Summers suggested more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws; reductions in \"excessive\" protection for intellectual property; greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation; strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements; improvements in corporate governance; strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity; easing of land-use restrictions that may cause estates to keep rising in value; better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers; and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development, such as energy production and transportation.<ref name=\"summers\"/><ref name=NYT-2014-12-15/><ref name=\"inequalityPuzzle\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dont-fear-the-robots-taking-your-job-blame-the-monopolies-behind-them|title=Don't Fear the Robots Taking Your Job, Fear the Monopolies Behind Them|last=Turk|first=Victoria|date=2014-06-19|magazine=Vice.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Spence]] has advised that responding to the future impact of technology will require a detailed understanding of the global forces and flows technology has set in motion. Adapting to them \"will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution\".<ref group=\"note\">Spence also wrote that \"Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and [[disintermediation]] has been underway for some time in service sectors \u2013 think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.\" In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. sensors) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. \"Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling.\" Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor.\" For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is \"easy to imagine\" that production may become \"extremely\" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. \"Meanwhile, the impact of robotics ... is not confined to production. Though self-driving cars and drones are the most attention-getting examples, the impact on logistics is no less transformative. Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore, one of the most efficient in the world.\" Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear globally. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion.</ref><ref>Michael Spence, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/michael-spence-describes-an-era-in-which-developing-countries-can-no-longer-rely-on-vast-numbers-of-cheap-workers Labor\u2019s Digital Displacement] (2014-05-22), ''[[Project Syndicate]]''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Autonomous car]]\n* [[Disruptive innovation]]\n* [[Emerging technologies]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* ''[[Humans Need Not Apply]]''\n* [[Industrial society]]\n* ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''\n* [[Robot tax]]\n* [[Technological revolution]]\n* [[Technological transitions]]\n* [[Technophobia]]\n* ''[[The Future of Work and Death]]''\n* [[The Triple Revolution]]\n* [[Working time]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=Some evidences of technological unemployment in ancient Athens and Rome |first= John Douglas |last= Forbes |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=1932 |oclc=654841233 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century: The Search for Labour Saving Inventions|first=  H.J. |last=Habakkuk| authorlink=Sir John Habakkuk|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1967 |isbn=978-0521094474 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=History of Economic Analysis (new edititon) |first=Joseph |last= Schumpeter|authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter|publisher=Routledge|year=1987 |isbn=978-0415108881 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=Studies in Ancient Technology Vol 2 |first=Robert |last=Forbes |author-link=Robert Jacobus Forbes |publisher=Brill |year=1993 |isbn=978-9004006225 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/studiesinancient0000forb }}\n* {{Noble1984}}\n* {{Citation | last = Noble | first = David F. | author-link = David F.

It is a key type of [[structural unemployment]].\n\nTechnological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes ([[automation]]). Just as horses employed as prime movers were gradually made obsolete by the automobile, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout [[modern history]]. Historical examples include [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|artisan weavers]] reduced to poverty after the introduction of [[Power loom|mechanized looms]]. During [[World War II]], [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Bombe]] machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by [[Self-checkout|self-service tills]].\n\nThat technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. ''Optimists'' agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs,  whereas ''pessimists'' contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in the 1930s, who said it was a \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\".<ref>''[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm The Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren]'' (1930). E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(2)]</ref> Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least [[Aristotle]]'s time.\n\nPrior to the 18th century both the elite and [[common people]] would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern.  In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the [[classical economists]]. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"[[Luddite]] fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\n\nThe view that technology is unlikely to lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second decade of the 21st century,  a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may be increasing worldwide.

Similarly, there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers. Disagreement focuses on whether it is possible for innovation to have a lasting negative impact on overall employment. Levels of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically, but the causes are subject to debate. Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation, yet claim that after a while, ''compensation effects'' will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed.  While this optimistic view has been continually challenged, it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90\">{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 77\u201390}}</ref><ref name = \"sympathy\"/> For example, labor economists [[Jacob Mincer]] and Stephan Danninger develop an empirical study using micro-data from the [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]], and find that although in the short run, technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment, it reduces unemployment in the long run. When they include a 5-year lag, however, the evidence supporting a short-run employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well, suggesting that technological unemployment \"appears to be a myth\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mincer|first=Jacob|last2=Danninger|first2=Stephan|date=July 2000|title=Technology, Unemployment, and Inflation|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w7817.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of [[structural unemployment]], a lasting level of joblessness that does not disappear even at the high point of the [[business cycle]], became popular in the 1960s. For pessimists, technological unemployment is one of the factors driving the wider phenomena of structural unemployment. Since the 1980s, even optimistic economists have increasingly accepted that structural unemployment has indeed risen in advanced economies (ref missing), but they have tended to blame this on [[globalisation]] and [[offshoring]] rather than technological change. Others claim a chief cause of the lasting increase in unemployment has been the reluctance of governments to pursue [[Expansionary Fiscal Policy|expansionary policies]] since the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] that occurred in the 1970s and early 80s.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90\"/><ref name=\"Effective Demand\"/><ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/> In the 21st century, and especially since 2013, pessimists have been arguing with increasing frequency that lasting worldwide technological unemployment is a growing threat.<ref name = \"sympathy\"/><ref name = \"replicants\"/><ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref>On the other hand, from a more positive perspective, some have argued that technological change will alter the structure of an organization in the sense that those in management roles will increasingly become more specialized to those roles as technology that assists collaboration and workflow management allows employees to manage themselves. The typical management role will, as a result, change to allow managers to concentrate on the task of supporting employees and improving their performance thus allowing them to add more, rather than less, value.</ref>\n\n===Compensation effects===\n[[File:BrownManchesterMuralJohnKay.jpg|thumb|''John Kay inventor of the Fly Shuttle AD 1753'', by [[Ford Madox Brown]], depicting the inventor [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] kissing his wife goodbye as men carry him away from his home to escape a mob angry about his labour-saving mechanical loom. Compensation effects were not widely understood at this time. ]]\nCompensation effects are labour-friendly consequences of innovation which \"compensate\" workers for job losses initially caused by new technology. In the 1820s, several compensation effects were described by [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]] in response to Ricardo's statement that long term technological unemployment could occur. Soon after, a whole system of effects was developed by [[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]].  The system was labelled \"compensation theory\" by [[Karl Marx|Marx]], who proceeded to attack the ideas, arguing that none of the effects were guaranteed to operate.  Disagreement over the effectiveness of compensation effects has remained a central part of academic debates on technological unemployment ever since.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/><ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\">{{Harvnb|Blaug|1997|loc= p182}}</ref>\n\nCompensation effects include: \n# By new machines. (The labour needed to build the new equipment that applied innovation requires.)\n# By new investments. (Enabled by the cost savings and therefore increased profits from the new technology.)\n#  By changes in wages. (In cases where unemployment does occur, this can cause a lowering of wages, thus allowing more workers to be re-employed at the now lower cost.  On the other hand, sometimes workers will enjoy wage increases as their profitability rises. This leads to increased income and therefore increased spending, which in turn encourages job creation.)\n# By lower prices.  (Which then lead to more demand, and therefore more employment.) Lower prices can also help offset wage cuts, as cheaper goods will increase workers' buying power.\n# By new products. (Where innovation directly creates new jobs.)\n\nThe \"by new machines\" effect is now rarely discussed by economists; it is often accepted that Marx successfully refuted it.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/> Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the \"by new products\" effect can sometimes have a positive effect on employment. An important distinction can be drawn between 'process'  and 'product' innovations.<ref group=\"note\">Labour-displacing technologies can be classified under the headings of [[mechanization]], [[automation]], and process improvement. The first two fundamentally involve transferring tasks from humans to machines. The third often involves the elimination of tasks altogether. The common theme of all three is that tasks are removed from the workforce, decreasing employment. In practice, the categories often overlap: a process improvement can include an automating or mechanizing achievement. The line between mechanization and automation is also subjective, as sometimes mechanization can involve sufficient [[control theory|control]] to be viewed as part of automation.</ref> Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level, more so than process innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Gustavo|last2=Tacsir|first2=Ezequiel|date=December 2012|title=Effects of Innovation on Employment in Latin America|url=|journal=Inter-American Development Bank|volume=|pages=}}</ref> The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics; the issue is still not resolved.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://ftp.iza.org/dp6291.pdf\n|title= Innovation, Employment and Skills in Advanced and Developing Countries: A Survey of the Literature\n|publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Labor]]\n|last= Vivarelli\n|first= Marco\n|date = January 2012\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref><ref name = \"Vivarelli2007\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://ftp.iza.org/dp2621.pdf\n|title= Innovation and Employment: : A Survey\n|publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Labor]]\n|last= Vivarelli\n|first= Marco\n|date = February 2007\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref> One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]]. According to research developed by Enrico Moretti, with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city, more than two jobs are created in the non-tradable sector.

Koopmans Research Institute|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nMany economists now pessimistic about technological unemployment accept that compensation effects did largely operate as the optimists claimed through most of the 19th and 20th century. Yet they hold that the advent of computerisation means that compensation effects are now less effective. An early example of this argument was made by [[Wassily Leontief]] in 1983. He conceded that after some disruption, the advance of [[mechanization]] during the Industrial Revolution actually increased the demand for labour as well as increasing pay due to effects that flow from increased [[productivity]]. While early machines lowered the demand for muscle power, they were unintelligent and needed large armies of human operators to remain productive. Yet since the introduction of computers into the workplace, there is now less need not just for muscle power but also for human brain power. Hence even as productivity continues to rise, the lower demand for human labour may mean less pay and employment.<ref name = \"Vivarelli2012\"/><ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref name = \"Advance\"/> However, this argument is not fully supported by more recent empirical studies. One research done by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Lorin Hitt|Lorin M. Hitt]] in 2003 presents direct evidence that suggests a positive short-term effect of computerization on firm-level measured productivity and output growth. In addition, they find the long-term productivity contribution of computerization and technological changes might even be greater.\n\n===The Luddite fallacy===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=If the Luddite fallacy were true we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries.|source=[[Alex Tabarrok]]<ref name=\"Tabarrok\">{{cite web |url=http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/12/productivity_an.html |title=Productivity and unemployment |accessdate=2007-03-11 |last=Tabarrok |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Tabarrok |date=2003-12-31 |work=Marginal Revolution}}</ref>|quoted=1}}\nThe term \"Luddite fallacy\" is sometimes used to express the view that those concerned about long term  technological unemployment are committing a fallacy, as they fail to account for compensation effects. People who use the term typically expect that technological progress will have no long-term impact on employment levels, and eventually will raise wages for all workers, because progress helps to increase the overall wealth of society. The term is based on the early 19th century example of the [[Luddite]]s. During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a [[fallacy]]. More recently, there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed.<ref name = \"sympathy\">\n{{cite news\n|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/krugman-sympathy-for-the-luddites.html?_r=0\n|title= Sympathy for the Luddites\n|work= New York Times\n|last= Krugman\n|first= Paul\n|date = 2013-06-12\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Paul Krugman\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= Chpt 3, 'The Luddite Fallacy'}}</ref><ref name = \"Death\">{{cite web\n  |url= http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/robert-skidelsky-revisits-the-luddites--claim-that-automation-depresses-real-wages\n  |title= Death to Machines?\n  |publisher= [[Project Syndicate]]\n  |author= Lord Skidelsky\n |date = 2013-06-12\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky\n }}\n</ref>\n\nThere are two underlying premises for why long-term difficulty could develop. The one that has traditionally been deployed is that ascribed to the Luddites (whether or not it is a truly accurate summary of their thinking), which is that there is a finite amount of work available and if machines do that work, there can be no other work left for humans to do. Economists call this the [[lump of labour fallacy]], arguing that in reality no such limitation exists. However, the other premise is that it is possible for long-term difficulty to arise that has nothing to do with any lump of labour. In this view, the amount of work that can exist is infinite, but (1) machines can do most of the \"easy\" work, (2) the definition of what is \"easy\" expands as information technology progresses, and (3) the work that lies beyond \"easy\" (the work that requires more skill, talent, knowledge, and insightful connections between pieces of knowledge) may require greater cognitive faculties than most humans are able to supply, as point 2 continually advances. This latter view is the one supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of long-term, systemic technological unemployment.\n\n===Skill levels and technological unemployment===\nA common view among those discussing the effect of innovation on the labour market has been that it mainly hurts those with low skills, while often benefiting  skilled workers. According to scholars such as [[Lawrence F. Katz]], this may have been true for much of the twentieth century, yet in the 19th century, innovations in the workplace largely displaced costly skilled artisans, and generally benefited the low skilled.  While 21st century innovation has been replacing some unskilled work, other low skilled occupations remain resistant to automation, while white collar work requiring intermediate skills is increasingly being performed by autonomous computer programs.<ref name = \"relative\">{{cite book |chapter=Technical Change and the Relative Demand for Skilled Labor: The United States in Historical Perspective |first=Lawrence F. |last=Katz |first2=Robert A. |last2=Margo |title=Human Capital in History: The American Record |editor-last=Boustan |editor2-last=Frydman |editor3-last=Margo |year=2014 |doi=10.3386/w18752 }}</ref><ref name = \"polarization\">\n{{cite journal\n|author1=David H.

Most existing firm-level research has found a labor-friendly nature of technological innovations. For example, German economists Stefan Lachenmaier and Horst Rottmann find that both product and process innovation have a positive effect on employment. They also find that process innovation has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lachenmaier|first=Stefan|last2=Rottmann|first2=Horst|title=May 2010|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=29|issue=2|pages=210\u2013220|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2010.05.004|year=2011|citeseerx=10.1.1.522.7577}}</ref> This result is supported by evidence in the United States as well, which shows that manufacturing firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs, not just limited to firm-specific behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coad|first=Alex|last2=Rao|first2=Rekha|date=May 2011|title=The firm-level employment effects of innovations in high-tech US manufacturing industries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=21|issue=2|pages=255\u2013283|doi=10.1007/s00191-010-0209-x}}</ref>\n\nAt the industry level, however, researchers have found mixed results with regard to the employment effect of technological changes. A 2017 study on manufacturing and service sectors in 11 European countries suggests that positive employment effects of technological innovations only exist in the medium- and high-tech sectors. There also seems to be a negative correlation between employment and capital formation, which suggests that technological progress could potentially be labor-saving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Piva|first=Mariacristina|last2=Vivarelli|first2=Marco|date=January 2017|title=Technological Change and Employment: Were Ricardo and Marx Right?|url=|journal=Institute of Labor Economics|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nLimited macroeconomic analysis has been done to study the relationship between technological shocks and unemployment. The small amount of existing research, however, suggests mixed results. Italian economist Marco Vivarelli finds that the labor-saving effect of process innovation seems to have affected the Italian economy more negatively than the United States. On the other hand, the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States, not Italy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Economics of Technology and Employment Theory and Empirical Evidence|last=Vivarelli|first=Marco|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=1995|isbn=978-1-85898-166-6|location=Italy}}</ref> Another study in 2013 finds a more transitory, rather than permanent, unemployment effect of technological change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Horst|date=November 2013|title=Technological unemployment in industrial countries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1099\u20131126|doi=10.1007/s00191-013-0308-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Measures of technological innovation ===\nThere have been four main approaches that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively.

Ramey in 2005, is to use long-run restrictions in a Vector Autoregression (VAR) to identify technological shocks, assuming that only technology affects long-run productivity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gali|first=Jordi|date=1999|title=Technology, Employment, and the Business Cycle: Do Technology Shocks Explain Aggregate Fluctuations?|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/697e5bf9da0ea3193c2dc64460286bab36dd4b47|journal=American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=1|pages=249\u2013271|doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.249}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Neville|last2=Ramey|first2=Valerie|date=2005|title=Is the Technology-Driven Real Business Cycle Hypothesis Dead?

It would assuredly bring them to ruin by depriving them of employment, thus making them beggars.\"  ]]\nIn Great Britain, the ruling elite began to take a less restrictive approach to innovation somewhat earlier than in much of continental Europe, which has been cited as a possible reason for Britain's early lead in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>E.g by [[Sir John Habakkuk]] in ''American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century'' (1962), [[Cambridge University Press]] \u2013 Habakkuk also went on to say that due to labour shortages, compared with their British counterparts there was far less resistance from U.S. workers  to the introduction of technology, leading to more update of innovation, and hence to the more efficient [[American system of manufacturing]]</ref>  Yet concern over the impact of innovation on employment remained strong through the 16th and early 17th century. A famous example of new technology being refused occurred when the inventor [[William Lee (inventor)|William Lee]] invited Queen Elizabeth I to view a labour saving knitting machine. The Queen declined to issue a patent on the grounds that the technology might cause unemployment among textile workers. After moving to France and also failing to achieve success in promoting his invention, Lee returned to England but was again refused by Elizabeth's successor [[James VI and I|James I]] for the same reason.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nEspecially after the [[Glorious Revolution]], authorities became less sympathetic to workers concerns about losing their jobs due to innovation. An increasingly influential strand of [[Mercantilism|Mercantilist]] thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment, as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition.  From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment. They would sometimes take [[direct action]], such as machine breaking, in attempts to protect themselves from disruptive innovation. [[Schumpeter]] notes that as the 18th century progressed, thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency, with [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|von Justi]] being a prominent example.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schumpeter|1987|loc= Chpt 4}}</ref> Yet Schumpeter also notes that the prevailing view among the elite solidified on the position that technological unemployment would not be a long-term problem.<ref name=\"Martin\"/><ref name=\"Schumpeter 1987 loc= Chpt 6\"/>\n\n===19th century===\nIt was only in the 19th century that debates over technological unemployment became intense, especially in Great Britain where many economic thinkers of the time were concentrated. Building on the work of [[Josiah Tucker|Dean Tucker]] and [[Adam Smith]], [[Political economy|political economists]] began to create what would become the modern discipline of [[economics]].<ref group=\"note\">Smith did not directly address the problem of technological unemployment, but the Dean had, saying in 1757 that in the long term, the introduction of machinery would allow more employment than would have been possible without them.</ref> While rejecting much of mercantilism, members of the new discipline largely agreed that technological unemployment would not be an enduring problem.  In the first few decades of the 19th century, several prominent political economists did, however, argue against the optimistic view, claiming that innovation could cause long-term unemployment. These included [[Jean Charles L\u00e9onard de Sismondi|Sismondi]],<ref name=\"Sowell_2006\">{{Citation |last=Sowell |first=T. |year=2006 |title=Chapter 5: Sismondi: A Neglected Pioneer |work=On Classical Economics}}</ref> [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[John Stuart Mill|J S Mill]], and from 1821, Ricardo himself.<ref>While initially of the view that innovation benefited the whole population,  Ricardo was persuaded by Malthus that technology could both push down wages for the working class, and cause long-term unemployment. He famously expressed these views in a chapter called  \"on Machinery\",  added to the third and final (1821) edition of [[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]</ref> As arguably the most respected political economist of his age, Ricardo's view was challenging to others in the discipline. The first major economist to respond was [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], who argued that no one would introduce machinery if they were going to reduce the amount of product,<ref group=\"note\">Typically the introduction of machinery would both increase output and lower cost per unit.</ref> and that as [[Say's Law]]  states that supply creates its own demand, any displaced workers would automatically find work elsewhere once the market had had time to adjust.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url= https://www.academia.edu/3465367\n|title= Is industrial innovation destroying jobs?   \n|journal= Academia.edu (Originally Published in the Cato Journal )\n|date = 18 Jan 2014\n|accessdate= 14 July 2015\n|last1= Bartlett \n|first1= Bruce \n}}</ref>   \n[[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]] expanded and formalised Say's optimistic views on technological unemployment, and was supported by others such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Nassau Senior]] and many other lesser known political economists.  Towards the middle of the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] joined the debates. Building on the work of Ricardo and Mill, Marx went much further, presenting a deeply pessimistic view of technological unemployment; his views attracted many followers and founded an enduring school of thought but mainstream economics was not dramatically changed.  By the 1870s,  at least in Great Britain, technological unemployment faded both as a popular concern and as an issue for academic debate. It had become increasingly apparent that innovation was increasing prosperity for all sections of British society, including the working class.  As the classical school of thought gave way to [[neoclassical economics]], mainstream thinking was tightened to take into account and refute the pessimistic arguments of Mill and Ricardo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 20\u201322}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:1980s computer worker, Centers for Disease Control.jpg|thumb|Critics of the view that innovation causes lasting unemployment argue that technology is used by workers and does not replace them on a large scale.]]\nFor the first two decades of the 20th century, mass unemployment was not the major problem it had been in the first half of the 19th. While the [[Marxian economics|Marxist school]] and a few other thinkers still challenged the optimistic view, technological unemployment was not a significant concern for mainstream economic thinking until the mid to late 1920s. In the 1920s mass unemployment re-emerged as a pressing issue within Europe.  At this time the U.S. was generally more prosperous, but even there urban unemployment had begun to increase from 1927. [[History of agriculture in the United States#1920s|Rural American workers had been suffering job losses]] from the start of the 1920s; many had been displaced by improved agricultural technology, such as the [[tractor]]. The centre of gravity for economic debates had by this time moved from Great Britain to the United States, and it was here that the 20th century's two great periods of debate over technological unemployment largely occurred.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 8\u201312}}</ref>\n\nThe peak periods for the two debates were in the 1930s and the 1960s.  According to economic historian Gregory R Woirol, the two episodes share several similarities.<ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12\">{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 8\u201312}}</ref>  In both cases academic debates were preceded by an outbreak of popular concern, sparked by recent rises in unemployment. In both cases the debates were not conclusively settled, but faded away as unemployment was reduced by an outbreak of war \u2013 World War II for the debate of the 1930s, and the [[Vietnam war]] for the 1960s episodes. In both cases, the debates were conducted within the prevailing paradigm at the time, with little reference to earlier thought. In the 1930s, optimists based their arguments largely on neo-classical beliefs in the self-correcting power of markets to automatically reduce any short-term unemployment via compensation effects. In the 1960s, faith in compensation effects was less strong, but the mainstream [[Keynesian economists]] of the time largely believed government intervention would be able to counter any persistent technological unemployment that was not cleared by market forces. Another similarity was the publication of a major Federal study towards the end of each episode, which broadly found that long-term technological unemployment was not occurring (though the studies did agree innovation was a major factor in the short term displacement of workers, and advised government action to provide assistance).<ref group=\"note\">In the 1930s, this study was \n''Unemployment and technological change''(Report no. G-70, 1940)  by Corrington Calhoun Gill  of the 'National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent changes in Industrial Techniques'. Some earlier Federal reports took a pessimistic view of technological unemployment, e.g.  ''Memorandum on Technological Unemployment'' (1933) by Ewan Clague  Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some authorities \u2013 e.g.   Udo Sautter in Chpt 5 of ''Three Cheers for the Unemployed: Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991) \u2013 say that in the early 1930s there was near consensus among US experts that technological unemployment was a major problem.  Other's though like [[Bruce Bartlett]] in [https://www.academia.edu/3465367/Is_Industrial_Innovation_Destroying_Jobs  Is Industrial Innovation Destroying Jobs (Cato Journal 1984)] argue that most economists remained optimistic even during the 1930s.  In the 1960s episode, the major Federal study that bookmarked the end of the period of intense debate was ''Technology and the American economy'' (1966) by the 'National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress' [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26449  established by president Lyndon Jonhson in 1964]</ref><ref name=\"Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12\"/>\n\nAs the [[golden age of capitalism]] came to a close in the 1970s, unemployment once again rose, and this time generally remained relatively high for the rest of the century, across most advanced economies.  Several economists once again argued that this may be due to innovation, with perhaps the most prominent being  [[Paul Samuelson]].<ref>{{cite journal \n|url= https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/scandj/v91y1989i1p47-62.html\n|title=Ricardo Was Right!\n|journal= [[The Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] \n|volume=91 \n|issue= 1 \n|pages= 47\u201362 \n|first= Paul |last=Samuelson|date=1989\n|doi=10.2307/3440162|jstor=3440162\n}}</ref> Overall, the closing decades of the 20th century saw most concern expressed over technological unemployment in Europe, though there were several examples in the U.S.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 143\u2013144}}</ref>  A number of popular works warning of technological unemployment were also published.

Often, the practical solution is to find another job, but usually workers do not have the qualifications for high-level jobs and must drop to low-level jobs.

Since the development of modern economics, however, this option has generally not even been considered as a solution, at least not for the advanced economies. Even commentators who are pessimistic about long-term technological unemployment invariably consider innovation to be an overall benefit to society, with JS Mill being perhaps the only prominent western political economist to have suggested prohibiting the use of technology as a possible solution to unemployment.<ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\"/>\n\n[[Gandhian economics]] called for a delay in the uptake of labour saving machines until unemployment was alleviated, however this advice was largely rejected by [[Nehru]] who was to become prime minister once India achieved its independence. The policy of slowing the introduction of innovation so as to avoid technological unemployment was however implemented in the 20th century within China under  [[Mao]]'s administration.<ref>\n{{cite book \n|author = B.

Just prior to World War II working hours had fallen to about 42 per week, and the fall was similar in other advanced economies. According to [[Wassily Leontief]], this was a voluntary increase in technological unemployment. The reduction in working hours helped share out available work, and was favoured by workers who were happy to reduce hours to gain extra leisure, as innovation was at the time generally helping to increase their rates of pay.<ref name = \"Advance\">\n{{cite journal\n|last=Leontief\n|first=Wassily\n|date= September 1983\n|title=Technological Advance, Economic Growth, and the Distribution of Income \n|journal=[[Population and Development Review]]\n|jstor=1973315 \n|doi= 10.2307/1973315\n|volume= 9 |issue= 3\n|pages= 403\u2013410\n|author-link= Wassily Leontief\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFurther reductions in working hours have been proposed as a possible solution to unemployment by economists including [[John R.

Yet once working hours have reached about 40 hours per week, workers have been less enthusiastic about further reductions, both to prevent loss of income and as many value [[workmanship|engaging in work for its own sake]].

Welfare programmes have historically tended to be more durable once established, compared with other solutions to unemployment such as directly creating jobs with public works.  Despite being the first person to create a formal system describing  compensation effects, Ramsey McCulloch and most other classical economists advocated government aid for those suffering from technological unemployment, as they understood that market adjustment to new technology was not instantaneous and that those displaced by labour-saving technology would not always be able to immediately obtain alternative employment through their own efforts.<ref name=\"Blaug 1997 loc= p182\"/>\n\n=====Basic income=====\n{{Main|Basic income|Guaranteed minimum income}}\nSeveral commentators have argued that traditional forms of welfare payment may be inadequate as a response to the future challenges posed by technological unemployment, and have suggested a [[basic income]] as an alternative.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title = Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

For example, while the best-known proposed forms (with taxation and distribution) are usually thought of as left-leaning ideas that right-leaning people try to defend against, other forms have been proposed even by [[libertarianism|libertarians]], such as [[Friedrich Hayek|von Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]]. Republican president [[Nixon]]'s Family Assistance Plan (FAP) of 1969, which had much in common with basic income, passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] but was defeated in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].<ref name=\"Nixon1978\">{{cite book | last = Nixon | first = Richard | year = 1978 | title = RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon | publisher = Grosset & Dunlap | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-448-14374-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/rnmemoirsofricha00nixo }}</ref>\n\nOne objection to basic income is that it could be a [[incentivisation|disincentive to work]], but evidence from older [[Basic income pilots|pilots]] in India, Africa, and Canada indicates that this does not happen and that a basic income encourages low-level [[entrepreneurship]] and more productive, collaborative work. Another objection is that funding it sustainably is a huge challenge. While new revenue-raising ideas have been proposed such as Martin Ford's wage recapture tax, how to fund a generous basic income remains a debated question, and skeptics have dismissed it as utopian. Even from a progressive viewpoint, there are concerns that a basic income set too low may not help the economically vulnerable, especially if financed largely from cuts to other forms of welfare.<ref name=\"paypressure\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= pp.162-168}}.</ref><ref name = \"MITRotman\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/538401/who-will-own-the-robots/\n|title= Who Will Own the Robots?\n|publisher= [[MIT]]\n|last= Rotman \n|first= David \n|date = 16 June 2015\n|accessdate=14 July 2015}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite magazine\n|url= https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1\n|title= Why the Tech Elite Is Getting Behind Universal Basic Income\n|magazine= [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]\n|last= Schneider\n|first= Nathan\n|date = January 2015\n|accessdate=14 July 2015|author-link= Nathan Schneider\n}}\n</ref>\n\nTo better address both the funding concerns and concerns about government control, one alternative model is that the cost and control would be distributed across the private sector instead of the public sector. Companies across the economy would be required to employ humans, but the job descriptions would be left to private innovation, and individuals would have to compete to be hired and retained. This would be a for-profit sector analog of basic income, that is, a market-based form of basic income. It differs from a [[job guarantee]] in that the government is not the employer (rather, companies are) and there is no aspect of having employees who \"cannot be fired\", a problem that interferes with economic dynamism. The economic salvation in this model is not that every individual is guaranteed a job, but rather just that enough jobs exist that massive unemployment is avoided and employment is no longer solely the privilege of only the very smartest or highly trained 20% of the population. Another option for a market-based form of basic income has been proposed by the [[Center for Economic and Social Justice]] (CESJ) as part of \"a Just Third Way\" (a [[Third Way]] with greater justice) through widely distributed power and liberty. Called the Capital Homestead Act,<ref name=\"Capital_Homestead_Act\">{{Citation |publisher=[[Center for Economic and Social Justice]] |title=Capital Homestead Act Summary |url=http://www.cesj.org/learn/capital-homesteading/capital-homestead-act-summary/ }}</ref> it is reminiscent of [[James S.

He advised vigorous cooperative efforts to address the \"myriad devices\" \u2013 such as tax havens, bank secrecy, money laundering, and regulatory arbitrage \u2013 which enable the holders of great wealth to avoid paying taxes, and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring \"great social contributions\" in return. Summers suggested more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws; reductions in \"excessive\" protection for intellectual property; greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation; strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements; improvements in corporate governance; strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity; easing of land-use restrictions that may cause estates to keep rising in value; better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers; and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development, such as energy production and transportation.<ref name=\"summers\"/><ref name=NYT-2014-12-15/><ref name=\"inequalityPuzzle\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dont-fear-the-robots-taking-your-job-blame-the-monopolies-behind-them|title=Don't Fear the Robots Taking Your Job, Fear the Monopolies Behind Them|last=Turk|first=Victoria|date=2014-06-19|magazine=Vice.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Spence]] has advised that responding to the future impact of technology will require a detailed understanding of the global forces and flows technology has set in motion. Adapting to them \"will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution\".<ref group=\"note\">Spence also wrote that \"Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and [[disintermediation]] has been underway for some time in service sectors \u2013 think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.\" In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. sensors) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. \"Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling.\" Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies \"is cost reduction via the replacement of labor.\" For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is \"easy to imagine\" that production may become \"extremely\" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. \"Meanwhile, the impact of robotics ... is not confined to production. Though self-driving cars and drones are the most attention-getting examples, the impact on logistics is no less transformative. Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore, one of the most efficient in the world.\" Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear globally. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion.</ref><ref>Michael Spence, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/michael-spence-describes-an-era-in-which-developing-countries-can-no-longer-rely-on-vast-numbers-of-cheap-workers Labor\u2019s Digital Displacement] (2014-05-22), ''[[Project Syndicate]]''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Autonomous car]]\n* [[Disruptive innovation]]\n* [[Emerging technologies]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* ''[[Humans Need Not Apply]]''\n* [[Industrial society]]\n* ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''\n* [[Robot tax]]\n* [[Technological revolution]]\n* [[Technological transitions]]\n* [[Technophobia]]\n* ''[[The Future of Work and Death]]''\n* [[The Triple Revolution]]\n* [[Working time]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=Some evidences of technological unemployment in ancient Athens and Rome |first= John Douglas |last= Forbes |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=1932 |oclc=654841233 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century: The Search for Labour Saving Inventions|first=  H.J. |last=Habakkuk| authorlink=Sir John Habakkuk|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1967 |isbn=978-0521094474 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=History of Economic Analysis (new edititon) |first=Joseph |last= Schumpeter|authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter|publisher=Routledge|year=1987 |isbn=978-0415108881 }}\n*{{citation |ref=harv |title=Studies in Ancient Technology Vol 2 |first=Robert |last=Forbes |author-link=Robert Jacobus Forbes |publisher=Brill |year=1993 |isbn=978-9004006225 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/studiesinancient0000forb }}\n* {{Noble1984}}\n* {{Citation | last = Noble | first = David F. | author-link = David F.
