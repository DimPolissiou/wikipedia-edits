After serving for many years as the Irish Bankruptcy judge, he was transferred to the King's Bench\nDivision of the [[High Court of Justice in Ireland]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol. 2 p.380</ref> His much younger friend [[Maurice Healy (writer)|Maurice Healy]] described him with great respect and affection in his memoir ''The Old Munster Circuit''.\n\nBoyd's eldest son Sir Walter Herbert Boyd, 2nd Baronet, is still remembered in the sailing world as the designer of the [[Howth 17]] [[yacht]].  His second son Dr. Cecil Boyd was a noted [[rugby football|rugby]] player.\n\n==Background==\nHe was born on what is now Walworth Road in [[Portobello, Dublin]], the fourth son of Walter Boyd and his second wife Jane MacRory, daughter of Robert MacRory of [[Castledawson]], [[County Londonderry]].<ref>Ball p.380</ref> He was educated at the [[University of Dublin]] where he took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1855 and Doctor of Laws in 1864.<ref>Ball p.380</ref> He entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1854 and was called to the [[Irish Bar]] in 1856. He took silk in 1877 and became [[Queen's Advocate]] for Ireland the following year. In politics he was a staunch [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]]: his wife's family, the Andersons, played a crucial role in maintaining British rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century.\n\nHe did not enjoy much of a reputation as a lawyer, but following in the great tradition of [[John Philpot Curran]] and [[Daniel O'Connell]], he was noted for his absolute fearlessness in Court.  Maurice Healy recalls a well-known story that [[William O'Brien (judge)|Mr Justice O'Brien]] angrily asked him: ''where was Dr Boyd's<ref>A reference to his Doctorate in law, not a medical degree.</ref> respect for the Court?''    Boyd replied that the Court ''was receiving the exact degree of respect it deserved''.<ref>Healy, Maurice  ''The Old Munster Circuit''  1939 Mercier Press Reissue 1979 p.32</ref>\n\n==Judge==\nIn 1885 he was appointed the Irish Bankruptcy judge.<ref>Ball p.380</ref> Maurice Healy thought that the office  suited him well: while he was not  an especially good lawyer, he had  a great deal of  common sense, and a remarkable ability to detect  commercial dishonesty. He was also, according to Healy,  a man of great physical courage,  which was an important  consideration at a time when the level of  agrarian unrest in Ireland   meant that his life might be threatened (for several years  he had two policemen assigned to act  as his  [[bodyguards]]).<ref>Healy pp.30\u201331</ref> He had a gift for detecting [[fraud]]; unfortunately, in Healy's view,  his  experience  as a judge  led him to  assume that almost all human beings are dishonest by nature, and  although he did not  lose his essential  kindness or good humour, he became something of a [[cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]].<ref>Healy p.30</ref> He had little patience with legal technicalities: \"I don't want evidence, I want the truth!\" he once thundered at  a barrister  who had unwisely objected to  the judge admitting [[hearsay evidence]].<ref>Healy p.116</ref>\n\nIn 1897 the reorganisation of the High Court led to Boyd's transfer to the King's Bench Division.<ref>Ball p.380</ref> Maurice Healy states that the universal affection and respect in which the Bar held him meant that he could always rely on the support of counsel on both sides to overcome any deficiencies in his own knowledge of the law.<ref>Healy p.31</ref> He was also fortunate that the quality of his judicial colleagues was very high; when he was sitting with more learned judges like [[Christopher Palles]] he would  generally defer to their greater expertise.\n\nHe rarely dealt with criminal cases until his last few years on the Bench.  Towards the end of his career he acquired a reputation for imposing exceptionally severe sentences: some of the  sentences he handed down  while holding  the [[Munster]] [[assize]] in 1910 were so harsh that, according to Healy, the session  became popularly known as \"the Mad Assize\".<ref>Healy p.103</ref> On the other hand, his great kindness of heart meant that he was always willing to recommend a [[pardon|reprieve]] from the [[death penalty]], if he thought that there were any mitigating circumstances in the case.<ref>Healy pp.108\u20139</ref>\n\nHis short judgement in the [[probate]] case, ''Crofts v Beamish'',<ref>[1905] 2 I.R. 345</ref> where three High Court judges were unable to agree on the interpretation of a [[will (law)|will]], gives a flavour of his robust style and forceful personality. Boyd admitted frankly that he had no idea what the [[testator]] meant, and added : \"I do not think he himself knew what he meant. More extraordinary words I have never come across.\"\n\n==Last years==\nBoyd retired in 1916, and was created a [[Boyd Baronets|Baronet]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=29647 |date=30 June 1916 |page=6494}}</ref> and a member of the Irish Privy Council.<ref>Ball p.380</ref> He lived at Howth House, [[Howth]], which his father had purchased, and where he pursued his great love of sailing, even into extreme old age.  He was one of the stalwarts of the Howth Yacht Club.    In 1897 his son Walter Herbert Boyd designed the ''Howth 17th Footer'', now the oldest one-design [[keelboat]] racing class in the world.  The judge owned one of the first 17th footers, the ''Aura'', which was launched in 1899: he was still sailing her when he was over 80.\n\nHe died on 25 June 1918.\n\n==Family==\n[[Image:SirRobertAnderson.jpg|thumb|125px|Sir Robert Anderson of Scotland Yard, whose sister Anne married Boyd.]]\nIn 1862 he married Anne Catherine Anderson of Dublin, daughter of Matthew Anderson, Crown solicitor, by his wife Mary Lee.

The intervention lasted for around three months until President [[Camille Chamoun]], who had requested the assistance, completed his term as president of Lebanon. American and Lebanese government forces successfully occupied the [[Port of Beirut]] and [[Beirut International Airport]]. With the crisis over, the United States withdrew.\n\n==Background==\nIn July 1958, Lebanon was threatened by a civil war between [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite Christians]] and Muslims. Tensions with Egypt had escalated earlier in 1956 when pro-western Christian President [[Camille Chamoun]] did not break diplomatic relations with the Western powers that attacked Egypt during the [[Suez Crisis]], angering Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].\n\nThese tensions were further increased when Chamoun showed closeness to the [[Central Treaty Organization|Baghdad Pact]]. Nasser felt that the pro-western Baghdad Pact posed a threat to [[Arab nationalism]]. As a response, Egypt and Syria united into the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR). Lebanese Sunni Prime Minister [[Rashid Karami]] supported Nasser in 1956 and 1958.\n\nLebanese Muslims pushed the government to join the newly created United Arab Republic, while the Christians wanted to keep Lebanon aligned with Western powers. A Muslim rebellion that was allegedly supplied with arms by the UAR through Syria caused President Chamoun to complain to the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The [[United Nations]] sent a group of inspectors that reported that it didn't find any evidence of significant intervention from the UAR.\n\nThe toppling of a pro-Western government in Iraq's [[14 July Revolution]], along with the internal instability, caused President Chamoun to call for U.S. assistance.\n\n==Operation Blue Bat==\n[[Image:USMC-Lebanon82-4.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|U.S. Marines on patrol in Beirut]]\nUnited States President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] responded by authorizing Operation Blue Bat on July 15, 1958. This was the first application of the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], under which the U.S. announced that it would intervene to protect regimes it considered threatened by international [[communism]]. The goal of the operation was to bolster the pro-Western Lebanese government of President Camille Chamoun against internal opposition and threats from Syria and Egypt. The plan was to occupy and secure [[Beirut International Airport]], a few miles south of the city, then to secure the port of [[Beirut]] and approaches to the city.\n\nThe chain of command for Operation Blue Bat was as follows: the Eisenhower administration at the strategic level; Specified Command, Middle East (SPECCOMME, a 'double-hat' for Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean) at the operational level; the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]], with aircraft carriers {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}}, {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}, and {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|6}}, cruisers {{USS|Des Moines|CA-134|6}} and {{USS|Boston|CA-69|6}}, and two [[destroyer squadron]]s. At the end of June, ''Essex'' and ''Boston'' were anchored at [[Piraeus]], Greece, while ''Des Moines'', from which Vice Admiral [[Charles R. Brown]] was flying his flag, was at [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]].<ref>Thomas A.

Murphy]] to Lebanon as his personal representative. Murphy played a significant role in convincing both sides of the conflict to reach a compromise by electing moderate Christian general [[Fuad Chehab]] as incoming President, while allowing Chamoun to continue in power until the end of his term on September 22.\n\nPrime Minister [[Rashid Karami]] formed a national reconciliation government after the 1958 crisis ended.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]]\n* [[Lebanese Civil War]]\n* [[1982 Lebanon War]]\n* [[Foreign interventions by the United States]]\n* [[United States involvement in regime change]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Books and studies===\n* Alin, Erika G.

The series premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on October 21, 1997. Although 11 episodes (plus a [[Television pilot|pilot]]) were produced, the series was canceled after only three had aired.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter being fired from the [[soap opera]] ''Days to Remember'', down on his luck, eccentric, self-centered actor Simon Ferguson (Tim Curry) moves into [[Manhattan]]'s Metropolitan Hotel, which is run by ex-wife Hadley Martin (Annie Potts), whom he was married to 20 years prior... for twelve days.  Despite her initial exasperation with her ex, Hadley again succumbs to the \"Ferguson charm\", as do all of those around her.\n\nSimon reluctantly plays role model to Hadley's children from a different marriage: precocious {{frac|7|1|2}}-year-old Daniel ([[Luke Tarsitano]]) and angst-ridden teen Gwen ([[Marla Sokoloff]]).  The hotel's psychotic Greek chef, Yorgo Galfanikos ([[Steve Carell]]), also looks up to Simon, having been a fan of his soap opera and films.  Also seen are Rose ([[Liz Torres]]), the hotel's assistant manager, Robert McSwain ([[John O'Hurley]]), the hotel's main investor, Tommy Sutton (Devin Neil Oatway), a popular jock Gwen fawns over, and Jesse ([[Danny Strong]]), a geek who is smitten with Gwen.\n\nEpisodes mostly centered around Simon's outlandish shenanigans and attempts to break back into show business.\n\n==Cast & Characters==\n*[[Tim Curry]] as Simon Ferguson<br />The star of his acting class, Simon was a British actor with a promising career ahead of him, even garnering an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1977, but his ego got in the way. After gaining a reputation for being difficult to work with, he was forced to take roles in [[straight-to-video]] fare like \"''[[Hardbodies|Hardbodies 3]]'',\" and eventually the trashy TV [[soap opera]] \"''Days to Remember''.\"  Simon's only real friend is Hadley, whom he was briefly married to decades earlier.\n*[[Annie Potts]] as Hadley Martin<br />Hailing from [[Tennessee]], Hadley moved to [[New York]] to pursue an acting career, but following a string of rejection and failed marriages, she found herself playing a single-mom to a pair of kids while managing a hotel in [[Manhattan]].\n*[[Steve Carell]] as Yorgo Galfanikos<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Yorgo Calfanikos (character)\n|publisher=Internet Movie Database\n|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0168426/\n|accessdate=2009-12-31\n}}</ref><br />A [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrant who's obsessed with presenting the perfect meal, chef Yorgo exudes a manic temperament that comes across as hostile even when he's being sincere.\n*[[Luke Tarsitano]] as Daniel Martin<br />Hadley's 7-year-old son questions everything and is a constant source of aggravation for both his sister and Simon.\n*[[Marla Sokoloff]] as Gwen Martin<br />Hadley's defiant teenage daughter, who's smitten with boys and social status.\n*[[Liz Torres]] as Rose<br />The hefty Assistant Manager of The Metropolitan Hotel, the Hispanic Rose takes no guff from anyone and is quick to spout off her opinion on any subject.\n*[[John O'Hurley]] as Robert McSwain<br />The infrequently-seen hotel investor is conservative to the point of being repressed, and his crush on Hadley is transparent.\n\n==Production==\nThe show was pitched in early 1996 to ABC president [[Ted Harbert]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Paeth|first=Greg |title=You'll Be Underwhelmed By ABC's 'Over the Top'|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|date=October 21, 1997}}</ref> and although it would not be ready to hit the air for the 1996-1997 season, it remained in development.

Although flabbergasted with Simon, Kate ultimately decided to let her ex stay on as a new addition to the staff.  The cast was rounded out by [[Luke Tarsitano]] and [[Natanya Ross]] as Kate's children from a subsequent marriage, [[Debra Jo Rupp]] as the maid, and a then-unknown actor named [[Steve Carell]] as manic chef Yorgo.\n\nBy the time the pilot was filmed, ABC Entertainment president [[Ted Harbert]] had been replaced by [[Jamie Tarses]], whom executive producer [[Robert Morton (producer)|Robert Morton]] was dating.<ref name=sun>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-10-21/lifestyle/9710200200_1_fawlty-towers-premiere-week-simon-ferguson|title='Top' a Flop|last=Jicha |first=Tom|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  Rumors began to swirl that the series was only picked up as a result of their romance, and it did not help matters that the press was only shown snippets of the pilot episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/glow/1997/10/21glow.html|title=Blue Glow|last=Millman|first=Joyce|publisher=[[salon.com]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  In the months between the time the series was picked up and its scheduled premiere, Morton and Tarses' relationship ended.\n\nOriginally slated to debut on September 23, 1997<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289604,00.html|title=On the Air: September 26, 1997|last=Flint |first=Joe |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 26, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> the show's premiere was delayed until October 21, opposite the [[World Series]],<ref name=sun /> so it could be retooled.  [[Natanya Ross]] and [[Debra Jo Rupp]] were replaced by [[Marla Sokoloff]] and [[Liz Torres]], and [[John O'Hurley]]'s character was written into the show. Kate was renamed Hadley and her character became more sympathetic toward Simon. The setting was changed to New York City and the pilot was reshot (as the episode \"I'm Bonnie, I'm Clyde\").  The reason given for the retooling was because in NYC there would be more opportunities \"for comedic interaction with city characters\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/09/arts/if-they-can-make-it-there.html|title=If They Can Make It There|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 9, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> but the press began to speculate that the changes were again a result of the failed Tarses/Morton romance.  Morton sidestepped this question by claiming, \"We needed to give Tim a bigger playing field,\"<ref name=EW /> and that the cast \"was not as comfortable with each other as we wanted\".<ref name=EW />  ABC, meanwhile, claimed that they did not want their 8:00&nbsp;p.m. lead-in show, ''[[Soul Man (TV series)|Soul Man]]'', to face off against what was expected to be a high-rated season premiere of ''[[Mad About You]]'',<ref name=EW /> so they rearranged the schedule.  \"By shifting ''Soul Man'''s time slot for the first few weeks of the season,\" Tarses released in a public statement, \"we're giving this pivotal series the luxury to recapture its audience without intense premiere competition.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|last=Carmody|first=John|title=The TV Column|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 11, 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe show's stars, however, remained optimistic.

The series premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on October 21, 1997. Although 11 episodes (plus a [[Television pilot|pilot]]) were produced, the series was canceled after only three had aired.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter being fired from the [[soap opera]] ''Days to Remember'', down on his luck, eccentric, self-centered actor Simon Ferguson (Tim Curry) moves into [[Manhattan]]'s Metropolitan Hotel, which is run by ex-wife Hadley Martin (Annie Potts), whom he was married to 20 years prior... for twelve days.  Despite her initial exasperation with her ex, Hadley again succumbs to the \"Ferguson charm\", as do all of those around her.\n\nSimon reluctantly plays role model to Hadley's children from a different marriage: precocious {{frac|7|1|2}}-year-old Daniel ([[Luke Tarsitano]]) and angst-ridden teen Gwen ([[Marla Sokoloff]]).  The hotel's psychotic Greek chef, Yorgo Galfanikos ([[Steve Carell]]), also looks up to Simon, having been a fan of his soap opera and films.  Also seen are Rose ([[Liz Torres]]), the hotel's assistant manager, Robert McSwain ([[John O'Hurley]]), the hotel's main investor, Tommy Sutton (Devin Neil Oatway), a popular jock Gwen fawns over, and Jesse ([[Danny Strong]]), a geek who is smitten with Gwen.\n\nEpisodes mostly centered around Simon's outlandish shenanigans and attempts to break back into show business.\n\n==Cast & Characters==\n*[[Tim Curry]] as Simon Ferguson<br />The star of his acting class, Simon was a British actor with a promising career ahead of him, even garnering an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1977, but his ego got in the way. After gaining a reputation for being difficult to work with, he was forced to take roles in [[straight-to-video]] fare like \"''[[Hardbodies|Hardbodies 3]]'',\" and eventually the trashy TV [[soap opera]] \"''Days to Remember''.\"  Simon's only real friend is Hadley, whom he was briefly married to decades earlier.\n*[[Annie Potts]] as Hadley Martin<br />Hailing from [[Tennessee]], Hadley moved to [[New York]] to pursue an acting career, but following a string of rejection and failed marriages, she found herself playing a single-mom to a pair of kids while managing a hotel in [[Manhattan]].\n*[[Steve Carell]] as Yorgo Galfanikos<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Yorgo Calfanikos (character)\n|publisher=Internet Movie Database\n|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0168426/\n|accessdate=2009-12-31\n}}</ref><br />A [[Greek]] immigrant who's obsessed with presenting the perfect meal, chef Yorgo exudes a manic temperament that comes across as hostile even when he's being sincere.\n*[[Luke Tarsitano]] as Daniel Martin<br />Hadley's 7-year-old son questions everything and is a constant source of aggravation for both his sister and Simon.\n*[[Marla Sokoloff]] as Gwen Martin<br />Hadley's defiant teenage daughter, who's smitten with boys and social status.\n*[[Liz Torres]] as Rose<br />The hefty Assistant Manager of The Metropolitan Hotel, the Hispanic Rose takes no guff from anyone and is quick to spout off her opinion on any subject.\n*[[John O'Hurley]] as Robert McSwain<br />The infrequently-seen hotel investor is conservative to the point of being repressed, and his crush on Hadley is transparent.\n\n==Production==\nThe show was pitched in early 1996 to ABC president [[Ted Harbert]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Paeth|first=Greg |title=You'll Be Underwhelmed By ABC's 'Over the Top'|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|date=October 21, 1997}}</ref> and although it would not be ready to hit the air for the 1996-1997 season, it remained in development.

Although flabbergasted with Simon, Kate ultimately decided to let her ex stay on as a new addition to the staff.  The cast was rounded out by [[Luke Tarsitano]] and [[Natanya Ross]] as Kate's children from a subsequent marriage, [[Debra Jo Rupp]] as the maid, and a then-unknown actor named [[Steve Carell]] as manic chef Yorgo.\n\nBy the time the pilot was filmed, ABC Entertainment president [[Ted Harbert]] had been replaced by [[Jamie Tarses]], whom executive producer [[Robert Morton (producer)|Robert Morton]] was dating.<ref name=sun>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-10-21/lifestyle/9710200200_1_fawlty-towers-premiere-week-simon-ferguson|title='Top' a Flop|last=Jicha |first=Tom|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  Rumors began to swirl that the series was only picked up as a result of their romance, and it did not help matters that the press was only shown snippets of the pilot episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/glow/1997/10/21glow.html|title=Blue Glow|last=Millman|first=Joyce|publisher=[[salon.com]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  In the months between the time the series was picked up and its scheduled premiere, Morton and Tarses' relationship ended.\n\nOriginally slated to debut on September 23, 1997<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289604,00.html|title=On the Air: September 26, 1997|last=Flint |first=Joe |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 26, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> the show's premiere was delayed until October 21, opposite the [[World Series]],<ref name=sun /> so it could be retooled.  [[Natanya Ross]] and [[Debra Jo Rupp]] were replaced by [[Marla Sokoloff]] and [[Liz Torres]], and [[John O'Hurley]]'s character was written into the show. Kate was renamed Hadley and her character became more sympathetic toward Simon. The setting was changed to New York City and the pilot was reshot (as the episode \"I'm Bonnie, I'm Clyde\").  The reason given for the retooling was because in NYC there would be more opportunities \"for comedic interaction with city characters\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/09/arts/if-they-can-make-it-there.html|title=If They Can Make It There|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 9, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> but the press began to speculate that the changes were again a result of the failed Tarses/Morton romance.  Morton sidestepped this question by claiming, \"We needed to give Tim a bigger playing field,\"<ref name=EW /> and that the cast \"was not as comfortable with each other as we wanted\".<ref name=EW />  ABC, meanwhile, claimed that they did not want their 8:00&nbsp;p.m. lead-in show, ''[[Soul Man (TV series)|Soul Man]]'', to face off against what was expected to be a high-rated season premiere of ''[[Mad About You]]'',<ref name=EW /> so they rearranged the schedule.  \"By shifting ''Soul Man'''s time slot for the first few weeks of the season,\" Tarses released in a public statement, \"we're giving this pivotal series the luxury to recapture its audience without intense premiere competition.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|last=Carmody|first=John|title=The TV Column|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 11, 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe show's stars, however, remained optimistic.
