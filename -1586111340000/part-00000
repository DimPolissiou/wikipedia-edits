From August to October 1819, [[pogrom]]s that came to be known as the [[Hep-Hep riots]] took place throughout Germany. During this time, many [[German states]] stripped Jews of their civil rights.

About 60% (numbering around 304,000) emigrated during the first six years of the Nazi dictatorship. In 1933, persecution of the Jews became an official [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] policy. In 1935 and 1936, the pace of antisemitic persecution increased. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from participating in education, politics, higher education and industry. The [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) ordered the Night of Broken Glass (''[[Kristallnacht]]'') the night of November 9\u201310, 1938. The storefronts of Jewish shops and offices were smashed and vandalized, and many synagogues were destroyed by fire. Only roughly 214,000 Jews were left in Germany proper (1937 borders) on the eve of [[World War II]].\n\nBeginning in late 1941, the remaining community was subjected to systematic [[Holocaust trains|deportations]] to ghettos and ultimately, to death camps in Eastern Europe.<ref name=DeJewsUSHMM>{{cite web |title=German Jews During The Holocaust, 1939\u20131945 |website=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|USHMM]] |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005469 |accessdate= October 1, 2012 }}</ref> In May 1943, Germany was declared ''[[judenrein]]'' (clean of Jews; also ''judenfrei'': free of Jews).{{r|DeJewsUSHMM}} By the end of the war, an estimated 160,000 to 180,000 German Jews had been killed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] and their collaborators.{{r|DeJewsUSHMM}} A total of about six million European Jews were murdered under the direction of the Nazis, in the genocide that later came to be known as [[the Holocaust]].\n\nAfter the war, the Jewish community in Germany started to slowly grow again.

It indicates that the legal status of the Jews there was the same as elsewhere in the [[Roman Empire]]. They enjoyed some civil liberties, but were restricted regarding the dissemination of their culture, the keeping of non-Jewish slaves, and the holding of office under the government.\n\nJews were otherwise free to follow any occupation open to indigenous Germans and were engaged in agriculture, trade, industry, and gradually money-lending. These conditions at first continued in the subsequently established [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] kingdoms under the [[Burgundians]] and [[Franks]], for [[Christian church|ecclesiasticism]] took root slowly. The [[Merovingian]] rulers who succeeded to the Burgundian empire were devoid of fanaticism and gave scant support to the efforts of the Church to restrict the civic and social status of the Jews.\n\n[[Charlemagne]] (800\u2013814) readily made use of the Church for the purpose of infusing coherence into the loosely joined parts of his extensive empire, by any means a blind tool of the [[canon law|canonical law]]. He employed Jews for diplomatic purposes, sending, for instance, a Jew as interpreter and guide with his embassy to [[Harun al-Rashid]]. Yet, even then, a gradual change occurred in the lives of the Jews. The Church forbade Christians to be [[usury|usurers]], so the Jews secured the [[remunerative]] monopoly of money-lending. This decree caused a mixed reaction of people in general in the Frankish empire (including Germany) to the Jews: Jewish people were sought everywhere, as well as avoided. This ambivalence about Jews occurred because their capital was indispensable, while their business was viewed as disreputable. This curious combination of circumstances increased Jewish influence and Jews went about the country freely, settling also in the eastern portions ([[Old Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia]]). Aside from Cologne, the earliest communities were established in Mainz, [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Speyer, and [[Regensburg]].{{sfn|Ben-Sasson|2007|pp=518-9}}\n\nThe status of the German Jews remained unchanged under Charlemagne's successor, [[Louis the Pious]]. Jews were unrestricted in their commerce; however, they paid somewhat higher taxes into the state treasury than did the non-Jews. A special officer, the ''Judenmeister'', was appointed by the government to protect Jewish privileges. The later Carolingians, however, followed the demands of the Church more and more. The bishops continually argued at the [[synods]] for including and enforcing decrees of the canonical law, with the consequence that the majority Christian populace mistrusted the Jewish unbelievers. This feeling, among both princes and people, was further stimulated by the attacks on the civic equality of the Jews. Beginning with the 10th century, [[Holy Week]] became more and more a period of antisemitic activities, yet the [[Saxons|Saxon]] emperors did not treat the Jews badly, exacting from them merely the taxes levied upon all other merchants. Although the Jews in Germany were as ignorant as their contemporaries in secular studies, they could read and understand the Hebrew prayers and the Bible in the original text. [[Halakah|Halakhic]] studies began to flourish about 1000.\n\nAt that time, [[Rav]] [[Gershom ben Judah]] was teaching at [[Metz]] and Mainz, gathering about him pupils from far and near. He is described in Jewish [[historiography]] as a model of wisdom, humility, and piety, and became known to succeeding generations as the \"Light of the [[Jewish Diaspora|Exile]]\".<ref>Ben-Sasson, Haim Hillel (1976). \"The Middle Ages,\" in: Ben-Sasson (Ed.), ''A History of the Jewish People'' (pp. 385-723).

This continuous study of the [[Torah]] and the [[Talmud]] produced such a devotion to Judaism that the Jews considered life without their religion not worth living; but they did not realize this clearly until the time of the Crusades, when they were often compelled to choose between life and faith.<ref>{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Germany / Up to the Crusades |p=631 |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6603-germany#anchor2 |short=x |noicon=1 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Cultural and religious centre of European Jewry ===\nThe Jewish communities of the cities of [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Mainz]] formed the league of cities which became the center of Jewish life during Medieval times. These are referred to as the ShUM cities, after the first letters of the Hebrew names: [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] for Speyer (''Shpira''), [[Waw (letter)|Waw]] for Worms (''Varmaisa'') and [[Mem]] for Mainz (''Magentza''). The ''[[Takkanot Shum]]'' ({{lang-he|\u05ea\u05e7\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05d5\"\u05dd}} \"Enactments of ShUM\") were a set of decrees formulated and agreed upon over a period of decades by their Jewish community leaders. The official website for the city of Mainz states:\n\n{{quote|One of the most glorious epochs in Mainz's long history was the period from the beginning of the 900s and evidently much earlier. Following the barbaric [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], a relatively safe and enlightened [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] period brought peace and prosperity to Mainz and much of central\u2013western Europe.\n\nFor the next 400 years, Mainz attracted many Jews as trade flourished. The greatest Jewish teachers and rabbis flocked to the Rhine. Their teachings, dialogues, decisions, and influence propelled Mainz and neighboring towns along the Rhine into world-wide prominence. Their fame spread, rivaling that of other post-[[Diaspora]] cities such as [[Baghdad]].

The [[History of the Jews in Speyer|Jewish community of Speyer]] was saved by the bishop, but [[Worms massacre (1096)|800 were slain in Worms]]. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the Rhenish cities alone between May and July 1096. Alleged crimes, like desecration of the host, ritual murder, poisoning of wells, and treason, brought hundreds to the stake and drove thousands into exile. Jews were alleged{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} to have caused [[Mongol invasion of Europe|the inroads of the Mongols]], though they suffered equally with the Christians. Jews suffered intense persecution during the [[Rintfleisch massacres]] of 1298. In 1336 [[History of the Jews in Alsace|Jews from Alsace]] were subjected to massacres by the outlaws of [[Arnold von Uissigheim]]. When the [[Black Death]] swept over Europe in 1348\u201349, some Christian communities accused Jews of poisoning wells. In the [[Erfurt massacre (1349)|Erfurt Massacre]] of 1349, the members of the entire Jewish community were murdered or expelled from the city, due to superstitions about the Black Death. Royal policy and public ambivalence towards Jews helped the persecuted Jews fleeing the German-speaking lands to form the foundations of what would become the largest Jewish community in Europe in what is now Poland/Ukraine/Romania/Belarus/Lithuania.\n\n== In the Holy Roman Empire ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}} \n[[File:1614jews.jpg|thumb|Etching of the expulsion of the Jews from [[Frankfurt]] on August 23, 1614: The text says, \"1,380 persons old and young were counted at the exit of the gate.\"]]\n\nThe legal and civic status of the Jews underwent a transformation under the Holy Roman Empire. Jewish people found a certain degree of protection with the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], who claimed the right of possession and protection of all the Jews of the empire. A justification for this claim was that the Holy Roman Emperor was the successor of the emperor Titus, who was said to have acquired the Jews as his private property. The German emperors apparently claimed this right of possession more for the sake of taxing the Jews than of protecting them.\n\nA variety of such taxes existed. [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], was a prolific creator of new taxes. In 1342, he instituted the \"golden sacrificial penny\" and decreed that every year all the Jews should pay the emperor one kreutzer out of every gulden of their property in addition to the taxes they were already paying to both the state and municipal authorities. The emperors of the house of Luxembourg devised other means of taxation. They turned their prerogatives in regard to the Jews to further account by selling at a high price to the princes and free towns of the empire the valuable privilege of taxing and [[fine (penalty)|fining]] the Jews. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], via the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], granted this privilege to the seven electors of the empire when the empire was reorganized in 1356.\n\nFrom this time onward, for reasons that also apparently concerned taxes, the Jews of Germany gradually passed in increasing numbers from the authority of the emperor to that of both the lesser sovereigns and the cities. For the sake of sorely needed revenue, the Jews were now invited, with the promise of full protection, to return to those districts and cities from which they had shortly before been expelled. However, as soon as Jewish people acquired some property, they were again plundered and driven away. These episodes thenceforth constituted a large portion of the medieval history of the German Jews. Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] was most expert in transferring to his own coffers gold from the pockets of rich Jews. He made compacts with many cities, estates, and princes whereby he annulled all outstanding debts to the Jews in return for a certain sum paid to him. Emperor Wenceslaus declared that anyone helping Jews with the collection of their debts, in spite of this annulment, would be dealt with as a robber and peacebreaker, and be forced to make restitution. This decree, which for years allegedly injured the public credit, is said to have impoverished thousands of Jewish families during the close of the [[14th century]].\n[[File:Burning Jews.jpg|thumb|left|Jews burned alive for the alleged [[host desecration]] in [[Deggendorf]], [[Bavaria]], in 1338, and in [[Sternberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Sternberg]], [[Mecklenburg]], in 1492; a woodcut from the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493)]]\nThe 15th century did not bring any amelioration. What happened in the time of the Crusades happened again. The war upon the [[Hussites]] became the signal for renewed persecution of Jews. The Jews of Austria, [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]] passed through all the terrors of death, forced baptism, or voluntary [[self-immolation]] for the sake of their faith. When the Hussites made peace with the Church, the Pope sent the Franciscan friar [[John of Capistrano]] to win the renegades back into the fold and inspire them with loathing for heresy and unbelief; 41 martyrs were burned in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] alone, and all Jews were forever banished from Silesia. The [[Franciscan]] friar [[Bernardine of Feltre]] brought a similar fate upon the communities in southern and western Germany. As a consequence of the fictitious confessions extracted under torture from the Jews of [[Trento|Trent]], the populace of many cities, especially of Regensburg, fell upon the Jews and massacred them.\n\nThe end of the [[15th century]], which brought a new epoch for the Christian world, brought no relief to the Jews. Jews in Germany remained the victims of a religious hatred that ascribed to them all possible evils. When the established Church, threatened in its spiritual power in Germany and elsewhere, prepared for its conflict with the culture of the Renaissance, one of its most convenient points of attack was rabbinic literature. At this time, as once before in France, Jewish converts spread false reports in regard to the Talmud, but an advocate of the book arose in the person of [[Johann Reuchlin]], the German humanist, who was the first one in Germany to include the Hebrew language among the humanities. His opinion, though strongly opposed by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and their followers, finally prevailed when the humanistic [[Pope Leo X]] permitted the Talmud to be printed in Italy.\n\n=== Moses Mendelssohn ===\n{{main|Moses Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:Moses Mendelson P7160073.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Moses Mendelssohn]]]]\nThough reading German books was forbidden in the 1700s by Jewish inspectors who had a measure of police power in Germany, Moses Mendelson found his first German book, an edition of Protestant theology, at a well-organized system of Jewish charity for needy Talmud students. Mendelssohn read this book and found proof of the existence of God \u2013 his first meeting with a sample of European letters. This was only the beginning to Mendelssohn's inquiries about the knowledge of life. Mendelssohn learned many new languages, and with his whole education consisting of Talmud lessons, he thought in Hebrew and translated for himself every new piece of work he met into this language. The divide between the Jews and the rest of society was caused by a lack of translation between these two languages, and [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] translated the Torah into German, bridging the gap between the two; this book allowed Jews to speak and write in German, preparing them for participation in German culture and secular science. In 1750, Mendelssohn began to serve as a teacher in the house of Isaac Bernhard, the owner of a silk factory, after beginning his publications of philosophical essays in German. Mendelssohn conceived of God as a perfect Being and had faith in \"God's wisdom, righteousness, mercy, and goodness.\"  He argued, \"the world results from a creative act through which the divine will seeks to realize the highest good,\" and accepted the existence of miracles and revelation as long as belief in God did not depend on them. He also believed that revelation could not contradict reason. Like the deists, Mendelssohn claimed that reason could discover the reality of God, divine providence, and immortality of the soul. He was the first to speak out against the use of excommunication as a religious threat. At the height of his career, in 1769, Mendelssohn was publicly challenged by a Christian apologist, a [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] pastor named [[Johann Kaspar Lavater|John Lavater]], to defend the superiority of Judaism over Christianity. From then on, he was involved in defending Judaism in print.  In 1783, he published ''Jerusalem, or On Religious Power and Judaism''. Speculating that no religious institution should use coercion and emphasized that Judaism does not coerce the mind through dogma, he argued that through reason, all people could discover religious philosophical truths, but what made Judaism unique was its revealed code of legal, ritual, and moral law. He said that Jews must live in civil society, but only in a way that their right to observe religious laws is granted, while also recognizing the needs for respect, and multiplicity of religions. He campaigned for emancipation and instructed Jews to form bonds with the gentile governments, attempting to improve the relationship between Jews and Christians while arguing for tolerance and humanity. He became the symbol of the Jewish Enlightenment, the Haskalah.<ref name=\"Moses Mendelssohn\">{{cite book|last1=Bach|first1=Hans|title=Moses Mendelssohn|date=Summer 1976|page=24|edition=2|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1312125181/}}</ref>\n\n'''Early 18th Century'''\n[[File:David Friedlander.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[David Friedl\u00e4nder]] was a German-Jewish communal leader who promoted [[Jewish emancipation]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n\nIn the late [[18th century]], a youthful enthusiasm for new ideals of religious equality began to take hold in the western world. Austrian Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] was foremost in espousing these new ideals. As early as 1782, he issued the ''Patent of Toleration for the Jews of Lower Austria'', thereby establishing civic equality for his Jewish subjects.\n\nBefore 1806, when general citizenship was largely nonexistent in the Holy Roman Empire, its inhabitants were subject to varying [[Estates of the realm|estate]] regulations. In different ways from one territory of the empire to another, these regulations classified inhabitants into different groups, such as dynasts, members of the court entourage, other aristocrats, city dwellers ([[bourgeoisie|burghers]]), Jews, [[Huguenot]]s (in Prussia a special estate until 1810), free [[peasant]]s, [[serf]]s, peddlers and [[Romani people|Gypsies]], with different privileges and burdens attached to each classification. Legal inequality was the principle.\n\nThe concept of citizenship was mostly restricted to cities, especially [[Free Imperial Cities|free imperial cities]]. No general franchise existed, which remained a privilege for the few, who had inherited the status or acquired it when they reached a certain level of taxed income or could afford the expense of the citizen's fee (''B\u00fcrgergeld''). Citizenship was often further restricted to city dwellers affiliated to the locally dominant Christian denomination (Calvinism, Roman Catholicism, or Lutheranism). City dwellers of other denominations or religions and those who lacked the necessary wealth to qualify as citizens were considered to be mere inhabitants who lacked political rights, and were sometimes subject to revocable residence permits.\n\nMost Jews then living in those parts of Germany that allowed them to settle were automatically defined as mere indigenous inhabitants, depending on permits that were typically less generous than those granted to gentile indigenous inhabitants (''Einwohner'', as opposed to ''B\u00fcrger'', or citizen). In the 18th century, some Jews and their families (such as [[Daniel Itzig]] in Berlin) gained equal status with their Christian fellow city dwellers, but had a different status from noblemen, Huguenots, or serfs. They often did not enjoy the right to freedom of movement across territorial or even municipal boundaries, let alone the same status in any new place as in their previous location.\n\nWith the abolition of differences in legal status during the Napoleonic era and its aftermath, citizenship was established as a new franchise generally applying to all former subjects of the monarchs. Prussia conferred citizenship on the Prussian Jews in 1812, though this by no means resulted in full equality with other citizens. [[Jewish emancipation#Dates of emancipation|Jewish emancipation]] did not eliminate all forms of discrimination against Jews, who often remained barred from holding official state positions. The German federal edicts of 1815 merely held out the prospect of full equality, but it was not genuinely implemented at that time, and even the promises which had been made were modified. However, such forms of discrimination were no longer the guiding principle for ordering society, but a violation of it. In Austria, many laws restricting the trade and traffic of Jewish subjects remained in force until the middle of the 19th century in spite of the patent of toleration. Some of the crown lands, such as [[Styria]] and Upper Austria, forbade any Jews to settle within their territory; in Bohemia, Moravia, and [[Austrian Silesia]] many cities were closed to them. The Jews were also burdened with heavy taxes and imposts.\n\nIn the German kingdom of Prussia, the government materially modified the promises made in the disastrous year of 1813. The promised uniform regulation of Jewish affairs was time and again postponed. In the period between 1815 and 1847, no less than 21 territorial laws affecting Jews in the [[Provinces of Prussia|older eight provinces]] of the Prussian state  were in effect, each having to be observed by part of the Jewish community. At that time, no official was authorized to speak in the name of all Prussian Jews, or Jewry in most of the [[States of the German Confederation|other 41 German states]], let alone for all German Jews.\n\nNevertheless, a few men came forward to promote their cause, foremost among them being [[Gabriel Riesser]] (d. 1863), a Jewish lawyer from [[Hamburg]], who demanded full civic equality for his people. He won over public opinion to such an extent that this equality was granted in Prussia on April 6, 1848, in [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] on September 5 and on December 12, respectively, and also in his home [[Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg|state of Hamburg]], then home to the second-largest Jewish community in Germany.<ref>By the introduction of the basic freedoms decided on by the [[Frankfurt National Assembly|National Assembly]], adopted into Hamburg's statutory law on February 21, 1849.</ref> In [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], equality was conceded on December 3, 1861; in [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] on October 4, 1862; in [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]] on July 14, 1863; and in [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] on December 3, 1868. After the establishment of the [[North German Confederation]] by the law of July 3, 1869, all remaining statutory restrictions imposed on the followers of different religions were abolished; this decree was extended to all the states of the German empire after the events of 1870.\n\n=== The Jewish Enlightenment ===\n{{main| Haskalah}}\nDuring the General Enlightenment (the 1600s to late 1700s), many Jewish women began to frequently visit non-Jewish salons and to campaign for emancipation. In Western Europe and the German states, observance of Jewish law, ''Halacha'', started to be neglected. In the 18th century, some traditional German scholars and leaders, such as the doctor and author of ''Ma'aseh Tuviyyah'', [[Tobias Cohn|Tobias b. Moses Cohn]], appreciated the secular culture. The most important feature during this time was the German ''Aufkl\u00e4rung'', which was able to boast of native figures who competed with the finest Western European writers, scholars, and intellectuals. Aside from the externalities of language and dress, the Jews internalized the cultural and intellectual norms of German society. The movement, becoming known as the German or Berlin ''Haskalah'' offered many effects to the challenges of German society. As early as the 1740s, many German Jews and some individual Polish and Lithuanian Jews had a desire for secular education. The German-Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century, the ''[[Haskalah]]'', marks the political, social, and intellectual transition of European Jewry to modernity. Some of the elite members of Jewish society knew European languages. Absolutist governments in Germany, Austria, and Russia deprived the Jewish community's leadership of its authority and many Jews became [[Court Jew|'Court Jews']].  Using their connections with Jewish businessmen to serve as military contractors, managers of mints, founders of new industries and providers to the court of precious stones and clothing, they gave economic assistance to the local rulers. Court Jews were protected by the rulers and acted as did everyone else in society in their speech, manners, and awareness of European literature and ideas. Isaac Euchel, for example, represented a new generation of Jews. He maintained a leading role in the German ''Haskalah'', is one of the founding editors of ''Ha-Me/assef''. Euchel was exposed to European languages and culture while living in Prussian centers: Berlin and Koenigsberg. His interests turned towards promoting the educational interests of the Enlightenment with other Jews. Moses Mendelssohn as another enlightenment thinker was the first Jew to bring secular culture to those living an Orthodox Jewish life. He valued reason and felt that anyone could arrive logically at religious truths while arguing that what makes Judaism unique is its divine revelation of a code of law. Mendelssohn's commitment to Judaism leads to tensions even with some of those who subscribed to Enlightenment philosophy. Faithful Christians who were less opposed to his rationalistic ideas than to his adherence to Judaism found it difficult to accept this ''Juif de Berlin.'' In most of Western Europe, the ''Haskalah'' ended with large numbers of Jews assimilating. Many Jews stopped adhering to Jewish law, and the struggle for emancipation in Germany awakened some doubts about the future of Jews in Europe and eventually led to both immigrations to America and Zionism. In Russia, antisemitism ended the'' Haskalah''. Some Jews responded to this antisemitism by campaigning for emancipation, while others joined revolutionary movements and assimilated, and some turned to Jewish nationalism in the form of the [[Hovevei Zion|Zionist Hibbat Zion movement.]]\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barnouw|first1=Dagmar|author-link=Dagmar Barnouw|title=Origin and Transformation: Salomon Maimon and German-Jewish Enlightenment Culture|date=Summer 2002|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume= 20|issue=4|pages=64\u201380|doi=10.1353/sho.2002.0051}}</ref>\n\n=== Reorganization of the German Jewish Community ===\n\nThe empowerment of the Jews and the rebirth of Jewish science led to a transfer of ancient traditions to the newer generations. [[Abraham Geiger|Geiger]] and [[Samuel Holdheim|Holdeim]] were two founders of the conservative movement in modern Judaism accepted the modern spirit of liberalism. Samson Raphael Hirsch defended traditional customs: denying the modern \"spirit\". Neither of these beliefs was followed by the faithful Jews; [[Zecharias Frankel|Zachary Frankel]] created a moderate reform movement in assurance with German communities, public worships were reorganized, reduction of medieval additions to the prayer, congregational singing was introduced, and regular sermons required scientifically trained rabbis. Religious schools were enforced by the state due to a want for the addition of religious structure to secular education of Jewish children. <!-- run-on sentence hard to understand Talmudic school had rabbinical seminaries with Talmudic instruction, which followed the methods introduced by Zacharias Frankel in the Jewish Theological Seminary it opened at Breslau in 1854, and started an attention to religious literature including textbooks on religion: biblical and Jewish history, translations and explanations of the bible and prayer books which met the demand of modern educational systems. --> Pulpit oratory started to thrive mainly due to German preachers, such as M. Sachs and M. Joel. Synagogal music was accepted with the help of Louis Lewandowski.  Part of the evolution of the Jewish community was the cultivation of Jewish literature and associations created with teachers, rabbis, and leaders of congregations.\n\nAnother vital part of the reorganization of the Jewish-German community was the heavy involvement of Jewish women in the community and their new tendencies to assimilate their families into a different lifestyle. Jewish women were contradicting their view points in the sense that they were modernizing, but they also tried to keep some traditions alive. German Jewish mothers were shifting the way they raised their children in ways such as moving their families out of Jewish neighborhoods, thus changing who Jewish children grew up around and conversed with, all in all shifting the dynamic of the then close-knit Jewish community. Additionally, Jewish mothers wished to integrate themselves and their families into German society in other ways.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Marion|title=Gender and Jewish History in Imperial Germany|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}</ref> Because of their mothers, Jewish children participated in walks around the neighborhood, sporting events, and other activities that would mold them into becoming more like their other German peers. In order for mothers to assimilate into German culture, they took pleasure in reading newspapers and magazines that focused on the fashion styles, as well as other trends that were up and coming for the time and that the Protestant, bourgeois Germans were exhibiting. Similar to this, German-Jewish mothers also urged their children to partake in music lessons, mainly because it was a popular activity among other Germans. Another effort German-Jewish mothers put into assimilating their families was enforcing the importance of manners on their children. It was noted that non-Jewish Germans saw Jews as disrespectful and unable to grasp the concept of time and place.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/> Because of this, Jewish mothers tried to raise their kids having even better manners than the Protestant children in an effort to combat the pre-existing stereotype put on their children. In addition, Jewish mothers put a large emphasis on proper education for their children in hopes that this would help them grow up to be more respected by their communities and eventually lead to prosperous careers. While Jewish mothers worked tirelessly on ensuring the assimilation of their families, they also attempted to keep the familial aspect of Jewish traditions. They began to look at Shabbat and holidays as less of culturally Jewish days, but more as family reunions of sorts. What was once viewed as a more religious event became more of a social gathering of relatives.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/>\n\n=== Birth of the Reform Movement ===\n\nThe beginning of the Reform Movement in Judaism was emphasized by [[David Philipson]], who was the rabbi at the largest Reform congregation. The increasing political centralization of the late 18th and early 19th centuries undermined the societal structure that perpetuated traditional Jewish life. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas began to influence many intellectuals, and the resulting political, economic, and social changes were overpowering. Many Jews felt a tension between Jewish tradition and the way they were now leading their lives-religiously- resulting in less tradition. As the insular religious society that reinforced such observance disintegrated, falling away from vigilant observance without deliberately breaking with Judaism  was easy. Some tried to reconcile their religious heritage with their new social surroundings; they reformed traditional Judaism to meet their new needs and to express their spiritual desires. A movement was formed with a set of religious beliefs, and practices that were considered expected and tradition. [[Reform Judaism]] was the first modern response to the Jew's emancipation, though reform Judaism differing in all countries caused stresses of autonomy on both the congregation and individual. Some of the reforms were in the practices: circumcisions were abandoned, rabbis wore vests after Protestant ministers, and instrumental accompaniment was used: pipe organs. In addition, the traditional Hebrew prayer book was replaced by German text, and reform synagogues began being called temples which were previously considered the Temple of Jerusalem. Reform communities composed of similar beliefs and Judaism changed at the same pace as the rest of society had. The Jewish people have adapted to religious beliefs and practices to the meet the needs of the Jewish people throughout the generation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Philipson|first1=David|title=The Beginnings of the Reform Movement in Judaism|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=15|issue=3|date=April 1903|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=475\u2013521|edition=Vol. 15, No. 3|jstor=1450629|doi=10.2307/1450629}}</ref>\n\n== 1815\u20131918 ==\n[[File:1890 gustav ermann kaiser soldier saarbrucken Germany.jpg|thumb|1890: Gustav Ermann, a Jewish soldier in the German [[Wilhelm the second|Kaiser]]'s army, born in [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]]]\n[[File:Azannes WWI German Cemetery 2.jpg|thumb|The headstones of the fallen Jewish soldiers who fought for Germany in World War I were removed during World War II, and were later replaced.

From August to October 1819, pogroms that came to be known as the [[Hep-Hep riots]] took place throughout Germany. Jewish property was destroyed, and many Jews were killed.\n\nDuring this time, many German states stripped Jews of their civil rights. In the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], only 12 Jewish couples were allowed to marry each year, and the 400,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]] the city's Jewish community had paid in 1811 for its emancipation was forfeited. After the [[Rhineland]] reverted to Prussian control, Jews lost the rights Napoleon had granted them, were banned from certain professions, and the few who had been appointed to public office before the [[Napoleonic Wars]] were dismissed.<ref>Elon, Amos: ''The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany, 1743\u20131933''</ref> Throughout numerous German states, Jews had their rights to work, settle, and marry restricted. Without special letters of protection, Jews were banned from many different professions, and often had to resort to jobs considered unrespectable, such as peddling or cattle dealing, to survive. A Jewish man who wanted to marry had to purchase a registration certificate, known as a ''Matrikel'', proving he was in a \"respectable\" trade or profession. A ''Matrikel'', which could cost up to 1,000 gulden, was usually restricted to firstborn sons.<ref name=history>Sachar, Howard M.: ''A History of the Jews in America'' \u2013 Vintage Books</ref> As a result, most Jewish men were unable to legally marry. Throughout Germany, Jews were heavily taxed, and were sometimes discriminated against by gentile craftsmen.\n\nAs a result, many German Jews began to emigrate. The emigration was encouraged by German-Jewish newspapers.<ref name=history /> At first, most emigrants were young, single men from small towns and villages. A smaller number of single women also emigrated. Individual family members would emigrate alone, and then send for family members once they had earned enough money. Emigration eventually swelled, with some German Jewish communities losing up to 70% of their members. At one point, a German-Jewish newspaper reported that all the young Jewish males in the Franconian towns of Hagenbach, [[Ottingen]], and [[Warnbach]] had emigrated or were about to emigrate.<ref name=history /> The [[United States]] was the primary destination for emigrating German Jews.\n\nThe [[Revolutions of 1848]] swung the pendulum back towards freedom for the Jews. A noted reform rabbi of that time was [[Leopold Zunz]], a contemporary and friend of [[Heinrich Heine]]. In 1871, with the unification of Germany by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], came their emancipation, but the growing mood of despair among assimilated Jews was reinforced by the antisemitic penetrations of politics. In the 1870s, antisemitism was fueled by the [[Panic of 1873|financial crisis]] and scandals; in the 1880s by the arrival of masses of ''[[Ostjuden]]'', fleeing from Russian territories; by the 1890s it was a parliamentary presence, threatening anti-Jewish laws. In 1879 the Hamburg anarchist pamphleteer [[Wilhelm Marr]] introduced the term 'anti-Semitism' into the political vocabulary by founding the [[Anti-Semitic League]].<ref>{{cite book|authorlink =Paul Johnson (writer)|first =Paul|last= Johnson|title = A History of the Jews|page = 395|publisher = Harper Collins|date= 2009|isbn = 9780061828096}}</ref> Antisemites of the ''[[v\u00f6lkisch movement]]'' were the first to describe themselves as such, because they viewed Jews as part of a Semitic race that could never be properly assimilated into German society. Such was the ferocity of the anti-Jewish feeling of the v\u00f6lkisch movement that by 1900, ''anti-Semitic'' had entered German to describe anyone who had anti-Jewish feelings. However, despite massive protests and petitions, the v\u00f6lkisch movement failed to persuade the government to revoke Jewish emancipation, and in the 1912 Reichstag elections, the parties with v\u00f6lkisch-movement sympathies suffered a temporary defeat.\n\nJews experienced a period of legal equality after 1848. Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg passed the legislation that gave the Jews complete equality before the law in 1861\u201364. The newly formed German Empire did the same in 1871.<ref>V. R. Berghahn, ''Imperial Germany, 1871\u20131914: Economy, Society, Culture, and Politics'' (1994) p 102</ref> Historian [[Fritz Stern]] concludes that by 1900, what had emerged was a Jewish-German symbiosis, where German Jews had merged elements of German and Jewish culture into a unique new one. Marriages between Jews and non-Jews became somewhat common from the 19th century; for example, the wife of German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] was Jewish. However, opportunity for high appointments in the military, the diplomatic service, judiciary or senior bureaucracy was very small.<ref>Berghahn, ''Imperial Germany, 1871\u20131914'' (1994) pp 105-6</ref> Some historians believe that with emancipation the Jewish people lost their roots in their culture and began only using German culture. However, other historians including Marion A. Kaplan, argue that it was the opposite and Jewish women were the initiators of balancing both Jewish and German culture during Imperial Germany.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Assimilation and Community|last=Kaplan|first=Marion|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Cambridge, New York|pages=200\u2013212}}</ref> Jewish women played a key role in keeping the Jewish communities in tune with the changing society that was evoked by the Jews being emancipation. Jewish women were the catalyst of modernization within the Jewish community. The years 1870-1918 marked the shift in the women's role in society. Their job in the past had been housekeeping and raising children. Now, however, they began to contribute to the home financially. Jewish mothers were the only tool families had to linking Judaism with German culture. They felt it was their job to raise children that would fit in with bourgeois Germany. Women had to balance enforcing German traditions while also preserving Jewish traditions. Women were in charge of keeping kosher and the Sabbath; as well as, teaching their children German speech and dressing them in German clothing. Jewish women attempted to create an exterior presence of German while maintaining the Jewish lifestyle inside their homes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the history of the German Empire, there were various divisions within the German Jewish community over its future; in religious terms, Orthodox Jews sought to keep to Jewish religious tradition, while liberal Jews sought to \"modernise\" their communities by shifting from liturgical traditions to organ music and German-language prayers.\n\nThe Jewish population grew from 512,000 in 1871 to 615,000 in 1910, including 79,000 recent immigrants from Russia, just under one percent of the total. About 15,000 Jews converted to Christianity between 1871 and 1909.<ref>Berghahn, ''Imperial Germany, 1871\u20131914''  (1994) p 102-3</ref> The typical attitude of German liberals towards Jews was that they were in Germany to stay and were capable of being assimilated; anthropologist and politician Rudolf Virchow summarised this position, saying \"The Jews are simply here. You cannot strike them dead.\" This position, however, did not tolerate cultural differences between Jews and non-Jews, advocating instead eliminating this difference.<ref>Zimmerman, Andrew. Anthropology and antihumanism in imperial Germany. University of Chicago Press, 2010, p.292</ref>\n\n=== World War I ===\nA higher percentage of [[German Jewish military personnel of World War I|German Jews fought in World War I]] than of any other ethnic, religious or political group in Germany; some 12,000 died for their country.<ref>[http://www.germanjewishsoldiers.com/introduction.php ''\"Die J\u00fcdischen Gefallenen\"'' (The Jewish war dead)] A roll of honor commemorating the 12,000 German Jews who died for their fatherland in World War I\"</ref><ref>Bryan Mark Rigg.

Approximately 2,000 Jews became military officers and 1,200 became medical officers.\"</ref>\n\nMany German Jews supported the war out of patriotism; like many Germans, they viewed Germany's actions as defensive in nature and even left-liberal Jews believed Germany was responding to the actions of other countries, particularly Russia. For many Jews it was never a question as to whether or not they would stand behind Germany, it was simply a given that they would. The fact that the enemy was Russia also gave an additional reason for German Jews to support the war; Tsarist Russia was regarded as the oppressor in the eyes of German Jews for its [[pogroms]] and for many German Jews, the war against Russia would become a sort of holy war. While there was partially a desire for vengeance, for many Jews ensuring Russia's Jewish population was saved from a life of servitude was equally important - one German-Jewish publication stated \"We are fighting to protect our holy fatherland, to rescue European culture and to liberate our brothers in the east.\"<ref>Grady, Timothy L.

The main Jewish organisation in Germany, the Central Association of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith, declared unconditional support for the war and when 5 August was declared by the Kaiser to be a day of patriotic prayer, synagogues across Germany surged with visitors and filled with patriotic prayers and nationalistic speeches.<ref>Grady, Timothy L. A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War. Yale University Press, 2017, p.26</ref>\n\nWhile going to war brought the unsavoury prospect fighting fellow Jews in Russia, France and Britain, for the majority of Jews this severing of ties with Jewish communities in the Entente was accepted part of their spiritual mobilisation for war. After all, the conflict also pitted German Catholics and Protestants against their fellow believers in the east and west. Indeed, for some Jews the fact that Jews were going to war with one another was proof of the normality of German-Jewish life; they could no longer be considered a minority with transnational loyalties but loyal German citizens. German Jews often broke ties with Jews of other countries; the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle, a French organisation that was dedicated to protecting Jewish rights, saw a German Jewish member quit once the war started, declaring that he could not, as a German, belong to a society that was under French leadership.<ref>Grady, Timothy L. A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War. Yale University Press, 2017, p.33</ref> German Jews supported German colonial ambitions in Africa and Eastern Europe, out of the desire to increase German power and to rescue Eastern European Jews from Tsarist rule. The eastern advance became important for German Jews because it combined German military superiority with rescuing Eastern Jews from Russian brutality; Russian antisemitism and pogroms had only worsened as the war dragged on.<ref name=\"Crim, Brian E 2018\">Crim, Brian E. \"A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War.\" (2018): 295-297.</ref><ref>Grady, Timothy L.

Many were repelled by Eastern Jews, who dressed and behaved differently, as well as being much more religiously devout. Victor Klemperer, a German Jew working for military censors, stated \"No, I did not belong to these people, even if one proved my blood relation to them a hundred times over...I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German.\" This was a common attitude amongst ethnic Germans however; during the invasion of Russia the territories the Germans overran seemed backwards and primitive, thus for many Germans their experiences in Russia simply reinforced their national self-concept.<ref>Strachan, Hew.

There was some violence against German Jews in the early years of the Weimar Republic, and it was led by the paramilitary [[Freikorps]]. ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1920), a [[forgery]] which claimed that Jews were taking over the world, was widely circulated. The second half of the 1920s were prosperous, and antisemitism was much less noticeable. When the Great Depression hit in 1929, it surged again as [[Adolf Hitler]] and his [[Nazi party]] promoted a virulent strain.\n\nAuthor Jay Howard Geller says that four possible responses were available to the German Jewish community. The majority of German Jews were only nominally religious and they saw their Jewish identity as only one of several identities; they opted for bourgeois liberalism and assimilation into all phases of German culture. A second group (especially recent migrants from eastern Europe) embraced Judaism and [[Zionism]]. A third group of left-wing elements endorsed the universalism of [[Marxism]], which downplayed ethnicity and antisemitism. A fourth group contained some who embraced hardcore [[German nationalism]] and minimized or hid their Jewish heritage. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, a fifth option was seized upon by hundreds of thousands: escape into exile, typically at the cost of leaving all wealth behind.<ref>Jay Howard Geller, \"The Scholem Brothers and the Paths of German Jewry, 1914-1939,\" ''Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies'' .

German university faculties became universally open to Jewish scholars in 1918.

Seventeen German citizens were awarded Nobel prizes during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u20131933), five of whom were Jewish scientists. The German-Jewish literary magazine, ''[[Der Morgen (magazine)|Der Morgen]]'', was established in 1925. It published essays and stories by prominent Jewish writers such as [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Leo Hirsch]] until its liquidation by the Nazi government in 1938.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Edward K.|last2=Dresner|first2=Samuel H.|title=Abraham Josua Heschel: Prophetic Witness|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=0300071868|page=341}}</ref><ref name=\"Fraiman\">{{cite journal |last1=Fraiman |first1=Sarah |title=The Transformation of Jewish Consciousness in Nazi Germany as Reflected in the German Jewish Journal ''Der Morgen'', 1925\u20131938 |journal=Modern Judaism |date=2000 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=41\u201359 |jstor=1396629|doi=10.1093/mj/20.1.41 }}</ref>\n\n== Jews under the Nazis (1933\u201345) ==\n{{Main|Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany|The Holocaust}}\n{{The Holocaust sidebar}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99542, M\u00fcnchen, Judenverfolgung, Michael Siegel.jpg|thumb|Taken in March 1933, immediately after the Nazis seized power, this photo shows Nazi SA militants forcing a Jewish lawyer to walk barefoot through the streets of Munich wearing a sign that says \"I will never again complain to the police\"]]\nIn Germany, according to historian [[Hans Mommsen]], there were three types of antisemitism. In a 1997 interview, Mommsen was quoted as saying:\n\n<blockquote>One should differentiate between the cultural antisemitism symptomatic of the German conservatives\u2014found especially in the German officer corps and the high civil administration\u2014and mainly directed against the Eastern Jews on the one hand, and ''v\u00f6lkisch'' antisemitism on the other. The conservative variety functions, as Shulamit Volkov has pointed out, as something of a \"cultural code.\" This variety of German antisemitism later on played a significant role insofar as it prevented the functional elite from distancing itself from the repercussions of racial antisemitism. Thus, there was almost no relevant protest against the Jewish persecution on the part of the generals or the leading groups within the ''Reich'' government. This is especially true with respect to Hitler's proclamation of the \"racial annihilation war\" against the Soviet Union.\n\nBesides conservative antisemitism, there existed in Germany a rather silent anti-Judaism within the Catholic Church, which had a certain impact on immunizing the Catholic population against the escalating persecution. The famous protest of the Catholic Church against the euthanasia program was, therefore, not accompanied by any protest against the Holocaust.<br /><br /> The third and most vitriolic variety of antisemitism in Germany (and elsewhere) is the so-called ''v\u00f6lkisch'' antisemitism or racism, and this is the foremost advocate of using violence.<ref>{{cite web|last = Mommsen|first = Hans|title = Interview with Hans Mommsen|publisher = Yad Vashem|date = December 12, 1997| url =http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%203850.pdf|accessdate = 2010-02-06}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1933, persecution of the Jews became an active [[Nazism|Nazi]] policy, but at first laws were not as rigorously obeyed or as devastating as in later years. Such clauses, known as [[Aryan paragraph]]s, had been postulated previously by antisemitism and enacted in many private organizations.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14468, Berlin, NS-Boykott gegen j\u00fcdische Gesch\u00e4fte.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycott]] of April 1, 1933]]\nThe continuing and exacerbating abuse of Jews in Germany triggered calls throughout March 1933 by Jewish leaders around world for a [[Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933|boycott of German products]]. The Nazis responded with further bans and [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycotts]] against Jewish doctors, shops, lawyers and stores. Only six days later, the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] was passed, banning Jews from being employed in government. This law meant that Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and upper-level positions reserved for \"[[Aryan]]\" Germans. From then on, Jews were forced to work at more menial positions, beneath non-Jews, pushing them to more labored positions.\n\nThe Civil Service Law reached immediately into the education system because university professors, for example, were civil servants. While the majority of the German intellectual classes were not thoroughgoing National Socialists,{{sfn|Friedl\u00e4nder|2007|p=59}} academia had been suffused with a \"cultured antisemitism\" since imperial times, even more so during Weimar.{{sfn|Friedl\u00e4nder|2007|p=56 n.65}} With the majority of non-Jewish professors holding such feelings about Jews, coupled with how the Nazis' outwardly appeared in the period during and after the [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]], there was little motivation to oppose the anti-Jewish measures being enacted\u2014few did, and many were actively in favor.{{sfn|Friedl\u00e4nder|2007|pp=56, 59\u201360}} According to a German professor of the history of mathematics, \"There is no doubt that most of the German mathematicians who were members of the [[German Mathematical Society|professional organization]] collaborated with the Nazis, and did nothing to save or help their Jewish colleagues.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Aderet |first= Ofer |date= 25 November 2011 |title= Setting the record straight about Jewish mathematicians in Nazi Germany |url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/setting-the-record-straight-about-Jewish-mathematicians-in-nazi-germany-1.397629 |newspaper= [[Haaretz]] |accessdate= 19 September 2012 |quote= Except for a few individual cases, the mathematical society didn't care about the Jews.

No new president was appointed; with Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany, he took control of the office of [[F\u00fchrer]]. This, and a tame government with no opposition parties, allowed [[Adolf Hitler]] totalitarian control of law-making. The army also swore an oath of loyalty personally to Hitler, giving him power over the military; this position allowed him to enforce his beliefs further by creating more pressure on the Jews than ever before.\n\nIn 1935 and 1936, the pace of persecution of the Jews increased. In May 1935, Jews were forbidden to join the [[Wehrmacht]] (Armed Forces), and that year, anti-Jewish propaganda appeared in Nazi German shops and restaurants. The [[Nuremberg Racial Purity Laws]] were passed around the time of the Nazi rallies at Nuremberg; on September 15, 1935, the [[Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor]] was passed, preventing [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews]]. At the same time the [[Reich Citizenship Law]] was passed and was reinforced in November by a decree, stating that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens (''Reichsb\u00fcrger'') of their own country. Their official status became ''Reichsangeh\u00f6riger'', \"subject of the state\". This meant that they had no basic civil rights, such as that to vote, but at this time the right to vote for the non-Jewish Germans only meant the obligation to vote for the Nazi party. This removal of basic citizens' rights preceded harsher laws to be passed in the future against Jews. The drafting of the Nuremberg Laws is often attributed to [[Hans Globke]].\n\nIn 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from exerting any influence in education, politics, higher education and industry. Because of this, there was nothing to stop the anti-Jewish actions which spread across the Nazi-German economy.\n\nAfter the [[Night of the Long Knives]], the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) became the dominant policing power in Germany. Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]] was eager to please Hitler and so willingly obeyed his orders. Since the SS had been Hitler's personal bodyguard, its members were far more loyal and skilled than those of the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) had been. Because of this, they were also supported, though distrusted, by the army, which was now more willing to agree with Hitler's decisions than when the SA was dominant.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} All of this allowed Hitler more direct control over government and political attitude towards Jews in Nazi Germany. In 1937 and 1938, new laws were implemented, and the segregation of Jews from the true \"Aryan\" German population was started. In particular, Jews were penalized financially for their perceived racial status.\n\nOn June 4, 1937, two young German Jews, [[Helmut Hirsch]] and Isaac Utting, were both executed for being involved in a plot to bomb the Nazi party headquarters in Nuremberg.\n\nAs of March 1, 1938, government contracts could no longer be awarded to Jewish businesses. On September 30, \"Aryan\" doctors could only treat \"Aryan\" patients. Provision of medical care to Jews was already hampered by the fact that Jews were banned from being doctors or having any professional jobs.\n\n[[File:German Jewish Passport.jpg|thumb|German Jewish passports could be used to leave, but not to return.]]\nBeginning August 17, 1938, Jews with first names of non-Jewish origin had to add Israel<!-- No offset with italics or quotation marks needed--> (males) or Sarah<!-- No offset with italics or quotation marks needed--> (females) to their names, and a large J was to be imprinted on their passports beginning October 5. On November 15 Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been forced to sell out to the Nazi German government. This further reduced Jews' rights as human beings. They were in many ways officially separated from the German populace.\n\n[[File:Nurembergsynagoguec.jpg|left|thumb|Synagogue at [[Nuremberg]], c. 1890\u20131900. The structure was destroyed in 1938.]]\nThe increasingly [[totalitarian]], [[militarism|militaristic]] regime which was being imposed on Germany by Hitler allowed him to control the actions of the SS and the military. On November 7, 1938, a young Polish Jew, [[Herschel Grynszpan]], attacked and shot two German officials in the Nazi German embassy in Paris. (Grynszpan was angry about the treatment of his parents by the Nazi Germans.) On November 9 the German Attache, [[Ernst vom Rath]], died. Goebbels issued instructions that demonstrations against Jews were to be organized and undertaken in retaliation throughout Germany. The SS ordered the Night of Broken Glass ([[Kristallnacht]]) to be carried out that night, November 9\u201310, 1938. The storefronts of Jewish shops and offices were smashed and vandalized, and many synagogues were destroyed by fire. Approximately 91 Jews were killed, and another 30,000 arrested, mostly able bodied males, all of whom were sent to the newly formed concentration camps. In the following 3 months some 2,000\u20132,500 of them died in the concentration camps, the rest were released under the condition that they leave Germany. Many Germans were disgusted by this action when the full extent of the damage was discovered, so Hitler ordered that it be blamed on the Jews. Collectively, the Jews were made to pay back one billion [[Reichsmark]] (equivalent to {{Inflation|DE|1|1938}} billion {{Inflation-year|DE}} euros) in damages, the fine being raised by confiscating 20 per cent of every Jewish property. The Jews also had to repair all damages at their own cost.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E03468, Berlin, Emigration von Juden, Umzugswagen.jpg|thumb|Jews emigrating from Berlin to the United States, 1939]]\nIncreasing antisemitism prompted a wave of Jewish mass emigration from Germany throughout the 1930s. Among the first wave were intellectuals, politically active individuals, and Zionists.  However, as Nazi legislation worsened the Jews' situation, more Jews wished to leave Germany, with a panicked rush in the months after [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938.\n\nPalestine was a popular destination for German Jewish emigration. Soon after the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, they negotiated the [[Haavara Agreement]] with [[Zionism|Zionist]] authorities in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which was signed on August 25, 1933. Under its terms, 60,000 German Jews were to be allowed to emigrate to Palestine and take $100 million in assets with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transferagreement.com/|title=Transfer Agreement - Home Page|website=www.transferagreement.com}}</ref> During the [[Fifth Aliyah]], between 1929 and 1939, a total of 250,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine\u2014more than 55,000 of them from Germany, Austria, or Bohemia.  Many of them were doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects, and other professionals, who contributed greatly to the development of the Yishuv.\n\nThe [[United States]] was another destination for German Jews seeking to leave the country, though the number allowed to immigrate was restricted due to the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. Between 1933 and 1939, more than 300,000 Germans, of whom about 90% were Jews, applied for immigration visas to the United States. By 1940, only 90,000 German Jews had been granted visas and allowed to settle in the United States. Some 100,000 German Jews also moved to Western European countries, especially [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]]. However, these countries would later be occupied by Germany, and most of them would still fall victim to [[the Holocaust]]. Another 48,000 emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] and other European countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/stlouis/teach/supread.htm |title=Teacher Resources |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2013-04-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402175330/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/stlouis/teach/supread.htm |archivedate=April 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005139 |title= Refugees |publisher=Ushmm.org}}</ref>\n\n== The Holocaust in Germany ==\n{{Main|The Holocaust}}\n[[File:Deportation of Jews from W\u00fcrzburg to the Lublin district, 25 April 1942 (USHMM 46207).jpg|thumb|Jews are deported from [[W\u00fcrzburg]] to the [[Lublin Reservation|Lublin district]] of [[Poland]], 25 April 1942]]\nOverall, of the 522,000 Jews living in Germany in January 1933, approximately 304,000 emigrated during the first six years of Nazi rule and about 214,000 were left on the eve of World War II.

Especially during the time of the [[Black Death]] from 1348 to 1350 hatred and violence against Jews increased. Approximately 72% of towns with a Jewish settlement suffered from violent attacks against the Jewish population.\n\nAfter World War I Antisemitism grew again, during the time of the Weimar Republic and later on during the Nazi reign.\n\nRegions that suffered from the [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|Black Death pogroms]] were 6 times more likely to engage in anti-Semitic violence during the 1920s, the Nazi parties like the [[German National People's Party|DNVP]], [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] and [[German V\u00f6lkisch Freedom Party|DVFP]] gained a 1.5 times higher voting share in the 1928 election, their inhabitants wrote more letters to anti-Semitic newspapers like \u201c[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]\u201d, and they deported more Jews during the Nazi reign.

Additionally, approximately 15,000 German Jews survived the concentration camps or survived by going into hiding. These German Jews were joined by approximately 200,000 [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|displaced persons (DPs)]], Eastern European Jewish Holocaust survivors. They came to Allied-occupied western Germany after finding no homes left for them in eastern Europe or after having been liberated on German soil. The overwhelming majority of the DPs wished to emigrate to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and lived in Allied- and U.N.-administered refugee camps, remaining isolated from German society. When [[Israel]] became independent in 1948, most European-Jewish DPs left for the new state; however, 10,000 to 15,000 Jews decided to resettle in Germany. Despite hesitations and a long history of antagonism between German Jews (''[[Yekke]]s'') and East European Jews (''Ostjuden''), the two disparate groups united to form the basis of a new Jewish community. In 1950 they founded their unitary representative organization, the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]].\n\n=== Jews of West Germany ===\nThe Jewish community in [[West Germany]] from the 1950s to the 1970s was characterized by its social conservatism and generally private nature. Although there were Jewish elementary schools in West Berlin, [[Frankfurt]], and [[Munich]], the community had a very high average age. Few young adults chose to remain in Germany, and many of those who did married non-Jews. Many critics{{who|date=February 2016}} of the community and its leadership accused it of ossification. In the 1980s, a college for Jewish studies was established in [[Heidelberg]]; however, a disproportionate number of its students were not Jewish. By 1990, the community numbered between 30,000 and 40,000. Although the Jewish community of Germany did not have the same impact as the pre-1933 community, some Jews were prominent in German public life, including [[Hamburg]] mayor [[Herbert Weichmann]]; [[Schleswig-Holstein]] Minister of Justice (and Deputy Chief Justice of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]]) [[Rudolf Katz]]; [[Hesse]] Attorney General [[Fritz Bauer]]; former Hesse Minister of Economics Heinz-Herbert Karry; West Berlin politician Jeanette Wolff; television personalities [[Hugo Egon Balder]], [[Hans Rosenthal]], [[Ilja Richter]], [[Inge Meysel]], and [[Michel Friedman]]; Jewish communal leaders [[Heinz Galinski]], [[Ignatz Bubis]], [[Paul Spiegel]], and [[Charlotte Knobloch]] (see: [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]]), and Germany's most influential literary critic, [[Marcel Reich-Ranicki]].\n\n=== Jews of East Germany ===\nThe Jewish community of communist [[East Germany]] numbered only a few hundred active members. Most Jews who settled in East Germany did so either because their pre-1933 homes had been there or because they had been politically leftist before the Nazi seizure of power and, after 1945, wished to build an antifascist, socialist Germany. Most such politically engaged Jews were not religious or active in the official Jewish community. They included writers such as [[Anna Seghers]], [[Stefan Heym]], [[Stephan Hermlin]], [[Jurek Becker]], [[Stasi]] Colonel General [[Markus Wolf]], singer [[Lin Jaldati]], composer [[Hanns Eisler]], and politician [[Gregor Gysi]].

In 1935 and 1936, the pace of antisemitic persecution increased. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from participating in education, politics, higher education and industry. The [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) ordered the Night of Broken Glass (''[[Kristallnacht]]'') the night of November 9\u201310, 1938. The storefronts of Jewish shops and offices were smashed and vandalized, and many synagogues were destroyed by fire.

It indicates that the legal status of the Jews there was the same as elsewhere in the [[Roman Empire]]. They enjoyed some civil liberties, but were restricted regarding the dissemination of their culture, the keeping of non-Jewish slaves, and the holding of office under the government.\n\nJews were otherwise free to follow any occupation open to indigenous Germans and were engaged in agriculture, trade, industry, and gradually money-lending. These conditions at first continued in the subsequently established [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] kingdoms under the [[Burgundians]] and [[Franks]], for [[Christian church|ecclesiasticism]] took root slowly. The [[Merovingian]] rulers who succeeded to the Burgundian empire were devoid of fanaticism and gave scant support to the efforts of the Church to restrict the civic and social status of the Jews.\n\n[[Charlemagne]] (800\u2013814) readily made use of the Church for the purpose of infusing coherence into the loosely joined parts of his extensive empire, by any means a blind tool of the [[canon law|canonical law]]. He employed Jews for diplomatic purposes, sending, for instance, a Jew as interpreter and guide with his embassy to [[Harun al-Rashid]]. Yet, even then, a gradual change occurred in the lives of the Jews. The Church forbade Christians to be [[usury|usurers]], so the Jews secured the [[remunerative]] monopoly of money-lending. This decree caused a mixed reaction of people in general in the Frankish empire (including Germany) to the Jews: Jewish people were sought everywhere, as well as avoided. This ambivalence about Jews occurred because their capital was indispensable, while their business was viewed as disreputable. This curious combination of circumstances increased Jewish influence and Jews went about the country freely, settling also in the eastern portions ([[Old Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia]]). Aside from Cologne, the earliest communities were established in Mainz, [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Speyer, and [[Regensburg]].{{sfn|Ben-Sasson|2007|pp=518-9}}\n\nThe status of the German Jews remained unchanged under Charlemagne's successor, [[Louis the Pious]]. Jews were unrestricted in their commerce; however, they paid somewhat higher taxes into the state treasury than did the non-Jews. A special officer, the ''Judenmeister'', was appointed by the government to protect Jewish privileges. The later Carolingians, however, followed the demands of the Church more and more. The bishops continually argued at the [[synods]] for including and enforcing decrees of the canonical law, with the consequence that the majority Christian populace mistrusted the Jewish unbelievers. This feeling, among both princes and people, was further stimulated by the attacks on the civic equality of the Jews. Beginning with the 10th century, [[Holy Week]] became more and more a period of antisemitic activities, yet the [[Saxons|Saxon]] emperors did not treat the Jews badly, exacting from them merely the taxes levied upon all other merchants. Although the Jews in Germany were as ignorant as their contemporaries in secular studies, they could read and understand the Hebrew prayers and the Bible in the original text. [[Halakah|Halakhic]] studies began to flourish about 1000.\n\nAt that time, [[Rav]] [[Gershom ben Judah]] was teaching at [[Metz]] and Mainz, gathering about him pupils from far and near. He is described in Jewish [[historiography]] as a model of wisdom, humility, and piety, and became known to succeeding generations as the \"Light of the [[Jewish Diaspora|Exile]]\".<ref>Ben-Sasson, Haim Hillel (1976). \"The Middle Ages,\" in: Ben-Sasson (Ed.), ''A History of the Jewish People'' (pp. 385-723).

This continuous study of the [[Torah]] and the [[Talmud]] produced such a devotion to Judaism that the Jews considered life without their religion not worth living; but they did not realize this clearly until the time of the Crusades, when they were often compelled to choose between life and faith.<ref>{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Germany / Up to the Crusades |p=631 |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6603-germany#anchor2 |short=x |noicon=1 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Cultural and religious centre of European Jewry ===\nThe Jewish communities of the cities of [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Mainz]] formed the league of cities which became the center of Jewish life during Medieval times. These are referred to as the ShUM cities, after the first letters of the Hebrew names: [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] for Speyer (''Shpira''), [[Waw (letter)|Waw]] for Worms (''Varmaisa'') and [[Mem]] for Mainz (''Magentza''). The ''[[Takkanot Shum]]'' ({{lang-he|\u05ea\u05e7\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05d5\"\u05dd}} \"Enactments of ShUM\") were a set of decrees formulated and agreed upon over a period of decades by their Jewish community leaders. The official website for the city of Mainz states:\n\n{{quote|One of the most glorious epochs in Mainz's long history was the period from the beginning of the 900s and evidently much earlier. Following the barbaric [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], a relatively safe and enlightened [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] period brought peace and prosperity to Mainz and much of central\u2013western Europe.\n\nFor the next 400 years, Mainz attracted many Jews as trade flourished. The greatest Jewish teachers and rabbis flocked to the Rhine. Their teachings, dialogues, decisions, and influence propelled Mainz and neighboring towns along the Rhine into world-wide prominence.

The [[History of the Jews in Speyer|Jewish community of Speyer]] was saved by the bishop, but [[Worms massacre (1096)|800 were slain in Worms]]. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the Rhenish cities alone between May and July 1096. Alleged crimes, like desecration of the host, ritual murder, poisoning of wells, and treason, brought hundreds to the stake and drove thousands into exile. Jews were alleged{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} to have caused [[Mongol invasion of Europe|the inroads of the Mongols]], though they suffered equally with the Christians. Jews suffered intense persecution during the [[Rintfleisch massacres]] of 1298. In 1336 [[History of the Jews in Alsace|Jews from Alsace]] were subjected to massacres by the outlaws of [[Arnold von Uissigheim]]. When the [[Black Death]] swept over Europe in 1348\u201349, some Christian communities accused Jews of poisoning wells. In the [[Erfurt massacre (1349)|Erfurt Massacre]] of 1349, the members of the entire Jewish community were murdered or expelled from the city, due to superstitions about the Black Death. Royal policy and public ambivalence towards Jews helped the persecuted Jews fleeing the German-speaking lands to form the foundations of what would become the largest Jewish community in Europe in what is now Poland/Ukraine/Romania/Belarus/Lithuania.\n\n== In the Holy Roman Empire ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}} \n[[File:1614jews.jpg|thumb|Etching of the expulsion of the Jews from [[Frankfurt]] on August 23, 1614: The text says, \"1,380 persons old and young were counted at the exit of the gate.\"]]\n\nThe legal and civic status of the Jews underwent a transformation under the Holy Roman Empire. Jewish people found a certain degree of protection with the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], who claimed the right of possession and protection of all the Jews of the empire. A justification for this claim was that the Holy Roman Emperor was the successor of the emperor Titus, who was said to have acquired the Jews as his private property. The German emperors apparently claimed this right of possession more for the sake of taxing the Jews than of protecting them.\n\nA variety of such taxes existed. [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], was a prolific creator of new taxes. In 1342, he instituted the \"golden sacrificial penny\" and decreed that every year all the Jews should pay the emperor one kreutzer out of every gulden of their property in addition to the taxes they were already paying to both the state and municipal authorities. The emperors of the house of Luxembourg devised other means of taxation. They turned their prerogatives in regard to the Jews to further account by selling at a high price to the princes and free towns of the empire the valuable privilege of taxing and [[fine (penalty)|fining]] the Jews. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], via the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], granted this privilege to the seven electors of the empire when the empire was reorganized in 1356.\n\nFrom this time onward, for reasons that also apparently concerned taxes, the Jews of Germany gradually passed in increasing numbers from the authority of the emperor to that of both the lesser sovereigns and the cities. For the sake of sorely needed revenue, the Jews were now invited, with the promise of full protection, to return to those districts and cities from which they had shortly before been expelled. However, as soon as Jewish people acquired some property, they were again plundered and driven away. These episodes thenceforth constituted a large portion of the medieval history of the German Jews. Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] was most expert in transferring to his own coffers gold from the pockets of rich Jews. He made compacts with many cities, estates, and princes whereby he annulled all outstanding debts to the Jews in return for a certain sum paid to him. Emperor Wenceslaus declared that anyone helping Jews with the collection of their debts, in spite of this annulment, would be dealt with as a robber and peacebreaker, and be forced to make restitution. This decree, which for years allegedly injured the public credit, is said to have impoverished thousands of Jewish families during the close of the [[14th century]].\n[[File:Burning Jews.jpg|thumb|left|Jews burned alive for the alleged [[host desecration]] in [[Deggendorf]], [[Bavaria]], in 1338, and in [[Sternberg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Sternberg]], [[Mecklenburg]], in 1492; a woodcut from the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493)]]\nThe 15th century did not bring any amelioration. What happened in the time of the Crusades happened again. The war upon the [[Hussites]] became the signal for renewed persecution of Jews. The Jews of Austria, [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]] passed through all the terrors of death, forced baptism, or voluntary [[self-immolation]] for the sake of their faith. When the Hussites made peace with the Church, the Pope sent the Franciscan friar [[John of Capistrano]] to win the renegades back into the fold and inspire them with loathing for heresy and unbelief; 41 martyrs were burned in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] alone, and all Jews were forever banished from Silesia. The [[Franciscan]] friar [[Bernardine of Feltre]] brought a similar fate upon the communities in southern and western Germany. As a consequence of the fictitious confessions extracted under torture from the Jews of [[Trento|Trent]], the populace of many cities, especially of Regensburg, fell upon the Jews and massacred them.\n\nThe end of the [[15th century]], which brought a new epoch for the Christian world, brought no relief to the Jews. Jews in Germany remained the victims of a religious hatred that ascribed to them all possible evils. When the established Church, threatened in its spiritual power in Germany and elsewhere, prepared for its conflict with the culture of the Renaissance, one of its most convenient points of attack was rabbinic literature. At this time, as once before in France, Jewish converts spread false reports in regard to the Talmud, but an advocate of the book arose in the person of [[Johann Reuchlin]], the German humanist, who was the first one in Germany to include the Hebrew language among the humanities. His opinion, though strongly opposed by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and their followers, finally prevailed when the humanistic [[Pope Leo X]] permitted the Talmud to be printed in Italy.\n\n=== Moses Mendelssohn ===\n{{main|Moses Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:Moses Mendelson P7160073.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Moses Mendelssohn]]]]\nThough reading German books was forbidden in the 1700s by Jewish inspectors who had a measure of police power in Germany, Moses Mendelson found his first German book, an edition of Protestant theology, at a well-organized system of Jewish charity for needy Talmud students. Mendelssohn read this book and found proof of the existence of God \u2013 his first meeting with a sample of European letters. This was only the beginning to Mendelssohn's inquiries about the knowledge of life. Mendelssohn learned many new languages, and with his whole education consisting of Talmud lessons, he thought in Hebrew and translated for himself every new piece of work he met into this language. The divide between the Jews and the rest of society was caused by a lack of translation between these two languages, and [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] translated the Torah into German, bridging the gap between the two; this book allowed Jews to speak and write in German, preparing them for participation in German culture and secular science. In 1750, Mendelssohn began to serve as a teacher in the house of Isaac Bernhard, the owner of a silk factory, after beginning his publications of philosophical essays in German. Mendelssohn conceived of God as a perfect Being and had faith in \"God's wisdom, righteousness, mercy, and goodness.\"  He argued, \"the world results from a creative act through which the divine will seeks to realize the highest good,\" and accepted the existence of miracles and revelation as long as belief in God did not depend on them. He also believed that revelation could not contradict reason. Like the deists, Mendelssohn claimed that reason could discover the reality of God, divine providence, and immortality of the soul. He was the first to speak out against the use of excommunication as a religious threat. At the height of his career, in 1769, Mendelssohn was publicly challenged by a Christian apologist, a [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] pastor named [[Johann Kaspar Lavater|John Lavater]], to defend the superiority of Judaism over Christianity. From then on, he was involved in defending Judaism in print.  In 1783, he published ''Jerusalem, or On Religious Power and Judaism''. Speculating that no religious institution should use coercion and emphasized that Judaism does not coerce the mind through dogma, he argued that through reason, all people could discover religious philosophical truths, but what made Judaism unique was its revealed code of legal, ritual, and moral law. He said that Jews must live in civil society, but only in a way that their right to observe religious laws is granted, while also recognizing the needs for respect, and multiplicity of religions. He campaigned for emancipation and instructed Jews to form bonds with the gentile governments, attempting to improve the relationship between Jews and Christians while arguing for tolerance and humanity. He became the symbol of the Jewish Enlightenment, the Haskalah.<ref name=\"Moses Mendelssohn\">{{cite book|last1=Bach|first1=Hans|title=Moses Mendelssohn|date=Summer 1976|page=24|edition=2|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1312125181/}}</ref>\n\n'''Early 18th Century'''\n[[File:David Friedlander.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[David Friedl\u00e4nder]] was a German-Jewish communal leader who promoted [[Jewish emancipation]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n\nIn the late [[18th century]], a youthful enthusiasm for new ideals of religious equality began to take hold in the western world. Austrian Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] was foremost in espousing these new ideals. As early as 1782, he issued the ''Patent of Toleration for the Jews of Lower Austria'', thereby establishing civic equality for his Jewish subjects.\n\nBefore 1806, when general citizenship was largely nonexistent in the Holy Roman Empire, its inhabitants were subject to varying [[Estates of the realm|estate]] regulations. In different ways from one territory of the empire to another, these regulations classified inhabitants into different groups, such as dynasts, members of the court entourage, other aristocrats, city dwellers ([[bourgeoisie|burghers]]), Jews, [[Huguenot]]s (in Prussia a special estate until 1810), free [[peasant]]s, [[serf]]s, peddlers and [[Romani people|Gypsies]], with different privileges and burdens attached to each classification. Legal inequality was the principle.\n\nThe concept of citizenship was mostly restricted to cities, especially [[Free Imperial Cities|free imperial cities]]. No general franchise existed, which remained a privilege for the few, who had inherited the status or acquired it when they reached a certain level of taxed income or could afford the expense of the citizen's fee (''B\u00fcrgergeld''). Citizenship was often further restricted to city dwellers affiliated to the locally dominant Christian denomination (Calvinism, Roman Catholicism, or Lutheranism). City dwellers of other denominations or religions and those who lacked the necessary wealth to qualify as citizens were considered to be mere inhabitants who lacked political rights, and were sometimes subject to revocable residence permits.\n\nMost Jews then living in those parts of Germany that allowed them to settle were automatically defined as mere indigenous inhabitants, depending on permits that were typically less generous than those granted to gentile indigenous inhabitants (''Einwohner'', as opposed to ''B\u00fcrger'', or citizen). In the 18th century, some Jews and their families (such as [[Daniel Itzig]] in Berlin) gained equal status with their Christian fellow city dwellers, but had a different status from noblemen, Huguenots, or serfs. They often did not enjoy the right to freedom of movement across territorial or even municipal boundaries, let alone the same status in any new place as in their previous location.\n\nWith the abolition of differences in legal status during the Napoleonic era and its aftermath, citizenship was established as a new franchise generally applying to all former subjects of the monarchs. Prussia conferred citizenship on the Prussian Jews in 1812, though this by no means resulted in full equality with other citizens. [[Jewish emancipation#Dates of emancipation|Jewish emancipation]] did not eliminate all forms of discrimination against Jews, who often remained barred from holding official state positions. The German federal edicts of 1815 merely held out the prospect of full equality, but it was not genuinely implemented at that time, and even the promises which had been made were modified. However, such forms of discrimination were no longer the guiding principle for ordering society, but a violation of it. In Austria, many laws restricting the trade and traffic of Jewish subjects remained in force until the middle of the 19th century in spite of the patent of toleration. Some of the crown lands, such as [[Styria]] and Upper Austria, forbade any Jews to settle within their territory; in Bohemia, Moravia, and [[Austrian Silesia]] many cities were closed to them. The Jews were also burdened with heavy taxes and imposts.\n\nIn the German kingdom of Prussia, the government materially modified the promises made in the disastrous year of 1813. The promised uniform regulation of Jewish affairs was time and again postponed. In the period between 1815 and 1847, no less than 21 territorial laws affecting Jews in the [[Provinces of Prussia|older eight provinces]] of the Prussian state  were in effect, each having to be observed by part of the Jewish community. At that time, no official was authorized to speak in the name of all Prussian Jews, or Jewry in most of the [[States of the German Confederation|other 41 German states]], let alone for all German Jews.\n\nNevertheless, a few men came forward to promote their cause, foremost among them being [[Gabriel Riesser]] (d. 1863), a Jewish lawyer from [[Hamburg]], who demanded full civic equality for his people. He won over public opinion to such an extent that this equality was granted in Prussia on April 6, 1848, in [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] on September 5 and on December 12, respectively, and also in his home [[Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg|state of Hamburg]], then home to the second-largest Jewish community in Germany.<ref>By the introduction of the basic freedoms decided on by the [[Frankfurt National Assembly|National Assembly]], adopted into Hamburg's statutory law on February 21, 1849.</ref> In [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], equality was conceded on December 3, 1861; in [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] on October 4, 1862; in [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]] on July 14, 1863; and in [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] on December 3, 1868. After the establishment of the [[North German Confederation]] by the law of July 3, 1869, all remaining statutory restrictions imposed on the followers of different religions were abolished; this decree was extended to all the states of the German empire after the events of 1870.\n\n=== The Jewish Enlightenment ===\n{{main| Haskalah}}\nDuring the General Enlightenment (the 1600s to late 1700s), many Jewish women began to frequently visit non-Jewish salons and to campaign for emancipation. In Western Europe and the German states, observance of Jewish law, ''Halacha'', started to be neglected. In the 18th century, some traditional German scholars and leaders, such as the doctor and author of ''Ma'aseh Tuviyyah'', [[Tobias Cohn|Tobias b. Moses Cohn]], appreciated the secular culture. The most important feature during this time was the German ''Aufkl\u00e4rung'', which was able to boast of native figures who competed with the finest Western European writers, scholars, and intellectuals. Aside from the externalities of language and dress, the Jews internalized the cultural and intellectual norms of German society. The movement, becoming known as the German or Berlin ''Haskalah'' offered many effects to the challenges of German society. As early as the 1740s, many German Jews and some individual Polish and Lithuanian Jews had a desire for secular education. The German-Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century, the ''[[Haskalah]]'', marks the political, social, and intellectual transition of European Jewry to modernity. Some of the elite members of Jewish society knew European languages. Absolutist governments in Germany, Austria, and Russia deprived the Jewish community's leadership of its authority and many Jews became [[Court Jew|'Court Jews']].  Using their connections with Jewish businessmen to serve as military contractors, managers of mints, founders of new industries and providers to the court of precious stones and clothing, they gave economic assistance to the local rulers. Court Jews were protected by the rulers and acted as did everyone else in society in their speech, manners, and awareness of European literature and ideas. Isaac Euchel, for example, represented a new generation of Jews. He maintained a leading role in the German ''Haskalah'', is one of the founding editors of ''Ha-Me/assef''. Euchel was exposed to European languages and culture while living in Prussian centers: Berlin and Koenigsberg. His interests turned towards promoting the educational interests of the Enlightenment with other Jews. Moses Mendelssohn as another enlightenment thinker was the first Jew to bring secular culture to those living an Orthodox Jewish life. He valued reason and felt that anyone could arrive logically at religious truths while arguing that what makes Judaism unique is its divine revelation of a code of law. Mendelssohn's commitment to Judaism leads to tensions even with some of those who subscribed to Enlightenment philosophy. Faithful Christians who were less opposed to his rationalistic ideas than to his adherence to Judaism found it difficult to accept this ''Juif de Berlin.'' In most of Western Europe, the ''Haskalah'' ended with large numbers of Jews assimilating. Many Jews stopped adhering to Jewish law, and the struggle for emancipation in Germany awakened some doubts about the future of Jews in Europe and eventually led to both immigrations to America and Zionism. In Russia, antisemitism ended the'' Haskalah''. Some Jews responded to this antisemitism by campaigning for emancipation, while others joined revolutionary movements and assimilated, and some turned to Jewish nationalism in the form of the [[Hovevei Zion|Zionist Hibbat Zion movement.]]\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barnouw|first1=Dagmar|author-link=Dagmar Barnouw|title=Origin and Transformation: Salomon Maimon and German-Jewish Enlightenment Culture|date=Summer 2002|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume= 20|issue=4|pages=64\u201380|doi=10.1353/sho.2002.0051}}</ref>\n\n=== Reorganization of the German Jewish Community ===\n\nThe empowerment of the Jews and the rebirth of Jewish science led to a transfer of ancient traditions to the newer generations. [[Abraham Geiger|Geiger]] and [[Samuel Holdheim|Holdeim]] were two founders of the conservative movement in modern Judaism accepted the modern spirit of liberalism. Samson Raphael Hirsch defended traditional customs: denying the modern \"spirit\". Neither of these beliefs was followed by the faithful Jews; [[Zecharias Frankel|Zachary Frankel]] created a moderate reform movement in assurance with German communities, public worships were reorganized, reduction of medieval additions to the prayer, congregational singing was introduced, and regular sermons required scientifically trained rabbis. Religious schools were enforced by the state due to a want for the addition of religious structure to secular education of Jewish children. <!-- run-on sentence hard to understand Talmudic school had rabbinical seminaries with Talmudic instruction, which followed the methods introduced by Zacharias Frankel in the Jewish Theological Seminary it opened at Breslau in 1854, and started an attention to religious literature including textbooks on religion: biblical and Jewish history, translations and explanations of the bible and prayer books which met the demand of modern educational systems. --> Pulpit oratory started to thrive mainly due to German preachers, such as M. Sachs and M. Joel. Synagogal music was accepted with the help of Louis Lewandowski.  Part of the evolution of the Jewish community was the cultivation of Jewish literature and associations created with teachers, rabbis, and leaders of congregations.\n\nAnother vital part of the reorganization of the Jewish-German community was the heavy involvement of Jewish women in the community and their new tendencies to assimilate their families into a different lifestyle. Jewish women were contradicting their view points in the sense that they were modernizing, but they also tried to keep some traditions alive. German Jewish mothers were shifting the way they raised their children in ways such as moving their families out of Jewish neighborhoods, thus changing who Jewish children grew up around and conversed with, all in all shifting the dynamic of the then close-knit Jewish community. Additionally, Jewish mothers wished to integrate themselves and their families into German society in other ways.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Marion|title=Gender and Jewish History in Imperial Germany|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}</ref> Because of their mothers, Jewish children participated in walks around the neighborhood, sporting events, and other activities that would mold them into becoming more like their other German peers. In order for mothers to assimilate into German culture, they took pleasure in reading newspapers and magazines that focused on the fashion styles, as well as other trends that were up and coming for the time and that the Protestant, bourgeois Germans were exhibiting. Similar to this, German-Jewish mothers also urged their children to partake in music lessons, mainly because it was a popular activity among other Germans. Another effort German-Jewish mothers put into assimilating their families was enforcing the importance of manners on their children. It was noted that non-Jewish Germans saw Jews as disrespectful and unable to grasp the concept of time and place.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/> Because of this, Jewish mothers tried to raise their kids having even better manners than the Protestant children in an effort to combat the pre-existing stereotype put on their children. In addition, Jewish mothers put a large emphasis on proper education for their children in hopes that this would help them grow up to be more respected by their communities and eventually lead to prosperous careers. While Jewish mothers worked tirelessly on ensuring the assimilation of their families, they also attempted to keep the familial aspect of Jewish traditions. They began to look at Shabbat and holidays as less of culturally Jewish days, but more as family reunions of sorts. What was once viewed as a more religious event became more of a social gathering of relatives.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/>\n\n=== Birth of the Reform Movement ===\n\nThe beginning of the Reform Movement in Judaism was emphasized by [[David Philipson]], who was the rabbi at the largest Reform congregation. The increasing political centralization of the late 18th and early 19th centuries undermined the societal structure that perpetuated traditional Jewish life. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas began to influence many intellectuals, and the resulting political, economic, and social changes were overpowering. Many Jews felt a tension between Jewish tradition and the way they were now leading their lives-religiously- resulting in less tradition. As the insular religious society that reinforced such observance disintegrated, falling away from vigilant observance without deliberately breaking with Judaism  was easy. Some tried to reconcile their religious heritage with their new social surroundings; they reformed traditional Judaism to meet their new needs and to express their spiritual desires. A movement was formed with a set of religious beliefs, and practices that were considered expected and tradition. [[Reform Judaism]] was the first modern response to the Jew's emancipation, though reform Judaism differing in all countries caused stresses of autonomy on both the congregation and individual. Some of the reforms were in the practices: circumcisions were abandoned, rabbis wore vests after Protestant ministers, and instrumental accompaniment was used: pipe organs. In addition, the traditional Hebrew prayer book was replaced by German text, and reform synagogues began being called temples which were previously considered the Temple of Jerusalem. Reform communities composed of similar beliefs and Judaism changed at the same pace as the rest of society had. The Jewish people have adapted to religious beliefs and practices to the meet the needs of the Jewish people throughout the generation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Philipson|first1=David|title=The Beginnings of the Reform Movement in Judaism|journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume=15|issue=3|date=April 1903|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=475\u2013521|edition=Vol. 15, No. 3|jstor=1450629|doi=10.2307/1450629}}</ref>\n\n== 1815\u20131918 ==\n[[File:1890 gustav ermann kaiser soldier saarbrucken Germany.jpg|thumb|1890: Gustav Ermann, a Jewish soldier in the German [[Wilhelm the second|Kaiser]]'s army, born in [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]]]\n[[File:Azannes WWI German Cemetery 2.jpg|thumb|The headstones of the fallen Jewish soldiers who fought for Germany in World War I were removed during World War II, and were later replaced.

From August to October 1819, pogroms that came to be known as the [[Hep-Hep riots]] took place throughout Germany. Jewish property was destroyed, and many Jews were killed.\n\nDuring this time, many German states stripped Jews of their civil rights. In the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], only 12 Jewish couples were allowed to marry each year, and the 400,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]] the city's Jewish community had paid in 1811 for its emancipation was forfeited. After the [[Rhineland]] reverted to Prussian control, Jews lost the rights Napoleon had granted them, were banned from certain professions, and the few who had been appointed to public office before the [[Napoleonic Wars]] were dismissed.<ref>Elon, Amos: ''The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany, 1743\u20131933''</ref> Throughout numerous German states, Jews had their rights to work, settle, and marry restricted. Without special letters of protection, Jews were banned from many different professions, and often had to resort to jobs considered unrespectable, such as peddling or cattle dealing, to survive. A Jewish man who wanted to marry had to purchase a registration certificate, known as a ''Matrikel'', proving he was in a \"respectable\" trade or profession. A ''Matrikel'', which could cost up to 1,000 gulden, was usually restricted to firstborn sons.<ref name=history>Sachar, Howard M.: ''A History of the Jews in America'' \u2013 Vintage Books</ref> As a result, most Jewish men were unable to legally marry. Throughout Germany, Jews were heavily taxed, and were sometimes discriminated against by gentile craftsmen.\n\nAs a result, many German Jews began to emigrate. The emigration was encouraged by German-Jewish newspapers.<ref name=history /> At first, most emigrants were young, single men from small towns and villages. A smaller number of single women also emigrated. Individual family members would emigrate alone, and then send for family members once they had earned enough money. Emigration eventually swelled, with some German Jewish communities losing up to 70% of their members. At one point, a German-Jewish newspaper reported that all the young Jewish males in the Franconian towns of Hagenbach, [[Ottingen]], and [[Warnbach]] had emigrated or were about to emigrate.<ref name=history /> The [[United States]] was the primary destination for emigrating German Jews.\n\nThe [[Revolutions of 1848]] swung the pendulum back towards freedom for the Jews. A noted reform rabbi of that time was [[Leopold Zunz]], a contemporary and friend of [[Heinrich Heine]]. In 1871, with the unification of Germany by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], came their emancipation, but the growing mood of despair among assimilated Jews was reinforced by the antisemitic penetrations of politics. In the 1870s, antisemitism was fueled by the [[Panic of 1873|financial crisis]] and scandals; in the 1880s by the arrival of masses of ''[[Ostjuden]]'', fleeing from Russian territories; by the 1890s it was a parliamentary presence, threatening anti-Jewish laws. In 1879 the Hamburg anarchist pamphleteer [[Wilhelm Marr]] introduced the term 'anti-Semitism' into the political vocabulary by founding the [[Anti-Semitic League]].<ref>{{cite book|authorlink =Paul Johnson (writer)|first =Paul|last= Johnson|title = A History of the Jews|page = 395|publisher = Harper Collins|date= 2009|isbn = 9780061828096}}</ref> Antisemites of the ''[[v\u00f6lkisch movement]]'' were the first to describe themselves as such, because they viewed Jews as part of a Semitic race that could never be properly assimilated into German society. Such was the ferocity of the anti-Jewish feeling of the v\u00f6lkisch movement that by 1900, ''anti-Semitic'' had entered German to describe anyone who had anti-Jewish feelings. However, despite massive protests and petitions, the v\u00f6lkisch movement failed to persuade the government to revoke Jewish emancipation, and in the 1912 Reichstag elections, the parties with v\u00f6lkisch-movement sympathies suffered a temporary defeat.\n\nJews experienced a period of legal equality after 1848. Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg passed the legislation that gave the Jews complete equality before the law in 1861\u201364. The newly formed German Empire did the same in 1871.<ref>V. R. Berghahn, ''Imperial Germany, 1871\u20131914: Economy, Society, Culture, and Politics'' (1994) p 102</ref> Historian [[Fritz Stern]] concludes that by 1900, what had emerged was a Jewish-German symbiosis, where German Jews had merged elements of German and Jewish culture into a unique new one. Marriages between Jews and non-Jews became somewhat common from the 19th century; for example, the wife of German Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] was Jewish. However, opportunity for high appointments in the military, the diplomatic service, judiciary or senior bureaucracy was very small.<ref>Berghahn, ''Imperial Germany, 1871\u20131914'' (1994) pp 105-6</ref> Some historians believe that with emancipation the Jewish people lost their roots in their culture and began only using German culture. However, other historians including Marion A. Kaplan, argue that it was the opposite and Jewish women were the initiators of balancing both Jewish and German culture during Imperial Germany.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Assimilation and Community|last=Kaplan|first=Marion|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Cambridge, New York|pages=200\u2013212}}</ref> Jewish women played a key role in keeping the Jewish communities in tune with the changing society that was evoked by the Jews being emancipation. Jewish women were the catalyst of modernization within the Jewish community. The years 1870-1918 marked the shift in the women's role in society. Their job in the past had been housekeeping and raising children. Now, however, they began to contribute to the home financially. Jewish mothers were the only tool families had to linking Judaism with German culture. They felt it was their job to raise children that would fit in with bourgeois Germany. Women had to balance enforcing German traditions while also preserving Jewish traditions. Women were in charge of keeping kosher and the Sabbath; as well as, teaching their children German speech and dressing them in German clothing. Jewish women attempted to create an exterior presence of German while maintaining the Jewish lifestyle inside their homes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the history of the German Empire, there were various divisions within the German Jewish community over its future; in religious terms, Orthodox Jews sought to keep to Jewish religious tradition, while liberal Jews sought to \"modernise\" their communities by shifting from liturgical traditions to organ music and German-language prayers.\n\nThe Jewish population grew from 512,000 in 1871 to 615,000 in 1910, including 79,000 recent immigrants from Russia, just under one percent of the total. About 15,000 Jews converted to Christianity between 1871 and 1909.<ref>Berghahn, ''Imperial Germany, 1871\u20131914''  (1994) p 102-3</ref> The typical attitude of German liberals towards Jews was that they were in Germany to stay and were capable of being assimilated; anthropologist and politician Rudolf Virchow summarised this position, saying \"The Jews are simply here. You cannot strike them dead.\" This position, however, did not tolerate cultural differences between Jews and non-Jews, advocating instead eliminating this difference.<ref>Zimmerman, Andrew. Anthropology and antihumanism in imperial Germany. University of Chicago Press, 2010, p.292</ref>\n\n=== World War I ===\nA higher percentage of [[German Jewish military personnel of World War I|German Jews fought in World War I]] than of any other ethnic, religious or political group in Germany; some 12,000 died for their country.<ref>[http://www.germanjewishsoldiers.com/introduction.php ''\"Die J\u00fcdischen Gefallenen\"'' (The Jewish war dead)] A roll of honor commemorating the 12,000 German Jews who died for their fatherland in World War I\"</ref><ref>Bryan Mark Rigg.

Approximately 2,000 Jews became military officers and 1,200 became medical officers.\"</ref>\n\nMany German Jews supported the war out of patriotism; like many Germans, they viewed Germany's actions as defensive in nature and even left-liberal Jews believed Germany was responding to the actions of other countries, particularly Russia. For many Jews it was never a question as to whether or not they would stand behind Germany, it was simply a given that they would. The fact that the enemy was Russia also gave an additional reason for German Jews to support the war; Tsarist Russia was regarded as the oppressor in the eyes of German Jews for its [[pogroms]] and for many German Jews, the war against Russia would become a sort of holy war. While there was partially a desire for vengeance, for many Jews ensuring Russia's Jewish population was saved from a life of servitude was equally important - one German-Jewish publication stated \"We are fighting to protect our holy fatherland, to rescue European culture and to liberate our brothers in the east.\"<ref>Grady, Timothy L.

The main Jewish organisation in Germany, the Central Association of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith, declared unconditional support for the war and when 5 August was declared by the Kaiser to be a day of patriotic prayer, synagogues across Germany surged with visitors and filled with patriotic prayers and nationalistic speeches.<ref>Grady, Timothy L. A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War. Yale University Press, 2017, p.26</ref>\n\nWhile going to war brought the unsavoury prospect fighting fellow Jews in Russia, France and Britain, for the majority of Jews this severing of ties with Jewish communities in the Entente was accepted part of their spiritual mobilisation for war. After all, the conflict also pitted German Catholics and Protestants against their fellow believers in the east and west. Indeed, for some Jews the fact that Jews were going to war with one another was proof of the normality of German-Jewish life; they could no longer be considered a minority with transnational loyalties but loyal German citizens. German Jews often broke ties with Jews of other countries; the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle, a French organisation that was dedicated to protecting Jewish rights, saw a German Jewish member quit once the war started, declaring that he could not, as a German, belong to a society that was under French leadership.<ref>Grady, Timothy L. A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War. Yale University Press, 2017, p.33</ref> German Jews supported German colonial ambitions in Africa and Eastern Europe, out of the desire to increase German power and to rescue Eastern European Jews from Tsarist rule. The eastern advance became important for German Jews because it combined German military superiority with rescuing Eastern Jews from Russian brutality; Russian antisemitism and pogroms had only worsened as the war dragged on.<ref name=\"Crim, Brian E 2018\">Crim, Brian E. \"A Deadly Legacy: German Jews and the Great War.\" (2018): 295-297.</ref><ref>Grady, Timothy L.

Many were repelled by Eastern Jews, who dressed and behaved differently, as well as being much more religiously devout. Victor Klemperer, a German Jew working for military censors, stated \"No, I did not belong to these people, even if one proved my blood relation to them a hundred times over...I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German.\" This was a common attitude amongst ethnic Germans however; during the invasion of Russia the territories the Germans overran seemed backwards and primitive, thus for many Germans their experiences in Russia simply reinforced their national self-concept.<ref>Strachan, Hew.

There was some violence against German Jews in the early years of the Weimar Republic, and it was led by the paramilitary [[Freikorps]]. ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1920), a [[forgery]] which claimed that Jews were taking over the world, was widely circulated. The second half of the 1920s were prosperous, and antisemitism was much less noticeable. When the Great Depression hit in 1929, it surged again as [[Adolf Hitler]] and his [[Nazi party]] promoted a virulent strain.\n\nAuthor Jay Howard Geller says that four possible responses were available to the German Jewish community. The majority of German Jews were only nominally religious and they saw their Jewish identity as only one of several identities; they opted for bourgeois liberalism and assimilation into all phases of German culture. A second group (especially recent migrants from eastern Europe) embraced Judaism and [[Zionism]]. A third group of left-wing elements endorsed the universalism of [[Marxism]], which downplayed ethnicity and antisemitism. A fourth group contained some who embraced hardcore [[German nationalism]] and minimized or hid their Jewish heritage. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, a fifth option was seized upon by hundreds of thousands: escape into exile, typically at the cost of leaving all wealth behind.<ref>Jay Howard Geller, \"The Scholem Brothers and the Paths of German Jewry, 1914-1939,\" ''Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies'' .

Seventeen German citizens were awarded Nobel prizes during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u20131933), five of whom were Jewish scientists. The German-Jewish literary magazine, ''[[Der Morgen (magazine)|Der Morgen]]'', was established in 1925.

In a 1997 interview, Mommsen was quoted as saying:\n\n<blockquote>One should differentiate between the cultural antisemitism symptomatic of the German conservatives\u2014found especially in the German officer corps and the high civil administration\u2014and mainly directed against the Eastern Jews on the one hand, and ''v\u00f6lkisch'' antisemitism on the other. The conservative variety functions, as Shulamit Volkov has pointed out, as something of a \"cultural code.\" This variety of German antisemitism later on played a significant role insofar as it prevented the functional elite from distancing itself from the repercussions of racial antisemitism. Thus, there was almost no relevant protest against the Jewish persecution on the part of the generals or the leading groups within the ''Reich'' government. This is especially true with respect to Hitler's proclamation of the \"racial annihilation war\" against the Soviet Union.\n\nBesides conservative antisemitism, there existed in Germany a rather silent anti-Judaism within the Catholic Church, which had a certain impact on immunizing the Catholic population against the escalating persecution. The famous protest of the Catholic Church against the euthanasia program was, therefore, not accompanied by any protest against the Holocaust.<br /><br /> The third and most vitriolic variety of antisemitism in Germany (and elsewhere) is the so-called ''v\u00f6lkisch'' antisemitism or racism, and this is the foremost advocate of using violence.<ref>{{cite web|last = Mommsen|first = Hans|title = Interview with Hans Mommsen|publisher = Yad Vashem|date = December 12, 1997| url =http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%203850.pdf|accessdate = 2010-02-06}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1933, persecution of the Jews became an active [[Nazism|Nazi]] policy, but at first laws were not as rigorously obeyed or as devastating as in later years. Such clauses, known as [[Aryan paragraph]]s, had been postulated previously by antisemitism and enacted in many private organizations.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14468, Berlin, NS-Boykott gegen j\u00fcdische Gesch\u00e4fte.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycott]] of April 1, 1933]]\nThe continuing and exacerbating abuse of Jews in Germany triggered calls throughout March 1933 by Jewish leaders around world for a [[Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933|boycott of German products]]. The Nazis responded with further bans and [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycotts]] against Jewish doctors, shops, lawyers and stores. Only six days later, the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] was passed, banning Jews from being employed in government. This law meant that Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and upper-level positions reserved for \"[[Aryan]]\" Germans. From then on, Jews were forced to work at more menial positions, beneath non-Jews, pushing them to more labored positions.\n\nThe Civil Service Law reached immediately into the education system because university professors, for example, were civil servants. While the majority of the German intellectual classes were not thoroughgoing National Socialists,{{sfn|Friedl\u00e4nder|2007|p=59}} academia had been suffused with a \"cultured antisemitism\" since imperial times, even more so during Weimar.{{sfn|Friedl\u00e4nder|2007|p=56 n.65}} With the majority of non-Jewish professors holding such feelings about Jews, coupled with how the Nazis' outwardly appeared in the period during and after the [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]], there was little motivation to oppose the anti-Jewish measures being enacted\u2014few did, and many were actively in favor.{{sfn|Friedl\u00e4nder|2007|pp=56, 59\u201360}} According to a German professor of the history of mathematics, \"There is no doubt that most of the German mathematicians who were members of the [[German Mathematical Society|professional organization]] collaborated with the Nazis, and did nothing to save or help their Jewish colleagues.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Aderet |first= Ofer |date= 25 November 2011 |title= Setting the record straight about Jewish mathematicians in Nazi Germany |url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/setting-the-record-straight-about-Jewish-mathematicians-in-nazi-germany-1.397629 |newspaper= [[Haaretz]] |accessdate= 19 September 2012 |quote= Except for a few individual cases, the mathematical society didn't care about the Jews.

No new president was appointed; with Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany, he took control of the office of [[F\u00fchrer]]. This, and a tame government with no opposition parties, allowed [[Adolf Hitler]] totalitarian control of law-making. The army also swore an oath of loyalty personally to Hitler, giving him power over the military; this position allowed him to enforce his beliefs further by creating more pressure on the Jews than ever before.\n\nIn 1935 and 1936, the pace of persecution of the Jews increased. In May 1935, Jews were forbidden to join the [[Wehrmacht]] (Armed Forces), and that year, anti-Jewish propaganda appeared in Nazi German shops and restaurants. The [[Nuremberg Racial Purity Laws]] were passed around the time of the Nazi rallies at Nuremberg; on September 15, 1935, the [[Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor]] was passed, preventing [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews]]. At the same time the [[Reich Citizenship Law]] was passed and was reinforced in November by a decree, stating that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens (''Reichsb\u00fcrger'') of their own country. Their official status became ''Reichsangeh\u00f6riger'', \"subject of the state\". This meant that they had no basic civil rights, such as that to vote, but at this time the right to vote for the non-Jewish Germans only meant the obligation to vote for the Nazi party. This removal of basic citizens' rights preceded harsher laws to be passed in the future against Jews. The drafting of the Nuremberg Laws is often attributed to [[Hans Globke]].\n\nIn 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from exerting any influence in education, politics, higher education and industry. Because of this, there was nothing to stop the anti-Jewish actions which spread across the Nazi-German economy.\n\nAfter the [[Night of the Long Knives]], the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) became the dominant policing power in Germany. Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]] was eager to please Hitler and so willingly obeyed his orders. Since the SS had been Hitler's personal bodyguard, its members were far more loyal and skilled than those of the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) had been. Because of this, they were also supported, though distrusted, by the army, which was now more willing to agree with Hitler's decisions than when the SA was dominant.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} All of this allowed Hitler more direct control over government and political attitude towards Jews in Nazi Germany. In 1937 and 1938, new laws were implemented, and the segregation of Jews from the true \"Aryan\" German population was started. In particular, Jews were penalized financially for their perceived racial status.\n\nOn June 4, 1937, two young German Jews, [[Helmut Hirsch]] and Isaac Utting, were both executed for being involved in a plot to bomb the Nazi party headquarters in Nuremberg.\n\nAs of March 1, 1938, government contracts could no longer be awarded to Jewish businesses. On September 30, \"Aryan\" doctors could only treat \"Aryan\" patients. Provision of medical care to Jews was already hampered by the fact that Jews were banned from being doctors or having any professional jobs.\n\n[[File:German Jewish Passport.jpg|thumb|German Jewish passports could be used to leave, but not to return.]]\nBeginning August 17, 1938, Jews with first names of non-Jewish origin had to add Israel<!-- No offset with italics or quotation marks needed--> (males) or Sarah<!-- No offset with italics or quotation marks needed--> (females) to their names, and a large J was to be imprinted on their passports beginning October 5. On November 15 Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been forced to sell out to the Nazi German government. This further reduced Jews' rights as human beings. They were in many ways officially separated from the German populace.\n\n[[File:Nurembergsynagoguec.jpg|left|thumb|Synagogue at [[Nuremberg]], c. 1890\u20131900. The structure was destroyed in 1938.]]\nThe increasingly [[totalitarian]], [[militarism|militaristic]] regime which was being imposed on Germany by Hitler allowed him to control the actions of the SS and the military. On November 7, 1938, a young Polish Jew, [[Herschel Grynszpan]], attacked and shot two German officials in the Nazi German embassy in Paris. (Grynszpan was angry about the treatment of his parents by the Nazi Germans.) On November 9 the German Attache, [[Ernst vom Rath]], died. Goebbels issued instructions that demonstrations against Jews were to be organized and undertaken in retaliation throughout Germany. The SS ordered the Night of Broken Glass ([[Kristallnacht]]) to be carried out that night, November 9\u201310, 1938. The storefronts of Jewish shops and offices were smashed and vandalized, and many synagogues were destroyed by fire. Approximately 91 Jews were killed, and another 30,000 arrested, mostly able bodied males, all of whom were sent to the newly formed concentration camps. In the following 3 months some 2,000\u20132,500 of them died in the concentration camps, the rest were released under the condition that they leave Germany. Many Germans were disgusted by this action when the full extent of the damage was discovered, so Hitler ordered that it be blamed on the Jews. Collectively, the Jews were made to pay back one billion [[Reichsmark]] (equivalent to {{Inflation|DE|1|1938}} billion {{Inflation-year|DE}} euros) in damages, the fine being raised by confiscating 20 per cent of every Jewish property. The Jews also had to repair all damages at their own cost.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E03468, Berlin, Emigration von Juden, Umzugswagen.jpg|thumb|Jews emigrating from Berlin to the United States, 1939]]\nIncreasing antisemitism prompted a wave of Jewish mass emigration from Germany throughout the 1930s. Among the first wave were intellectuals, politically active individuals, and Zionists.  However, as Nazi legislation worsened the Jews' situation, more Jews wished to leave Germany, with a panicked rush in the months after [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938.\n\nPalestine was a popular destination for German Jewish emigration. Soon after the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, they negotiated the [[Haavara Agreement]] with [[Zionism|Zionist]] authorities in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], which was signed on August 25, 1933. Under its terms, 60,000 German Jews were to be allowed to emigrate to Palestine and take $100 million in assets with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transferagreement.com/|title=Transfer Agreement - Home Page|website=www.transferagreement.com}}</ref> During the [[Fifth Aliyah]], between 1929 and 1939, a total of 250,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine\u2014more than 55,000 of them from Germany, Austria, or Bohemia.  Many of them were doctors, lawyers, engineers, architects, and other professionals, who contributed greatly to the development of the Yishuv.\n\nThe [[United States]] was another destination for German Jews seeking to leave the country, though the number allowed to immigrate was restricted due to the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. Between 1933 and 1939, more than 300,000 Germans, of whom about 90% were Jews, applied for immigration visas to the United States. By 1940, only 90,000 German Jews had been granted visas and allowed to settle in the United States. Some 100,000 German Jews also moved to Western European countries, especially [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]]. However, these countries would later be occupied by Germany, and most of them would still fall victim to [[the Holocaust]]. Another 48,000 emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]] and other European countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/stlouis/teach/supread.htm |title=Teacher Resources |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=2013-04-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402175330/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/stlouis/teach/supread.htm |archivedate=April 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005139 |title= Refugees |publisher=Ushmm.org}}</ref>\n\n== The Holocaust in Germany ==\n{{Main|The Holocaust}}\n[[File:Deportation of Jews from W\u00fcrzburg to the Lublin district, 25 April 1942 (USHMM 46207).jpg|thumb|Jews are deported from [[W\u00fcrzburg]] to the [[Lublin Reservation|Lublin district]] of [[Poland]], 25 April 1942]]\nOverall, of the 522,000 Jews living in Germany in January 1933, approximately 304,000 emigrated during the first six years of Nazi rule and about 214,000 were left on the eve of World War II.

Especially during the time of the [[Black Death]] from 1348 to 1350 hatred and violence against Jews increased. Approximately 72% of towns with a Jewish settlement suffered from violent attacks against the Jewish population.\n\nAfter World War I Antisemitism grew again, during the time of the Weimar Republic and later on during the Nazi reign.\n\nRegions that suffered from the [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|Black Death pogroms]] were 6 times more likely to engage in anti-Semitic violence during the 1920s, the Nazi parties like the [[German National People's Party|DNVP]], [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] and [[German V\u00f6lkisch Freedom Party|DVFP]] gained a 1.5 times higher voting share in the 1928 election, their inhabitants wrote more letters to anti-Semitic newspapers like \u201c[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]\u201d, and they deported more Jews during the Nazi reign.

Additionally, approximately 15,000 German Jews survived the concentration camps or survived by going into hiding. These German Jews were joined by approximately 200,000 [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|displaced persons (DPs)]], Eastern European Jewish Holocaust survivors. They came to Allied-occupied western Germany after finding no homes left for them in eastern Europe or after having been liberated on German soil. The overwhelming majority of the DPs wished to emigrate to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and lived in Allied- and U.N.-administered refugee camps, remaining isolated from German society. When [[Israel]] became independent in 1948, most European-Jewish DPs left for the new state; however, 10,000 to 15,000 Jews decided to resettle in Germany. Despite hesitations and a long history of antagonism between German Jews (''[[Yekke]]s'') and East European Jews (''Ostjuden''), the two disparate groups united to form the basis of a new Jewish community. In 1950 they founded their unitary representative organization, the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]].\n\n=== Jews of West Germany ===\nThe Jewish community in [[West Germany]] from the 1950s to the 1970s was characterized by its social conservatism and generally private nature. Although there were Jewish elementary schools in West Berlin, [[Frankfurt]], and [[Munich]], the community had a very high average age. Few young adults chose to remain in Germany, and many of those who did married non-Jews. Many critics{{who|date=February 2016}} of the community and its leadership accused it of ossification. In the 1980s, a college for Jewish studies was established in [[Heidelberg]]; however, a disproportionate number of its students were not Jewish. By 1990, the community numbered between 30,000 and 40,000. Although the Jewish community of Germany did not have the same impact as the pre-1933 community, some Jews were prominent in German public life, including [[Hamburg]] mayor [[Herbert Weichmann]]; [[Schleswig-Holstein]] Minister of Justice (and Deputy Chief Justice of the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]]) [[Rudolf Katz]]; [[Hesse]] Attorney General [[Fritz Bauer]]; former Hesse Minister of Economics Heinz-Herbert Karry; West Berlin politician Jeanette Wolff; television personalities [[Hugo Egon Balder]], [[Hans Rosenthal]], [[Ilja Richter]], [[Inge Meysel]], and [[Michel Friedman]]; Jewish communal leaders [[Heinz Galinski]], [[Ignatz Bubis]], [[Paul Spiegel]], and [[Charlotte Knobloch]] (see: [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]]), and Germany's most influential literary critic, [[Marcel Reich-Ranicki]].\n\n=== Jews of East Germany ===\nThe Jewish community of communist [[East Germany]] numbered only a few hundred active members. Most Jews who settled in East Germany did so either because their pre-1933 homes had been there or because they had been politically leftist before the Nazi seizure of power and, after 1945, wished to build an antifascist, socialist Germany. Most such politically engaged Jews were not religious or active in the official Jewish community. They included writers such as [[Anna Seghers]], [[Stefan Heym]], [[Stephan Hermlin]], [[Jurek Becker]], [[Stasi]] Colonel General [[Markus Wolf]], singer [[Lin Jaldati]], composer [[Hanns Eisler]], and politician [[Gregor Gysi]].
