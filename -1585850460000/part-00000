The exhibition showed around 50 paintings, sculptures, wall drawings, neon works and text pieces by the artist, covering everything from his sculptures to digital works. One of his works called ''On the Table'' (1970) involved four metal buckets suspended on a table, exemplifying the influence of [[Minimalism]] and [[Conceptualism]] on Craig-Martin. ''[[An Oak Tree]]'' (1973), consisting of \"an ordinary glass of water on an equally plain shelf, accompanied by a text in which Craig-Martin asserts the supremacy of the artist's intention over the object itself ... is now widely regarded as a turning point in the development of conceptual art\".<ref>{{citation|title=Michael Craig-Martin at the Irish Museum of Modern Art|publisher=ARTINFO|date=5 October 2006|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/21219/michael-craig-martin-at-the-irish-museum-of-modern-art|accessdate=23 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Craig-Martin's exhibition \"Transience\" at the [[Serpentine Galleries]] brought together works from 1981 to 2015, including representations of once familiar yet obsolete technology;

In various contexts the Acalyptratae also are referred to informally as the '''[[Schizophora|acalyptrate muscoids]]''', or '''acalyptrates''', as opposed to the [[Calyptratae]]. All forms of the name refer to the lack of [[calypter]]s in the members of this subsection of flies. An alternative name, '''Acalypterae''' is current, though in minority usage. It was first used by [[Justin Pierre Marie Macquart]] in 1835 for a section of his tribe Muscides; he used it to refer to all acalyptrates plus [[Scathophagidae|scathophagids]] and [[Phoridae|phorids]], but excluding [[Conopidae]].\n\nThe confusing forms of the names stem from their first usage; ''Acalyptratae'' and ''Acalyptrata'' actually are adjectival forms in [[New Latin]].

He read Botany at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] and in 1947 moved to the [[University College of Wales]], first as a research student in Aberystwyth and then as a lecturer in the Department of\nAgricultural Botany at Bangor. There he worked on the adaptation of plants to heavy metal pollution, demonstrating the ability of natural selection to bring about rapid evolutionary changes in natural grasses, even in very localised situations.\n\nIn 1958 he accepted the Chair of Botany at the [[University of Liverpool]] where he pioneered novel ideas of restoration ecology to help recover polluted sites without the need to cover them in imported topsoil. His work on the revegetation of china clay tips in Cornwall formed the basis of the techniques behind the [[Eden Project]].\n\nIn 1982 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. He was President of the [[British Ecological Society]] for 1982\u201383 and the Inaugural President of the [[Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management]] in 1991\u201394.
