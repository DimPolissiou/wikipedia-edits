Prior to this, Friedman had played in a local band, Total Crudd. After recording three albums with the Dictators, Friedman went to France and worked for one year in [[Fabienne Shine]]'s band [[Shakin' Street (band)|Shakin' Street]]. On [[Black Sabbath]]'s ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' tour in 1980 (on which Shakin' Street were the support act), Friedman was introduced to bass player [[Joey DeMaio]] by [[Ronnie James Dio]]. Later in 1980, Friedman and DeMaio formed Manowar, with whom he recorded six albums before DeMaio asked him to leave the band after the 1988 album ''[[Kings of Metal]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=bravewords.com |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/112929 |title=> News > ROSS THE BOSS \u2013 \"I Was Kinda Fired From MANOWAR\" |publisher=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>\n\n===Timeline===\nIn 1990, Friedman joined [[Manitoba's Wild Kingdom]] with fellow Dictators Andy Shernoff and [[Handsome Dick Manitoba]].  With drummer J.P. Patterson the band released the album, \"...And You?\" to critical acclaim.  The album was in heavy rotation on MTV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobaswildkingdom.com/ALBUM.php |title=ALBUM |publisher=Manitobaswildkingdom.com |date=March 14, 1990 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Friedman had a blues rock band called \"Heyday\" and in 1999 CMC records released the Spinatras album, \"@Midnight.com\", a band whom Friedman has described as \"The Dictators meet Cheap Trick\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crushermagazine.com/features9_08/featross_the_boss.htm |title=Ross the Boss Band |publisher=Crushermagazine.com |accessdate=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929221319/http://www.crushermagazine.com/features9_08/featross_the_boss.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Dictators started playing again in 1996, touring heavily.  In 2001, with original rhythm guitar player [[Scott Kempner]] now back in the fold, the band released their album \"D.F.F.D.\" which they then toured to support in the US and Europe. A resulting live album was released from the European tour, entitled \"[[Viva Dictators]]\".\n\nIn 2004 Friedman joined [[Albert Bouchard]], the original drummer for [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], in his band [[Brain Surgeons]]. He also recorded an instrumental album with Dictators drummer JP Thunderbolt Patterson, called \"Thunderboss\"\n\nIn July 2005, Friedman joined [[Manowar]] onstage at the [[Earthshaker Festival]]; performing \"Metal Daze\" and \"Dark Avenger\" with them. At the end of the concert, he also performed \"[[Battle Hymn (Manowar song)|Battle Hymn]]\", with other past and present members of Manowar.\n\nIn April 2006, he played one night of early Manowar music at the Keep It True VI Festival in Germany, backed by German Manowar cover band [[Men Of War (cover band)|Men of War]], featuring members of German groups [[Ivory Night]] and [[Divinus]].  That band (later changed name to Ross the Boss or \"The RTB Band\") went on to play some more festivals in Germany, Italy and Greece and then began working on new original material.\n\nIn August 2006, Thunderboss was released on Poptown Records. Thunderboss was written and arranged by J.P. Thunderbolt Patterson and featured Friedman on all 11 tracks. The CD met with some critical acclaim, but was not successful enough to keep Friedman interested in the project, so there was no supporting tour.\n\nIn October 2006, Friedman and The Dictators played Friday and Saturday nights of the closing weekend at punk rock venue [[CBGB]]s, one of the clubs where they got their start.\n\n2007 started off with an eleven city tour of Spain with JP Patterson and their Spanish super-band \"The Thunderbolts\" which also includes members of Bummer and [[Sex Museum]].\n\nFriedman guested on former band-mate [[Fabienne Shine]]'s 2007 LP, [[Wotan (band)|Wotan]]'s LP \"Epos\" where he played Grand Piano on one track, and [[Atlantean Kodex]]'s 2007 EP.\n\nFriedman's 2008 included an appearance with Manitoba's Wild Kingdom at the 2008 Joey Ramone Birthday Bash, performances with Shakin' Street at the Sweden Rock Festival, and a few tour dates in Spain with The Dictators. He released a new album in August with his German Metal Band under the name \"Ross the Boss\" called \"[[New Metal Leader]]\" which debuted at #99 in the German Album charts.  The following month he appeared on ''Inner Demons'', the 2nd CD by New Jersey metallers [http://www.skullshifter.com Skullshifter], playing lead guitar on the track \"Etched in Sand\".\n\nIn August 2009, Friedman debuted his \"Ross the Boss\" band in the US at the [[Brooklyn]], New York venue Europa, to favorable reviews.<ref>[http://piercingmetal.com/ross-the-boss-raven-club-europa-8282009/ www.PiercingMetal.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn November 2010, Friedman and his German Metal Band released the followup to \"[[New Metal Leader]]\", \"[[hailstorm 2010|Hailstorm]]\", which received 4.5 out of 5 stars on AllMusic.com.<ref>{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Phil |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hailstorm-r2047038/review |title=Hailstorm \u2013 Ross the Boss |publisher=AllMusic |date=November 9, 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, Friedman was a special guest at the 11th Annual [[Joey Ramone]] Birthday Bash in New York city, performing, among other songs, \"Stop Thinking About It\" with fellow Dictator [[Andy Shernoff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islpr.com/wordpress/?p=36 |title=ISL Public Relations \" Blog Archive \" 2011 JOEY RAMONE BIRTHDAY BASH DETAILS UNVEILED; 10 YEARS AFTER HIS PASSING, THE PUNK-ROCK LEGEND LIVES ON |publisher=Islpr.com |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>\n\nIn June, Friedman was invited to co-headline Venezuela's Gillmanfest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gillmanfest.com.ve/cabimas/ |title=Gillmanfest Cabimas 2011 |publisher=Gillmanfest.com.ve |accessdate=2011-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625141919/http://gillmanfest.com.ve/cabimas/ |archive-date=June 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the coming months with the Ross the Boss band he performed at several festivals in Europe, including Masters of Rock in the Czech Republic.\n\nFriedman also owns and manages a small business called \"The Cage Baseball NYC.\" He runs \"The Cage\" with his wife and son. His son teaches classes at \"The Cage,\" while his wife runs the clinics and manages the business when Friedman is on tour.\n\nIn early 2012 vocalist Sean Peck, guitarists Friedman and Stu Marshall, bassist Mike Davis and drummer Rhino formed a metal supergroup, [[Death Dealer (band)|Death Dealer]]. Death Dealer began as an online collaboration between Marshall and Peck. All they needed to tell Friedman about the project to get him on board was that Rhino was on drums. Although Friedman and Rhino are both former members of Manowar, they'd only ever played together for one song at the Earthshaker Festival in 2005. They both had always meant to do something together. In June 2013, [[Death Dealer (band)|Death Dealer]] released a full-length studio album called [[War Master (Death Dealer Album)|War Master]].

Prior to this, Friedman had played in a local band, Total Crudd. After recording three albums with the Dictators, Friedman went to France and worked for one year in [[Fabienne Shine]]'s band [[Shakin' Street (band)|Shakin' Street]]. On [[Black Sabbath]]'s ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' tour in 1980 (on which Shakin' Street were the support act), Friedman was introduced to bass player [[Joey DeMaio]] by [[Ronnie James Dio]]. Later in 1980, Friedman and DeMaio formed Manowar, with whom he recorded six albums before DeMaio asked him to leave the band after the 1988 album ''[[Kings of Metal]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=bravewords.com |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/112929 |title=> News > ROSS THE BOSS \u2013 \"I Was Kinda Fired From MANOWAR\" |publisher=Bravewords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>\n\n===Timeline===\nIn 1990, Friedman joined [[Manitoba's Wild Kingdom]] with fellow Dictators Andy Shernoff and [[Handsome Dick Manitoba]].

In 2001, with original rhythm guitar player [[Scott Kempner]] now back in the fold, the band released their album \"D.F.F.D.\" which they then toured to support in the US and Europe. A resulting live album was released from the European tour, entitled \"[[Viva Dictators]]\".\n\nIn 2004 Friedman joined [[Albert Bouchard]], the original drummer for [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], in his band [[Brain Surgeons]]. He also recorded an instrumental album with Dictators drummer JP Thunderbolt Patterson, called \"Thunderboss\"\n\nIn July 2005, Friedman joined [[Manowar]] onstage at the [[Earthshaker Festival]]; performing \"Metal Daze\" and \"Dark Avenger\" with them. At the end of the concert, he also performed \"[[Battle Hymn (Manowar song)|Battle Hymn]]\", with other past and present members of Manowar.\n\nIn April 2006, he played one night of early Manowar music at the Keep It True VI Festival in Germany, backed by German Manowar cover band [[Men Of War (cover band)|Men of War]], featuring members of German groups [[Ivory Night]] and [[Divinus]].  That band (later changed name to Ross the Boss or \"The RTB Band\") went on to play some more festivals in Germany, Italy and Greece and then began working on new original material.\n\nIn August 2006, Thunderboss was released on Poptown Records. Thunderboss was written and arranged by J.P. Thunderbolt Patterson and featured Friedman on all 11 tracks. The CD met with some critical acclaim, but was not successful enough to keep Friedman interested in the project, so there was no supporting tour.\n\nIn October 2006, Friedman and The Dictators played Friday and Saturday nights of the closing weekend at punk rock venue [[CBGB]]s, one of the clubs where they got their start.\n\n2007 started off with an eleven city tour of Spain with JP Patterson and their Spanish super-band \"The Thunderbolts\" which also includes members of Bummer and [[Sex Museum]].\n\nFriedman guested on former band-mate [[Fabienne Shine]]'s 2007 LP, [[Wotan (band)|Wotan]]'s LP \"Epos\" where he played Grand Piano on one track, and [[Atlantean Kodex]]'s 2007 EP.\n\nFriedman's 2008 included an appearance with Manitoba's Wild Kingdom at the 2008 Joey Ramone Birthday Bash, performances with Shakin' Street at the Sweden Rock Festival, and a few tour dates in Spain with The Dictators. He released a new album in August with his German Metal Band under the name \"Ross the Boss\" called \"[[New Metal Leader]]\" which debuted at #99 in the German Album charts.  The following month he appeared on ''Inner Demons'', the 2nd CD by New Jersey metallers [http://www.skullshifter.com Skullshifter], playing lead guitar on the track \"Etched in Sand\".\n\nIn August 2009, Friedman debuted his \"Ross the Boss\" band in the US at the [[Brooklyn]], New York venue Europa, to favorable reviews.<ref>[http://piercingmetal.com/ross-the-boss-raven-club-europa-8282009/ www.PiercingMetal.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn November 2010, Friedman and his German Metal Band released the followup to \"[[New Metal Leader]]\", \"[[hailstorm 2010|Hailstorm]]\", which received 4.5 out of 5 stars on AllMusic.com.<ref>{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Phil |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hailstorm-r2047038/review |title=Hailstorm \u2013 Ross the Boss |publisher=AllMusic |date=November 9, 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, Friedman was a special guest at the 11th Annual [[Joey Ramone]] Birthday Bash in New York city, performing, among other songs, \"Stop Thinking About It\" with fellow Dictator [[Andy Shernoff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islpr.com/wordpress/?p=36 |title=ISL Public Relations \" Blog Archive \" 2011 JOEY RAMONE BIRTHDAY BASH DETAILS UNVEILED; 10 YEARS AFTER HIS PASSING, THE PUNK-ROCK LEGEND LIVES ON |publisher=Islpr.com |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>\n\nIn June, Friedman was invited to co-headline Venezuela's Gillmanfest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gillmanfest.com.ve/cabimas/ |title=Gillmanfest Cabimas 2011 |publisher=Gillmanfest.com.ve |accessdate=2011-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625141919/http://gillmanfest.com.ve/cabimas/ |archive-date=June 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the coming months with the Ross the Boss band he performed at several festivals in Europe, including Masters of Rock in the Czech Republic.\n\nFriedman also owns and manages a small business called \"The Cage Baseball NYC.\" He runs \"The Cage\" with his wife and son. His son teaches classes at \"The Cage,\" while his wife runs the clinics and manages the business when Friedman is on tour.\n\nIn early 2012 vocalist Sean Peck, guitarists Friedman and Stu Marshall, bassist Mike Davis and drummer Rhino formed a metal supergroup, [[Death Dealer (band)|Death Dealer]]. Death Dealer began as an online collaboration between Marshall and Peck. All they needed to tell Friedman about the project to get him on board was that Rhino was on drums. Although Friedman and Rhino are both former members of Manowar, they'd only ever played together for one song at the Earthshaker Festival in 2005. They both had always meant to do something together. In June 2013, [[Death Dealer (band)|Death Dealer]] released a full-length studio album called [[War Master (Death Dealer Album)|War Master]].

''The Book of the Laws of Countries: Dialogue on Fate of Bardaisan of Edessa'', Assen: Van Gorcum, 1965. pp 43-45</ref>\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest use of the word Xwedodah in Middle Persian in the inscription Kordir on the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] is in the role of [[Naqsh-e Rostam]]. New Avestan texts are x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuada\u03b8a (male) and x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuadai\u03b8\u012b (female) and the adjectives x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuada\u03b8a and x\u1d5ba\u0113tuuada\u03b8\u0101 (female). The nineteenth-century qa\u00eatvadatha style (with q instead of Avesta x) and similar writings reappear in modern literature.\n\nThe first part of the compound seems to be a \"family\" (or similar) of Khito (x\u1d5ba\u0113tu), which is generally thought to derive from the \"self\" (x\u1d5ba\u0113-) with the suffix -you (-tu-), although this is not entirely straightforward . The second part, vada\u03b8a, is nowadays generally regarded as a derivative of the verb (From * Wad-) 'resulting in marriage', related to other Iranian and Hindu European languages which refer to marriage or marriage partner (compare with ancient Indik). \"Wife\" Av. Va\u03b4\u016b; Pahlavi way\u016bg (Pers. Bayu) \"bride\"; Avestan va\u03b4ut \"one who has reached the age of marriage\"; Pahlavi way\u016bdag \"bride's room\"; \n\nThis etymology was suggested by Carl Goldner, and accepted by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] and Christian Bartholomae, and became a popular opinion among Western scholars. However, there is no * vadha- to Vedic or * vada- root in the Avesta of the vadh root; in Avesta the v\u0101\u03b4aya and upa.v\u0101\u03b4aiia- 'lead (to marry)' and uzuu\u0101\u03b4aiia are 'leaving the father's house'. vadh-Vedic, vad-Avestan should not be confused with vah-Avestan \"to take\", vaz-Avestan with the uhy\u00e1-unknown form.\n\n== Zoroastrian religious views ==\nMost of Pahlavi's texts are self-contained by [[Edward William West]]'s comments. Brief evaluations and references include Friedrich Spiegel and standard books on Zoroastrianism (such as Boyce).\n\n=== Mythology ===\nAccording to the Pahlavi texts, Ahura Mazda began his quest at the time of creation and linked human beings to each other, going through a period of mixing in which [[good and evil]] compete for supremacy, reaching the epicenter of a period in which the world Once again it will be the way that Ahura Mazda had created it.In Isna 1.6, [[Spenta Armaiti]] is said to have been the daughter of Ahura Mazda, but no details on how [[Ahura Mazda]] was her father can be found. On the other hand, it is said that Ahura Mazda was both his father and mother of creation; his mother when he was brought up in the world of thought and his father when he brought it into the world of being. Denig has said of the first manuscripts (the first humans) that the creator enjoyed the action from which all creatures were made, in which it is a word that can refer to sexual activity but is not unambiguous. Denkard says people should do it because it is clear that the creator did it when he made such creations.\n\n=== Nuclear family incest ===\nXwedodah is considered the highest act of worship. A man could marry his sister, daughter, or mother in this system.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Forrest, Satnam Mendoza.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/703621262|title=Witches, whores, and sorcerers : the concept of evil in early Iran|date=2011|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8, Prods O.|isbn=978-0-292-72687-1|edition=1st ed|location=Austin|oclc=703621262}}</ref> Zoroastrian religious text provide unequivocal evidence for the desirability and occurrence of nuclear family incest in order to \"preserve the purity of the race, to increase the compatibility of husband and wife, and to increase affection for children\"<ref name=\":1\">de Menasce, J.

The nineteenth-century qa\u00eatvadatha style (with q instead of Avesta x) and similar writings reappear in modern literature.\n\nThe first part of the compound seems to be a \"family\" (or similar) of Khito (x\u1d5ba\u0113tu), which is generally thought to derive from the \"self\" (x\u1d5ba\u0113-) with the suffix -you (-tu-), although this is not entirely straightforward . The second part, vada\u03b8a, is nowadays generally regarded as a derivative of the verb (From * Wad-) 'resulting in marriage', related to other Iranian and Hindu European languages which refer to marriage or marriage partner (compare with ancient Indik). \"Wife\" Av. Va\u03b4\u016b; Pahlavi way\u016bg (Pers. Bayu) \"bride\"; Avestan va\u03b4ut \"one who has reached the age of marriage\"; Pahlavi way\u016bdag \"bride's room\"; This etymology was suggested by Carl Goldner, and accepted by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] and Christian Bartholomae, and became a popular opinion among Western scholars. However, there is no * vadha- to Vedic or * vada- root in the Avesta of the vadh root; in Avesta the v\u0101\u03b4aya and upa.v\u0101\u03b4aiia- 'lead (to marry)' and uzuu\u0101\u03b4aiia are 'leaving the father's house'.\n\nvadh-Vedic, vad-Avestan should not be confused with vah-Avestan \"to take\", vaz-Avestan with the uhy\u00e1-unknown form.\n\n==Mythology==\nAccording to the Pahlavi texts, Ahura Mazda began his quest at the time of creation and linked human beings to each other, going through a period of mixing in which [[good and evil]] compete for supremacy, reaching the epicenter of a period in which the world Once again it will be the way that Ahura Mazda had created it.In Isna 1.6, [[Spenta Armaiti]] is said to have been the daughter of Ahura Mazda, but no details on how [[Ahura Mazda]] was her father can be found. On the other hand, it is said that Ahura Mazda was both his father and mother of creation; his mother when he was brought up in the world of thought and his father when he brought it into the world of being. Denig has said of the first manuscripts (the first humans) that the creator enjoyed the action from which all creatures were made, in which it is a word that can refer to sexual activity but is not unambiguous. Denkard says people should do it because it is clear that the creator did it when he made such creations.\n\n== Zoroastrian religious views ==\nXwedodah is considered the highest act of worship.
