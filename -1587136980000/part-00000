At that time, the party revolved around two political leaders such as [[Radu C\u00e2mpeanu]] and [[Mircea Ionescu-Quintus]], both former youth liberal leaders during the [[interwar period]] and after [[World War II]]. At the [[1990 Romanian general election|1990 general elections]], the PNL became the third largest party in Romania and its then leader, Radu C\u00e2mpeanu, finished second in the same year's presidential elections, with 10.6% of the cast votes, behind [[Ion Iliescu]].\n\nShortly afterwards, most notably alongside the [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PN\u021a-CD), but to a lesser extent also with other smaller center-right parties and NGOs, the PNL managed to form the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] (CDR) in an effort to ensemble a stronger collective opposition and alternative governing body to then ruling [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN). However, prior to the [[1992 Romanian general election|1992 general elections]], C\u00e2mpeanu decided to withdraw the party from the CDR electoral alliance and instead compete as a stand-alone political force.\n\nUltimately, this proved to be a strategic error, as the party did not manage to surpass the needed electoral threshold for parliamentary presence and as such was forced to enter extra-parliamentary opposition for the period 1992\u20131996. This also resulted in several splinter factions leaving the main party, with some PNL groups opting to remain within the CDR while others still supporting C\u00e2mpeanu's side.\n\nNevertheless, after a change of leadership that saw Ionescu-Quintus as the new party leader elected in 1995, the PNL contested the [[1996 Romanian general election|1996 general election]] as part of the CDR.<ref name=\"RoseMunro2009\">{{cite book|author1=Richard Rose|author2=Neil Munro|title=Parties and Elections in New European Democracies|year=2009|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0-9558203-2-8|pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> The 1996 general elections represented the first peaceful transition of power in post-1989 Romania, with the PNL, PN\u021a-CD, [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD), and the [[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania]] (UDMR) forming a grand coalition that pushed the PDSR (formerly the FSN) in opposition for the period 1996\u20132000. The presidency was also won by the CDR's common candidate, more specifically [[Emil Constantinescu]], who received support on behalf of all of the alliance's constituent parties (including the PNL political groups therein).\n\n=== 2000\u20132010: Opposition and second governing experiences ===\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, because of the lack of political coherence within the parties of the governing CDR coalition and the multiple changes of cabinets that followed, the PNL decided once more to withdraw from the alliance just before the [[2000 Romanian general election|2000 general elections]] and, consequently, to compete alone instead. This time, the party managed to gain parliamentary presence but failed to form another centre-right government, finishing fourth in the legislative elections and third in the presidential election.\n\nTherefore, during the mid 2000s, the PNL joined forces with the PD in order to form the [[Justice and Truth Alliance]] (DA)<ref name=\"RoseMunro2009\"/> so as to compete in the [[2004 Romanian general election|2004 general election]] as an alternative to the then ruling PSD (formerly PDSR) government. The alliance managed to finish second by popular vote in the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], subsequently form a centre-right cabinet, and also win the presidency during the same year.\n\nUntil April 2007, the PNL was the largest member of the governing Justice and Truth Alliance, which enjoyed a parliamentary majority due to an alliance between the PNL, PD, the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] (PC) and the UDMR.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Villy Tsakona|editor2=Diana Elena Popa|title=Studies in Political Humour: In Between Political Critique and Public Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uELvEqHybukC&pg=PA162|year=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-0637-6|page=162}}</ref> In April 2007, then PNL prime minister [[C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu]], who was also the party leader, formed a minority government solely with the UDMR and the remainder PD ministers were reshuffled. This cause internal opposition within the party and led to a splinter group, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Romania)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (PLD), eventually merging with the PD to form the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]] (PDL).\n\nAfter the [[2008 Romanian legislative election|2008 legislative election]] the party placed third and entered official opposition, winning 19.74% seats in the Parliament, while the new grand coalition, formed by their former enlarged ally the democrat liberals (PDL) and the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), had roughly 70%. At the [[2009 Romanian presidential election|2009 presidential election]] the National Liberal Party's then newly elected leader, [[Crin Antonescu]], finished third in the first round and the party still found itself in parliamentary opposition for the three next years to come.\n\n=== 2010\u20132020: New electoral alliances and third governing experiences ===\n\n[[File:Bucuresti, Romania, Aleea

At that time, the party revolved around two political leaders such as [[Radu C\u00e2mpeanu]] and [[Mircea Ionescu-Quintus]], both former youth liberal leaders during the [[interwar period]] and after [[World War II]]. At the [[1990 Romanian general election|1990 general elections]], the PNL became the third largest party in Romania and its then leader, Radu C\u00e2mpeanu, finished second in the same year's presidential elections, with 10.6% of the cast votes, behind [[Ion Iliescu]].\n\nShortly afterwards, most notably alongside the [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PN\u021a-CD), but to a lesser extent also with other smaller center-right parties and NGOs, the PNL managed to form the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] (CDR) in an effort to ensemble a stronger collective opposition and alternative governing body to then ruling [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN). However, prior to the [[1992 Romanian general election|1992 general elections]], C\u00e2mpeanu decided to withdraw the party from the CDR electoral alliance and instead compete as a stand-alone political force.\n\nUltimately, this proved to be a strategic error, as the party did not manage to surpass the needed electoral threshold for parliamentary presence and as such was forced to enter extra-parliamentary opposition for the period 1992\u20131996. This also resulted in several splinter factions leaving the main party, with some PNL groups opting to remain within the CDR while others still supporting C\u00e2mpeanu's side.\n\nNevertheless, after a change of leadership that saw Ionescu-Quintus as the new party leader elected in 1995, the PNL contested the [[1996 Romanian general election|1996 general election]] as part of the CDR.<ref name=\"RoseMunro2009\">{{cite book|author1=Richard Rose|author2=Neil Munro|title=Parties and Elections in New European Democracies|year=2009|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0-9558203-2-8|pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> The 1996 general elections represented the first peaceful transition of power in post-1989 Romania, with the PNL, PN\u021a-CD, [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD), and the [[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania]] (UDMR) forming a grand coalition that pushed the PDSR (formerly the FSN) in opposition for the period 1996\u20132000. The presidency was also won by the CDR's common candidate, more specifically [[Emil Constantinescu]], who received support on behalf of all of the alliance's constituent parties (including the PNL political groups therein).\n\n=== 2000\u20132010: Opposition and second governing experiences ===\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, because of the lack of political coherence within the parties of the governing CDR coalition and the multiple changes of cabinets that followed, the PNL decided once more to withdraw from the alliance just before the [[2000 Romanian general election|2000 general elections]] and, consequently, to compete alone instead. This time, the party managed to gain parliamentary presence but failed to form another centre-right government, finishing fourth in the legislative elections and third in the presidential election.\n\nTherefore, during the mid 2000s, the PNL joined forces with the PD in order to form the [[Justice and Truth Alliance]] (DA)<ref name=\"RoseMunro2009\"/> so as to compete in the [[2004 Romanian general election|2004 general election]] as an alternative to the then ruling PSD (formerly PDSR) government. The alliance managed to finish second by popular vote in the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], subsequently form a centre-right cabinet, and also win the presidency during the same year.\n\nUntil April 2007, the PNL was the largest member of the governing Justice and Truth Alliance, which enjoyed a parliamentary majority due to an alliance between the PNL, PD, the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] (PC) and the UDMR.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Villy Tsakona|editor2=Diana Elena Popa|title=Studies in Political Humour: In Between Political Critique and Public Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uELvEqHybukC&pg=PA162|year=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-0637-6|page=162}}</ref> In April 2007, then PNL prime minister [[C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu]], who was also the party leader, formed a minority government solely with the UDMR and the remainder PD ministers were reshuffled. This cause internal opposition within the party and led to a splinter group, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Romania)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (PLD), eventually merging with the PD to form the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]] (PDL).\n\nAfter the [[2008 Romanian legislative election|2008 legislative election]] the party placed third and entered official opposition, winning 19.74% seats in the Parliament, while the new grand coalition, formed by their former enlarged ally the democrat liberals (PDL) and the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), had roughly 70%. At the [[2009 Romanian presidential election|2009 presidential election]] the National Liberal Party's then newly elected leader, [[Crin Antonescu]], finished third in the first round and the party

Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, dismemberment, and flames.\n\nPicasso painted ''Guernica'' at his home in Paris in response to the [[bombing of Guernica]], a [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] [[Guernica (town)|town]] in northern [[Spain]], by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]] at the request of the Spanish [[Spain under Franco|Nationalists]].

The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief.<ref name=\"Cohen_2003\"/> The painting soon became famous and widely acclaimed, and it helped bring worldwide attention to the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n==Commission==\nIn January 1937, while Pablo Picasso was living in Paris on Rue des Grands Augustins, he was commissioned by the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] government to create a large [[mural]] for the Spanish pavilion at the [[1937 Paris World's Fair]]. Picasso, who had last visited Spain in 1934 and would never return, was the Honorary Director-in-Exile of the [[Prado Museum]].<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nPicasso worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April on the project's initial sketches, which depicted his perennial theme of an artist's studio.<ref name=\"Richardson_2016\"/> Then, immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, poet [[Juan Larrea (poet)|Juan Larrea]] visited Picasso's home to urge him to make the bombing his subject.<ref name=\"Richardson_2016\"/> Days later, on 1 May, Picasso read [[George Steer]]'s eyewitness account of the attack, which originally had been published in both ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 28 April, and abandoned his initial idea. Acting on Larrea's suggestion, Picasso began sketching a series of preliminary drawings for ''Guernica''.<ref>[[Preston, Paul]] (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOpqVkAyFkAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steer%27s+report+preston ''The Destruction of Guernica''.

The 250s toppled a number of houses and destroyed the water mains. The incendiaries now could spread and become effective. The materials of the houses: tile roofs, wooden porches, and half-timbering resulted in complete annihilation. Most inhabitants were away because of a holiday; a majority of the rest left town immediately at the beginning [of the bombardment]. A small number perished in shelters that were hit.\"<ref> Quoted in Oppler (1988), p. 166.</ref>}}\n\nOther accounts state that since it was Guernica's market day, its inhabitants were congregated in the center of town. When the bombardment began they were unable to escape because the roads were full of debris and the bridges leading out of town had been destroyed.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|right|thumb|Guernica in ruins, 1937]]\nGuernica was a quiet village 10 kilometers from the front lines, and in-between the front lines and Bilbao, the capital of Bizkaia ([[Biscay]]). But any Republican retreat towards Bilbao, or any Nationalist advance towards Bilbao, had to pass through Guernica.<ref>Beevor (2006), 231</ref> Wolfram von Richthofen's war diary entry for 26 April 1937 states, \"K/88 [the Condor Legion bomber force] was targeted at Guernica in order to halt and disrupt the Red withdrawal which has to pass through here.\" Under the German concept of tactical bombing, areas that were routes of transportation and troop movement were considered legitimate military targets. The following day, Richthofen wrote in his war diary, \"Guernica burning.\"<ref name=\"beevor233\">Beevor (2006), 233.</ref>  \n\nThe nearest military target of any consequence was a war product factory on Guernica's outskirts, but it went through the attack unscathed.

An assault on women and children is, in Picasso's view, directed at the core of mankind.\"<ref name=Arhheim1973/>\n\n''The Times'' journalist [[George Steer]], a Basque and Republican sympathizer, propelled this event onto the international scene and brought it to Pablo Picasso's attention. Steer's eyewitness account was published on 28 April in both ''The Times'' and ''The New York Times'', and on the 29th it appeared in ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', a French Communist daily. Steer wrote:\n\n{{quote|Guernica, the most ancient town of the Basques and the centre of their cultural tradition, was completely destroyed yesterday afternoon by insurgent air raiders. The bombardment of this open town far behind the lines occupied precisely three hours and a quarter, during which a powerful fleet of aeroplanes consisting of three types of German types, Junkers and Heinkel bombers, did not cease unloading on the town bombs weighing from 1,000 lbs. downwards and, it is calculated, more than 3,000 two-pounder aluminium incendiary projectiles.

Art was part of him\n\n==Composition==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|470px|center]]\nThe scene occurs within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a grieving woman holding a dead child in her arms. In the center of the room a horse falls in agony with a large gaping hole in its side, as if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. The horse appears to be wearing chain mail armor, decorated with vertical tally marks arranged in rows.\n\nA dead and dismembered soldier lies under the horse. The hand of his severed right arm grasps a shattered sword, from which a flower grows. The open palm of the soldier's left hand contains a stigma, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the [[stigmata]] of Christ. A bare light bulb in the shape of an eye blazes over the suffering horse's head.\n\nTo the horse's upper right a frightened female figure appears to have floated into the room through a window, and witnesses the scene. She carries a flame-lit lamp, and holds it near the bare bulb. From the right, below the floating figure, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center, looking into the blazing light bulb with a blank stare.\n\nDaggers that suggest screaming have replaced the tongues of the horse, the bull, and the grieving woman. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull, part of its body comprising a crack in the wall through which bright light from the outside shines.\n\nOn the far right another woman, her arms raised in terror, is entrapped by fire from above and below. Her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right side of the room.\n\nTwo \"hidden\" images formed by the horse appear in ''Guernica'':\n* A human skull overlays the horse's body.\n* A bull appears to gore the horse from underneath. The bull's head is formed mainly by the horse's entire front leg which has the knee on the ground. The leg's knee cap forms the head's nose. A horn appears within the horse's breast. The bull's tail forms the image of a flame with smoke rising from it, seemingly appearing in a window created by the lighter shade of gray surrounding it.\n\n==Symbolism and interpretations==\nInterpretations of ''Guernica'' vary widely and contradict one another. This extends, for example, to the mural's two dominant elements: the bull and the horse. Art historian Patricia Failing said, \"The bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture. Picasso himself certainly used these characters to play many different roles over time. This has made the task of interpreting the specific meaning of the bull and the horse very tough. Their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conceived in a variety of ways throughout Picasso's career.\"\n\nWhen pressed to explain the elements in ''Guernica'', Picasso said,\n\n{{quote|...this bull is a bull and this horse is a horse... If you give a meaning to certain things in my paintings it may be very true, but it is not my idea to give this meaning. What ideas and conclusions you have got I obtained too, but instinctively, unconsciously. I make the painting for the painting. I paint the objects for what they are.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/guernica_nav/gnav_level_1/5meaning_guerfrm.html ...questions of meaning], part of a series of web pages on ''Guernica'' in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Treasures of the World'' series. Accessed 16 July 2006.</ref>}}\n\nIn ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'', a series of narrative sketches Picasso also created for the World's Fair, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] is depicted as a monster that first devours his own horse and later does battle with an angry bull. Work on these illustrations began before the bombing of Guernica, and four additional panels were added, three of which relate directly to the Guernica mural.\n\nAccording to scholar Beverly Ray, the following list of interpretations reflects the general consensus of historians: \"The shape and posture of the bodies express protest\"; \"Picasso uses black, white, and grey paint to set a somber mood and express pain and chaos\"; \"flaming buildings and crumbling walls not only express the destruction of Guernica, but reflect the destructive power of civil war\"; \"the newspaper print used in the painting reflects how Picasso learned of the massacre\"; \"The light bulb in the painting represents the sun\"; and \"The broken sword near the bottom of the painting symbolizes the defeat of the people at the hand of their tormentors\".<ref name=Ray2006/>\n\nAlejandro Escalona said, \"The chaos unfolding seems to happen in closed quarters provoking an intense feeling of oppression. There is no way out of the nightmarish cityscape. The absence of color makes the violent scene developing right before your eyes even more horrifying. The blacks, whites, and grays startle you\u2014especially because you are used to see war images broadcast live and in high-definition right to your living room.\"<ref name = \"75years\" />\n\nIn drawing attention to a number of preliminary studies, the so-called primary project,<ref>[[Werner Spies]]: Guernica und die Weltausstellung von 1937.

In his ''chef d'oeuvre'', Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, ''Guernica'' should be seen as Picasso's comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.<ref>See Becht-J\u00f6rdens (2003)</ref>\n\n==Exhibition==\n===1937 Paris International Exhibition===\n''Guernica'' was unveiled and initially exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]].<ref>Martin (2002)</ref>, where Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia had huge pavilions. The Pavilion, which was financed by the Spanish Republican government at the time of civil war, was built to exhibit the Spanish government's struggle for existence contrary to the Exposition's technology theme. The Pavilion's entrance presented an enormous photographic mural of Republican soldiers accompanied by the slogan:\n\n:We are fighting for the essential unity of Spain.\n:We are fighting for the integrity of Spanish soil.\n:We are fighting for the independence of our country and for\n:the right of the Spanish people to determine their own destiny.\n\nThe display of ''Guernica'' was accompanied by a poem by [[Paul \u00c9luard]], and the pavilion displayed ''[[The Reaper (Mir\u00f3 painting)|The Reaper]]'' by [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and ''[[Mercury fountain|Mercury Fountain]]'' by [[Alexander Calder]], both of whom were sympathetic to the Republican cause.\n\nAt ''Guernica''{{'}}s Paris Exhibition unveiling it garnered little attention. The public's reaction to the painting was mixed.<ref>Witham (2013), p. 175.</ref> [[Max Aub]], one of the officials in charge of the Spanish pavilion, was compelled to defend the work against a group of Spanish officials who objected to the mural's modernist style and sought to replace it with a more traditional painting that was also commissioned for the exhibition, ''Madrid 1937 (Black Aeroplanes)'' by Horacio Ferrer de Morgado.<ref name=\"Richardson_2016\"/> Some Marxist groups criticized Picasso's painting as lacking in political commitment, and faulted it for not offering a vision of a better future.<ref>Greeley, Robin A.

Starting in late September ''Guernica'' was exhibited in [[London]]'s [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]]. This stop was organized by [[Roland Penrose|Sir Roland Penrose]] with Labour Party leader [[Clement Attlee]], and the painting arrived in London on 30 September, the same day the [[Munich Agreement]] was signed by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. It then travelled to [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], and, in early 1939, [[Manchester]]. There, Manchester Foodship For Spain, a group of artists and activists engaged in sending aid to the people of Spain, exhibited the painting in the HE Nunn & Co Ford automobile showroom for two weeks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16927120 |title=BBC News \u2013 Picasso's Guernica in a car showroom |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> ''Guernica'' then returned briefly to France.\n\n===American tour===\nAfter Francisco Franco's victory in Spain, ''Guernica'' was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. The San Francisco Museum of Art (later renamed the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]) gave the work its first public appearance in the United States from 27 August to 19 September 1939. New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) then mounted an exhibition from 15 November until 7 January 1940, entitled: ''Picasso: 40 Years of His Art''. The exhibition, which was organized by MoMA's director [[Alfred H. Barr]] in collaboration with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], contained 344 works, including ''Guernica'' and its studies.<ref>Fluegel (1980), p. 350</ref>\n\nAt Picasso's request the safekeeping of ''Guernica'' was then entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art, and it was his expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Between 1939 and 1952, ''Guernica'' traveled extensively in the United States. Between 1953 and 1956 it was shown in [[Brazil]], then at the first Picasso retrospective in [[Milan]], Italy, and then in numerous other major European cities before returning to MoMA for a retrospective celebrating Picasso's 75th birthday. It then went to [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]]. By this time, concern for the state of the painting resulted in a decision to keep it in one place: a room on MoMA's third floor, where it was accompanied by several of Picasso's preliminary studies and some of [[Dora Maar]]'s photographs of the work in progress. The studies and photos were often loaned for other exhibitions, but until 1981, ''Guernica'' itself remained at MoMA.<ref name=\"timeline\">[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/guernica/glevel_1/gtimeline.html Timeline], part of a series of web pages on ''Guernica'' in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Treasures of the World'' series.

The paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.<ref name=\"Hoberman 2004\">Hoberman 2004</ref>\n\n==Establishment in Spain==\nAs early as 1968, Franco had expressed an interest in having ''Guernica'' come to Spain.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> However, Picasso refused to allow this until the Spanish people again enjoyed a republic. He later added other conditions, such as the restoration of \"public liberties and democratic institutions\". Picasso died in 1973. Franco, ten years Picasso's junior, died two years later, in 1975. After Franco's death, Spain was transformed into a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]], ratified by [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|a new constitution]] in 1978. However, MoMA was reluctant to give up one of its greatest treasures and argued that a monarchy did not represent the republic that had been stipulated in Picasso's will as a condition for the painting's delivery.

Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, dismemberment, and flames.\n\nPicasso painted ''Guernica'' at his home in Paris in response to the [[bombing of Guernica]], a [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] [[Guernica (town)|town]] in northern [[Spain]], by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]] at the request of the Spanish [[Spain under Franco|Nationalists]].

Acting on Larrea's suggestion, Picasso began sketching a series of preliminary drawings for ''Guernica''.<ref>[[Preston, Paul]] (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOpqVkAyFkAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steer%27s+report+preston ''The Destruction of Guernica''.

When the bombardment began they were unable to escape because the roads were full of debris and the bridges leading out of town had been destroyed.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|right|thumb|Guernica in ruins, 1937]]\nGuernica was a quiet village 10 kilometers from the front lines, and in-between the front lines and Bilbao, the capital of Bizkaia ([[Biscay]]).

An assault on women and children is, in Picasso's view, directed at the core of mankind.\"<ref name=Arhheim1973/>\n\n''The Times'' journalist [[George Steer]], a Basque and Republican sympathizer, propelled this event onto the international scene and brought it to Pablo Picasso's attention. Steer's eyewitness account was published on 28 April in both ''The Times'' and ''The New York Times'', and on the 29th it appeared in ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'', a French Communist daily. Steer wrote:\n\n{{quote|Guernica, the most ancient town of the Basques and the centre of their cultural tradition, was completely destroyed yesterday afternoon by insurgent air raiders. The bombardment of this open town far behind the lines occupied precisely three hours and a quarter, during which a powerful fleet of aeroplanes consisting of three types of German types, Junkers and Heinkel bombers, did not cease unloading on the town bombs weighing from 1,000 lbs. downwards and, it is calculated, more than 3,000 two-pounder aluminium incendiary projectiles.

My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody think for a moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call ''Guernica'', and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death.\"<ref>T\u00f3ib\u00edn (2006).</ref>\n\nPicasso worked on the painting for 35 days, and finished it on 4 June 1937.<ref name=\"Richardson_2016\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|470px|center]]\nThe scene occurs within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a grieving woman holding a dead child in her arms. In the center of the room a horse falls in agony with a large gaping hole in its side, as if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. The horse appears to be wearing chain mail armor, decorated with vertical tally marks arranged in rows.\n\nA dead and dismembered soldier lies under the horse. The hand of his severed right arm grasps a shattered sword, from which a flower grows. The open palm of the soldier's left hand contains a stigma, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the [[stigmata]] of Christ. A bare light bulb in the shape of an eye blazes over the suffering horse's head.\n\nTo the horse's upper right a frightened female figure appears to have floated into the room through a window, and witnesses the scene. She carries a flame-lit lamp, and holds it near the bare bulb. From the right, below the floating figure, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center, looking into the blazing light bulb with a blank stare.\n\nDaggers that suggest screaming have replaced the tongues of the horse, the bull, and the grieving woman. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull, part of its body comprising a crack in the wall through which bright light from the outside shines.\n\nOn the far right another woman, her arms raised in terror, is entrapped by fire from above and below. Her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right side of the room.\n\nTwo \"hidden\" images formed by the horse appear in ''Guernica'':\n* A human skull overlays the horse's body.\n* A bull appears to gore the horse from underneath. The bull's head is formed mainly by the horse's entire front leg which has the knee on the ground. The leg's knee cap forms the head's nose. A horn appears within the horse's breast. The bull's tail forms the image of a flame with smoke rising from it, seemingly appearing in a window created by the lighter shade of gray surrounding it.\n\n==Symbolism and interpretations==\nInterpretations of ''Guernica'' vary widely and contradict one another. This extends, for example, to the mural's two dominant elements: the bull and the horse. Art historian Patricia Failing said, \"The bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture. Picasso himself certainly used these characters to play many different roles over time. This has made the task of interpreting the specific meaning of the bull and the horse very tough. Their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conceived in a variety of ways throughout Picasso's career.\"\n\nWhen pressed to explain the elements in ''Guernica'', Picasso said,\n\n{{quote|...this bull is a bull and this horse is a horse... If you give a meaning to certain things in my paintings it may be very true, but it is not my idea to give this meaning. What ideas and conclusions you have got I obtained too, but instinctively, unconsciously. I make the painting for the painting. I paint the objects for what they are.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/guernica_nav/gnav_level_1/5meaning_guerfrm.html ...questions of meaning], part of a series of web pages on ''Guernica'' in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Treasures of the World'' series. Accessed 16 July 2006.</ref>}}\n\nIn ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'', a series of narrative sketches Picasso also created for the World's Fair, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] is depicted as a monster that first devours his own horse and later does battle with an angry bull. Work on these illustrations began before the bombing of Guernica, and four additional panels were added, three of which relate directly to the Guernica mural.\n\nAccording to scholar Beverly Ray, the following list of interpretations reflects the general consensus of historians: \"The shape and posture of the bodies express protest\"; \"Picasso uses black, white, and grey paint to set a somber mood and express pain and chaos\"; \"flaming buildings and crumbling walls not only express the destruction of Guernica, but reflect the destructive power of civil war\"; \"the newspaper print used in the painting reflects how Picasso learned of the massacre\"; \"The light bulb in the painting represents the sun\"; and \"The broken sword near the bottom of the painting symbolizes the defeat of the people at the hand of their tormentors\".<ref name=Ray2006/>\n\nAlejandro Escalona said, \"The chaos unfolding seems to happen in closed quarters provoking an intense feeling of oppression. There is no way out of the nightmarish cityscape. The absence of color makes the violent scene developing right before your eyes even more horrifying. The blacks, whites, and grays startle you\u2014especially because you are used to see war images broadcast live and in high-definition right to your living room.\"<ref name = \"75years\" />\n\nIn drawing attention to a number of preliminary studies, the so-called primary project,<ref>[[Werner Spies]]: Guernica und die Weltausstellung von 1937.

In his ''chef d'oeuvre'', Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, ''Guernica'' should be seen as Picasso's comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.<ref>See Becht-J\u00f6rdens (2003)</ref>\n\n==Exhibition==\n===1937 Paris International Exhibition===\n''Guernica'' was unveiled and initially exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]].<ref>Martin (2002)</ref>, where Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia had huge pavilions. The Pavilion, which was financed by the Spanish Republican government at the time of civil war, was built to exhibit the Spanish government's struggle for existence contrary to the Exposition's technology theme. The Pavilion's entrance presented an enormous photographic mural of Republican soldiers accompanied by the slogan:\n\n:We are fighting for the essential unity of Spain.\n:We are fighting for the integrity of Spanish soil.\n:We are fighting for the independence of our country and for\n:the right of the Spanish people to determine their own destiny.\n\nThe display of ''Guernica'' was accompanied by a poem by [[Paul \u00c9luard]], and the pavilion displayed ''[[The Reaper (Mir\u00f3 painting)|The Reaper]]'' by [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and ''[[Mercury fountain|Mercury Fountain]]'' by [[Alexander Calder]], both of whom were sympathetic to the Republican cause.\n\nAt ''Guernica''{{'}}s Paris Exhibition unveiling it garnered little attention.

The tour's main attraction was ''Guernica''.\n\nFrom January to April 1938 the tour visited [[Oslo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Stockholm]], and [[Gothenburg|G\u00f6teborg]]. Starting in late September ''Guernica'' was exhibited in [[London]]'s [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]]. This stop was organized by [[Roland Penrose|Sir Roland Penrose]] with Labour Party leader [[Clement Attlee]], and the painting arrived in London on 30 September, the same day the [[Munich Agreement]] was signed by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. It then travelled to [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], and, in early 1939, [[Manchester]]. There, Manchester Foodship For Spain, a group of artists and activists engaged in sending aid to the people of Spain, exhibited the painting in the HE Nunn & Co Ford automobile showroom for two weeks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16927120 |title=BBC News \u2013 Picasso's Guernica in a car showroom |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> ''Guernica'' then returned briefly to France.\n\n===American tour===\nAfter Francisco Franco's victory in Spain, ''Guernica'' was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. The San Francisco Museum of Art (later renamed the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]) gave the work its first public appearance in the United States from 27 August to 19 September 1939. New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) then mounted an exhibition from 15 November until 7 January 1940, entitled: ''Picasso: 40 Years of His Art''. The exhibition, which was organized by MoMA's director [[Alfred H. Barr]] in collaboration with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], contained 344 works, including ''Guernica'' and its studies.<ref>Fluegel (1980), p. 350</ref>\n\nAt Picasso's request the safekeeping of ''Guernica'' was then entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art, and it was his expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Between 1939 and 1952, ''Guernica'' traveled extensively in the United States. Between 1953 and 1956 it was shown in [[Brazil]], then at the first Picasso retrospective in [[Milan]], Italy, and then in numerous other major European cities before returning to MoMA for a retrospective celebrating Picasso's 75th birthday. It then went to [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]]. By this time, concern for the state of the painting resulted in a decision to keep it in one place: a room on MoMA's third floor, where it was accompanied by several of Picasso's preliminary studies and some of [[Dora Maar]]'s photographs of the work in progress. The studies and photos were often loaned for other exhibitions, but until 1981, ''Guernica'' itself remained at MoMA.<ref name=\"timeline\">[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/guernica/glevel_1/gtimeline.html Timeline], part of a series of web pages on ''Guernica'' in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Treasures of the World'' series.

The paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.<ref name=\"Hoberman 2004\">Hoberman 2004</ref>\n\n==Establishment in Spain==\nAs early as 1968, Franco had expressed an interest in having ''Guernica'' come to Spain.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> However, Picasso refused to allow this until the Spanish people again enjoyed a republic. He later added other conditions, such as the restoration of \"public liberties and democratic institutions\". Picasso died in 1973. Franco, ten years Picasso's junior, died two years later, in 1975. After Franco's death, Spain was transformed into a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]], ratified by [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|a new constitution]] in 1978. However, MoMA was reluctant to give up one of its greatest treasures and argued that a monarchy did not represent the republic that had been stipulated in Picasso's will as a condition for the painting's delivery. Under great pressure from a number of observers, MoMA finally ceded the painting to Spain in 1981.

In animals, this means an individual derived from two or more [[zygote]]s, which can include possessing [[blood cell]]s of different [[blood type]]s, subtle variations in form ([[phenotype]]) and, if the zygotes were of differing sexes, then even the possession of both female and male [[sex organs]]<ref name=\"Norton\" /> (this is just one of many different phenomena that may result in [[intersexuality]]). Animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs. In plant chimeras, however, the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same [[zygote]], and the difference is often due to [[mutation]] during ordinary [[cell division]]. Normally, genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection; however, it has been detected in the course of proving parentage.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Friedman| first1=Lauren| title=The Stranger-Than-Fiction Story Of A Woman Who Was Her Own Twin| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lydia-fairchild-is-her-own-twin-2014-2| accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother way that chimerism can occur in animals is by [[organ (biology)|organ]] transplantation, giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome. For example, transplantation of [[bone marrow]] often determines the recipient's ensuing [[blood type]].\n\n==Animals==\nAn animal chimera is a single [[organism]] that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct [[cell (biology)|cells]] that originated from different [[zygote]]s involved in [[sexual reproduction]]. If the different cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Cases of human chimerism have been documented.<ref name=\"Norton\" />\n\nThis condition is either inherited or it is acquired through the infusion of [[allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic cell]]s during [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] or [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]. In nonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel [[anastomose]]s. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via [[in vitro fertilization|in vitro fertilisation]].<ref name=\"Strain\" /> Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying degrees of [[intersex]] differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.\n\n===Tetragametic chimerism===\nTetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism. This condition occurs through the fertilization of two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the [[blastocyst]] or zygote stages. This results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines. Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two [[twin|nonidentical twins]] (a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins, but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct, the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera). As such, they can be male, female, or have mixed intersex characteristics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schoenle|first=E.|last2=Schmid|first2=W.|last3=Schinzel|first3=A.|last4=Mahler|first4=M.|last5=Ritter|first5=M.|last6=Schenker|first6=T.|last7=Metaxas|first7=M.|last8=Froesch|first8=P.|last9=Froesch|first9=E.

Chimeras may also show, under a certain spectrum of UV light, distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called [[Blaschko's lines]].<ref name=\"Starr-2004\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |title=Understanding Genetics: Human Health and the Genome |date=November 30, 2004 |work=Ask a Geneticist |publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine]] |first1=Barry |last1=Starr |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724035334/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |archivedate=2011-07-24}}<!-- Date determined from list at https://web.archive.org/web/20110805030220/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/asklist.php?category=% --></ref>\n\nAffected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, [[ambiguous genitalia]] and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or [[eye pigmentation]] ([[heterochromia]]). If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] of both sexes may be formed: either [[ovary]] and [[testis]], or combined [[ovotestes]], in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as ''[[true hermaphroditism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nNote that the frequency of this condition does ''not'' indicate the true prevalence of chimerism. Most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition, as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body. Often, most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line, i.e. the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line, and the internal organs of the other cell line. Genitalia produce the hormones responsible for other sex characteristics.\n\nNatural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation. The most noticeable are some male [[tortoiseshell cat]]s and [[calico cat]]s (although most male tortoiseshells have an extra X chromosome responsible for the colouration) or animals with ambiguous sex organs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n{{anchor|(KarenKeegan)}}The existence of chimerism is problematic for [[DNA testing]], a fact with implications for family and criminal law. The [[Lydia Fairchild]] case, for example, was brought to court after DNA testing apparently showed that her children could not be hers. Fraud charges were filed against her and her custody of her children was challenged. The charge against her was dismissed when it became clear that Lydia was a chimera, with the matching DNA being found in her cervical tissue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Another case was that of '''Karen Keegan''', who was also suspected (initially) of not being her children's biological mother, after DNA tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed seemed to show she was not their mother.<ref name=\"Norton\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |title=The Twin Inside Me: Extraordinary People |publisher=[[Five (TV channel)|Channel 5 TV, UK]] |date=9 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526105634/http://www.five.tv/programmes/extraordinarypeople/twininside/ |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe tetragametic state has important implications for organ or [[stem cell]] transplantation. Chimeras typically have [[immunologic tolerance]] to both cell lines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Microchimerism===\n{{Main| Microchimerism}}\n\nMicrochimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual. Most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older. People who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mother's have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases, presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems.\nThe higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and it is unknown whether microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bellefon | first1 = L. | last2 = Heiman | first2 = P. | last3 = Kanaan | first3 = S. | last4 = Azzouz | first4 = D. | last5 = Rak | first5 = J. | last6 = Martin | first6 = M. | last7 = Roudier | first7 = J. | last8 = Roufosse | first8 = F. | last9 = Lambert | first9 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Cells from a vanished twin as a source of microchimerism 40 years later | url = | journal = Chimerism | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 56\u201360 | doi=10.4161/chim.1.2.14294| pmid = 21327048 | pmc = 3023624 }}</ref> Mothers often also have a few cells genetically identical to those of their children, and some people also have some cells genetically identical to those of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish===\nChimerism occurs naturally in adult [[Ceratiidae|Ceratioid]] [[anglerfish]] and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. Using strong [[olfactory|olfactory (or smell)]] receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male's survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] individual. Sometimes in this process, more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. In this case, they will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large [[testicle]]s as their other organs [[atrophy]]. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.<ref>[[Ceratiidae]]</ref>\n\n===Germline chimerism===\nGermline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, [[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]] cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own. It has been recently discovered that [[marmoset]]s can carry the reproductive cells of their (fraternal) twin siblings due to placental fusion during development.

After successful transplantation has been complete, in the case that the recipient needs to be identified using [[Forensic science|forensics]], his or her identity will match exactly that of the donor.

These include insights into problems such as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.\nThe general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins.

Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the [[trophectoderm]], the [[inner cell mass]], and the [[primitive endoderm]]. Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00478.x | pmid = 15996204 | last1 = Ralston | first1 = A | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J | year = 2005 | title = Genetic regulation of stem cell origins in the mouse embryo | url = | journal = Clin Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 106\u2013112}}</ref> Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm.

For example, subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst, for example, can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.<ref name=\"Pappaioannou-1993\">{{Cite journal |last1=Pappaioannou |first1=V. |first2=R. |last2=Johnson |year=1993 |title=Production of chimeras and genetically defined offspring from targeted ES cells |journal=Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach |editor-last=Joyner |editor-first=A. |publisher=IRL Press at [[Oxford University Press]] |pp=107\u2013146 }}</ref>\nFrom this knowledge, [[ES cell]] contributions to chimeras have been developed.

These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.17.8804 | last1 = Jasin | first1 = M | last2 = Moynahan | first2 = ME | last3 = Richardson | first3 = C | year = 1996 | title = Targeted transgenesis | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 17| pages = 8804\u20138808 | pmid = 8799106 | pmc = 38547 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.8804J }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0958067000021059 | last1 = Ledermann | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Embryonic Stem Cell and Gene Targeting | url = | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 603\u2013613 | pmid = 11187956 }}</ref> ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst.

This type of chimera is recognized at the time of origin by the sorting-out pattern in the leaves.

The majority of variegated-leaf chimeras are of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAll plastid gene- and some nuclear gene-differential chimeras affect the color of the plasmids within the leaves, and these are grouped together as [[chlorophyll]] chimeras, or preferably as variegated leaf chimeras.

This mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own, but it is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue.

The bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed to the point where the human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this, serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases. With that being said, the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans.<ref name=\"Human Chimera Prohibition Act\"/>\n\nOn 22 August 2016, another bill, The Human-Animal Chimera Prohibition Act of 2016, was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]]. It identifies a chimera as:\n\n* a human embryo into which a nonhuman cell or cells (or the component parts thereof) have been introduced to render the embryo's membership in the species Homo sapiens uncertain;\n* a chimera human/animal embryo produced by fertilizing a human egg with nonhuman sperm;\n* chimera human/animal embryo produced by fertilizing a nonhuman egg with human sperm;\n* an embryo produced by introducing a nonhuman nucleus into a human egg;\n* an embryo produced by introducing a human nucleus into a nonhuman egg;\n* an embryo containing at least haploid sets of chromosomes from both a human and a nonhuman life form;\n* a nonhuman life form engineered such that human gametes develop within the body of a nonhuman life form; or\n* a nonhuman life form engineered such that it contains a human brain or a brain derived wholly or predominantly from human neural tissues.\n\nThe bill prohibits the attempts to create a human-animal chimera, the transfer or attempt to transfer a human embryo into a nonhuman womb, the transfer or attempt to transfer a nonhuman embryo into a human womb, and the transport or receive of any purpose of an animal chimera. Penalties for violations of this bill include fines and/or imprisonment of up to 10 years. The bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations in October 11, 2016, but died there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6131/text|title=Text - H.R.6131 - 114th Congress (2015-2016): Human-Animal Chimera Prohibition Act of 2016|last=Smith|first=Christopher H.|date=2016-10-11|website=congress.gov|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Conjoined twins]]\n* [[Genetic chimerism in fiction]]\n* [[Vanishing twin]]\n* [[X-inactivation]] (lyonization)\n* [[Chimera (EST)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Yu N, Kruskall MS, Yunis JJ, Knoll JH, Uhl L, Alosco S, Ohashi M, Clavijo O, Husain Z, Yunis EJ, Yunis JJ, Yunis EJ | title=Disputed maternity leading to identification of tetragametic chimerism | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2002 | pages=1545\u201352 | volume=346 | issue=20 | pmid=12015394 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa013452}}\n* Appel, Jacob M. \"The Monster's Law\", ''[[Genewatch]]'', Volume 19, Number 2, March\u2013April 2007.\n* Nelson, J.

In animals, this means an individual derived from two or more [[zygote]]s, which can include possessing [[blood cell]]s of different [[blood type]]s, subtle variations in form ([[phenotype]]) and, if the zygotes were of differing sexes, then even the possession of both female and male [[sex organs]]<ref name=\"Norton\" /> (this is just one of many different phenomena that may result in [[intersexuality]]). Animal chimeras are produced by the merger of multiple fertilized eggs. In plant chimeras, however, the distinct types of tissue may originate from the same [[zygote]], and the difference is often due to [[mutation]] during ordinary [[cell division]]. Normally, genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection; however, it has been detected in the course of proving parentage.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Friedman| first1=Lauren| title=The Stranger-Than-Fiction Story Of A Woman Who Was Her Own Twin| url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lydia-fairchild-is-her-own-twin-2014-2| accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother way that chimerism can occur in animals is by [[organ (biology)|organ]] transplantation, giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome. For example, transplantation of [[bone marrow]] often determines the recipient's ensuing [[blood type]].\n\n==Animals==\nAn animal chimera is a single [[organism]] that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct [[cell (biology)|cells]] that originated from different [[zygote]]s involved in [[sexual reproduction]]. If the different cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Cases of human chimerism have been documented.<ref name=\"Norton\" />\n\nThis condition is either inherited or it is acquired through the infusion of [[allogeneic]] [[hematopoietic cell]]s during [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] or [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]. In nonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel [[anastomose]]s. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via [[in vitro fertilization|in vitro fertilisation]].<ref name=\"Strain\" /> Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying degrees of [[intersex]] differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.\n\n===Tetragametic chimerism===\nTetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism. This condition occurs through the fertilisation of two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the [[blastocyst]] or zygote stages. This results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines. Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two [[twin|nonidentical twins]] (a similar merging presumably occurs with identical twins, but as their genotypes are not significantly distinct, the resulting individual would not be considered a chimera).

Chimeras may also show, under a certain spectrum of UV light, distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downwards from the shoulders down to the lower back; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called [[Blaschko's lines]].<ref name=\"Starr-2004\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |title=Understanding Genetics: Human Health and the Genome |date=November 30, 2004 |work=Ask a Geneticist |publisher=[[Stanford University School of Medicine]] |first1=Barry |last1=Starr |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724035334/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=75 |archivedate=2011-07-24}}<!-- Date determined from list at https://web.archive.org/web/20110805030220/http://www.thetech.org/genetics/asklist.php?category=% --></ref>\n\nAffected persons may be identified by the finding of two populations of red cells or, if the zygotes are of opposite sex, [[ambiguous genitalia]] and intersex alone or in combination; such persons sometimes also have patchy skin, hair, or [[eye pigmentation]] ([[heterochromia]]). If the blastocysts are of opposite sex, [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] of both sexes may be formed: either [[ovary]] and [[testis]], or combined [[ovotestes]], in one rare form of intersex, a condition previously known as ''[[true hermaphroditism]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nNote that the frequency of this condition does ''not'' indicate the true prevalence of chimerism. Most chimeras composed of both male and female cells probably do not have an intersex condition, as might be expected if the two cell populations were evenly blended throughout the body. Often, most or all of the cells of a single cell type will be composed of a single cell line, i.e. the blood may be composed predominantly of one cell line, and the internal organs of the other cell line. Genitalia produce the hormones responsible for other sex characteristics.\n\nNatural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as male/female or hermaphrodite characteristics or uneven skin pigmentation. The most noticeable are some male [[tortoiseshell cat]]s and [[calico cat]]s (although most male tortoiseshells have an extra X chromosome responsible for the colouration) or animals with ambiguous sex organs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n{{anchor|(KarenKeegan)}}The existence of chimerism is problematic for [[DNA testing]], a fact with implications for family and criminal law.

Chimeras typically have [[immunologic tolerance]] to both cell lines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Microchimerism===\n{{Main| Microchimerism}}\n\nMicrochimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual. Most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers' and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older. People who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mother's have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases, presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems.\nThe higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and it is unknown whether microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bellefon | first1 = L. | last2 = Heiman | first2 = P. | last3 = Kanaan | first3 = S. | last4 = Azzouz | first4 = D. | last5 = Rak | first5 = J. | last6 = Martin | first6 = M. | last7 = Roudier | first7 = J. | last8 = Roufosse | first8 = F. | last9 = Lambert | first9 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Cells from a vanished twin as a source of microchimerism 40 years later | url = | journal = Chimerism | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 56\u201360 | doi=10.4161/chim.1.2.14294| pmid = 21327048 | pmc = 3023624 }}</ref> Mothers often also have a few cells genetically identical to those of their children, and some people also have some cells genetically identical to those of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish===\nChimerism occurs naturally in adult [[Ceratiidae|Ceratioid]] [[anglerfish]] and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. Using strong [[olfactory|olfactory (or smell)]] receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male's survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] individual. Sometimes in this process, more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. In this case, they will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large [[testicle]]s as their other organs [[atrophy]]. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.<ref>[[Ceratiidae]]</ref>\n\n===Germline chimerism===\nGermline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, [[sperm]] and [[ovum|egg]] cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own. It has been recently discovered that [[marmoset]]s can carry the reproductive cells of their (fraternal) twin siblings due to placental fusion during development. (Marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins.)<ref name=\"Ross2007\">{{cite journal | last=Ross| first=C. N.|author2=J. A. French | author3=G.

After successful transplantation has been complete, in the case that the recipient needs to be identified using [[Forensic science|forensics]], his or her identity will match exactly that of the donor.

However, these signs do not necessarily mean an individual is a chimera and should only be seen as possible symptoms. Again, forensic investigation or curiosity over a failed maternity/paternity DNA test usually leads to the accidental discovery of this condition.

These include insights into problems such as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.\nThe general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mintz | first1 = B. | last2 = Silvers | first2 = W.

ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of [[homologous recombination]], thus allowing [[gene targeting]]. Since this discovery occurred in 1988, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.22.8583 | last1 = Doetschman | first1 = T. | last2 = Maeda | first2 = N. | last3 = Smithies | first3 = O. | year = 1988 | title = Targeted mutation of the Hp gene in mouse embryonic stem cells | url = | journal = Proc.

Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the [[trophectoderm]], the [[inner cell mass]], and the [[primitive endoderm]]. Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2005.00478.x | pmid = 15996204 | last1 = Ralston | first1 = A | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J | year = 2005 | title = Genetic regulation of stem cell origins in the mouse embryo | url = | journal = Clin Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 2| pages = 106\u2013112}}</ref> Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. In the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera, chimerism can be later found in the [[epiblast]], primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm of the mouse [[blastocyst]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1242/dev.00893 | last1 = Tam | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Rossant | first2 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Mouse embryonic chimeras: tools for studying mammalian development | url = | journal = Development | volume = 130 | issue = 25| pages = 6155\u20136163 | pmid = 14623817 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rossant | first1 = J. | year = 1976 | title = Postimplantation development of blastomeres isolated from 4- and 8-cell mouse eggs | url = | journal = J.

For example, subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst, for example, can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.<ref name=\"Pappaioannou-1993\">{{Cite journal |last1=Pappaioannou |first1=V. |first2=R. |last2=Johnson |year=1993 |title=Production of chimeras and genetically defined offspring from targeted ES cells |journal=Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach |editor-last=Joyner |editor-first=A. |publisher=IRL Press at [[Oxford University Press]] |pp=107\u2013146 }}</ref>\nFrom this knowledge, [[ES cell]] contributions to chimeras have been developed. ES cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper.

An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos.

The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.17.8804 | last1 = Jasin | first1 = M | last2 = Moynahan | first2 = ME | last3 = Richardson | first3 = C | year = 1996 | title = Targeted transgenesis | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 93 | issue = 17| pages = 8804\u20138808 | pmid = 8799106 | pmc = 38547 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.8804J }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0958067000021059 | last1 = Ledermann | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = Embryonic Stem Cell and Gene Targeting | url = | journal = Experimental Physiology | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 603\u2013613 | pmid = 11187956 }}</ref> ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst.

This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and human. Legal debate would be the next step in the process to determine whether certain chimeras should be granted legal rights.<ref name=\"Defining Humanity\">{{cite web | last1=Bruch| first1=Quinton| title=Defining Humanity: The Ethics of Chimeric Animals and Organ Growing |url=http://triplehelixblog.com/2014/02/defining-humanity-the-ethics-of-chimeric-animals-and-organ-growing/| website=The Triple Helix Online| accessdate=21 May 2015| date=2014-02-20}}</ref> Along with issues regarding the rights of chimeras, individuals have expressed concern about whether or not creating human chimeras diminishes the dignity of being human.<ref name=\"Human Chimera Prohibition Act\">{{cite web | last1=Brownback| first1=Samuel| title=S.659 \u2013 Human Chimera Prohibition Act of 2005 (Introduced in Senate - IS)| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.659:| website=The Library of Congress THOMAS| accessdate=20 May 2015| date=2005-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Legislation===\n\n====The Human Chimera Prohibition Act====\nOn 11 July 2005, a bill known as The Human Chimera Prohibition Act, was introduced into the [[United States Congress]] by Senator \n[[Samuel Brownback]]; however, it died in Congress sometime in the next year. The bill was introduced based on the findings that science has progressed to the point where the human and nonhuman species can be merged to create new forms of life. Because of this, serious ethical issues arise as this blurs the line between humans and other animals, and according to the bill with this blurring of the lines comes a show of disrespect for human dignity. The final claim brought up in The Human Chimera Prohibition Act was that there is an increasing amount of zoonotic diseases. With that being said, the creation of human-animal chimeras can allow these diseases to reach humans.<ref name=\"Human Chimera Prohibition Act\"/>\n\nOn 22 August 2016, another bill, The Human-Animal Chimera Prohibition Act of 2016, was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]]. It identifies a chimera as:\n\n* a human embryo into which a nonhuman cell or cells (or the component parts thereof) have been introduced to render the embryo's membership in the species Homo sapiens uncertain;\n* a chimera human/animal embryo produced by fertilizing a human egg with nonhuman sperm;\n* chimera human/animal embryo produced by fertilizing a nonhuman egg with human sperm;\n* an embryo produced by introducing a nonhuman nucleus into a human egg;\n* an embryo produced by introducing a human nucleus into a nonhuman egg;\n* an embryo containing at least haploid sets of chromosomes from both a human and a nonhuman life form;\n* a nonhuman life form engineered such that human gametes develop within the body of a nonhuman life form; or\n* a nonhuman life form engineered such that it contains a human brain or a brain derived wholly or predominantly from human neural tissues.\n\nThe bill prohibits the attempts to create a human-animal chimera, the transfer or attempt to transfer a human embryo into a nonhuman womb, the transfer or attempt to transfer a nonhuman embryo into a human womb, and the transport or receive of any purpose of an animal chimera. Penalties for violations of this bill include fines and/or imprisonment of up to 10 years. The bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations in October 11, 2016, but died there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6131/text|title=Text - H.R.6131 - 114th Congress (2015-2016): Human-Animal Chimera Prohibition Act of 2016|last=Smith|first=Christopher H.|date=2016-10-11|website=congress.gov|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Conjoined twins]]\n* [[Genetic chimerism in fiction]]\n* [[Vanishing twin]]\n* [[X-inactivation]] (lyonization)\n* [[Chimera (EST)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Yu N, Kruskall MS, Yunis JJ, Knoll JH, Uhl L, Alosco S, Ohashi M, Clavijo O, Husain Z, Yunis EJ, Yunis JJ, Yunis EJ | title=Disputed maternity leading to identification of tetragametic chimerism | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2002 | pages=1545\u201352 | volume=346 | issue=20 | pmid=12015394 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa013452}}\n* Appel, Jacob M. \"The Monster's Law\", ''[[Genewatch]]'', Volume 19, Number 2, March\u2013April 2007.\n* Nelson, J.

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" corresponds to the tenth: \"Covet not thy neighbor's wife,\" for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

''\"...all which a man loves, for which he leaves everything else but that, is his god, thus the glutton and drunkard has for his idol his own flesh, the fornicator has for his idol the harlot and the greedy has for his idol silver and gold, and so the same for every other sinner.\"''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202022/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arts/barnabas/Barncoloured.html Gospel of Barnabas chapter XXXIII] ''Latrobe Edu''</ref>  Idolatory was thus the basic sin, which manifested in various acts or thoughts, which displace the primacy of God.  However, the Gospel of Barnabas does not form part of the Christian bible.  It is known only from 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts, and frequently reflects Islamic rather than Christian understandings<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne}}</ref>, so it cannot be taken as authoritative on Christian views.\n\nIn Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, which others thought inappropriate. No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible.

Levinson]] argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more [[ritual]]istic to the more [[ethic]]al. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). \"Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: the Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis\".

Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Exodus 34:10\u201328 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that \"had already been normalized in the period of the Judges\" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]: a [[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|silent movie which was released in 1923]] and starred [[Theodore Roberts]] as Moses and a colour [[VistaVision]] [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|version which was released in 1956]], and starred [[Charlton Heston]] as Moses.\n\nBoth ''[[Dekalog]]'', a 1989 Polish film series directed by [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]], and ''[[The Ten]]'', a 2007 American film, use the ten commandments as a structure for 10 smaller stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|title=The Ten|accessdate=8 April 2020|via=www.imdb.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307211234/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|archive-date=7 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe receipt of the Ten Commandments by Moses was satirized in [[Mel Brooks]]'s movie ''[[History of the World Part I]]'' (1981), which shows Moses (played by Brooks, in a similar costume to [[Charlton Heston]]'s Moses in the [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|1956 film]]), receiving three tablets containing fifteen commandments, but before he can present them to his people, he stumbles and drops one of the tablets, shattering it.

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" corresponds to the tenth: \"Covet not thy neighbor's wife,\" for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible.

Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). \"Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: the Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis\".

Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Exodus 34:10\u201328 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that \"had already been normalized in the period of the Judges\" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

The Decalogue, he argues, was modelled on the suzerainty treaties of the [[Hittites]] (and other Mesopotamian Empires), that is, represents the relationship between God and Israel as a relationship between king and vassal, and enacts that bond.<ref>John Bright, 1972, p., 146\u2013147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 4th ed. p.150\u2013151] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428085746/https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=28 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\n\"The prologue of the Hittite treaty reminds his vassals of his benevolent acts..

It is likely to be an independent document, which was inserted here by the Redactor.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 153</ref> In his view, the [[Covenant Code]] follows that version of the Ten Commandments in the northern Israel E narrative. In the J narrative in Exodus 34 the editor of the combined story known as the Redactor (or RJE), adds in an explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets which were shattered. \"In the combined JE text, it would be awkward to picture God just commanding Moses to make some tablets, as if there were no history to this matter, so RJE adds the explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets that were shattered.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 177</ref>\n\nHe writes that Exodus 34:14\u201326 is the J text of the Ten Commandments: \"The first two commandments and the sabbath commandment have parallels in the other versions of the Ten Commandments.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B.
