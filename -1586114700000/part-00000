This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

It was on the northern shoreline (just above the high-water mark) of [[Tulare Lake]], then potentially the largest freshwater body of water in the US, outside of the Great Lakes.{{efn|The maps published by Thos. H. Thompson in 1892, shows three high water levels of the giant [[Tulare Lake]] in different years. The highest lake level, the one Thompson labeled \"original lake line\" skirts or touches the 1892 town of Lemoore's south-west corner at the current highway 41. On that map, Lemoore is on the east bank, and Lemoore Naval Air Station would have been on the west bank of the northern tip of Tulare Lake at its maximum size. By 1892, the shoreline is shown five miles to the south of Lemoore.  It is presumed that by \"original lake line\" Thompson meant the still discernible high water line, and that this is near the elevation of the natural spillway and marks the maximum size of Tulare Lake during flood years. According to Google Earth map elevations, the current physical \"spillway\" would be north-west of Lemoore at the intersection of Grangeville Blvd. and 24th at elevation 213 or 214 feet at the natural \"ridge\" or \"dam\" top separating the San Joaquin River watershed from the Kings River drainage. The nearby remnant stream ''oxbows'' of Bogg Slough marks the natural, pre-dammed start of the Fresno Slough. However, current elevations (and the spillway's location) may have changed due to land subsidence reportedly caused in nearby areas by ground water pumping. Because the land is so flat, just a few feet in changed elevation can translate to more than a mile in distance.}} The American pioneers from eastern states saw this as a stretch of vast virgin land on which sheep, horses and wild animals had grazed but had never been cultivated.\n\nBy the time Dr. Moore arrived, scores of individual farms dotted the landscape, but as Tulare Lake retreated, more became continually available. The soil was rich and productive as it had been brought down and deposited for centuries from the high [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]] by the Kings River and the [[Los Gatos Creek (Fresno County, California)|Los Gatos Creek]] [[alluvial fan]] from the [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Range]]. Wells were easy to dig, as the water level was unusually high. So water was plentiful for irrigation from shallow wells farm families installed. Raising of sheep and grains were principal concerns of farmers in the area.\n\nHowever, the pioneers were somewhat isolated, since they had to drive by horse as far as {{Convert|6|miles}} northeast to [[Grangeville, California|Grangeville settlement]], to get mail or newspapers. It was even farther to [[Kingston, California|Kingston]] for other supplies. Hanford was not founded until later in 1877. Even the area was called by various names, believed to be of Indian origin, such as Latache, Tailholt, or just, in English, the Lake District.\n\nDr. Lee Moore proved to be a man of vision. He decided to knit together the scores of surrounding farm families, to secure a post office, and some local center for conducting business which could be hastened by direct means of communicating with the outside world. He must also have had the hope of attracting the railroad, which was then being planned but was not built until six years later.\n\nThe first steps he took to organize a community began in early 1872, when he surveyed a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} subdivision in what is now the land immediately west of the present Lemoore High School. In August 1872 he had established the first real estate development in this district and had laid out and named the streets after other pioneer families. In the summer of 1872 land auctions were held and lots went to the highest bidder. Prices ranged from $75 to $150 per lot. One business lot was sold for $600, rated as a very high price, considering the value of the dollar in 1872. Dr. Moore's home was believed to be situated where the grammar school playground on Bush Street is now located.\n\nThe year 1872 was a busy one for the inhabitants. In addition to sales at the subdivision and putting in of streets, new buildings for homes and businesses began to arise. This was the start of a real community, but it still lacked a school, a definitely accepted name, and a post office.\n\nAll these developed in the next eventful year of 1873. Dr. Moore had presented a signed petition to the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office Department]] in distant [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] for a post office in the new town in 1872, but his petition was not granted until 1873.\n\nAt that time it was common custom to name communities after their founders or some prominent person of the day. The naming of Hanford and [[Porterville, California|Porterville]] are examples of this common practice.\n\nThe Lemoore post office first opened in 1875.<ref name=CGN />\n\nFor some reason the U.S. Post Office objected to the name \"Latache,\" so,by about the 1920s it combined the founder's name by omitting one letter \"e\",from Lee and called the new post office Lemoore after Lee Moore. In that way the new community received its new name.\n\nIn the same year, 1873, a Mr. Armstrong donated {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of land for the first school building in Lemoore. It was a frame structure {{Convert|18|feet}} by {{convert|30|ft|m}}, completed and dedicated at a [[country dance]] held in December 1873.\n\nThe railroad came to what is now Kings County in 1877. At that date Grangeville was the largest community in the entire area. After some dispute with its residents, rail officials decided to by-pass that settlement and went through Hanford. Lemoore, by that time had shown healthy growth. It could have been through the foresight of Dr. Moore in setting a head-start in '72 which attracted the rail route to his budding community. The line was put through Lemoore in 1877 parallel to Front Street, now called E Street.\n\nThis re-directed the business growth of the town toward the railroad station from where Dr. Moore first encouraged residence and business activity. It eventually made E (Front Street) and D Streets the main business avenues of the community.\n\nAfter 25 years of service to the Lemoore area, Dr. Lee Moore died on September 11, 1898. The number of new residents he had helped bring into the world numbered in the thousands.\n\nIn 1883 the town then had a flouring mill of 200 barrels daily capacity. It was an important shipping point for wheat and wool, and not long afterwards became a center for fruit, but in its early period many fires retarded its growth.\n\nMany of the early settlers of the Lemoore District were cultured people, and Lemoore attained a reputation for literary and musical accomplishments unmatched by many pioneer towns. There was an early literary society that had a long and noteworthy existence.\n\nIn 1893 Tulare County, by act of the State Legislature, was split into two areas. Western Tulare County became what is now Kings County. In creating the new County of Kings there was keen competition between Hanford and Lemoore as to which would become the county seat. By that time Hanford's population had exceeded Lemoore's and the addition of the Santa Fe Railroad's main line through Hanford gave it the advantage of two rail lines instead of one. The result was the construction of the County Courthouse in that city.\n\nLemoore became an [[Municipal corporation|incorporated city]] on 4 July 1900, which opened a new era for the community, with government by an elected City Council. Lemoore residents have always taken a keen interest in local political activities.\n\nBob E. Baldock designed and opened for play in 1928 a 9-hole [[golf course]]. The City of Lemoore had it remodeled in 1991, by Bill Phillips to add to the community an exciting 18-hole golf course.\n\n===Military===\n\nIn 1941, the Lemoore Army Air Field opened as an [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] training field. The [[Federal government of the United States|Federal Government]] acquired {{Convert|1466|acre|}} for the Lemoore Basic Flying School in 1941\u201342. Approximately {{Convert|488|acre|}} were acquired by grant deed from individual land owners, {{Convert|963|acre|}} were leased from the City of Lemoore and {{Convert|14|acre|}} were acquired by transfer from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|National Housing Agency]]. In 1961, The Army Air Field was converted into what is now [[Naval Air Station Lemoore]], a [[Naval Aviation]] base 7 miles west of Lemoore. Since 1961, The base has grown to become the largest [[Master Jet Base]] in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. NAS Lemoore hosts five carrier air wings, mostly made up of [[F-18]]s and [[F-35]] jets.\n\n==Geography==\nThe maps published by Thos. H. Thompson in 1892, shows three high water levels of the giant [[Tulare Lake]] in different years. The highest lake level, the one Thompson labeled \"original lake line\" skirts or touches the 1892 town of Lemoore's south-west corner at the current intersection of [[State Route 41]] and [[State Route 198]]. On Thompson's map, Lemoore is on the east bank, and about five miles away [[Naval Air Station Lemoore|Lemoore Naval Air Station]] would have been on the west bank of the pointy northern tip of Tulare Lake at its maximum size.  At the extreme northern point of Tulare Lake was its natural, occasional \"flood year\" spillway northbound into Bogg Slough, [[Fresno Slough]], and the [[San Joaquin River]]'s watershed, onward to the sea at [[San Francisco Bay]]. The present (2014) remaining marshy remnants of Bogg Slough, with its unfarmed [[oxbow lake|''oxbow'']] structures may be the last of their kind to avoid the plow in the Kings-San Joaquin river system.  This \"summit,\" or spillway is located just a few miles north-west of Lemoore, off Grangeville Blvd at elevation {{Convert|210|feet}}.<ref>U.S. Geologic Survey: STRUCTURAL CONTROL OF INTERIOR DRAINAGE, SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY, CALIFORNIA By George H. Davis and J. H. Green, Washington, D.C., and Sacramento, Calif.  \"The low point of [[Tulare Lake]] Bed is 178 feet above sea level; the divide to the north is 210 feet above sea level\" ... \"During periods of high runoff, Tulare Lake would fill to an elevation of 210 feet and would discharge north to the San Joaquin River and thence to the Pacific Ocean. Playas or salt flats did not form because through-flowing water periodically flushed out accumulated salt.\" ... \"Two principal explanations have been advanced to account for the interior drainage of the southern San Joaquin Valley. One advocated by Mendenhall and others (1916, p. 21), W. M. Davis (1933, p. 224), Hinds (1952, p. 150), and many others explains the interior drainage as due to damming of the valley by the growth of the alluvial fans of the Kings River from the east and Los Gatos Creek from the west. The other explanation suggests that Tulare Lake Bed is the site of a structural downwarp and that active tectonic subsidence is the cause of the topographic depression (G. H. Davis and others, 1939, p. 29).\"</ref> The spillway was wide, shallow and confusing, choked with tall [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tule rushes]], and without observable landmarks. Only one commercial boat is known to have sailed from [[Tulare Lake]] to the San Francisco delta.  [[Tulare Lake]] had huge economic importance in the region, both for the very large population of Indians, and the white pioneers.  The lake supported a large commercial fishery feeding San Francisco, and a steam powered ferry servicing several towns and settlements.  The receding lake continually opened up new agricultural lands for settlement.  Because of its source streams being diverted, the last time the lake overflowed was 1878, and today it no longer exists.\n\nBecause the natural summit or border between the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] basin and the San Joaquin River's watershed, and the Kings River itself nearly intersect near Lemoore, a number of huge water works that control regional water flow are also located nearby.  For example, in flood years the Kings River is diverted west into the so-called \"[[North Fork Kings River]],\" to Crescent Weir and related major levees eastward to the north-flowing Fresno Slough and to the sea, preventing a resurgence (\"flooding\") of [[Tulare Lake]] to the south. This \"switch point\" is located just north of Lemoore right off of Highway 41 and Elgin Ave at the New Island Weirs.  In many cases the prehistoric Kings River bed has been obliterated and new channels have been constructed. However, as of 2014, in satellite images (such as Google maps, etc.) the remains of many of the old channels can still be detected.\n\nOther towns built just above the [[Tulare Lake]] high-water shoreline include [[Kettleman City]] and [[Alpaugh]] (once also called Hog Island, Root Island, and Atwell's Island<ref>Historic Tulare County: A Sesquicentennial History, 1852-2002, By Chris Brewer, page 28</ref>). Satellite maps indicate that highways, railroads, and property lines are aligned with the historic lake shores. Also, many of the farms can be seen to be much larger within its various historic shore lines than in the surrounding areas.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] system, Lemoore has a [[semi-arid climate]], abbreviated \"BSk\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=20747&cityname=Lemoore%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Lemoore, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 463\n|1890= 651\n|1910= 1000\n|1920= 1355\n|1930= 1399\n|1940= 1711\n|1950= 2153\n|1960= 2561\n|1970= 4219\n|1980= 8832\n|1990= 13622\n|2000= 19712\n|2010= 24531\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26474\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YSasqtfX?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=May 12, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0641152|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Lemoore city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Lemoore had a population of 24,531.

It was on the northern shoreline (just above the high-water mark) of [[Tulare Lake]], then potentially the largest freshwater body of water in the US, outside of the Great Lakes.{{efn|The maps published by Thos. H. Thompson in 1892, shows three high water levels of the giant [[Tulare Lake]] in different years. The highest lake level, the one Thompson labeled \"original lake line\" skirts or touches the 1892 town of Lemoore's south-west corner at the current highway 41. On that map, Lemoore is on the east bank, and Lemoore Naval Air Station would have been on the west bank of the northern tip of Tulare Lake at its maximum size. By 1892, the shoreline is shown five miles to the south of Lemoore.  It is presumed that by \"original lake line\" Thompson meant the still discernible high water line, and that this is near the elevation of the natural spillway and marks the maximum size of Tulare Lake during flood years. According to Google Earth map elevations, the current physical \"spillway\" would be north-west of Lemoore at the intersection of Grangeville Blvd. and 24th at elevation 213 or 214 feet at the natural \"ridge\" or \"dam\" top separating the San Joaquin River watershed from the Kings River drainage. The nearby remnant stream ''oxbows'' of Bogg Slough marks the natural, pre-dammed start of the Fresno Slough. However, current elevations (and the spillway's location) may have changed due to land subsidence reportedly caused in nearby areas by ground water pumping. Because the land is so flat, just a few feet in changed elevation can translate to more than a mile in distance.}} The American pioneers from eastern states saw this as a stretch of vast virgin land on which sheep, horses and wild animals had grazed but had never been cultivated.\n\nBy the time Dr. Moore arrived, scores of individual farms dotted the landscape, but as Tulare Lake retreated, more became continually available. The soil was rich and productive as it had been brought down and deposited for centuries from the high [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]] by the Kings River and the [[Los Gatos Creek (Fresno County, California)|Los Gatos Creek]] [[alluvial fan]] from the [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Range]]. Wells were easy to dig, as the water level was unusually high. So water was plentiful for irrigation from shallow wells farm families installed. Raising of sheep and grains were principal concerns of farmers in the area.\n\nHowever, the pioneers were somewhat isolated, since they had to drive by horse as far as {{Convert|6|miles}} northeast to [[Grangeville, California|Grangeville settlement]], to get mail or newspapers. It was even farther to [[Kingston, California|Kingston]] for other supplies. Hanford was not founded until later in 1877. Even the area was called by various names, believed to be of Indian origin, such as Latache, Tailholt, or just, in English, the Lake District.\n\nDr. Lee Moore proved to be a man of vision. He decided to knit together the scores of surrounding farm families, to secure a post office, and some local center for conducting business which could be hastened by direct means of communicating with the outside world. He must also have had the hope of attracting the railroad, which was then being planned but was not built until six years later.\n\nThe first steps he took to organize a community began in early 1872, when he surveyed a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} subdivision in what is now the land immediately west of the present Lemoore High School. In August 1872 he had established the first real estate development in this district and had laid out and named the streets after other pioneer families. In the summer of 1872 land auctions were held and lots went to the highest bidder. Prices ranged from $75 to $150 per lot. One business lot was sold for $600, rated as a very high price, considering the value of the dollar in 1872. Dr. Moore's home was believed to be situated where the grammar school playground on Bush Street is now located.\n\nThe year 1872 was a busy one for the inhabitants. In addition to sales at the subdivision and putting in of streets, new buildings for homes and businesses began to arise. This was the start of a real community, but it still lacked a school, a definitely accepted name, and a post office.\n\nAll these developed in the next eventful year of 1873. Dr. Moore had presented a signed petition to the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office Department]] in distant [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] for a post office in the new town in 1872, but his petition was not granted until 1873.\n\nAt that time it was common custom to name communities after their founders or some prominent person of the day. The naming of Hanford and [[Porterville, California|Porterville]] are examples of this common practice.\n\nThe Lemoore post office first opened in 1875.<ref name=CGN />\n\nFor some reason the U.S. Post Office objected to the name \"Latache,\" so,by about the 1920s it combined the founder's name by omitting one letter \"e\",from Lee and called the new post office Lemoore after Lee Moore. In that way the new community received its new name.\n\nIn the same year, 1873, a Mr. Armstrong donated {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of land for the first school building in Lemoore. It was a frame structure {{Convert|18|feet}} by {{convert|30|ft|m}}, completed and dedicated at a [[country dance]] held in December 1873.\n\nThe railroad came to what is now Kings County in 1877. At that date Grangeville was the largest community in the entire area. After some dispute with its residents, rail officials decided to by-pass that settlement and went through Hanford. Lemoore, by that time had shown healthy growth. It could have been through the foresight of Dr. Moore in setting a head-start in '72 which attracted the rail route to his budding community. The line was put through Lemoore in 1877 parallel to Front Street, now called E Street.\n\nThis re-directed the business growth of the town toward the railroad station from where Dr. Moore first encouraged residence and business activity. It eventually made E (Front Street) and D Streets the main business avenues of the community.\n\nAfter 25 years of service to the Lemoore area, Dr. Lee Moore died on September 11, 1898. The number of new residents he had helped bring into the world numbered in the thousands.\n\nIn 1883 the town then had a flouring mill of 200 barrels daily capacity. It was an important shipping point for wheat and wool, and not long afterwards became a center for fruit, but in its early period many fires retarded its growth.\n\nMany of the early settlers of the Lemoore District were cultured people, and Lemoore attained a reputation for literary and musical accomplishments unmatched by many pioneer towns. There was an early literary society that had a long and noteworthy existence.\n\nIn 1893 Tulare County, by act of the State Legislature, was split into two areas. Western Tulare County became what is now Kings County. In creating the new County of Kings there was keen competition between Hanford and Lemoore as to which would become the county seat. By that time Hanford's population had exceeded Lemoore's and the addition of the Santa Fe Railroad's main line through Hanford gave it the advantage of two rail lines instead of one. The result was the construction of the County Courthouse in that city.\n\nLemoore became an [[Municipal corporation|incorporated city]] on 4 July 1900, which opened a new era for the community, with government by an elected City Council. Lemoore residents have always taken a keen interest in local political activities.\n\nBob E. Baldock designed and opened for play in 1928 a 9-hole [[golf course]]. The City of Lemoore had it remodeled in 1991, by Bill Phillips to add to the community an exciting 18-hole golf course.\n\n===Military===\n\nIn 1941, the Lemoore Army Air Field opened as an [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] training field. The [[Federal government of the United States|Federal Government]] acquired {{Convert|1466|acre|}} for the Lemoore Basic Flying School in 1941-42. Approximately {{Convert|488|acre|}} were acquired by grant deed from individual land owners, {{Convert|963|acre|}} were leased from the City of Lemoore and {{Convert|14|acre|}} were acquired by transfer from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|National Housing Agency]]. In 1961, The Army Air Field was converted into what is now [[Naval Air Station Lemoore]], a [[Naval Aviation]] base 7 miles west of Lemoore. Since 1961, The base has grown to become the largest [[Master Jet Base]] in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. NAS Lemoore hosts five carrier air wings, mostly made up of [[F-18]]s and [[F-35]] jets.\n\n==Geography==\nThe maps published by Thos. H. Thompson in 1892, shows three high water levels of the giant [[Tulare Lake]] in different years. The highest lake level, the one Thompson labeled \"original lake line\" skirts or touches the 1892 town of Lemoore's south-west corner at the current intersection of [[State Route 41]] and [[State Route 198]]. On Thompson's map, Lemoore is on the east bank, and about five miles away [[Naval Air Station Lemoore|Lemoore Naval Air Station]] would have been on the west bank of the pointy northern tip of Tulare Lake at its maximum size.  At the extreme northern point of Tulare Lake was its natural, occasional \"flood year\" spillway northbound into Bogg Slough, [[Fresno Slough]], and the [[San Joaquin River]]'s watershed, onward to the sea at [[San Francisco Bay]]. The present (2014) remaining marshy remnants of Bogg Slough, with its unfarmed [[oxbow lake|''oxbow'']] structures may be the last of their kind to avoid the plow in the Kings-San Joaquin river system.  This \"summit,\" or spillway is located just a few miles north-west of Lemoore, off Grangeville Blvd at elevation {{Convert|210|feet}}.<ref>U.S. Geologic Survey: STRUCTURAL CONTROL OF INTERIOR DRAINAGE, SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY, CALIFORNIA By George H. Davis and J. H. Green, Washington, D.C., and Sacramento, Calif.  \"The low point of [[Tulare Lake]] Bed is 178 feet above sea level; the divide to the north is 210 feet above sea level\" ... \"During periods of high runoff, Tulare Lake would fill to an elevation of 210 feet and would discharge north to the San Joaquin River and thence to the Pacific Ocean. Playas or salt flats did not form because through-flowing water periodically flushed out accumulated salt.\" ... \"Two principal explanations have been advanced to account for the interior drainage of the southern San Joaquin Valley. One advocated by Mendenhall and others (1916, p. 21), W. M. Davis (1933, p. 224), Hinds (1952, p. 150), and many others explains the interior drainage as due to damming of the valley by the growth of the alluvial fans of the Kings River from the east and Los Gatos Creek from the west. The other explanation suggests that Tulare Lake Bed is the site of a structural downwarp and that active tectonic subsidence is the cause of the topographic depression (G. H. Davis and others, 1939, p. 29).\"</ref> The spillway was wide, shallow and confusing, choked with tall [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tule rushes]], and without observable landmarks. Only one commercial boat is known to have sailed from [[Tulare Lake]] to the San Francisco delta.  [[Tulare Lake]] had huge economic importance in the region, both for the very large population of Indians, and the white pioneers.  The lake supported a large commercial fishery feeding San Francisco, and a steam powered ferry servicing several towns and settlements.  The receding lake continually opened up new agricultural lands for settlement.  Because of its source streams being diverted, the last time the lake overflowed was 1878, and today it no longer exists.\n\nBecause the natural summit or border between the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] basin and the San Joaquin River's watershed, and the Kings River itself nearly intersect near Lemoore, a number of huge water works that control regional water flow are also located nearby.  For example, in flood years the Kings River is diverted west into the so-called \"[[North Fork Kings River]],\" to Crescent Weir and related major levees eastward to the north-flowing Fresno Slough and to the sea, preventing a resurgence (\"flooding\") of [[Tulare Lake]] to the south. This \"switch point\" is located just north of Lemoore right off of Highway 41 and Elgin Ave at the New Island Weirs.  In many cases the prehistoric Kings River bed has been obliterated and new channels have been constructed. However, as of 2014, in satellite images (such as Google maps, etc.) the remains of many of the old channels can still be detected.\n\nOther towns built just above the [[Tulare Lake]] high-water shoreline include [[Kettleman City]] and [[Alpaugh]] (once also called Hog Island, Root Island, and Atwell's Island<ref>Historic Tulare County: A Sesquicentennial History, 1852-2002, By Chris Brewer, page 28</ref>). Satellite maps indicate that highways, railroads, and property lines are aligned with the historic lake shores. Also, many of the farms can be seen to be much larger within its various historic shore lines than in the surrounding areas.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] system, Lemoore has a [[semi-arid climate]], abbreviated \"BSk\" on climate maps.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=20747&cityname=Lemoore%2C+California%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Lemoore, California]</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 463\n|1890= 651\n|1910= 1000\n|1920= 1355\n|1930= 1399\n|1940= 1711\n|1950= 2153\n|1960= 2561\n|1970= 4219\n|1980= 8832\n|1990= 13622\n|2000= 19712\n|2010= 24531\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26474\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YSasqtfX?url=http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archive-date=May 12, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0641152|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Lemoore city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Lemoore had a population of 24,531.

{"title_page": "E8 (mathematics)", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:E<sub>8</sub> (mathematics)}}\n{{Group theory sidebar |top/lie}}\n{{Lie groups |simple}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''E<sub>8</sub>''' is any of several closely related [[exceptional simple Lie group]]s, linear [[algebraic group]]s or Lie algebras of [[dimension]] 248; the same notation is used for the corresponding [[root lattice]], which has [[Rank of a Lie group|rank]]&nbsp;8. The designation E<sub>8</sub> comes from the [[Killing form|Cartan\u2013Killing classification]] of the complex [[simple Lie algebra]]s, which fall into four infinite series labeled A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>''n''</sub>, C<sub>''n''</sub>, D<sub>''n''</sub>, and [[Exceptional simple Lie group|five exceptional cases]] labeled [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]], E<sub>8</sub>, [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], and [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]]. The E<sub>8</sub> algebra is the largest and most complicated of these exceptional cases.\n\n== Basic description ==\n\nThe [[Lie group]] E<sub>8</sub> has dimension 248. Its [[Cartan subgroup|rank]], which is the dimension of its [[maximal torus]], is eight (8).\n\nTherefore, the vectors of the root system are in eight-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]: they are described explicitly later in this article. The [[Weyl group]] of E<sub>8</sub>, which is the [[symmetry group|group of symmetries]] of the maximal torus which are induced by [[conjugacy class|conjugations]] in the whole group, has order 2{{sup|14}}{{nnbsp}}3{{sup|5}}{{nnbsp}}5{{sup|2}}{{nnbsp}}7 = {{gaps|696|729|600}}.\n\nThe compact group E<sub>8</sub> is unique among simple compact Lie groups in that its non-[[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] representation of smallest dimension is the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]] (of dimension 248) acting on the Lie algebra E<sub>8</sub> itself; it is also the unique one which has the following four properties: trivial center, compact, simply connected, and simply laced (all roots have the same length).\n\nThere is a Lie algebra [[En (Lie algebra)|E<sub>''k''</sub>]] for every integer ''k''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;3, which is infinite dimensional if ''k'' is greater than&nbsp;8.\n\n== Real and complex forms ==\n\nThere is a unique complex Lie algebra of type E<sub>8</sub>, corresponding to a complex group of complex dimension 248. The complex Lie group E<sub>8</sub> of [[complex dimension]] 248 can be considered as a simple real Lie group of real dimension 496. This is simply connected, has maximal [[Compact space|compact]] subgroup the compact form (see below) of E<sub>8</sub>, and has an outer automorphism group of order 2 generated by complex conjugation.\n\nAs well as the complex Lie group of type E<sub>8</sub>, there are three real forms of the Lie algebra, three real forms of the group with trivial center (two of which have non-algebraic double covers, giving two further real forms), all of real dimension 248, as follows:\n\n* The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which is simply connected and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n* The split form, EVIII (or E<sub>8(8)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup Spin(16)/('''Z'''/2'''Z'''), fundamental group of order 2 (implying that it has a [[Double covering group|double cover]], which is a simply connected Lie real group but is not algebraic, see [[#E8 as an algebraic group|below]]) and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n* EIX (or E<sub>8(\u221224)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup E<sub>7</sub>&times;SU(2)/(\u22121,\u22121), fundamental group of order 2 (again implying a double cover, which is not algebraic) and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n\nFor a complete list of real forms of simple Lie algebras, see the [[list of simple Lie groups]].\n\n== E<sub>8</sub> as an algebraic group ==\n\nBy means of a [[Chevalley basis]] for the Lie algebra, one can define E<sub>8</sub> as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as \u201cuntwisted\u201d) form of E<sub>8</sub>. Over an algebraically closed field, this is the only form; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or \u201ctwists\u201d of E<sub>8</sub>, which are classified in the general framework of [[Galois cohomology]] (over a [[perfect field]] ''k'') by the set H<sup>1</sup>(''k'',Aut(E<sub>8</sub>)) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E<sub>8</sub> (see [[#Dynkin diagram|below]]) has no automorphisms, coincides with H<sup>1</sup>(''k'',E<sub>8</sub>).<ref>{{citation |last1=\u041f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 |first1=\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041f. |last2=\u0420\u0430\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0447\u0443\u043a |first2=\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0421. |title=\u0410\u043b\u0433\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u044b \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0447\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b |year=1991 |publisher=\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 |isbn=5-02-014191-7}} (English translation: {{citation |last1=Platonov |first1=Vladimir P. |last2=Rapinchuk |first2=Andrei S. |title=Algebraic groups and number theory |year=1994 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-558180-7}}), \u00a72.2.4</ref>\n\nOver '''R''', the real connected component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E<sub>8</sub> coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned [[#Real and complex forms|above]], but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all forms of E<sub>8</sub> are simply connected in the sense of algebraic geometry, meaning that they admit no non-trivial algebraic coverings; the non-compact and simply connected real Lie group forms of E<sub>8</sub> are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations.\n\nOver finite fields, the [[Lang\u2013Steinberg theorem]] implies that H<sup>1</sup>(''k'',E<sub>8</sub>)=0, meaning that E<sub>8</sub> has no twisted forms: see [[#Chevalley groups of type E8|below]].\n\nThe characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the [[Weyl character formula]].  The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are {{OEIS|id=A121732}}:\n: 1, 248, 3875, 27000, 30380, 147250, 779247, 1763125, 2450240, 4096000, 4881384, 6696000, 26411008, 70680000, 76271625, 79143000, 146325270, 203205000, 281545875, 301694976, 344452500, 820260000, 1094951000, 2172667860, 2275896000, 2642777280, 2903770000, 3929713760, 4076399250, 4825673125, 6899079264, 8634368000 (twice), 12692520960&hellip;\n\nThe 248-dimensional representation is the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]].  There are two non-isomorphic irreducible representations of dimension 8634368000 (it is not unique; however, the next integer with this property is 175898504162692612600853299200000 {{OEIS|id=A181746}}).  The [[fundamental representation]]s are those with dimensions 3875, 6696000, 6899079264, 146325270, 2450240, 30380, 248 and 147250 (corresponding to the eight nodes in the [[#Dynkin diagram|Dynkin diagram]] in the order chosen for the [[#Cartan matrix|Cartan matrix]] below, i.e., the nodes are read in the seven-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the third).\n\nThe coefficients of the character formulas for infinite dimensional irreducible [[representation theory|representation]]s of E<sub>8</sub> depend on some large square matrices consisting of polynomials, the [[Lusztig\u2013Vogan polynomial]]s, an analogue of [[Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig polynomial]]s introduced for [[reductive group]]s in general by [[George Lusztig]] and [[David Kazhdan]] (1983). The values at 1 of the Lusztig\u2013Vogan polynomials give the coefficients of the matrices relating the standard representations (whose characters are easy to describe) with the irreducible representations.\n\nThese matrices were computed after four years of collaboration by a [[atlas of Lie groups and representations|group of 18 mathematicians and computer scientists]], led by [[Jeffrey Adams (mathematician)|Jeffrey Adams]], with much of the programming done by [[Fokko du Cloux]]. The most difficult case (for exceptional groups)  is the split [[real form]] of  E<sub>8</sub> (see above), where the largest matrix is  of size 453060\u00d7453060. The Lusztig\u2013Vogan polynomials for all other exceptional simple groups  have been known for some time; the calculation for the split form of ''E''<sub>8</sub> is far longer than any other case. The announcement of the result in March 2007 received extraordinary attention from the media (see the external links), to the surprise of the mathematicians working on it.\n\nThe representations of the E<sub>8</sub> groups over finite fields are given by [[Deligne\u2013Lusztig theory]].\n\n== Constructions ==\n\nOne can construct the (compact form of the) E<sub>8</sub> group as the [[automorphism group]] of the corresponding '''e'''<sub>8</sub> Lie algebra. This algebra has a 120-dimensional subalgebra '''so'''(16) generated by ''J''<sub>''ij''</sub> as well as 128 new generators ''Q''<sub>''a''</sub> that transform as a [[Weyl\u2013Majorana spinor]] of '''spin'''(16). These statements determine the commutators\n: <math>\\left[J_{ij}, J_{k\\ell}\\right] = \\delta_{jk}J_{i\\ell} - \\delta_{j\\ell}J_{ik} - \\delta_{ik}J_{j\\ell} + \\delta_{i\\ell}J_{jk}</math>\n\nas well as\n: <math>\\left[J_{ij}, Q_a\\right] = \\frac 14 \\left(\\gamma_i\\gamma_j-\\gamma_j\\gamma_i\\right)_{ab} Q_b,</math>\n\nwhile the remaining commutators (not anticommutators!) between the spinor generators are defined as\n: <math>\\left[Q_a, Q_b\\right] = \\gamma^{[i}_{ac}\\gamma^{j]}_{cb} J_{ij}.</math>\n\nIt is then possible to check that the [[Jacobi identity]] is satisfied.\n\n== Geometry ==\n\nThe compact real form of E<sub>8</sub> is the [[isometry group]] of the 128-dimensional exceptional compact [[Riemannian symmetric space]] EVIII (in Cartan's [[Riemannian symmetric space#Classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces|classification]]). It is known informally as the \"[[octooctonionic projective plane]]\" because it can be built using an algebra that is the tensor product of the [[octonion]]s with themselves, and is also known as a [[Rosenfeld projective plane]], though it does not obey the usual axioms of a projective plane. This can be seen systematically using a construction known as the [[Freudenthal magic square|''magic square'']], due to [[Hans Freudenthal]] and [[Jacques Tits]] {{harv|Landsberg|Manivel|2001}}.\n\n== E<sub>8</sub> root system ==\n[[File:e8 roots zome.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Zome]] model of the E<sub>8</sub> root system, projected into three-space, and represented by the vertices of the [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub> polytope]], {{CDD|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|branch|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea_1}}]]\n[[File:4_21_E8_to_3D_H3_symmetry_concentric_hulls.png|thumb|300px|Shown in 3D projection using the basis vectors [u,v,w] giving H3 symmetry:\n{{ubl\n | u {{=}} (1, ''\u03c6'', 0, \u22121, ''\u03c6'', 0,0,0)\n | v {{=}} (''\u03c6'', 0, 1, ''\u03c6'', 0, \u22121,0,0)\n | w {{=}} (0, 1, ''\u03c6'', 0, \u22121, ''\u03c6'',0,0)\n}}\n\nThe projected [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub> polytope]] vertices are sorted and tallied by their 3D norm generating the increasingly transparent hulls of each set of tallied norms.

In particular, the root system must be invariant under [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] through the hyperplane perpendicular to any root.\n\nThe '''E<sub>8</sub> root system''' is a rank 8 root system containing 240 root vectors spanning '''R'''<sup>8</sup>. It is [[Irreducibility (mathematics)|irreducible]] in the sense that it cannot be built from root systems of smaller rank. All the root vectors in E<sub>8</sub> have the same length. It is convenient for a number of purposes to normalize them to have length {{radic|2}}.  These 240 vectors are the vertices of a [[semi-regular polytope]] discovered by [[Thorold Gosset]] in 1900, sometimes known as the [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub> polytope]].\n\n===Construction===\nIn the so-called ''even coordinate system'', E<sub>8</sub> is given as the set of all vectors in '''R'''<sup>8</sup> with length squared equal to 2 such that coordinates are either all [[integer]]s or all [[half-integer]]s and the sum of the coordinates is even.\n\nExplicitly, there are 112 roots with integer entries obtained from\n: <math>\\left(\\pm 1,\\pm 1,0,0,0,0,0,0\\right)\\,</math>\n\nby taking an arbitrary combination of signs and an arbitrary [[permutation]] of coordinates, and 128 roots with half-integer entries obtained from\n: <math>\\left(\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12\\right) \\,</math>\n\nby taking an even number of minus signs (or, equivalently, requiring that the sum of all the eight coordinates be even). There are 240 roots in all.\n\n[[File:E8-with-thread.jpg|thumb|300px|E8 2d projection with thread made by hand]]\n\nThe 112 roots with integer entries form a D<sub>8</sub> root system. The E<sub>8</sub> root system also contains a copy of A<sub>8</sub> (which has 72 roots) as well as [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]] and [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]] (in fact, the latter two are usually ''defined'' as subsets of E<sub>8</sub>).\n\nIn the ''odd coordinate system'', E<sub>8</sub> is given by taking the roots in the even coordinate system and changing the sign of any one coordinate. The roots with integer entries are the same while those with half-integer entries have an odd number of minus signs rather than an even number.\n\n===Dynkin diagram===\nThe [[Dynkin diagram]] for E<sub>8</sub> is given by [[File:Dynkin diagram E8.svg|120px]].\n\nThis diagram gives a concise visual summary of the root structure. Each node of this diagram represents a simple root. A line joining two simple roots indicates that they are at an angle of 120\u00b0 to each other.

Since the adjoint representation can be described by the roots together with the generators in the [[Cartan subalgebra]], we may see that decomposition by looking at these. In this description,\n* (3,1) consists of the roots (0,0,0,0,0,0,1,\u22121), (0,0,0,0,0,0,\u22121,1) and the Cartan generator corresponding to the last dimension;\n* (1,133) consists of all roots with (1,1), (\u22121,\u22121), (0,0), (\u2212{{frac|1|2}},\u2212{{frac|1|2}}) or ({{frac|1|2}},{{frac|1|2}}) in the last two dimensions, together with the Cartan generators corresponding to the first seven dimensions;\n* (2,56) consists of all roots with permutations of (1,0), (\u22121,0) or ({{frac|1|2}},\u2212{{frac|1|2}}) in the last two dimensions.\n\nThe 248-dimensional adjoint representation of E<sub>8</sub>, when similarly restricted, transforms under E<sub>6</sub>\u00d7SU(3) as: (8,1) + (1,78) + (3,27) + (<u style=\"text-decoration:overline\">3</u>,<u style=\"text-decoration:overline\">27</u>).

It is contained in the [[Thompson sporadic group]], which acts on the underlying vector space of the Lie group E<sub>8</sub> but does not preserve the Lie bracket. The Thompson group fixes a lattice and does preserve the Lie bracket of this lattice mod 3, giving an embedding of the Thompson group into E<sub>8</sub>('''F'''<sub>3</sub>).\n\n== Applications ==\n\nThe E<sub>8</sub> Lie group has applications in [[theoretical physics]] and especially in [[string theory]] and [[supergravity]]. E<sub>8</sub>\u00d7E<sub>8</sub> is the [[gauge group]] of one of the two types of [[heterotic string]] and is one of two [[anomaly (physics)|anomaly-free]] gauge groups that can be coupled to the ''N''&nbsp;= 1 supergravity in ten dimensions. E<sub>8</sub> is the [[U-duality]] group of supergravity on an eight-torus (in its split form).\n\nOne way to incorporate the [[standard model]] of particle physics into heterotic string theory is the [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry breaking]] of E<sub>8</sub> to its maximal subalgebra SU(3)&times;E<sub>6</sub>.\n\nIn 1982, [[Michael Freedman]] used the [[E8 lattice|E<sub>8</sub> lattice]] to construct an example of a [[Topological manifold|topological]] [[4-manifold]], the [[E8 manifold|E<sub>8</sub> manifold]], which has no [[Differential structure|smooth structure]].\n\n[[Antony Garrett Lisi]]'s incomplete \"[[An Exceptionally Simple Theory of Everything]]\" attempts to describe all known [[fundamental interaction]]s in physics as part of the E<sub>8</sub> Lie algebra.<ref name=\"SciAm\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1210-54 |author1=A.

This is simply connected, has maximal [[Compact space|compact]] subgroup the compact form (see below) of E<sub>8</sub>, and has an outer automorphism group of order 2 generated by complex conjugation.\n\nAs well as the complex Lie group of type E<sub>8</sub>, there are three real forms of the Lie algebra, three real forms of the group with trivial center (two of which have non-algebraic double covers, giving two further real forms), all of real dimension 248, as follows:\n\n* The compact form (which is usually the one meant if no other information is given), which is simply connected and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n* The split form, EVIII (or E<sub>8(8)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup Spin(16)/('''Z'''/2'''Z'''), fundamental group of order 2 (implying that it has a [[Double covering group|double cover]], which is a simply connected Lie real group but is not algebraic, see [[#E8 as an algebraic group|below]]) and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n* EIX (or E<sub>8(\u221224)</sub>), which has maximal compact subgroup E<sub>7</sub>&times;SU(2)/(\u22121,\u22121), fundamental group of order 2 (again implying a double cover, which is not algebraic) and has trivial outer automorphism group.\n\nFor a complete list of real forms of simple Lie algebras, see the [[list of simple Lie groups]].\n\n== E<sub>8</sub> as an algebraic group ==\n\nBy means of a [[Chevalley basis]] for the Lie algebra, one can define E<sub>8</sub> as a linear algebraic group over the integers and, consequently, over any commutative ring and in particular over any field: this defines the so-called split (sometimes also known as \u201cuntwisted\u201d) form of E<sub>8</sub>. Over an algebraically closed field, this is the only form; however, over other fields, there are often many other forms, or \u201ctwists\u201d of E<sub>8</sub>, which are classified in the general framework of [[Galois cohomology]] (over a [[perfect field]] ''k'') by the set H<sup>1</sup>(''k'',Aut(E<sub>8</sub>)) which, because the Dynkin diagram of E<sub>8</sub> (see [[#Dynkin diagram|below]]) has no automorphisms, coincides with H<sup>1</sup>(''k'',E<sub>8</sub>).<ref>{{citation |last1=\u041f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 |first1=\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041f. |last2=\u0420\u0430\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0447\u0443\u043a |first2=\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0421. |title=\u0410\u043b\u0433\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u044b \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0447\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b |year=1991 |publisher=\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 |isbn=5-02-014191-7}} (English translation: {{citation |last1=Platonov |first1=Vladimir P. |last2=Rapinchuk |first2=Andrei S. |title=Algebraic groups and number theory |year=1994 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-558180-7}}), \u00a72.2.4</ref>\n\nOver '''R''', the real connected component of the identity of these algebraically twisted forms of E<sub>8</sub> coincide with the three real Lie groups mentioned [[#Real and complex forms|above]], but with a subtlety concerning the fundamental group: all forms of E<sub>8</sub> are simply connected in the sense of algebraic geometry, meaning that they admit no non-trivial algebraic coverings; the non-compact and simply connected real Lie group forms of E<sub>8</sub> are therefore not algebraic and admit no faithful finite-dimensional representations.\n\nOver finite fields, the [[Lang\u2013Steinberg theorem]] implies that H<sup>1</sup>(''k'',E<sub>8</sub>)=0, meaning that E<sub>8</sub> has no twisted forms: see [[#Chevalley groups of type E8|below]].\n\nThe characters of finite dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the [[Weyl character formula]].  The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are {{OEIS|id=A121732}}:\n: 1, 248, 3875, 27000, 30380, 147250, 779247, 1763125, 2450240, 4096000, 4881384, 6696000, 26411008, 70680000, 76271625, 79143000, 146325270, 203205000, 281545875, 301694976, 344452500, 820260000, 1094951000, 2172667860, 2275896000, 2642777280, 2903770000, 3929713760, 4076399250, 4825673125, 6899079264, 8634368000 (twice), 12692520960&hellip;\n\nThe 248-dimensional representation is the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]].

The [[fundamental representation]]s are those with dimensions 3875, 6696000, 6899079264, 146325270, 2450240, 30380, 248 and 147250 (corresponding to the eight nodes in the [[#Dynkin diagram|Dynkin diagram]] in the order chosen for the [[#Cartan matrix|Cartan matrix]] below, i.e., the nodes are read in the seven-node chain first, with the last node being connected to the third).\n\nThe coefficients of the character formulas for infinite dimensional irreducible [[representation theory|representation]]s of E<sub>8</sub> depend on some large square matrices consisting of polynomials, the [[Lusztig\u2013Vogan polynomial]]s, an analogue of [[Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig polynomial]]s introduced for [[reductive group]]s in general by [[George Lusztig]] and [[David Kazhdan]] (1983). The values at 1 of the Lusztig\u2013Vogan polynomials give the coefficients of the matrices relating the standard representations (whose characters are easy to describe) with the irreducible representations.\n\nThese matrices were computed after four years of collaboration by a [[atlas of Lie groups and representations|group of 18 mathematicians and computer scientists]], led by [[Jeffrey Adams (mathematician)|Jeffrey Adams]], with much of the programming done by [[Fokko du Cloux]]. The most difficult case (for exceptional groups)  is the split [[real form]] of  E<sub>8</sub> (see above), where the largest matrix is  of size 453060\u00d7453060. The Lusztig\u2013Vogan polynomials for all other exceptional simple groups  have been known for some time; the calculation for the split form of ''E''<sub>8</sub> is far longer than any other case. The announcement of the result in March 2007 received extraordinary attention from the media (see the external links), to the surprise of the mathematicians working on it.\n\nThe representations of the E<sub>8</sub> groups over finite fields are given by [[Deligne\u2013Lusztig theory]].\n\n== Constructions ==\n\nOne can construct the (compact form of the) E<sub>8</sub> group as the [[automorphism group]] of the corresponding '''e'''<sub>8</sub> Lie algebra. This algebra has a 120-dimensional subalgebra '''so'''(16) generated by ''J''<sub>''ij''</sub> as well as 128 new generators ''Q''<sub>''a''</sub> that transform as a [[Weyl\u2013Majorana spinor]] of '''spin'''(16).

It is known informally as the \"[[octooctonionic projective plane]]\" because it can be built using an algebra that is the tensor product of the [[octonion]]s with themselves, and is also known as a [[Rosenfeld projective plane]], though it does not obey the usual axioms of a projective plane. This can be seen systematically using a construction known as the [[Freudenthal magic square|''magic square'']], due to [[Hans Freudenthal]] and [[Jacques Tits]] {{harv|Landsberg|Manivel|2001}}.\n\n== E<sub>8</sub> root system ==\n[[File:e8 roots zome.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Zome]] model of the E<sub>8</sub> root system, projected into three-space, and represented by the vertices of the [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub> polytope]], {{CDD|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|branch|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea_1}}]]\n[[File:4_21_E8_to_3D_H3_symmetry_concentric_hulls.png|thumb|300px|Shown in 3D projection using the basis vectors [u,v,w] giving H3 symmetry:\n{{ubl\n | u {{=}} (1, ''\u03c6'', 0, \u22121, ''\u03c6'', 0,0,0)\n | v {{=}} (''\u03c6'', 0, 1, ''\u03c6'', 0, \u22121,0,0)\n | w {{=}} (0, 1, ''\u03c6'', 0, \u22121, ''\u03c6'',0,0)\n}}\n\nThe projected [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub> polytope]] vertices are sorted and tallied by their 3D norm generating the increasingly transparent hulls of each set of tallied norms.

In particular, the root system must be invariant under [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] through the hyperplane perpendicular to any root.\n\nThe '''E<sub>8</sub> root system''' is a rank 8 root system containing 240 root vectors spanning '''R'''<sup>8</sup>. It is [[Irreducibility (mathematics)|irreducible]] in the sense that it cannot be built from root systems of smaller rank. All the root vectors in E<sub>8</sub> have the same length. It is convenient for a number of purposes to normalize them to have length {{radic|2}}.  These 240 vectors are the vertices of a [[semi-regular polytope]] discovered by [[Thorold Gosset]] in 1900, sometimes known as the [[4 21 polytope|4<sub>21</sub> polytope]].\n\n===Construction===\nIn the so-called ''even coordinate system'', E<sub>8</sub> is given as the set of all vectors in '''R'''<sup>8</sup> with length squared equal to 2 such that coordinates are either all [[integer]]s or all [[half-integer]]s and the sum of the coordinates is even.\n\nExplicitly, there are 112 roots with integer entries obtained from\n: <math>\\left(\\pm 1,\\pm 1,0,0,0,0,0,0\\right)\\,</math>\n\nby taking an arbitrary combination of signs and an arbitrary [[permutation]] of coordinates, and 128 roots with half-integer entries obtained from\n: <math>\\left(\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12,\\pm\\tfrac12\\right) \\,</math>\n\nby taking an even number of minus signs (or, equivalently, requiring that the sum of all the eight coordinates be even). There are 240 roots in all.\n\n[[File:E8-with-thread.jpg|thumb|300px|E8 2d projection with thread made by hand]]\n\nThe 112 roots with integer entries form a D<sub>8</sub> root system. The E<sub>8</sub> root system also contains a copy of A<sub>8</sub> (which has 72 roots) as well as [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]] and [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]] (in fact, the latter two are usually ''defined'' as subsets of E<sub>8</sub>).\n\nIn the ''odd coordinate system'', E<sub>8</sub> is given by taking the roots in the even coordinate system and changing the sign of any one coordinate. The roots with integer entries are the same while those with half-integer entries have an odd number of minus signs rather than an even number.\n\n===Dynkin diagram===\nThe [[Dynkin diagram]] for E<sub>8</sub> is given by [[File:Dynkin diagram E8.svg|120px]].\n\nThis diagram gives a concise visual summary of the root structure. Each node of this diagram represents a simple root. A line joining two simple roots indicates that they are at an angle of 120\u00b0 to each other. Two simple roots which are not joined by a line are [[orthogonal]].\n\n===Cartan matrix===\nThe [[Cartan matrix]] of a rank ''r'' root system is an ''r \u00d7 r'' [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] whose entries are derived from the simple roots. Specifically, the entries of the Cartan matrix are given by\n: <math>A_{ij} = 2\\frac{\\left(\\alpha_i, \\alpha_j\\right)}{\\left(\\alpha_i, \\alpha_i\\right)}</math>\n\nwhere (\u2212,\u2212) is the Euclidean [[inner product]] and ''\u03b1<sub>i</sub>'' are the simple roots.

It is located in the northern half of [[Germany]], south of [[Berlin]]. The history of [[Leipzig]] from 1933 to 1939, is affected by the actions of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime. From the beginning of the Nazi party's rise to power in 1933, to the beginning of [[World War II]] in 1939, Leipzig was an important city to the regime. Thousands of [[Jews]] were transported to and from this city as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s plans for the Jewish people evolved. Between the years of 1933 to 1939, Jews suffered from the implementation of over 400 anti-Jewish policies, laws, and regulations.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007901|title=Antisemitic Legislation 1933-1939|website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum}}</ref> However, other than the history of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], Leipzig, Germany has a rich history and culture.\n\n== 1933 ==\nRelations were strengthened with south-eastern European countries once the Nazis rose to power, because Nazi leaders orchestrated agreements and under-hand deals.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Stephen|date=February 2012|title=Selling Germany in South-Eastern Europe: Economic Uncertainty, Commercial Information and the Leipzig Trade Fair 1920-40|url=|journal=Contemporary European History|volume=21|pages=|via=ProQuest}}</ref> Because of Germany's relatively large size compared to other European countries, it was easier to gain economic power in trade, especially the power they had from the [[Leipzig Trade Fair]], and use that as leverage to force countries like former [[Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], and [[Bulgaria]] to tolerate German power.<ref name=\":1\" /> Eventually, after the Nazi party's rise to power in 1933, the Trade Fair was no longer as valuable to Nazi Germany and its economy because it relied on foreign goods to maintain its military strength. As the Nazi party began implementing anti-Jewish policies and expelling Jews, mainly male, from their high positions in the arts and academics, Jewish women began to lead the households, maintain the mental health of her family members, and urge them to immigrate and escape the evils coming.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany|last=Kaplan|first=Marion|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> April 7, 1933 the Law for the Restoration and Civil Service was passed by Nazi leaders.<ref name=\":2\" /> This law allowed for the dismissal of Jews and other \"politically unreliable\" people from their positions in civil service including lawyers and doctors.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Saxon Ministry for Popular Education issued a directive to the schools of Leipzig, Germany in April 1933 that effectively called for the further segregation of Jews and Aryans in school that would later lead to more a more violent separation between the groups.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Willingham|first=Robert|date=|title=Jews in Leipzig: Nationality and community in the 20th century|url=|journal=The University of Texas as Austin|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\n== 1934 ==\nAt the Leipzig Trade Fair in 1934, the [[Economics Minister of Germany|Economics Minister]] and Reichbank director, [[Hjalmar Schacht]], included the agreements and deals from the 1933 Nazi rise to power in the New Plan for foreign trade.<ref name=\":1\" /> Adolf Hitler was determined to rearm the German military lead to foreign crises regarding foreign currency, but his determination harmed the economy.<ref name=\":1\" /> It was only the Leipzig Trade Fair that saved the German economy; because of its established reputation and network among other European countries, Germany was able to regulate trade licenses and prioritize importation to ultimately improve their exportation success and prevent further deficit.<ref name=\":1\" /> As the economy worsened, so did tensions for the Jews. Because of activity that was deemed rebellious or against the Nazi regime, 1,600 people were arrested in Leipzig towards the end of 1934.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jewish youth in various youth groups were prohibited from wearing uniforms and displaying pennants like their [[Aryan]] peers to help create a distinction between Aryan and non-Aryan.<ref name=\":3\" /> This rampant antisemitism caused Jews to flee the country. Eight hundred Jews emigrated from Leipzig to Palestine between the years of 1933 and 1935 to seek freedom from their religious persecution and escape the Nazi regime.<ref name=\":3\" /> To combat the antisemitic policies and decrees, Jews joined together in an attempt to save their culture.<ref name=\":3\" /> In December, over 575 Jews made up the Cultural Organization of the German Jews, or Kulturbund Deutscher Juden Ortsgruppe Leipzig as it later became known as, which was an organization dedicated to keeping Jewish culture alive and providing an outlet to Jews whose lifestyles were

were expelled from schools in the state of Saxony by order of the Saxon education ministry and were to be transferred to various religious schools.<ref name=\":3\" /> On June 8, 1935 Jews were banned from all public baths and pools.<ref name=\":3\" /> In October, the [[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinde]], a German township, created a \"Lehrhaus\" to accommodate the Jewish children who were barred from

It is located in the northern half of [[Germany]], south of [[Berlin]]. The history of [[Leipzig]] from 1933 to 1939, is affected by the actions of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime. From the beginning of the Nazi party's rise to power in 1933, to the beginning of [[World War II]] in 1939, Leipzig was an important city to the regime. Thousands of [[Jews]] were transported to and from this city as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s plans for the Jewish people evolved.

In Domesday Book (1087) the county is recorded as ''Ledecestrescire'' and in 1124 ''Le\u00feec\u00e6strescir'' occurs.<ref>Ekwall, Eilert (1940) ''The Concise Dictionary of English Place-names''; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 280</ref>\n\nLeicestershire's external boundaries have changed little since the Domesday Survey.  The [[Measham]]-[[Donisthorpe]] [[exclave]] of [[Derbyshire]] has been exchanged for the [[Netherseal]]/[[Overseal]] area, and the urban expansion of [[Market Harborough]] has caused [[Little Bowden]], previously in [[Northamptonshire]] to be annexed.\n\n===Hundreds===\nLeicestershire was recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in four [[wapentake]]s: [[Guthlaxton]], [[Framland]], [[Goscote]] and [[Gartree (hundred)|Gartree]]. These later became [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s, with the division of Goscote into [[West Goscote]] and [[East Goscote (hundred)|East Goscote]], and the addition of [[Sparkenhoe]] hundred.\n\n===Roads and tracks===\n====Prehistoric tracks====\nAs the county was not densely inhabited before the 10th century there are few traces of early trackways. The prehistoric trackway (\"Jurassic Trackway\") which linked the downlands of [[Wiltshire]] with the wolds of [[Yorkshire]] did cross the county having followed the top of the [[Northamptonshire]] uplands. Where the escarpment had broken down as it had in Northamptonshire and Leicestershire it is impossible to know what route was followed; however where the uplands formed a narrow belt the approximate line of it can be identified. It is likely to have been in use already in the early Bronze Age (c. 1900-1500 BC) but if not so early than certainly during the middle Bronze Age (1500-1000 BC). The route of the trackway passes near [[Husbands Bosworth]] and Tilton and further on passes into Lincolnshire where it follows [[Lincoln Edge]] before crossing the River Humber into Yorkshire.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', p. 18</ref>\n\nAnother prehistoric road came from the Fens and crossed the limestone plateau round [[Croxton Kerrial]] and [[Saltby]], then went between Eastwell and [[Goadby Marwood]] and then southwestwards past [[Wartnaby]] and Six Hills to reach the Soar at Barrow. Possibly it continued into [[Charnwood Forest]] as Beacon Hill was probably an inhabited Bronze Age site, and possibly terminated at [[Bardon Hill]].<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', p. 19-20</ref>\n\nAnother ancient east to west road crossed the dry limestone plateau and provided a link between the Welland and the Trent. It begins at Stamford (whose name means \"stone ford\", a ford by which the Welland was crossed) following the line of [[Ermine Street]] (a Roman road) but diverges from the Roman road towards the left and rises to its summit of 500 feet near [[Buckminster]]; thereafter it crosses Saltby heath and goes by Three Queens to reach the [[Vale of Belvoir]] where its course cannot be identified. Beyond the vale it probably went through [[Long Bennington]] to the banks of the [[River Trent]] at or near [[Newark, England|Newark]]. This road may have been in use as early as the Bronze Age but if not so early then its use began in the early Iron Age. It remained in use in ancient British, Roman and early Anglian times.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', p. 20</ref>\n\nSewstern Lane (also known as The Drift) is an old road which was used throughout the Middle Ages, probably as the most direct way between the great fairs of Nottingham and Stamford. A more direct route came into use later via Stonesby and Waltham on the Wolds. Sewstern Lane became less used after the mid 17th century, apart from its use by the Earls of Rutland on their journeys to London from Belvoir. When coaches started to run in the later 17th century a different route was taken via Stretton, Colsterworth and Great Ponton since Sewstern Lane would have provided insufficient staging posts where food for men and horses would be available. It continued in use as a drove road for cattle until the advent of railways changed the means of transport.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', pp. 21-23</ref>\n\nThe plateau round Tilton was a meeting place for prehistoric tracks: one of these which is called in its latter stages Ridgemere Lane runs north of Cold Newton, by New York farm to the edge of the flood plain of the Wreak near Syston. Part of it coincides with parish boundaries, proof that it predates the delimiting of parishes in the pre-Conquest era. Another old way goes above Lowesby and South Croxton and comes down to the edge of the plain at [[Queniborough]]. No dating of these two tracks is possible except that they are pre-Roman in origin.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', p. 23</ref>\n\nAnother very old road, perhaps a true ridgeway of the Bronze Age, comes westwards from Stamford and follows a limestone ridge then goes by Edith Weston, Manton and Martinsthorpe (a deserted village) to enter Leicestershire near Withcote. It goes from there along the high ground through Halstead and so to Tilton. From Tilton it continues westward by Billesdon Coplow and the site of the abandoned village of Ingarsby; near Scraptoft it follows Scraptoft Lane and reaches the gravel terrace by the banks of the Soar where Leicester would in later times be founded. It is not certain that this was a through route in prehistoric times but it was such in the Middle Ages and was used by Leicester merchants to reach the fairs of Stamford.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', pp. 23-24</ref>\n\n====Roman roads====\n[[File:Course of a former Roman Road - geograph.org.uk - 693524.jpg|thumb|The course of a former Roman road]]\nThere are about 76 miles of Roman roads in the county: these are well marked on Ordnance Survey maps. Another Roman road, [[Watling Street]], forms  the county's boundary with Warwickshire. The longest single stretch of road is from High Cross to the vanished Roman station of [[Vernemetum]]. This passes through Leicester and is part of the [[Fosse Way]], constructed about 46-48 AD. The section northwards to Vernemetum forms the present main road to Newark. The next road in age is Watling Street, which dates from 50-51 AD. The road from Leicester to [[Mancetter]] (Manduessum) was probably made some 20 years later than Watling Street. Parts of this route became disused in Anglo-Saxon times as that people established no villages nearby.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', pp. 24-26</ref>\n\n====Medieval roads and bridges====\n[[File:The Seven Arch Bridge, Rearsby - geograph.org.uk - 50084.jpg|thumb|The Seven Arch Bridge, [[Rearsby]]]]\nThe Anglo-Saxons were not road makers but the paths and tracks which connected their villages with those nearby form the basis for the modern road system. There are some green tracks in the county of probable Anglo-Saxon origin which are also followed by parish boundaries (these are often called \"The Mere\", mere meaning boundary). One of these runs from [[Countesthorpe]] towards Gilmorton and another, long known as \"The Old Mere\", from the Wigston Magna - Newton Harcourt road nearly to Houghton on the Hill. In the 13th and 14th centuries various fairs and markets were established in some of the villages; those that prospered led to the villages becoming  market towns. Between fair and market towns roads became established and communication was also aided by the building to bridges. Most of the medieval bridges of the county outside Leicester were built in the second half of the 13th century or very early in the 14th. None of these early stone bridges survives but there are some later ones in existence at Aylestone, Anstey, Enderby Mill (the road to it was diverted away when turnpikes were built) and Rearsby. These are of uncertain date but probably not earlier than the 15th century.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', pp. 26-28</ref>\n\n===Rutland and Leicester===\nIn 1974, due to the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the county of [[Rutland]] was annexed to Leicestershire as a [[Districts of England|district]], and [[Leicester]]'s [[county borough]] status was abolished, it becoming a district also.\n\nIn 1974, the [[Local Government Act 1972]] abolished the [[county borough]] status of Leicester and the county status of neighbouring [[Rutland]], converting both to administrative [[Districts of England|districts]] of Leicestershire. These actions were reversed on 1 April 1997, when Rutland and the City of Leicester became unitary authorities. Rutland became a distinct [[Ceremonial County]] once again, although it continues to be policed by [[Leicestershire Constabulary]].\n\n==Early history==\nThe earthworks of Leicestershire include hill-top camps of the 1st century BC and the sites of deserted villages abandoned in the later Middle Ages. There are hill-forts, Roman camps (e.g. [[Ratby]]), linear earthworks, castle-sites (e.g.[[Hallaton]]), moated homesteads and sites of deserted villages (e.g. [[Ingarsby]]). The remains of prehistoric burial mounds and tumuli are scanty. The county was sparsely populated up to the 10th century AD and a large part of it was thickly wooded areas of heavy clay. However, during the rest of the Middle Ages most of the land was progressively cleared and settled; so that it became populous and prosperous, but more so in the eastern half and in the southeast.<ref>Hoskins, W. G. (1950). ''The Heritage of Leicestershire''. Leicester: City of Leicester Publicity Department. p. 1.</ref>\n\nTogether with Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Rutland and Northamptonshire Leicestershire was inhabited by the ancient British tribe formerly known as [[Coritani]] (now corrected to [[Corieltauvi]]). After the Roman conquest it was included in the province of [[Flavia Caesariensis]]. In Anglo-Saxon times the land was settled by the [[Middle Angles]] (i.e. the Angles between the East Angles and the Mercians) whose territory was later included in the kingdom of [[Mercia]]. From the reign of [[Egbert, King of Wessex]], the kings of Wessex also ruled Mercia. The division of the kingdom into shires or counties was probably done about 800 or even earlier. During the incursions of the [[Danes]] the midlands were frequently plundered and laid waste.<ref>Curtis, John (1831). ''A Topographical History of the County of Leicester''. Ashby-de-la-Zouch: W. Hextall. p. ix.</ref> After the Danish invasions it was included in the [[Danelaw]], whose boundary ran on the south-western boundary of the shire.\n\n===Diocese===\nA bishopric of the Middle Angles was established here in 680, and the Anglo-Saxon cathedral was probably located close to (if not on the site of) the present cathedral.  The original diocese fell victim to the invasion by the Danes around 870 and after the establishment of the [[Danelaw]] in 886 the diocese's seat was moved to Oxfordshire and, taking over the existing [[Diocese of Lindine]] (created in 678), became the [[Mercian Diocese of Dorchester|Diocese of Dorchester]].\n\n==20th century==\nAfter the division of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]] in 1541 the county was part of the Diocese of Peterborough. In the 19th century there were [[suffragan bishop]]s of Leicester whilst the county was still within the [[Anglican Diocese of Peterborough|Diocese of Peterborough]]. The modern diocese of Leicester was founded on 12 November 1926 from the archdeaconries of Leicester and Loughborough and part of the [[Archdeaconry of Northampton]], all from the Diocese of Peterborough.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33220|date=12 November 1926|page=7322}}</ref> [[Leicester Cathedral|St Martin's Church, Leicester]], was elevated as the cathedral of the new see.\n\n==County symbol==\n[[File:Straw fox - geograph.org.uk - 559950.jpg|thumb|A straw fox at Long Whatton]]\nThe crest of the county council, and the emblem of [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club]], [[Leicester City FC]] and Leicestershire Scouts is the [[red fox]].

In Domesday Book (1087) the county is recorded as ''Ledecestrescire'' and in 1124 ''Le\u00feec\u00e6strescir'' occurs.<ref>Ekwall, Eilert (1940) ''The Concise Dictionary of English Place-names''; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 280</ref>\n\nLeicestershire's external boundaries have changed little since the Domesday Survey.  The [[Measham]]-[[Donisthorpe]] [[exclave]] of [[Derbyshire]] has been exchanged for the [[Netherseal]]/[[Overseal]] area, and the urban expansion of [[Market Harborough]] has caused [[Little Bowden]], previously in [[Northamptonshire]] to be annexed.\n\n===Hundreds===\nLeicestershire was recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in four [[wapentake]]s: [[Guthlaxton]], [[Framland]], [[Goscote]] and [[Gartree (hundred)|Gartree]]. These later became [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s, with the division of Goscote into [[West Goscote]] and [[East Goscote (hundred)|East Goscote]], and the addition of [[Sparkenhoe]] hundred.\n\n===Roads and tracks===\n====Prehistoric tracks====\nAs the county was not densely inhabited before the 10th century there are few traces of early trackways. The prehistoric trackway (\"Jurassic Trackway\") which linked the downlands of [[Wiltshire]] with the wolds of [[Yorkshire]] did cross the county having followed the top of the [[Northamptonshire]] uplands. Where the escarpment had broken down as it had in Northamptonshire and Leicestershire it is impossible to know what route was followed; however where the uplands formed a narrow belt the approximate line of it can be identified. It is likely to have been in use already in the early Bronze age (c. 1900-1500 BC) but if not so early than certainly during the middle Bronze age (1500-1000 BC). The route of the trackway passes near [[Husbands Bosworth]] and Tilton and further on passes into Lincolnshire where it follows [[Lincoln Edge]] before crossing the River Humber into Yorkshire.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', p. 18</ref>\n\nAnother prehistoric road came from the Fens and crossed the limestone plateau round [[Croxton Kerrial]] and [[Saltby]], then went between Eastwell and [[Goadby Marwood]] and then southwestwards past [[Wartnaby]] and Six Hills to reach the Soar at Barrow. Possibly it continued into [[Charnwood Forest]] as Beacon Hill was probably an inhabited Bronze age site, and possibly terminated at [[Bardon Hill]].<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', p. 19-20</ref>\n\nAnother ancient east to west road crossed the dry limestone plateau and provided a link between the Welland and the Trent. It begins at Stamford (whose name means \"stone ford\", a ford by which the Welland was crossed) following the line of [[Ermine Street]] (a Roman road) but diverges from the Roman road towards the left and rises to its summit of 500 feet near [[Buckminster]]; thereafter it crosses Saltby heath and goes by Three Queens to reach the [[Vale of Belvoir]] where its course cannot be identified. Beyond the vale it probably went through [[Long Bennington]] to the banks of the [[River Trent]] at or near [[Newark, England|Newark]]. This road may have been in use as early as the Bronze age but if not so early then its use began in the early Iron age. It remained in use in ancient British, Roman and early Anglian times.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', p. 20</ref>\n\nSewstern Lane (also known as The Drift) is an old road which was used throughout the Middle Ages, probably as the most direct way between the great fairs of Nottingham and Stamford. A more direct route came into use later via Stonesby and Waltham on the Wolds. Sewstern Lane became less used after the mid 17th century, apart from its use by the Earls of Rutland on their journeys to London from Belvoir. When coaches started to run in the later 17th century a different route was taken via Stretton, Colsterworth and Great Ponton since Sewstern Lane would have provided insufficient staging posts where food for men and horses would be available. It continued in use as a drove road for cattle until the advent of railways changed the means of transport.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', pp. 21-23</ref>\n\nThe plateau round Tilton was a meeting place for prehistoric tracks: one of these which is called in its latter stages Ridgemere Lane runs north of Cold Newton, by New York farm to the edge of the flood plain of the Wreak near Syston. Part of it coincides with parish boundaries, proof that it predates the delimiting of parishes in the pre-Conquest era. Another old way goes above Lowesby and South Croxton and comes down to the edge of the plain at [[Queniborough]]. No dating of these two tracks is possible except that they are pre-Roman in origin.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', p. 23</ref>\n\nAnother very old road, perhaps a true ridgeway of the Bronze age, comes westwards from Stamford and follows a limestone ridge then goes by Edith Weston, Manton and Martinsthorpe (a deserted village) to enter Leicestershire near Withcote. It goes from there along the high ground through Halstead and so to Tilton. From Tilton it continues westward by Billesdon Coplow and the site of the abandoned village of Ingarsby; near Scraptoft it follows Scraptoft Lane and reaches the gravel terrace by the banks of the Soar where Leicester would in later times be founded. It is not certain that this was a through route in prehistoric times but it was such in the Middle Ages and was used by Leicester merchants to reach the fairs of Stamford.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', pp. 23-24</ref>\n\n====Roman roads====\n[[File:Course of a former Roman Road - geograph.org.uk - 693524.jpg|thumb|The course of a former Roman road]]\nThere are about 76 miles of Roman roads in the county: these are well marked on Ordnance Survey maps. Another Roman road, [[Watling Street]], forms  the county's boundary with Warwickshire. The longest single stretch of road is from High Cross to the vanished Roman station of [[Vernemetum]]. This passes through Leicester and is part of the [[Fosse Way]], constructed about 46-48 AD. The section northwards to Vernemetum forms the present main road to Newark. The next road in age is Watling Street, which dates from 50-51 AD. The road from Leicester to [[Mancetter]] (Manduessum) was probably made some 20 years later than Watling Street. Parts of this route became disused in Anglo-Saxon times as that people established no villages nearby.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', pp. 24-26</ref>\n\n====Medieval roads and bridges====\n[[File:The Seven Arch Bridge, Rearsby - geograph.org.uk - 50084.jpg|thumb|The Seven Arch Bridge, [[Rearsby]]]]\nThe Anglo-Saxons were not road makers but the paths and tracks which connected their villages with those nearby form the basis for the modern road system. There are some green tracks in the county of probable Anglo-Saxon origin which are also followed by parish boundaries (these are often called \"The Mere\", mere meaning boundary). One of these runs from [[Countesthorpe]] towards Gilmorton and another, long known as \"The Old Mere\", from the Wigston Magna - Newton Harcourt road nearly to Houghton on the Hill. In the 13th and 14th centuries various fairs and markets were established in some of the villages; those that prospered led to the villages becoming  market towns. Between fair and market towns roads became established and communication was also aided by the building to bridges. Most of the medieval bridges of the county outside Leicester were built in the second half of the 13th century or very early in the 14th. None of these early stone bridges survives but there are some later ones in existence at Aylestone, Anstey, Enderby Mill (the road to it was diverted away when turnpikes were built) and Rearsby. These are of uncertain date but probably not earlier than the 15th century.<ref>Hoskins ''Heritage'', pp. 26-28</ref>\n\n===Rutland and Leicester===\nIn 1974, due to the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the county of [[Rutland]] was annexed to Leicestershire as a [[Districts of England|district]], and [[Leicester]]'s [[county borough]] status was abolished, it becoming a district also.\n\nIn 1974, the [[Local Government Act 1972]] abolished the [[county borough]] status of Leicester and the county status of neighbouring [[Rutland]], converting both to administrative [[Districts of England|districts]] of Leicestershire. These actions were reversed on 1 April 1997, when Rutland and the City of Leicester became unitary authorities. Rutland became a distinct [[Ceremonial County]] once again, although it continues to be policed by [[Leicestershire Constabulary]].\n\n==Early history==\nThe earthworks of Leicestershire include hill-top camps of the 1st century BC and the sites of deserted villages abandoned in the later middle ages. There are hill-forts, Roman camps (e.g. [[Ratby]]), linear earthworks, castle-sites (e.g.[[Hallaton]]), moated homesteads and sites of deserted villages (e.g. [[Ingarsby]]). The remains of prehistoric burial mounds and tumuli are scanty. The county was sparsely populated up to the 10th century AD and a large part of it was thickly wooded areas of heavy clay. However during the rest of the middle ages most of the land was progressively cleared and settled; so that it became populous and prosperous, but more so in the eastern half and in the southeast.<ref>Hoskins, W. G. (1950). ''The Heritage of Leicestershire''. Leicester: City of Leicester Publicity Department. p. 1.</ref>\n\nTogether with Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Rutland and Northamptonshire Leicestershire was inhabited by the ancient British tribe formerly known as [[Coritani]] (now corrected to [[Corieltauvi]]). After the Roman conquest it was included in the province of [[Flavia Caesariensis]]. In Anglo-Saxon times the land was settled by the [[Middle Angles]] (i.e. the Angles between the East Angles and the Mercians) whose territory was later included in the kingdom of [[Mercia]]. From the reign of [[Egbert, King of Wessex]], the kings of Wessex also ruled Mercia. The division of the kingdom into shires or counties was probably done about 800 or even earlier. During the incursions of the [[Danes]] the midlands were frequently plundered and laid waste.<ref>Curtis, John (1831). ''A Topographical History of the County of Leicester''. Ashby-de-la-Zouch: W. Hextall. p. ix.</ref> After the Danish invasions it was included in the [[Danelaw]], whose boundary ran on the south-western boundary of the shire.\n\n===Diocese===\nA bishopric of the Middle Angles was established here in 680, and the Anglo-Saxon cathedral was probably located close to (if not on the site of) the present cathedral.  The original diocese fell victim to the invasion by the Danes around 870 and after the establishment of the [[Danelaw]] in 886 the diocese's seat was moved to Oxfordshire and, taking over the existing [[Diocese of Lindine]] (created in 678), became the [[Mercian Diocese of Dorchester|Diocese of Dorchester]].\n\n==20th century==\nAfter the division of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]] in 1541 the county was part of the Diocese of Peterborough. In the 19th century there were [[suffragan bishop]]s of Leicester whilst the county was still within the [[Anglican Diocese of Peterborough|Diocese of Peterborough]]. The modern diocese of Leicester was founded on 12 November 1926 from the archdeaconries of Leicester and Loughborough and part of the [[Archdeaconry of Northampton]], all from the Diocese of Peterborough.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=33220|date=12 November 1926|page=7322}}</ref> [[Leicester Cathedral|St Martin's Church, Leicester]], was elevated as the cathedral of the new see.\n\n==County symbol==\n[[File:Straw fox - geograph.org.uk - 559950.jpg|thumb|A straw fox at Long Whatton]]\nThe crest of the county council, and the emblem of [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club]], [[Leicester City FC]] and Leicestershire Scouts is the [[red fox]].
