Single-mindedly, and with an enthusiasm far exceeding any artistic talent, he sets to work on his supposed masterpiece ''[[Aphrodite]] at the Waterhole'', moving to [[Paris]] where he expects his genius will be appreciated. While his ideas and persona gain acceptance (indeed plaudits) among the \"[[Beat generation|beat]]\" set, legitimate art critics like Sir Charles Broward ([[George Sanders]]) scoff at his work. However, he manages to achieve success, when the work of his former roommate, a genuinely talented painter, becomes confused with his own.

Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko, 1988. 291.</ref> There have since been multiple [[manga]], [[anime]] and [[Video game|computer game]] adaptations, several of which have been translated into [[English language|English]]. The plots generally follow the conventions and structure of the RPG systems including ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and ''[[Sword World RPG]]'', in which several characters of distinct [[character class|types]] undertake a specific [[quest]].\n\n==Origins==\n''Record of Lodoss War'' was created in 1986 by [[Group SNE]] as a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' \"replay\" serialized in the Japanese magazine ''[[Comptiq]]'' from 1986 to 1988, though they also used the setting with other systems such as ''[[Tunnels & Trolls]]'' and ''[[RuneQuest]]''.<ref name=Yasuda /> Replays are not novels, but transcripts of RPG sessions, meant to both hold the interest of readers and convey the events that took place. They have proven to be popular, even to those who do not play [[role-playing game]]s but are fans of fiction (including fantasy fiction). Similar to [[light novel]]s, many characters and parties in replays have become popular as characters of [[anime]]. An example of such a character is the female elf Deedlit in ''Record of Lodoss War'', who was played by [[science fiction]] novelist Hiroshi Yamamoto during the RPG sessions.\n\nThe popularity of the ''Record of Lodoss War'' replays was such that the [[Dungeon Master]] Ryo Mizuno started to adapt the story into some of the earliest Japanese-language domestic [[high fantasy]] novels in 1988.\n\nWhen the replay series went on to become a trilogy, [[Group SNE]] had to abandon the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' rules and create their own game, dubbed ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' and released in 1989. All three parts of the replay series were eventually published as paperbacks by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] from 1989 to 1991: \n\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War I'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2160|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki Wan}} (September 1989) \u2014 Parn's party, retake played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules and incorporating elements from the novelization\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War II'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2161|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki T\u016b}} (September 1990) \u2014 Orson's party, retake played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules and incorporating elements from the novelization\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War III'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2162|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki Sur\u012b}} (August 1991) \u2014 Spark's party, played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules\n\nMizuno's novelizations were published by Kadokawa Shoten between 1988 and 1993, and followed by two collections of short stories in 1995, with illustrations done by [[Yutaka Izubuchi]].

The final five episodes of the OVA series are loosely based on the story told across the third and fourth novels and, having caught up with the ongoing novelization at that point, feature an original ending. The ''Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight'' TV series is a more faithful adaptation of volumes three to seven. The first collection of short stories was adapted into the ''Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit's Tale'' manga series.\n\nMizuno later went on to pen two other series of novels: a prequel titled {{nihongo|'''''Legend of Lodoss'''''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u4f1d\u8aac|R\u014ddosu-t\u014d Densetsu}} (1994 to 2002, 5 volumes) and sequels {{nihongo|'''''[[Legend of Crystania|Drifting Legend Crystania]]'''''|\u6f02\u6d41\u4f1d\u8aac\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30cb\u30a2|Hy\u014dry\u016b Densetsu Kurisutania}} (1993 to 1996, 4 volumes) and {{nihongo|'''''Record of Lodoss War Next Generation'''''|\u65b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18|Shin R\u014ddosu-t\u014d Senki}} (1998 to 2006, 6 volumes); ''Legend of Lodoss'' was adapted into the ''Record of Lodoss War: The Lady of Pharis'' manga series and ''Drifting Legend Crystania'' was adapted into manga, an anime film, and OVA series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Record of Lodoss War characters}}\n\n''Record of Lodoss War'' recounts the adventures of a youth by the name of Parn, the son of a dishonored knight. Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father, and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later by Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high [[elf]] Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction; and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard.\n\nThe volumes three to seven, adapted into manga and anime ''Chronicles of the Heroic Knight'', continue the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then focus on Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the [[Avatar]] of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel.\n\nThe series ''[[Legend of Crystania|Drifting Legend Crystania]]'', places the former villain Ashram into the seat of a would-be hero who is placed under a spell by a \"god beast\" of Crystania. The series then focuses on Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and to restore him back to his living self.\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Home video releases===\nThe original OVA series and the TV series had both been released in North America through [[Central Park Media]] on VHS and on DVD.

originally created for a world called ''[[Sword World RPG#Setting|Forcelia]]'' as a rules-free setting for [[role-playing game]]s (RPGs).<ref name=Yasuda>Yasuda, Hitoshi.

Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko, 1988. 291.</ref> There have since been multiple [[manga]], [[anime]] and [[Video game|computer game]] adaptations, several of which have been translated into [[English language|English]]. The plots generally follow the conventions and structure of the RPG systems including ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and ''[[Sword World RPG]]'', in which several characters of distinct [[character class|types]] undertake a specific [[quest]].\n\n==Origins==\n''Record of Lodoss War'' was created in 1986 by [[Group SNE]] as a ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' \"replay\" serialized in the Japanese magazine ''[[Comptiq]]'' from 1986 to 1988, though they also used the setting with other systems such as ''[[Tunnels & Trolls]]'' and ''[[RuneQuest]]''.<ref name=Yasuda /> Replays are not novels, but transcripts of RPG sessions, meant to both hold the interest of readers and convey the events that took place. They have proven to be popular, even to those who do not play [[role-playing game]]s but are fans of fiction (including fantasy fiction). Similar to [[light novel]]s, many characters and parties in replays have become popular as characters of [[anime]]. An example of such a character is the female elf Deedlit in ''Record of Lodoss War'', who was played by [[science fiction]] novelist Hiroshi Yamamoto during the RPG sessions.\n\nThe popularity of the ''Record of Lodoss War'' replays was such that the [[Dungeon Master]] Ryo Mizuno started to adapt the story into some of the earliest Japanese-language domestic [[high fantasy]] novels in 1988.\n\nWhen the replay series went on to become a trilogy, [[Group SNE]] had to abandon the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' rules and create their own game, dubbed ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' and released in 1989. All three parts of the replay series were eventually published as paperbacks by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] from 1989 to 1991: \n\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War I'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2160|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki Wan}} (September 1989) \u2014 Parn's party, retake played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules and incorporating elements from the novelization\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War II'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2161|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki T\u016b}} (September 1990) \u2014 Orson's party, retake played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules and incorporating elements from the novelization\n* {{nihongo|'''''RPG Replay Record of Lodoss War III'''''|\uff32\uff30\uff27\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 \u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18\u2162|Aru P\u012b J\u012b Ripurei R\u014ddosut\u014d Senki Sur\u012b}} (August 1991) \u2014 Spark's party, played according to the ''Record of Lodoss War Companion'' rules\n\nMizuno's novelizations were published by Kadokawa Shoten between 1988 and 1993, and followed by two collections of short stories in 1995, with illustrations done by [[Yutaka Izubuchi]].

The second was also adapted in manga form, and as a four-CD [[radio drama|audio drama]]. The final five episodes of the OVA series are loosely based on the story told across the third and fourth novels and, having caught up with the ongoing novelization at that point, feature an original ending. The ''Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight'' TV series is a more faithful adaptation of volumes three to seven. The first collection of short stories was adapted into the ''Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit's Tale'' manga series.\n\nMizuno later went on to pen two other series of novels: a prequel titled {{nihongo|'''''Legend of Lodoss'''''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u4f1d\u8aac|R\u014ddosu-t\u014d Densetsu}} (1994 to 2002, 5 volumes) and sequels {{nihongo|'''''[[Legend of Crystania|Drifting Legend Crystania]]'''''|\u6f02\u6d41\u4f1d\u8aac\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\u30cb\u30a2|Hy\u014dry\u016b Densetsu Kurisutania}} (1993 to 1996, 4 volumes) and {{nihongo|'''''Record of Lodoss War Next Generation'''''|\u65b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30b9\u5cf6\u6226\u8a18|Shin R\u014ddosu-t\u014d Senki}} (1998 to 2006, 6 volumes); ''Legend of Lodoss'' was adapted into the ''Record of Lodoss War: The Lady of Pharis'' manga series and ''Drifting Legend Crystania'' was adapted into manga, an anime film, and OVA series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Record of Lodoss War characters}}\n\n''Record of Lodoss War'' recounts the adventures of a youth by the name of Parn, the son of a dishonored knight. Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father, and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later by Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high [[elf]] Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction; and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard.\n\nThe volumes three to seven, adapted into manga and anime ''Chronicles of the Heroic Knight'', continue the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then focus on Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the [[Avatar]] of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel.\n\nThe series ''[[Legend of Crystania|Drifting Legend Crystania]]'', places the former villain Ashram into the seat of a would-be hero who is placed under a spell by a \"god beast\" of Crystania. The series then focuses on Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and to restore him back to his living self.\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Home video releases===\nThe original OVA series and the TV series had both been released in North America through [[Central Park Media]] on VHS and on DVD.
