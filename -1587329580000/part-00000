{"title_page": "Zero to the power of zero", "text_new": "'''Zero to the power of zero''', denoted by [[267.50]], is a [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical expression]] with no agreed-upon [[Value (mathematics)|value]]. The most common possibilities are [[1#Mathematics|1]] or leaving the expression undefined, with justifications existing for each, depending on context.\nIn [[algebra]] and [[combinatorics]], the generally agreed upon value is&nbsp;{{nowrap|1=0<sup>0</sup> = 1}}, whereas in [[mathematical analysis]], the expression is sometimes left undefined. [[#Treatment on computers|Computer program]]s also have differing ways of handling this expression.\n\n==Discrete exponents==\nThere are many widely used formulas having terms involving [[natural number|natural-number]] exponents that require {{math|0<sup>0</sup>}} to be evaluated to {{math|1}}.  For example, regarding {{math|''b''<sup>0</sup>}} as an [[empty product]] assigns it the value {{math|1}}, even when {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}.  Alternatively, the [[Exponentiation#Combinatorial interpretation|combinatorial interpretation]] of {{math|''b''<sup>0</sup>}} is the number of [[empty tuple]]s of elements from a set with {{math|''b''}} elements; there is exactly one empty tuple, even if {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}.  Equivalently, the [[Exponentiation#Over sets|set-theoretic interpretation]] of {{math|0<sup>0</sup>}} is the number of functions from the empty set to the empty set; there is exactly one such function, the [[empty function]].<ref name=\"Bourbaki\">N. Bourbaki, Elements of Mathematics, Theory of Sets, Springer-Verlag, 2004, III.\u00a73.5.</ref>\n\n==Polynomials and power series==\nLikewise, when working with [[polynomial]]s, it is often necessary to assign {{math|0<sup>0</sup>}} the value 1.  A polynomial is an expression of the form <math>a_0x^0+\\cdots+a_nx^n</math> where {{math|''x''}} is an indeterminate, and the coefficients <math>a_n</math> are real numbers (or, more generally, elements of some [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]).  The set of all real polynomials in {{math|''x''}} is denoted by <math>\\mathbb R[x]</math>.  Polynomials are added termwise, and multiplied by the applying the usual rules for exponents in the indeterminate {{math|''x''}} (see [[Cauchy product]]).  With these algebraic rules for manipulation, polynomials form a [[polynomial ring]].  The polynomial <math>x^0</math> is the [[identity element]] of the polynomial ring, meaning that it is the (unique) element such that the product of <math>x^0</math> with any polynomial <math>p(x)</math> is just <math>p(x)</math>.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=Alg\u00e8bre|publisher=Springer|year=1970|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki}}, \u00a7III.2 No. 9: \"L'unique mon\u00f4me de degr\u00e9 0 est l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment unit\u00e9 de <math>A[(X_i)_{i\\in I}]</math>; on l'identifie souvent \u00e0 l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment unit\u00e9 1 de {{math|''A''}}\".</ref>  Polynomials can be evaluated by specializing the indeterminate {{math|''x''}} to be a real number.  More precisely, for any given real number <math>x_0</math> there is a unique unital [[ring homomorphism]] <math>\\operatorname{ev}_{x_0}:\\mathbb R[x]\\to\\mathbb R</math> such that <math>\\operatorname{ev}_{x_0}(x^1)=x_0</math>.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=Alg\u00e8bre|publisher=Springer|year=1970|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki}}, \u00a7IV.1 No. 3.</ref>  This is called the ''evaluation homomorphism''.  Because it is a unital homomorphism, we have <math>\\operatorname{ev}_{x_0}(x^0) = 1.</math>  That is, <math>x^0=1</math> for all specializations of {{math|''x''}} to a real number (including zero).\n\nThis perspective is significant for many polynomial identities appearing in combinatorics.  For example, the [[binomial theorem]] <math>(1 + x)^n = \\sum_{k = 0}^n \\binom{n}{k} x^k</math> is not valid for {{math|1=''x'' = 0}} unless {{math|1=0<sup>0</sup> = 1}}.<ref>\"Some textbooks leave the quantity {{math|0<sup>0</sup>}} undefined, because the functions {{math|''x''<sup>0</sup>}} and {{math|0<sup>''x''</sup>}} have different limiting values when {{math|''x''}} decreases to 0. But this is a mistake. We must define {{math|1=''x''<sup>0</sup> = 1}}, for all {{math|''x''}}, if the binomial theorem is to be valid when {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}, {{math|1=''y'' = 0}}, and/or {{math|1=''x'' = \u2212''y''}}.

Its first flight was during a drop test in 2006. X-37s have completed five orbital missions.\n\nThe spaceplane's first mission, [[USA-212]], was launched in April 2010 and returned to Earth in December 2010.

It is boosted into space by a [[launch vehicle]], then re-enters Earth's atmosphere and lands as a [[spaceplane]]. The X-37 is operated by the [[United States Space Force]] for orbital [[Spaceflight#Earth-launched spaceflight|spaceflight]] missions intended to demonstrate [[reusable launch system|reusable space technologies]].<ref name=USAF_factsh/> It is a 120%-scaled derivative of the earlier [[Boeing X-40]]. The X-37 began as a [[NASA]] project in 1999, before being transferred to the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] in 2004. Its first flight was during a drop test in 2006. X-37s have completed five orbital missions.\n\nThe spaceplane's first mission, [[USA-212]], was launched in April 2010 and returned to Earth in December 2010. A second X-37 was launched on mission [[USA-226]] in March 2011 and returned in June 2012. The third mission was [[USA-240]], which launched in December 2012 and landed in October 2014. The fourth mission, USA-261, launched in May 2015 and landed in May 2017. The fifth and latest X-37 mission, USA-277, was launched on 7 September 2017, and was the longest X-37 mission to date,<ref name=\"GZM-20190827\">{{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/secret-u-s-air-force-spaceplane-breaks-record-with-719-1837605822 |title=Secretive U.S. Air Force Spaceplane Breaks Record With 719 Straight Days in Orbit|work=[[Gizmodo]]|last=Novak|first=Matt|date=27 August 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}</ref> landing on 27 October 2019 after {{time interval|7 September 2017 14:00|27 October 2019 07:51|show=d|duration=on}} in orbit.<ref name=\"sfnow20191027\"/><ref name=\"today20191027\"/>\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\n[[File:X-37 spacecraft, artist's rendition.jpeg|thumb|left|An artist's rendering of the X-37 spacecraft in 1999]]\n\nIn 1999, NASA selected [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security|Boeing Integrated Defense Systems]] to design and develop an orbital vehicle, built by the California branch of Boeing's [[Boeing Phantom Works|Phantom Works]].

One is that the name ''Dumfries'' originates from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] name ''D\u00f9n Phris'' which means \"Fort of the Thicket\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliament Scotland - Placenames - Gaelic - C-E |url=http://www.parliament.scot/Gaelic/placenamesC-E.pdf}}</ref> Another is that it comes from a [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] cognate of the alleged Gaelic derivation ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Din Prys'').<ref name=\"bliton\">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence |url=http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |website=SPNS - The Brittonic Language in the Old North |accessdate=25 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813011121/http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |archive-date=13 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dumfries may be the same place as ''Penprys'', which is mentioned in an [[awdl]] by [[Taliesin]],<ref name=\"bliton\" /> and suggests that the first element may have originally been ''pen'', \"summit, head\" (Welsh ''pen'').\nAccording to a third theory, the name is a corruption of two [[Old English]] or [[Old Norse]] words which mean \"the Friars\u2019 Hill\"; those who favour this idea allege the formation of a religious house near the head of what is now the Friars\u2019 Vennel.<ref name=autogeneratedhist /> If the name were English or Norse, however, the expected form would have the elements in reversed orientation (compare [[Clarendon Palace|Clarendon]]). A Celtic derivation is therefore preferred. Moreover, the Brittonic element ''drum'',<ref name=\"bliton\" /> meaning \"ridge\", and the [[Old Irish|Gaelic]] elements ''druim'',<ref name=\"bliton\" /> which means the same, and ''dronn-'',<ref name=\"bliton\" /> \"a hump\", have all been suggested as an explanation of the first element.<ref name=\"bliton\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early history===\nNo positive information has been obtained of the era and circumstances in which the town of Dumfries was founded.<ref name=autogeneratedhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/dumfries/history1.htm |title=History of the Burgh of Dumfries \u2013 Chapter I |publisher=Electricscotland.com |date= |accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome writers hold that Dumfries flourished as a place of distinction during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of North Great Britain. The [[Selgovae]] inhabited [[Nithsdale]] at the time and may have raised some military works of a defensive nature on or near the site of Dumfries; and it is more than probable that a castle of some kind formed the nucleus of the town. This is inferred from the etymology of the name, which, according to one theory, is resolvable into two [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] terms signifying a castle or fort in the [[copse]] or brushwood. Dumfries was once within the borders of the Kingdom of Northumbria. The district around Dumfries was for several centuries ruled over and deemed of much importance by the invading Romans. Many traces of Roman presence in Dumfriesshire are still to be found; coins, weapons, sepulchral remains, military earthworks, and roads being among the relics left by their lengthened sojourn in this part of Scotland. the [[Caledonians|Caledonian]] tribes in the south of Scotland were invested with the same rights by an edict of [[Antoninus Pius]] The Romanized natives received freedom (the burrows, cairns, and remains of stone temples still to be seen in the district tell of a time when [[Druidism]] was the prevailing religion) as well as civilisation from their conquerors. Late in the fourth century, the Romans bade farewell to the country.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n\nAccording to another theory, the name is a corruption of two words which mean the Friars\u2019 Hill; those who favour this idea allege that [[St. Ninian]], by planting a religious house near the head of what is now the Friars\u2019 Vennel, at the close of the fourth century, became the virtual founder of the Burgh; however Ninian, so far as is known, did not originate any monastic establishments anywhere and was simply a missionary. In the list of British towns given by the ancient historian [[Nennius]], the name ''Caer Peris'' occurs, which some modern antiquarians suppose to have been transmuted, by a change of dialect, into Dumfries.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n\nTwelve of [[King Arthur]]'s battles were recorded by [[Nennius]] in ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. The Battle of Tribruit (the 10th battle), has been suggested as having possibly been near Dumfries or near the mouth of the [[River Avon, Falkirk|river Avon]] near [[Bo'ness]].\n\nAfter the Roman departure the area around Dumfries had various forms of visit by [[Picts]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], [[Scottish people|Scots]] and [[Norsemen|Norse]] culminating in a decisive victory for [[Giric|Gregory, King of Scots]] at what is now [[Lochmaben]] over the native [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] in 890.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n\n===Medieval period===\nWhen, in 1069, [[Malcolm Canmore]] and [[William the Conqueror]] held a conference regarding the claims of [[Edgar \u00c6theling]] to the English Crown, they met at Abernithi \u2013 a term which in the old British tongue means a port at the mouth of the Nith. It has been argued, the town thus characterised must have been Dumfries; and therefore it must have existed as a port in the Kingdom of Strathclyde, if not in the Roman days. However, against this argument is that the town is situated eight to nine miles (14&nbsp;km) distant from the sea,<ref name=autogeneratedhist /> although the [[River Nith]] is tidal and navigable all the way into the town itself.\n\n[[File:Lincluden Collegiate Church.jpg|thumb|Lincluden Collegiate Church, also known as [[Lincluden Abbey]], c.1789]]\nAlthough at the time {{convert|1|mi}} upstream and on the opposite bank of the Nith from Dumfries, [[Lincluden Collegiate Church|Lincluden Abbey]] was founded circa 1160. The abbey ruins are on the site of the [[bailey (castle)|bailey]] of the very early Lincluden Castle, as are those of the later Lincluden Tower. This religious house was used for various purposes, until its abandonment around 1700. Lincluden Abbey and its grounds are now within the Dumfries urban conurbation boundary.\n[[William the Lion]] granted the charter to raise Dumfries to the rank of a [[royal burgh]] in 1186. Dumfries was very much on the frontier during its first 50 years as a burgh and it grew rapidly as a market town and port.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of the burgh of Dumfries: with notices of Nithsdale, Annandale, and the western border|first=William|last=M'Dowall|publisher=Adam and Charles Black|year=1867|page=144}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] visited Dumfries in 1264 to plan an expedition against the [[Isle of Man]], previously Scots but for 180 years subjected by the crown of Norway. Identified with the conquest of Man, Dumfries shared in the well being of Scotland for the next 22 years until Alexander's accidental death brought an Augustan era in the town's history to an abrupt finish.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n\nA royal castle, which no longer exists, was built in the 13th century on the site of the present Castledykes Park. In the latter part of the century [[William Wallace]] chased a fleeing English force southward through the Nith valley. The English fugitives met the gates of [[Dumfries Castle]] that remained firmly closed in their presence. With a body of the town's people joining Wallace and his fellow pursuers when they arrived, the fleeing English met their end at Cockpool on the [[Solway Coast]]. After resting at [[Caerlaverock Castle]] a few miles away from the bloodletting, Wallace again passed through Dumfries the day after as he returned north to [[Sanquhar]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn the invasion of 1300, [[Edward I of England]] lodged for a few days in June with the Minorite Friars of the Vennel, before at the head of the then greatest invasion force to attack Scotland he laid siege to [[Caerlaverock Castle]]. After Caerlaverock eventually succumbed, Edward passed through Dumfries again as he crossed the Nith to take his invasion into [[Galloway]]. With the Scottish nobility having requested [[Holy See|Vatican]] support for their cause, Edward on his return to Caerlaverock was presented with a missive directed to him by [[Pope Boniface VIII]]. Edward held court in Dumfries at which he grudgingly agreed to an armistice. On 30 October, the truce solicited by Pope Boniface was signed by Edward at Dumfries. Letters from Edward, dated at Dumfries, were sent to his subordinates throughout Scotland, ordering them to give effect to the treaty. The peace was to last till Whitsunday in the following year.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n[[File:Death of Comyn.jpg|thumb|The killing of [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]] in the Greyfriars church in Dumfries, as seen by [[Henri F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux|Felix Philippoteaux]], a 19th-century illustrator.]]\nBefore becoming [[King of Scots]], [[Robert the Bruce]] slew his rival the [[John III Comyn|Red Comyn]] at Greyfriars Kirk in the town on 10 February 1306. His uncertainty about the fatality of his stabbing caused one of his followers, [[Roger de Kirkpatrick]], to utter the famous, \"I mak siccar\" (\"I make sure\") and finish the Comyn off. Bruce was subsequently excommunicated as a result, less for the murder than for its location. Regardless, for Bruce the die was cast at the moment in Greyfriars and so began his campaign by force for the independence of Scotland. Swords were drawn by supporters of both sides, the burial ground of the Monastery becoming the theatre of battle. Bruce and his party then attacked Dumfries Castle. The English garrison surrendered and for the third time in the day Bruce and his supporters were victorious. He was crowned King of Scots barely seven weeks after. Bruce later triumphed at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] and led Scotland to independence.\n\nOnce Edward received word of the revolution that had started in Dumfries, he again raised an army and invaded Scotland. Dumfries was again subjected to the control of Bruce's enemies. Sir [[Christopher Seton]] (Bruce's brother in law) had been captured at [[Loch Doon]] and was hurried to Dumfries to be tried for treason in general and more specifically for being present at Comyn's killing. Still in 1306 and along with two companions, Seton was condemned and executed by [[hanging]] and then [[Decapitation|beheading]] at the site of what is now St Mary's Church.\n\n[[File:Burns Statue and Greyfriars, Dumfries.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Greyfriars Church and Burns Statue|alt=]]\nIn 1659 ten women were accused of diverse acts of witchcraft by Dumfries Kirk Session although the Kirk Session minutes itself records nine witches.

It is one of the less snowy locations in Scotland owing to its sheltered, low lying position in the South West of the country.

At low tide, the sea recedes to such an extent on the shallow sloping sands of the Solway that the length of the Nith is extended by 13&nbsp;km to {{convert|113.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}. This makes the Nith Scotland's seventh longest river. There are several bridges across the river within the town. In between the [[Devorgilla]] (also known as 'The Old Bridge') and the suspension bridge is a [[weir]] colloquially known as 'The Caul'. In wetter months of the year the Nith can flood the surrounding streets.\n\nDumfries has numerous suburbs including [[Summerhill, Dumfries|Summerhill]], Summerville, Troqueer, Georgetown, Cresswell, Larchfield, Calside, Lochside, Lincluden, [[Newbridge Drive]], Sandside, Heathhall, [[Locharbriggs]], Noblehill and Marchmount. [[Maxwelltown]] to the west of the river Nith, was formerly a Burgh in its own right within [[The Stewartry of Kirkcudbright]] (also known as Kirkcudbrightshire) until its incorporation into Dumfries in 1928; Summerhill, Troqueer, Lochside, Lincluden, Sandside are among other suburbs located on the Maxwelltown side of the river. [[Palmerston Park]], home to the town's senior football team [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]], is on Terregles Street, also on the Maxwelltown side of the river.\n\nQueensberry Square and High Street are the central focal points of the town and this area hosts many of the historical, social and commercial enterprises and events of Dumfries. During the 1990s, these areas enjoyed various aesthetic recognitions from organisations including [[Britain in Bloom]].\n\n==Governance==\nScottish communities granted [[Royal Burgh]] status by the monarch guarded the honour jealously and with vigour. Riding the Marches maintains the tradition of an occasion that was, in its day, of great importance. Dumfries has been a Royal Burgh since 1186, its charter being granted by King William the Lion in a move that ensured the loyalty of its citizens to the Monarch.\n\nAlthough far from the centre of power in Scotland, Dumfries had obvious strategic significance sitting as it does on the edge of Galloway and being the centre of control for the south west of Scotland.\n\nWith the River Nith on two sides and the Lochar Moss on another, Dumfries was a town with good natural defences. Consequently, it was never completely walled. A careful eye still had to be kept on the clearly defined boundaries of the burgh, a task that had to be taken each year by the Provost, Baillies, Burgesses and others within the town.\n\nNeighbouring landowners might try to encroach on the town boundaries, or the Marches as they were known, moving them back 100 yards or so to their own benefit. It had to be made clear to anyone thinking of or trying to encroach that they dare not do so.\n\nIn return for the Royal status of the town and the favour of the King, the Provost and his council, along with other worthies of the town had to be diligent in ensuring the boundaries were strictly observed. Although steeped in history, Scotland's burghs remained the foundation of the country's system of local government for centuries. Burgh status conferred on its citizens the right to elect their own town councils, run their own affairs and raise their own local taxes or rates.\n\nIn 1974 the burghs became part of larger districts and regions. Those boundaries lost the significance they were granted by Royal statute. Ancient titles like Provost and Bailie were discarded or retained only for ceremonial purposes. Robes and chains often found their way into museums as a reminder of the past.\n\nDumfries remains a centre of local government for a much bigger area than just the town itself. But its people, the Doonhamers still retain a pride in their town and distinctive identity. This is never more so than during the week-long Guid Nychburris Festival and its highlight the Riding of the Marches which takes place on the third Saturday in June each year.\n\n===Politics===\nDumfries is located in the [[Subdivisions of Scotland|council area]] of [[Dumfries and Galloway]]. It is the seat of the local council, whose headquarters are located on the edge of the town centre. Until 1995 Dumfries was also home to the council for the local district of [[Nithsdale]]. Dumfries also lends its name to the [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]] of Dumfries, which is similar in boundaries to the former [[Dumfriesshire]] county.\n\nDumfries lies in the UK Parliament constituency of [[Dumfries and Galloway (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfries and Galloway]] which is represented by [[Alister Jack]] of the [[Scottish Conservative Party]]. For Scottish Parliament elections, Dumfries is in the [[South Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|South Scotland electoral region]] and split between two constituencies. The western wards of Abbey and North West Dumfries are in the constituency of [[Galloway and West Dumfries (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Galloway and West Dumfries]], while the eastern wards of Nith and Lochar are in the constituency of [[Dumfriesshire (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire]]. The respective MSPs are [[Finlay Carson]] and [[Oliver Mundell]], both of the Conservative Party.\n\nOn the Dumfries and Galloway council, Dumfries is covered by four 4-seat wards: Abbey, Lochar, Nith and North West Dumfries. North West Dumfries is the only ward that solely covers areas within the town itself, with the others incorporating outlying areas. In the [[2017 Dumfries and Galloway Council election|2017 council election]], these wards elected 6 Labour, 5 Conservative and 4 SNP councillors.\n\n==Economy==\nDumfries has a long history as a [[county town]], and as the [[market town]] of a surrounding rural hinterland.\n\nDumfries is a relatively prosperous community but the town centre has been exposed to the centrifugal forces that have seen retail, business, educational, residential and other uses gravitate towards the town's urban fringe.<ref>[http://www.dumgal.gov.uk/Dumgal/Documents.aspx?id=12338 DGC -Document: Dumfries Town Centre Urban Design Strategy \u2013 Part 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215015236/http://www.dumgal.gov.uk/Dumgal/Documents.aspx?id=12338 |date=15 February 2008 }}</ref> This was started in the 1980s with the building of the Dumfries bypass. The immediate effect of this was as intended the diversion of transiting traffic away from the town centre. This brought with it an accompanying reduction in economic input to the town centre. The second effect of this has been more pronounced. Sites close to the bypass have attracted development to utilise the bypass as a high speed urban highway without the bottlenecks of the town centre and without the constraining limited town centre parking.\n\nIn a bid to re-stimulate development in Dumfries town centre, both economically and in a social context, several strategies have been proposed by the controlling authorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dumfriesregeneration.co.uk |title=MiniWeb: Regeneration & Europe \u2013 Dumfries Town Centre |publisher=Dumfriesregeneration.co.uk |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nDumfries got its nickname 'Queen of the South' from David Dunbar, a local poet,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telinco.co.uk/RobertTemple/Hrkiv6.htm#t1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031105133946/http://www.telinco.co.uk/RobertTemple/Hrkiv6.htm#t1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 November 2003 |title=Robert Temple Bibliographical Archive |publisher=Telinco.co.uk |date=2 March 2008 |accessdate=24 August 2011 }}</ref> who in 1857 stood in the [[1857 United Kingdom general election|general election]].

People from Dumfries are known colloquially in [[Scots language]] as ''Doonhamers''.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThere are at least three theories on the etymology of the name. One is that the name ''Dumfries'' originates from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] name ''D\u00f9n Phris'' which means \"Fort of the Thicket\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliament Scotland - Placenames - Gaelic - C-E |url=http://www.parliament.scot/Gaelic/placenamesC-E.pdf}}</ref> Another is that it comes from a [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] cognate of the alleged Gaelic derivation ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Din Prys'').<ref name=\"bliton\">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence |url=http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |website=SPNS - The Brittonic Language in the Old North |accessdate=25 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813011121/http://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary.pdf |archive-date=13 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dumfries may be the same place as ''Penprys'', which is mentioned in an [[awdl]] by [[Taliesin]],<ref name=\"bliton\" /> and suggests that the first element may have originally been ''pen'', \"summit, head\" (Welsh ''pen'').\nAccording to a third theory, the name is a corruption of two [[Old English]] or [[Old Norse]] words which mean \"the Friars\u2019 Hill\"; those who favour this idea allege the formation of a religious house near the head of what is now the Friars\u2019 Vennel.<ref name=autogeneratedhist /> If the name were English or Norse, however, the expected form would have the elements in reversed orientation (compare [[Clarendon Palace|Clarendon]]). A Celtic derivation is therefore preferred. Moreover, the Brittonic element ''drum'',<ref name=\"bliton\" /> meaning \"ridge\", and the [[Old Irish|Gaelic]] elements ''druim'',<ref name=\"bliton\" /> which means the same, and ''dronn-'',<ref name=\"bliton\" /> \"a hump\", have all been suggested as an explanation of the first element.<ref name=\"bliton\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early history===\nNo positive information has been obtained of the era and circumstances in which the town of Dumfries was founded.<ref name=autogeneratedhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/dumfries/history1.htm |title=History of the Burgh of Dumfries \u2013 Chapter I |publisher=Electricscotland.com |date= |accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome writers hold that Dumfries flourished as a place of distinction during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation of North Great Britain. The [[Selgovae]] inhabited [[Nithsdale]] at the time and may have raised some military works of a defensive nature on or near the site of Dumfries; and it is more than probable that a castle of some kind formed the nucleus of the town. This is inferred from the etymology of the name, which, according to one theory, is resolvable into two [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] terms signifying a castle or fort in the [[copse]] or brushwood. Dumfries was once within the borders of the Kingdom of Northumbria. The district around Dumfries was for several centuries ruled over and deemed of much importance by the invading Romans. Many traces of Roman presence in Dumfriesshire are still to be found; coins, weapons, sepulchral remains, military earthworks, and roads being among the relics left by their lengthened sojourn in this part of Scotland. the [[Caledonians|Caledonian]] tribes in the south of Scotland were invested with the same rights by an edict of [[Antoninus Pius]] The Romanized natives received freedom (the burrows, cairns, and remains of stone temples still to be seen in the district tell of a time when [[Druidism]] was the prevailing religion) as well as civilisation from their conquerors. Late in the fourth century, the Romans bade farewell to the country.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n\nAccording to another theory, the name is a corruption of two words which mean the Friars\u2019 Hill; those who favour this idea allege that [[St. Ninian]], by planting a religious house near the head of what is now the Friars\u2019 Vennel, at the close of the fourth century, became the virtual founder of the Burgh; however Ninian, so far as is known, did not originate any monastic establishments anywhere and was simply a missionary. In the list of British towns given by the ancient historian [[Nennius]], the name ''Caer Peris'' occurs, which some modern antiquarians suppose to have been transmuted, by a change of dialect, into Dumfries.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n\nTwelve of [[King Arthur]]'s battles were recorded by [[Nennius]] in ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. The Battle of Tribruit (the 10th battle), has been suggested as having possibly been near Dumfries or near the mouth of the [[River Avon, Falkirk|river Avon]] near [[Bo'ness]].\n\nAfter the Roman departure the area around Dumfries had various forms of visit by [[Picts]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], [[Scottish people|Scots]] and [[Norsemen|Norse]] culminating in a decisive victory for [[Giric|Gregory, King of Scots]] at what is now [[Lochmaben]] over the native [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] in 890.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n\n===Medieval period===\nWhen, in 1069, [[Malcolm Canmore]] and [[William the Conqueror]] held a conference regarding the claims of [[Edgar \u00c6theling]] to the English Crown, they met at Abernithi \u2013 a term which in the old British tongue means a port at the mouth of the Nith. It has been argued, the town thus characterised must have been Dumfries; and therefore it must have existed as a port in the Kingdom of Strathclyde, if not in the Roman days. However, against this argument is that the town is situated eight to nine miles (14&nbsp;km) distant from the sea,<ref name=autogeneratedhist /> although the [[River Nith]] is tidal and navigable all the way into the town itself.\n\n[[File:Lincluden Collegiate Church.jpg|thumb|Lincluden Collegiate Church, also known as [[Lincluden Abbey]], c.1789]]\nAlthough at the time {{convert|1|mi}} upstream and on the opposite bank of the Nith from Dumfries, [[Lincluden Collegiate Church|Lincluden Abbey]] was founded circa 1160. The abbey ruins are on the site of the [[bailey (castle)|bailey]] of the very early Lincluden Castle, as are those of the later Lincluden Tower. This religious house was used for various purposes, until its abandonment around 1700. Lincluden Abbey and its grounds are now within the Dumfries urban conurbation boundary.\n[[William the Lion]] granted the charter to raise Dumfries to the rank of a [[royal burgh]] in 1186. Dumfries was very much on the frontier during its first 50 years as a burgh and it grew rapidly as a market town and port.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of the burgh of Dumfries: with notices of Nithsdale, Annandale, and the western border|first=William|last=M'Dowall|publisher=Adam and Charles Black|year=1867|page=144}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] visited Dumfries in 1264 to plan an expedition against the [[Isle of Man]], previously Scots but for 180 years subjected by the crown of Norway. Identified with the conquest of Man, Dumfries shared in the well being of Scotland for the next 22 years until Alexander's accidental death brought an Augustan era in the town's history to an abrupt finish.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n\nA royal castle, which no longer exists, was built in the 13th century on the site of the present Castledykes Park. In the latter part of the century [[William Wallace]] chased a fleeing English force southward through the Nith valley. The English fugitives met the gates of [[Dumfries Castle]] that remained firmly closed in their presence. With a body of the town's people joining Wallace and his fellow pursuers when they arrived, the fleeing English met their end at Cockpool on the [[Solway Coast]]. After resting at [[Caerlaverock Castle]] a few miles away from the bloodletting, Wallace again passed through Dumfries the day after as he returned north to [[Sanquhar]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn the invasion of 1300, [[Edward I of England]] lodged for a few days in June with the Minorite Friars of the Vennel, before at the head of the then greatest invasion force to attack Scotland he laid siege to [[Caerlaverock Castle]]. After Caerlaverock eventually succumbed, Edward passed through Dumfries again as he crossed the Nith to take his invasion into [[Galloway]]. With the Scottish nobility having requested [[Holy See|Vatican]] support for their cause, Edward on his return to Caerlaverock was presented with a missive directed to him by [[Pope Boniface VIII]]. Edward held court in Dumfries at which he grudgingly agreed to an armistice. On 30 October, the truce solicited by Pope Boniface was signed by Edward at Dumfries. Letters from Edward, dated at Dumfries, were sent to his subordinates throughout Scotland, ordering them to give effect to the treaty. The peace was to last till Whitsunday in the following year.<ref name=autogeneratedhist />\n[[File:Death of Comyn.jpg|thumb|The killing of [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]] in the Greyfriars church in Dumfries, as seen by [[Henri F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux|Felix Philippoteaux]], a 19th-century illustrator.]]\nBefore becoming [[King of Scots]], [[Robert the Bruce]] slew his rival the [[John III Comyn|Red Comyn]] at Greyfriars Kirk in the town on 10 February 1306. His uncertainty about the fatality of his stabbing caused one of his followers, [[Roger de Kirkpatrick]], to utter the famous, \"I mak siccar\" (\"I make sure\") and finish the Comyn off. Bruce was subsequently excommunicated as a result, less for the murder than for its location. Regardless, for Bruce the die was cast at the moment in Greyfriars and so began his campaign by force for the independence of Scotland. Swords were drawn by supporters of both sides, the burial ground of the Monastery becoming the theatre of battle. Bruce and his party then attacked Dumfries Castle. The English garrison surrendered and for the third time in the day Bruce and his supporters were victorious. He was crowned King of Scots barely seven weeks after. Bruce later triumphed at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] and led Scotland to independence.\n\nOnce Edward received word of the revolution that had started in Dumfries, he again raised an army and invaded Scotland. Dumfries was again subjected to the control of Bruce's enemies. Sir [[Christopher Seton]] (Bruce's brother in law) had been captured at [[Loch Doon]] and was hurried to Dumfries to be tried for treason in general and more specifically for being present at Comyn's killing. Still in 1306 and along with two companions, Seton was condemned and executed by [[hanging]] and then [[Decapitation|beheading]] at the site of what is now St Mary's Church.\n\n[[File:Burns Statue and Greyfriars, Dumfries.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Greyfriars Church and Burns Statue|alt=]]\nIn 1659 ten women were accused of diverse acts of witchcraft by Dumfries Kirk Session although the Kirk Session minutes itself records nine witches.

It is one of the less snowy locations in Scotland owing to its sheltered, low lying position in the South West of the country.

At low tide, the sea recedes to such an extent on the shallow sloping sands of the Solway that the length of the Nith is extended by 13&nbsp;km to {{convert|113.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}. This makes the Nith Scotland's seventh longest river. There are several bridges across the river within the town. In between the [[Devorgilla]] (also known as 'The Old Bridge') and the suspension bridge is a [[weir]] colloquially known as 'The Caul'. In wetter months of the year the Nith can flood the surrounding streets.\n\nDumfries has numerous suburbs including [[Summerhill, Dumfries|Summerhill]], Summerville, Troqueer, Georgetown, Cresswell, Larchfield, Calside, Lochside, Lincluden, [[Newbridge Drive]], Sandside, Heathhall, [[Locharbriggs]], Noblehill and Marchmount. [[Maxwelltown]] to the west of the river Nith, was formerly a Burgh in its own right within [[The Stewartry of Kirkcudbright]] (also known as Kirkcudbrightshire) until its incorporation into Dumfries in 1928; Summerhill, Troqueer, Lochside, Lincluden, Sandside are among other suburbs located on the Maxwelltown side of the river. [[Palmerston Park]], home to the town's senior football team [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]], is on Terregles Street, also on the Maxwelltown side of the river.\n\nQueensberry Square and High Street are the central focal points of the town and this area hosts many of the historical, social and commercial enterprises and events of Dumfries. During the 1990s, these areas enjoyed various aesthetic recognitions from organisations including [[Britain in Bloom]].\n\n==Governance==\nScottish communities granted [[Royal Burgh]] status by the monarch guarded the honour jealously and with vigour. Riding the Marches maintains the tradition of an occasion that was, in its day, of great importance. Dumfries has been a Royal Burgh since 1186, its charter being granted by King William the Lion in a move that ensured the loyalty of its citizens to the Monarch.\n\nAlthough far from the centre of power in Scotland, Dumfries had obvious strategic significance sitting as it does on the edge of Galloway and being the centre of control for the south west of Scotland.\n\nWith the River Nith on two sides and the Lochar Moss on another, Dumfries was a town with good natural defences. Consequently, it was never completely walled. A careful eye still had to be kept on the clearly defined boundaries of the burgh, a task that had to be taken each year by the Provost, Baillies, Burgesses and others within the town.\n\nNeighbouring landowners might try to encroach on the town boundaries, or the Marches as they were known, moving them back 100 yards or so to their own benefit. It had to be made clear to anyone thinking of or trying to encroach that they dare not do so.\n\nIn return for the Royal status of the town and the favour of the King, the Provost and his council, along with other worthies of the town had to be diligent in ensuring the boundaries were strictly observed. Although steeped in history, Scotland's burghs remained the foundation of the country's system of local government for centuries. Burgh status conferred on its citizens the right to elect their own town councils, run their own affairs and raise their own local taxes or rates.\n\nIn 1974 the burghs became part of larger districts and regions. Those boundaries lost the significance they were granted by Royal statute. Ancient titles like Provost and Bailie were discarded or retained only for ceremonial purposes. Robes and chains often found their way into museums as a reminder of the past.\n\nDumfries remains a centre of local government for a much bigger area than just the town itself. But its people, the Doonhamers still retain a pride in their town and distinctive identity. This is never more so than during the week-long Guid Nychburris Festival and its highlight the Riding of the Marches which takes place on the third Saturday in June each year.\n\n===Politics===\nDumfries is located in the [[Subdivisions of Scotland|council area]] of [[Dumfries and Galloway]]. It is the seat of the local council, whose headquarters are located on the edge of the town centre. Until 1995 Dumfries was also home to the council for the local district of [[Nithsdale]]. Dumfries also lends its name to the [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]] of Dumfries, which is similar in boundaries to the former [[Dumfriesshire]] county.\n\nDumfries lies in the UK Parliament constituency of [[Dumfries and Galloway (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfries and Galloway]] which is represented by [[Alister Jack]] of the [[Scottish Conservative Party]]. For Scottish Parliament elections, Dumfries is in the [[South Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|South Scotland electoral region]] and split between two constituencies. The western wards of Abbey and North West Dumfries are in the constituency of [[Galloway and West Dumfries (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Galloway and West Dumfries]], while the eastern wards of Nith and Lochar are in the constituency of [[Dumfriesshire (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire]]. The respective MSPs are [[Finlay Carson]] and [[Oliver Mundell]], both of the Conservative Party.\n\nOn the Dumfries and Galloway council, Dumfries is covered by four 4-seat wards: Abbey, Lochar, Nith and North West Dumfries. North West Dumfries is the only ward that solely covers areas within the town itself, with the others incorporating outlying areas. In the [[2017 Dumfries and Galloway Council election|2017 council election]], these wards elected 6 Labour, 5 Conservative and 4 SNP councillors.\n\n==Economy==\nDumfries has a long history as a [[county town]], and as the [[market town]] of a surrounding rural hinterland.\n\nDumfries is a relatively prosperous community but the town centre has been exposed to the centrifugal forces that have seen retail, business, educational, residential and other uses gravitate towards the town's urban fringe.<ref>[http://www.dumgal.gov.uk/Dumgal/Documents.aspx?id=12338 DGC -Document: Dumfries Town Centre Urban Design Strategy \u2013 Part 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215015236/http://www.dumgal.gov.uk/Dumgal/Documents.aspx?id=12338 |date=15 February 2008 }}</ref> This was started in the 1980s with the building of the Dumfries bypass. The immediate effect of this was as intended the diversion of transiting traffic away from the town centre. This brought with it an accompanying reduction in economic input to the town centre. The second effect of this has been more pronounced. Sites close to the bypass have attracted development to utilise the bypass as a high speed urban highway without the bottlenecks of the town centre and without the constraining limited town centre parking.\n\nIn a bid to re-stimulate development in Dumfries town centre, both economically and in a social context, several strategies have been proposed by the controlling authorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dumfriesregeneration.co.uk |title=MiniWeb: Regeneration & Europe \u2013 Dumfries Town Centre |publisher=Dumfriesregeneration.co.uk |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nDumfries got its nickname 'Queen of the South' from David Dunbar, a local poet,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telinco.co.uk/RobertTemple/Hrkiv6.htm#t1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031105133946/http://www.telinco.co.uk/RobertTemple/Hrkiv6.htm#t1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 November 2003 |title=Robert Temple Bibliographical Archive |publisher=Telinco.co.uk |date=2 March 2008 |accessdate=24 August 2011 }}</ref> who in 1857 stood in the [[1857 United Kingdom general election|general election]].

In the past, when Great Danes were commonly used to [[Boar hunting#Hunting dogs|hunt boars]], [[Cropping (animal)|cropping]] of the ears was performed to make injuries to the dogs' ears less likely during hunts. Now that Danes are primarily [[Companion dog|companion animals]], cropping is sometimes still done for traditional and cosmetic reasons. In the 1930s when Great Danes had their ears cropped, after the surgery, two devices called Easter bonnets were fitted to their ears to make them stand up.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA873&dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22 \"Easter Bonnets for Dogs Make Ears Stand Erect\" ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1934]</ref> Today, the practice is common in the United States, but much less common in Europe.

However, it is important not to over exercise this breed, particularly when young. Great Dane puppies grow very large, very fast, which puts them at risk of joint and bone problems.

Even at one year of age, a Great Dane continues to grow for several more months.<ref name=\"All about Great Danes.com\" />\n\n== Health ==\nGreat Danes, like most giant dogs, have a fairly slow metabolism. This results in less energy and less food consumption per pound of dog than in small breeds. They have some health problems that are common to large breeds, including bloat ([[gastric dilatation volvulus]]). To avoid bloat, a rest period of 40 minutes to one hour after meals is recommended before exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane/|title=Great Dane - Dogs 101 - Animal Planet|website=www.animalplanet.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315025350/https://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane|archivedate=15 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \nTheir average lifespan is 6 to 8 years; however, some Great Danes have been known to reach 10 years of age or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1566/hsgreatdane.pdf|title=Summary results of the Purebred Dog Health Survey for Great Danes|year=2004|publisher=Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee|accessdate=29 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816075617/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1566/hsgreatdane.pdf|archivedate=16 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdca.org/health/surveyfinal.pdf|title=National Health Survey|year=2004|publisher=Great Dane Club of America|accessdate=29 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510043224/http://www.gdca.org/health/surveyfinal.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Like many larger breeds, Great Danes are at particular risk for [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].\n\n[[Dilated cardiomyopathy]]  and many [[congenital]] heart diseases are also commonly found in the Great Dane, leading to its [[nickname]]: the heartbreak breed, in conjunction with its shorter lifespan.

Great Danes can also develop [[wobbler disease]], a condition affecting the vertebral column. Since these dogs do grow at a rapid rate, the bones in their vertebae can push up against the spinal cord and cause weakness in the legs.

However, it is important not to over exercise this breed, particularly when young. Great Dane puppies grow very large, very fast, which puts them at risk of joint and bone problems.

This results in less energy and less food consumption per pound of dog than in small breeds. They have some health problems that are common to large breeds, including bloat ([[gastric dilatation volvulus]]). To avoid bloat, a rest period of 40 minutes to one hour after meals is recommended before exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane/|title=Great Dane - Dogs 101 - Animal Planet|website=www.animalplanet.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315025350/https://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/great-dane|archivedate=15 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \nTheir average lifespan is 6 to 8 years; however, some Great Danes have been known to reach 10 years of age or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1566/hsgreatdane.pdf|title=Summary results of the Purebred Dog Health Survey for Great Danes|year=2004|publisher=Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee|accessdate=29 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816075617/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/download/1566/hsgreatdane.pdf|archivedate=16 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdca.org/health/surveyfinal.pdf|title=National Health Survey|year=2004|publisher=Great Dane Club of America|accessdate=29 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510043224/http://www.gdca.org/health/surveyfinal.pdf|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Like many larger breeds, Great Danes are at particular risk for [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].\n\n[[Dilated cardiomyopathy]]  and many [[congenital]] heart diseases are also commonly found in the Great Dane, leading to its [[nickname]]: the heartbreak breed, in conjunction with its shorter lifespan.

That has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are (see [[phoneme]] for details). Only some of the variation is significant, by being detectable or perceivable, to speakers.\n\nThere are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation or whether the speaker has the unconscious freedom to choose the allophone that is used.\n\nIf a specific allophone from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme must be selected in a given context, and using a different allophone for a phoneme would cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native, the allophones are said to be ''complementary''. The allophones then complement each other, and one of them is not used in a situation in which the usage of another is standard. For complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a [[phonology|phonological]] process.<ref name=\"ref47qoref\">{{Citation | title=English L2 reading: getting to the bottom | author=Barbara M.

Complementary distribution means that the allophones are 'distributed' as complements....''}}</ref>\n\nIn other cases, the speaker can freely select from ''[[free variation|free variant]]'' allophones on personal habit or preference, but free variant allophones are still selected in the specific context, not the other way around.\n\nAnother example of an allophone is [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], in which a phoneme is to sound more like another phoneme. One example of assimilation is [[consonant voicing and devoicing]], in which voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants, and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants.\n\n==Allotone==\nAn '''allotone''' is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonic]] allophone, such as the [[neutral tone]] in [[Standard Mandarin]].\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== English ===\n{{main|English phonology#Allophones of consonants|English phonology#Allophones of vowels}}\n \nThere are many allophonic processes in English: lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.\n\n* [[Aspirated consonant|Aspiration]]: In English, a voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} is aspirated (has a strong explosion of breath) if it is at the beginning of the first or a stressed syllable in a word. For example, {{IPA|[p\u02b0]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in [[complementary distribution]]). English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is [[unaspirated]] (plain). Many languages [[Aspirated consonant#Usage patterns|treat the two phones differently]].\n* Nasal plosion \u2013 In English, a plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/}}) has nasal plosion if it is followed by a nasal, whether within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Partial devoicing of [[sonorant]]s: In English, sonorants ({{IPA|/j, w, l, r, m, n, \u014b/}}) are partially devoiced after a voiceless sound in the same syllable.\n* Complete devoicing of sonorants: In English, a sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}).\n* Partial devoicing of [[obstruent]]s: In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Retraction: In English, {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} are [[Retracted (phonetics)|retracted]] before {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\nBecause the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}: unreleased {{IPA|[ t\u031a]}} as in ''cat'', aspirated {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} as in ''top'', glottalized {{IPA|[\u0294]}} as in ''button'', flapped {{IPA|[\u027e]}} as in [[American English]] ''water'', nasalized flapped {{IPA|[\u027e&#771;]}} as in ''winter'', and none of the above {{IPA|[t]}} as in ''stop''. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:\n\n*''Night rate'': unreleased {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u028c\u026at\u031a.\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}} (without a [[word space]] between {{IPA|[ . ]}} and {{IPA|[\u0279]}})\n*''Nitrate'': aspirated {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u02b0\u0279\u0325e\u026at\u031a]}} or retracted {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u0320\u0279\u0320\u030a\u02d4\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}}\n\nA flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated ''nitrate'' than for the unaspirated ''night rate.'' The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.\n\nAllophones of English {{IPA|/l/}} may be noticed if the 'light' {{IPA|[l]}} of ''leaf'' {{IPA|[\u02c8li\u02d0f]}} is contrasted with the 'dark' {{IPA|[\u026b]}} of ''feel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8fi\u02d0\u026b]}}. Again, the difference is much more obvious to a [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/\u026b/}} are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.\n\nThese descriptions are more sequentially broken down in the next section.\n\n=== Rules for English Consonant Allophones ===\n\n[[Peter Ladefoged]], a renowned [[phonetics|phonetician]], clearly explains the [[consonant]] [[allophones]] of [[language|English]] in a precise list of statements to illustrate the language behavior. Some of these rules apply to all the consonants of English; the first item on the list deals with consonant length, items 2 through 18 apply to only selected groups of consonants, and the last item deals with the quality of a consonant. \nThese descriptive rules are as follows<ref>Ladefoged, Peter (2001). A Course in Phonetics (4th ed.). Orlando: Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-15-507319-2}}. p. 56-60.</ref>:\n# Consonants are longer when at the end of a phrase. This can be easily tested by recording a speaker saying a sound like \u201cbib\u201d, then comparing the forward and backward playback of the recording. One will find that the backward playback does not sound like the forward playback because the production of what is expected to be the same sound is not identical.\n# [[Voicelessness|Voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] when they come at the beginning of a syllable, such as in words like \"pip, test, kick\" {{IPA|[p<sup>h</sup>\u026ap, t<sup>h</sup>\u025bst, k<sup>h</sup>\u026ak]}}. You can compare this with voiceless stops that are not [[syllable]] initial like \"stop\" [st\u0251p]. The {{IPA|/t/}} voiceless stop follows the {{IPA|/s/}} (fricative) here.\n# [[voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] [[obstruents]], which include stops and [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], such as {{IPA|/b,d,g,v,\u00f0,z,\u0292/}}, that come at the end of an utterance like {{IPA|/v/}} in \"improve\" or before a voiceless sound like {{IPA|/d/}} in \"add two\") are only briefly voiced during the articulation.\n# Voiced stops and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} in fact occur as voiceless at the beginning of a syllable unless immediately preceded by a voiced sound, in which the voiced sound carries over.\n# [[Approximant consonant|Approximants]] (in English, these include {{IPA|/w,r,j,l/}}) are partially voiceless when they occur after syllable-initial {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} like in \"play, twin, cue\" {{IPA|[pl\u0325e\u026a, tw\u0325\u026an, kj\u0325u]}}.\n# Voiceless stops {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are not aspirated when following after a syllable initial fricative, such as in the words \"spew, stew, skew.\"\n# Voiceless stops and affricates {{IPA|/p,t,k,t\u0283/}} are longer than their voiced counterparts {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} when situated at the end of a syllable. Try comparing \"cap\" to \"cab\" or \"back\" to \"bag\".\n# When a stop comes before another stop, the explosion of air only follows after the second stop, illustrated in words like \"apt\" {{IPA|[\u00e6p\u031at]}} and \"rubbed\" {{IPA|[r\u028cb\u031ad]}}.\n# Many English accents produce a [[glottal stop]] in syllables that end with voiceless stops. Some examples include pronunciations of \"tip, pit, kick\" {{IPA|[t\u026a\u0294p, p\u026a\u0294t, k\u026a\u0294k]}}.\n# Some accents of English use a glottal stop in place of a {{IPA|/t/}} when it comes before an alveolar nasal in the same word (as opposed to in the next word), such as in the word \"beaten\" {{IPA|[\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0294n\u0329]}}.\n# Nasals become syllabic, or their own syllable, only when immediately following an obstruent (as opposed to just any consonant), such as in the words \"leaden, chasm\" {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u025bdn\u0329, \u02c8k\u00e6zm\u0329]}}. Take in comparison \"kiln, film\"; in most accents of English, the nasals are not syllabic.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}}, however, is syllabic at the end of the word when immediately following any consonant, like in \"paddle, whistle\" {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u00e6dl\u0329, \u02c8w\u026asl\u0329]}}. \n## When considering {{IPA|/r,l/}} as [[Liquid consonant|liquids]], {{IPA|/r/}} is included in this rule as well as present in the words \"sabre, razor, hammer, tailor\" {{IPA|[\u02c8se\u026ab\u0279\u0329, \u02c8re\u026az\u0279\u0329, \u02c8h\u00e6m\u0279\u0329, \u02c8te\u026al\u0279\u0329]}}.\n# [[voiceless dental and alveolar stops|Alveolar stops]] become [[Dental and alveolar taps and flaps|voiced taps]] when they occur between two vowels, as long as the second vowel is [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]]. Take for instance mainly American English pronunciations like \"fatty, data, daddy, many\" {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027e\u0259, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8m\u025b\u027e\u0303i]}}.\n## When an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar nasals|alveolar nasal]] is followed by a stop, the {{IPA|/t/}} is lost and a nasal tap occurs, causing \"winter\" to sound just like \"winner\" or \"panting\" to sound just like \"panning\". In this case, both alveolar stops and alveolar nasal plus stop sequences become voiced taps after two vowels when the second vowel is unstressed. This can vary among speakers, where the rule does not apply to certain words or when speaking at a slower pace.\n# All alveolar consonants assimilate to [[Dental consonant|dentals]] when occurring before a dental. Take the words \"eighth, tenth, wealth\". This also applies across word boundaries, for example \"at this\" {{IPA|[\u02c8\u00e6t\u032a \u00f0\u026as]]}}.\n# Alveolar stops are reduced or omitted when between two consonants. Some examples include \"most people\" (can be written either as {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028as \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028ast \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], where the {{IPA|[t]}} is inaudible, and \"sand paper, grand master\", where the {{IPA|[d]}} is inaudible.\n# A consonant is shortened when it is before an identical consonant, such as in \"big game\" or \"top post\".\n# A [[Homorganic consonant|homorganic]] voiceless stop may be inserted after a [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] before a voiceless fricative followed by an unstressed vowel in the same word. For example, a [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p/}} can be detected in the word \"something\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u028cmp\u03b8\u026a\u014b]}} even though it is orthographically not indicated. This is known as [[epenthesis]]. However, the following vowel must be unstressed.\n# Velar stops {{IPA|/k,g/}} become more [[Front and back|front]] when the following vowel sound in the same syllable becomes more front. Compare for instance \"cap\" {{IPA|[k\u00e6p]}} vs. \"key\" {{IPA|[k\u02b2i]}} and \"gap\" {{IPA|[g\u00e6p]}} vs. \"geese\" {{IPA|[g\u02b2i\u02d0s]}}.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is [[Velarization|velarized]] at the end of a word when it comes after a vowel as well as before a consonant. Compare for example \"life\" {{IPA|[la\u026af]}} vs. \"file\" {{IPA|[fa\u026a\u026b]}} or \"feeling\" {{IPA|[fi\u02d0l\u026a\u014b]}} vs. \"feel\" {{IPA|[fi\u02d0\u026b]}}.\n\n===Other languages===\nThere are many examples for allophones in languages other than English. Typically, languages with a small phoneme inventory allow for quite a lot of allophonic variation: examples are [[Hawaiian language#Consonants|Hawaiian]] and [[Toki Pona#Allophony|Toki Pona]].

Not included yet: [[Quenya#Morphophonemics_and_allophony]], . Also the following has relevance here: [[Free variation]]. -->\n\n== Representing a phoneme with an allophone ==\nSince phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct [[phonetic transcription]]. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple [[broad transcription]] is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, the allophony becomes significant and things then become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, that representation is chosen for the phoneme.\n\nHowever, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than that allows. In such cases, a common convention is to use the \"elsewhere condition\" to decide the allophone that stands for the phoneme. The \"elsewhere\" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules.\n\nFor example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only before a nasal consonant in the same syllable; elsewhere, they are oral. Therefore, by the \"elsewhere\" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic, and nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.\n\nIn other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the languages of the world than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory.\n\nAn alternative, which is commonly used for [[archiphoneme]]s, is to use a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [\u014b].\n\nIn rare cases, a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as [[dingbat]]s, to avoid privileging any particular allophone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hale |first1=Mark |title=Marshallese phonology, the phonetics-phonology interface and historical linguistics |journal=The Linguistic Review |date=2000 |volume=17 |issue=2-4 |page=241-258}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Allo-]]\n*[[Allophonic rule]]\n*[[Allomorph]]\n*[[Alternation (linguistics)]]\n*[[Diaphoneme]]\n*[[List of phonetics topics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110212012436/http://www.elloandfriends.uni-osnabrueck.de/wikis/1/show?n=PhoneticsandPhonology.PhonemesAndAllophones Phonemes and allophones]\n\n[[Category:Phonetics]]\n[[Category:Phonology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Sounds considered the same in a language}}\n{{Use American English|date=February 2019}}\n{{for|the term for someone whose native language is not French or English, typically used in Canada|Allophone (Canada)}}\n[[File:Phoneme-allophone-determination-chart.svg|thumb|A simplified procedure to determine whether two sounds represent the same or different phonemes.

That has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are (see [[phoneme]] for details). Only some of the variation is significant, by being detectable or perceivable, to speakers.\n\nThere are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation or whether the speaker has the unconscious freedom to choose the allophone that is used.\n\nIf a specific allophone from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme must be selected in a given context, and using a different allophone for a phoneme would cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native, the allophones are said to be ''complementary''. The allophones then complement each other, and one of them is not used in a situation in which the usage of another is standard. For complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a [[phonology|phonological]] process.<ref name=\"ref47qoref\">{{Citation | title=English L2 reading: getting to the bottom | author=Barbara M.

Complementary distribution means that the allophones are 'distributed' as complements....''}}</ref>\n\nIn other cases, the speaker can freely select from ''[[free variation|free variant]]'' allophones on personal habit or preference, but free variant allophones are still selected in the specific context, not the other way around.\n\nAnother example of an allophone is [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], in which a phoneme is to sound more like another phoneme. One example of assimilation is [[consonant voicing and devoicing]], in which voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants, and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants.\n\n==Allotone==\nAn '''allotone''' is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonic]] allophone, such as the [[neutral tone]] in [[Standard Mandarin]].\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== English ===\n{{main|English phonology#Allophones of consonants|English phonology#Allophones of vowels}}\n \nThere are many allophonic processes in English: lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.\n\n* [[Aspirated consonant|Aspiration]]: In English, a voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} is aspirated (has a strong explosion of breath) if it is at the beginning of the first or a stressed syllable in a word. For example, {{IPA|[p\u02b0]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in [[complementary distribution]]). English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is [[unaspirated]] (plain). Many languages [[Aspirated consonant#Usage patterns|treat the two phones differently]].\n* Nasal plosion \u2013 In English, a plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/}}) has nasal plosion if it is followed by a nasal, whether within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Partial devoicing of [[sonorant]]s: In English, sonorants ({{IPA|/j, w, l, r, m, n, \u014b/}}) are partially devoiced after a voiceless sound in the same syllable.\n* Complete devoicing of sonorants: In English, a sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}).\n* Partial devoicing of [[obstruent]]s: In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Retraction: In English, {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} are [[Retracted (phonetics)|retracted]] before {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\nBecause the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}: unreleased {{IPA|[ t\u031a]}} as in ''cat'', aspirated {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} as in ''top'', glottalized {{IPA|[\u0294]}} as in ''button'', flapped {{IPA|[\u027e]}} as in [[American English]] ''water'', nasalized flapped {{IPA|[\u027e&#771;]}} as in ''winter'', and none of the above {{IPA|[t]}} as in ''stop''. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:\n\n*''Night rate'': unreleased {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u028c\u026at\u031a.\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}} (without a [[word space]] between {{IPA|[ . ]}} and {{IPA|[\u0279]}})\n*''Nitrate'': aspirated {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u02b0\u0279\u0325e\u026at\u031a]}} or retracted {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u0320\u0279\u0320\u030a\u02d4\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}}\n\nA flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated ''nitrate'' than for the unaspirated ''night rate.'' The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.\n\nAllophones of English {{IPA|/l/}} may be noticed if the 'light' {{IPA|[l]}} of ''leaf'' {{IPA|[\u02c8li\u02d0f]}} is contrasted with the 'dark' {{IPA|[\u026b]}} of ''feel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8fi\u02d0\u026b]}}. Again, the difference is much more obvious to a [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/\u026b/}} are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.\n\nThese descriptions are more sequentially broken down in the next section.\n\n=== Rules for English Consonant Allophones ===\n\n[[Peter Ladefoged]], a renowned [[phonetics|phonetician]], clearly explains the [[consonant]] [[allophones]] of [[language|English]] in a precise list of statements to illustrate the language behavior. Some of these rules apply to all the consonants of English; the first item on the list deals with consonant length, items 2 through 18 apply to only selected groups of consonants, and the last item deals with the quality of a consonant. \nThese descriptive rules are as follows<ref>Ladefoged, Peter (2001). A Course in Phonetics (4th ed.). Orlando: Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-15-507319-2}}. p. 56-60.</ref>:\n# Consonants are longer when at the end of a phrase. This can be easily tested by recording a speaker saying a sound like \u201cbib\u201d, then comparing the forward and backward playback of the recording. One will find that the backward playback does not sound like the forward playback because the production of what is expected to be the same sound is not identical.\n# [[Voicelessness|Voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] when they come at the beginning of a syllable, such as in words like \"pip, test, kick\" {{IPA|[p<sup>h</sup>\u026ap, t<sup>h</sup>\u025bst, k<sup>h</sup>\u026ak]}}. You can compare this with voiceless stops that are not [[syllable]] initial like \"stop\" [st\u0251p]. The {{IPA|/t/}} voiceless stop follows the {{IPA|/s/}} (fricative) here.\n# [[voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] [[obstruents]], which include stops and [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], such as {{IPA|/b,d,g,v,\u00f0,z,\u0292/}}, that come at the end of an utterance like {{IPA|/v/}} in \"improve\" or before a voiceless sound like {{IPA|/d/}} in \"add two\") are only briefly voiced during the articulation.\n# Voiced stops and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} in fact occur as voiceless at the beginning of a syllable unless immediately preceded by a voiced sound, in which the voiced sound carries over.\n# [[Approximant consonant|Approximants]] (in English, these include {{IPA|/w,r,j,l/}}) are partially voiceless when they occur after syllable-initial {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} like in \"play, twin, cue\" {{IPA|[pl\u0325e\u026a, tw\u0325\u026an, kj\u0325u]}}.\n# Voiceless stops {{IPA|/p,t,k/}} are not aspirated when following after a syllable initial fricative, such as in the words \"spew, stew, skew.\"\n# Voiceless stops and affricates {{IPA|/p,t,k,t\u0283/}} are longer than their voiced counterparts {{IPA|/b,d,g,d\u0292/}} when situated at the end of a syllable. Try comparing \"cap\" to \"cab\" or \"back\" to \"bag\".\n# When a stop comes before another stop, the explosion of air only follows after the second stop, illustrated in words like \"apt\" {{IPA|[\u00e6p\u031at]}} and \"rubbed\" {{IPA|[r\u028cb\u031ad]}}.\n# Many English accents produce a [[glottal stop]] in syllables that end with voiceless stops. Some examples include pronunciations of \"tip, pit, kick\" {{IPA|[t\u026a\u0294p, p\u026a\u0294t, k\u026a\u0294k]}}.\n# Some accents of English use a glottal stop in place of a {{IPA|/t/}} when it comes before an alveolar nasal in the same word (as opposed to in the next word), such as in the word \"beaten\" {{IPA|[\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0294n\u0329]}}.\n# Nasals become syllabic, or their own syllable, only when immediately following an obstruent (as opposed to just any consonant), such as in the words \"leaden, chasm\" {{IPA|[\u02c8l\u025bdn\u0329, \u02c8k\u00e6zm\u0329]}}. Take in comparison \"kiln, film\"; in most accents of English, the nasals are not syllabic.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}}, however, is syllabic at the end of the word when immediately following any consonant, like in \"paddle, whistle\" {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u00e6dl\u0329, \u02c8w\u026asl\u0329]}}. \n## When considering {{IPA|/r,l/}} as [[Liquid consonant|liquids]], {{IPA|/r/}} is included in this rule as well as present in the words \"sabre, razor, hammer, tailor\" {{IPA|[\u02c8se\u026ab\u0279\u0329, \u02c8re\u026az\u0279\u0329, \u02c8h\u00e6m\u0279\u0329, \u02c8te\u026al\u0279\u0329]}}.\n# [[voiceless dental and alveolar stops|Alveolar stops]] become [[Dental and alveolar taps and flaps|voiced taps]] when they occur between two vowels, as long as the second vowel is [[Stress (linguistics)|unstressed]]. Take for instance mainly American English pronunciations like \"fatty, data, daddy, many\" {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027e\u0259, \u02c8d\u00e6\u027ei, \u02c8m\u025b\u027e\u0303i]}}.\n## When an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar nasals|alveolar nasal]] is followed by a stop, the {{IPA|/t/}} is lost and a nasal tap occurs, causing \"winter\" to sound just like \"winner\" or \"panting\" to sound just like \"panning\". In this case, both alveolar stops and alveolar nasal plus stop sequences become voiced taps after two vowels when the second vowel is unstressed. This can vary among speakers, where the rule does not apply to certain words or when speaking at a slower pace.\n# All alveolar consonants assimilate to [[Dental consonant|dentals]] when occurring before a dental. Take the words \"eighth, tenth, wealth\". This also applies across word boundaries, for example \"at this\" {{IPA|[\u02c8\u00e6t\u032a \u00f0\u026as]]}}.\n# Alveolar stops are reduced or omitted when between two consonants. Some examples include \"most people\" (can be written either as {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028as \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8mo\u028ast \u02c8pipl\u0329]}} with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], where the {{IPA|[t]}} is inaudible, and \"sand paper, grand master\", where the {{IPA|[d]}} is inaudible.\n# A consonant is shortened when it is before an identical consonant, such as in \"big game\" or \"top post\".\n# A [[Homorganic consonant|homorganic]] voiceless stop may be inserted after a [[Nasal consonant|nasal]] before a voiceless fricative followed by an unstressed vowel in the same word. For example, a [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]] voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p/}} can be detected in the word \"something\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u028cmp\u03b8\u026a\u014b]}} even though it is orthographically not indicated. This is known as [[epenthesis]]. However, the following vowel must be unstressed.\n# Velar stops {{IPA|/k,g/}} become more [[Front and back|front]] when the following vowel sound in the same syllable becomes more front. Compare for instance \"cap\" {{IPA|[k\u00e6p]}} vs. \"key\" {{IPA|[k\u02b2i]}} and \"gap\" {{IPA|[g\u00e6p]}} vs. \"geese\" {{IPA|[g\u02b2i\u02d0s]}}.\n# The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is [[Velarization|velarized]] at the end of a word when it comes after a vowel as well as before a consonant. Compare for example \"life\" {{IPA|[la\u026af]}} vs. \"file\" {{IPA|[fa\u026a\u026b]}} or \"feeling\" {{IPA|[fi\u02d0l\u026a\u014b]}} vs. \"feel\" {{IPA|[fi\u02d0\u026b]}}.\n\n===Other languages===\nThere are many examples for allophones in languages other than English.

Not included yet: [[Quenya#Morphophonemics_and_allophony]], . Also the following has relevance here: [[Free variation]]. -->\n\n== Representing a phoneme with an allophone ==\nSince phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct [[phonetic transcription]]. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple [[broad transcription]] is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, the allophony becomes significant and things then become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, that representation is chosen for the phoneme.\n\nHowever, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than that allows. In such cases, a common convention is to use the \"elsewhere condition\" to decide the allophone that stands for the phoneme. The \"elsewhere\" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules.\n\nFor example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only before a nasal consonant in the same syllable; elsewhere, they are oral. Therefore, by the \"elsewhere\" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic, and nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.\n\nIn other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the languages of the world than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory.\n\nAn alternative, which is commonly used for [[archiphoneme]]s, is to use a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [\u014b].\n\nIn rare cases, a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as [[dingbat]]s, to avoid privileging any particular allophone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hale |first1=Mark |title=Marshallese phonology, the phonetics-phonology interface and historical linguistics |journal=The Linguistic Review |date=2000 |volume=17 |issue=2-4 |page=241-258}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Allo-]]\n*[[Allophonic rule]]\n*[[Allomorph]]\n*[[Alternation (linguistics)]]\n*[[Diaphoneme]]\n*[[List of phonetics topics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110212012436/http://www.elloandfriends.uni-osnabrueck.de/wikis/1/show?n=PhoneticsandPhonology.PhonemesAndAllophones Phonemes and allophones]\n\n[[Category:Phonetics]]\n[[Category:Phonology]]\n", "name_user": "149.255.198.4", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed grammar)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone"}

In May 1833, he travelled to Berlin, meeting such surgeons as [[Karl Ferdinand von Graefe]], [[Johann Nepomuk Rust]] and [[Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach]] at the [[University of Berlin]]. Professor [[Bernhard von Langenbeck]] taught Pirogov how to properly use the [[scalpel]].

Kirov Military Medical Academy|Imperial Academy of Military Medicine]] in [[Saint Petersburg]],<ref name=r1/> and undertook three years of military service in this period. He first used [[diethyl ether|ether]] as an [[anaesthetic]] in 1847, and investigated [[cholera]] from 1848.

In 1858 he received the rank of [[Privy Councillor (Russia)|Privy Councillor]] and was transferred to [[Kiev]] as a superintendent of schools of the Kiev Educational District after disagreements with the [[Odessa]] governor general.<ref name='shtreich' /> In 1861 he became a member of the Main Directorate of Schools, serving at the [[Ministry of National Education (Russian Empire)|Ministry of National Education]] up until his death. Same year he bought an estate in the Vishnya village near [[Vinnytsia]].\n\nIn 1862, he took charge of a delegation of Russian students sent overseas to prepare for professorship. He lived in [[Heidelberg]] and at one point treated [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s injury sustained at [[Aspromonte]] on 28 August. In 1866 upon return to Russia he settled down at his estate, treating local peasants and establishing a free clinic.<ref name=\"r1\" />\n\nIn 1870 he visited the battlefields and field hospitals of the [[Franco\u2013Prussian War]] as a representative of the Russian [[Red Cross]], and in 1877\u20141878 spent several months working as a field surgeon during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War]], treating both Russian and [[Bulgaria]]n soldiers and organizing field hospitals. In 1879 he published The Old Physician's Diary and \"Questions of Life\".<ref name=\"r1\" />\n\nHe last appeared in public on 24 May 1881 and died later that year at his Vishnya estate, [[Podolian Governorate]] (modern-day Vinnytsia, [[Ukraine]]). His body is preserved using [[embalming]] techniques he himself developed, and rests in a church in Vinnytsia. Compared to the corpse of [[Lenin]], which undergoes thorough maintenance in a special underground clinic twice a week, the body of Pirogov rests untouched and unchanging: it is said that only dust has to be brushed off of it. It resides at room temperature in a glass-lid coffin (while Lenin's body is preserved at a constant low temperature).\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:1960 CPA 2504.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet 1960 stamp, published during his 150th anniversary]]\n\nNikolay Pirogov was from 1847 corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and received in 1844, 1851 and 1860 the [[Demidov Prize]] by the academy. He was appointed honorary citizen of Moscow in 1881. The Pirogov Society was founded four years after his death, which aims for better medical training and treatment in Russia.\n\nThe Pirogov Museum is located in Vinnytsia, Ukraine at his former estate and clinic. Near this 1947 building is a [[mausoleum]] which is used as a family chapel and in which his embalmed body is visible in public.

The medical universities [[Russian National Research Medical University]] and [[Odessa State Medical University]] were formerly named after him, until the [[1917 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution]]; [[Vinnytsia Medical University]] was named after N. Pirogov in 1960. Stamps with his portrait were published in the Soviet Union in 1949 and his 150th anniversary in 1960. The highest humanitarian prize in the Soviet Union was the Pirogov Gold Medal.\n\nApart from his developed foot amputation techniques, several anatomical structures were named after him, such as the [[Pirogoff angle]]; the [[Pirogoff aponeurosis]], a structure from [[fascia]] and the [[aponeurosis]] of the [[biceps]]; the [[Pirogoff triangle]], a triangular area located between the [[mylohyoid muscle]], the intermediate [[tendon]] of the [[musculus digastricus]] and the [[hypoglossal nerve]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book|url=http://runeberg.org/nfca/0518.html|title=Nordisk Familjebok.

He encouraged female volunteers as an organised corps of nurses, the [[Khrestovozdvizhenskaya]] ([[:ru:\u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0451\u0440 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u044f|ru]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encblago.lfond.spb.ru/showObject.do?object=2824182532|title= Exaltation of the Holy Cross Community of Sisters of Charity|language=russian}}</ref> at the Saint Petersburg Charity Encyclopedia community of nurses established by [[Grand Duchess Yelena Pavlovna]] in 1854<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2492652?seq=1 Russian Sisters of Mercy in the Crimea, 1854-1855]</ref>, after the Crimean War [[Florence Nightingale]] laid the foundations of professional nursing for the British.\n\n===Return and retirement===\n[[File:Ilya Repin Portrait of the Surgeon Nikolay Pirogov 1881.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Nikolay Pirogov by [[Ilya Repin]], 1881]]\nIn 1856 after the end of war he returned to Saint Petersburg and withdrew from the academy following the suggestion to work as a superintendent of schools of the Odessa Educational District which united several governorates.<ref name='shtreich' /> He wrote an influential paper on the problems of [[pedagogy]], arguing for the [[universal education|education]] of the poor, non-Russians, and women. (He was influential in his family's decision to educate his niece [[Henriette Saloz-Joudra|Henriette Joudra]] who would go on to earn her medical doctorate and become the first woman to open a private medical practice in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://100elles.ch/biographies/henriette-saloz-joudra/|title=Henriette SALOZ-JOUDRA|website=100 Elles*|language=fr-CH|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nHe also argued against early specialisation, and for the development of [[secondary school]]s. In 1858 he received the rank of [[Privy Councillor (Russia)|Privy Councillor]] and was transferred to [[Kiev]] as a superintendent of schools of the Kiev Educational District after disagreements with the [[Odessa]] governor general.<ref name='shtreich' /> In 1861 he became a member of the Main Directorate of Schools, serving at the [[Ministry of National Education (Russian Empire)|Ministry of National Education]] up until his death. Same year he bought an estate in the Vishnya village near [[Vinnytsia]].\n\nIn 1862, he took charge of a delegation of Russian students sent overseas to prepare for professorship. He lived in [[Heidelberg]] and at one point treated [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s injury sustained at [[Aspromonte]] on 28 August. In 1866 upon return to Russia he settled down at his estate, treating local peasants and establishing a free clinic.<ref name=\"r1\" />\n\nIn 1870 he visited the battlefields and field hospitals of the [[Franco\u2013Prussian War]] as a representative of the Russian [[Red Cross]], and in 1877\u20141878 spent several months working as a field surgeon during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War]], treating both Russian and [[Bulgaria]]n soldiers and organizing field hospitals. In 1879 he published The Old Physician's Diary and \"Questions of Life\".<ref name=\"r1\" />\n\nHe last appeared in public on 24 May 1881 and died later that year at his Vishnya estate, [[Podolian Governorate]] (modern-day Vinnytsia, [[Ukraine]]). His body is preserved using [[embalming]] techniques he himself developed, and rests in a church in Vinnytsia. Compared to the corpse of [[Lenin]], which undergoes thorough maintenance in a special underground clinic twice a week, the body of Pirogov rests untouched and unchanging: it is said that only dust has to be brushed off of it. It resides at room temperature in a glass-lid coffin (while Lenin's body is preserved at a constant low temperature).\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:1960 CPA 2504.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet 1960 stamp, published during his 150th anniversary]]\n\nNikolay Pirogov was from 1847 corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and received in 1844, 1851 and 1860 the [[Demidov Prize]] by the academy. He was appointed honorary citizen of Moscow in 1881. The Pirogov Society was founded four years after his death, which aims for better medical training and treatment in Russia.\n\nThe Pirogov Museum is located in Vinnytsia, Ukraine at his former estate and clinic. Near this 1947 building is a [[mausoleum]] which is used as a family chapel and in which his embalmed body is visible in public. [[Pirogov Glacier]] in [[Antarctica]],<ref>[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=136909 Pirogov Glacier.] SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica.</ref> the large [[Pirogov Hospital]] in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria and the [[2506 Pirogov]] [[asteroid]], discovered in August 1976 by Russian astronomer [[Nikolai Chernykh]], are all named in honour of him. The medical universities [[Russian National Research Medical University]] and [[Odessa State Medical University]] were formerly named after him, until the [[1917 Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution]]; [[Vinnytsia Medical University]] was named after N. Pirogov in 1960. Stamps with his portrait were published in the Soviet Union in 1949 and his 150th anniversary in 1960. The highest humanitarian prize in the Soviet Union was the Pirogov Gold Medal.\n\nApart from his developed foot amputation techniques, several anatomical structures were named after him, such as the [[Pirogoff angle]]; the [[Pirogoff aponeurosis]], a structure from [[fascia]] and the [[aponeurosis]] of the [[biceps]]; the [[Pirogoff triangle]], a triangular area located between the [[mylohyoid muscle]], the intermediate [[tendon]] of the [[musculus digastricus]] and the [[hypoglossal nerve]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book|url=http://runeberg.org/nfca/0518.html|title=Nordisk Familjebok.
