The population was 31,063 at the 2010 census, down from 31,638 at the 2000 census.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lordsburg Pacific Electric station (00013185).jpg|thumb|left|The Lordsburg [[Pacific Electric]] station, 1922]]\n\nThe history of the area dates back to the 1830s when [[Ygnacio Palomares]] received the {{convert|15000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} [[Rancho San Jose (Palomares)|Rancho San Jose]] land grant from Governor [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]] in 1837.  The land included the present day cities [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], [[Claremont, California|Claremont]], [[San Dimas, California|San Dimas]], [[Glendora, California|Glendora]], and La Verne.  The adobe which Palomares built in 1837 is still preserved in Pomona as [[La Casa Primera de Rancho San Jose]] (The First House).  Palomares soon moved a mile or so northeast and constructed the [[Ygnacio Palomares Adobe]].  He ensured that a nephew, Jose Dolores Palomares, secured a tract of land a mile west.  In the mid-1880s, entrepreneur Isaac W. Lord purchased a tract of Jose Palomares' land and convinced the Santa Fe Railroad company to run its line across towards [[Los Angeles]]. Lord had the land surveyed for building lots and in 1887 had a large land sale, naming the new town 'Lordsburg' after himself.  He also had a large Lordsburg Hotel constructed, but the land boom was over by the time it was completed.  It sat empty for several years, until sold to four members of the German Baptist Brethren Church, who persuaded others of that denomination that it would be an excellent site for a new institution of higher learning.  Lordsburg College was founded in 1891.  In 1906 the town was incorporated as \"La Verne.\"  Residents grew field crops, then began planting citrus trees, which flourished.  Lordsburg became known as the \"Heart of the Orange Empire.\" The city of La Verne flourished as a center of the citrus industry until after World War II, when the citrus industry slowly faded away.  Today the last two orange groves are on the grounds of the La Verne Mansion and Heritage Park.\n\n==Geography==\nLa Verne is a [[suburb]] {{convert|30|mi|km}} east of [[Los Angeles]], located in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] below the foothills of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]].

The population was 31,063 at the 2010 census, down from 31,638 at the 2000 census.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lordsburg Pacific Electric station (00013185).jpg|thumb|left|The Lordsburg [[Pacific Electric]] station, 1922]]\n\nThe history of the area dates back to the 1830s when [[Ygnacio Palomares]] received the {{convert|15000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} [[Rancho San Jose (Palomares)|Rancho San Jose]] land grant from Governor [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]] in 1837.  The land included the present day cities [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], [[Claremont, California|Claremont]], [[San Dimas, California|San Dimas]], [[Glendora, California|Glendora]], and La Verne.  The adobe which Palomares built in 1837 is still preserved in Pomona as [[La Casa Primera de Rancho San Jose]] (The First House).  Palomares soon moved a mile or so northeast and constructed the [[Ygnacio Palomares Adobe]].  He ensured that a nephew, Jose Dolores Palomares, secured a tract of land a mile west.  In the mid-1880s, entrepreneur Isaac W. Lord purchased a tract of Jose Palomares' land and convinced the Santa Fe Railroad company to run its line across towards [[Los Angeles]]. Lord had the land surveyed for building lots and in 1887 had a large land sale, naming the new town 'Lordsburg' after himself.  He also had a large Lordsburg Hotel constructed, but the land boom was over by the time it was completed.  It sat empty for several years, until sold to four members of the German Baptist Brethren Church, who persuaded others of that denomination that it would be an excellent site for a new institution of higher learning.  Lordsburg College was founded in 1891.  In 1906 the town was incorporated as \"La Verne.\"  Residents grew field crops, then began planting citrus trees, which flourished.  Lordsburg became known as the \"Heart of the Orange Empire.\" The city of La Verne flourished as a center of the citrus industry until after World War II, when the citrus industry slowly faded away.  Today the last two orange groves are on the grounds of the La Verne Mansion and Heritage Park.\n\n==Geography==\nLa Verne is a [[suburb]] {{convert|30|mi|km}} east of [[Los Angeles]], located in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] below the foothills of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]].

Soon after, in 1921, the airport was renamed \"Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field\" for the [[World War I]] pilots Ernest Groves Wold and Cyrus Foss Chamberlain. [[Howard Hughes]] briefly stopped at Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field on his round the world flight in 1938. In 1944 the site was renamed to \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metropolitan Airport/Wold-Chamberlain Field\", with \"International\" replacing \"Metropolitan\" four years later. Today it is rare to see the Wold\u2013Chamberlain portion of the name used anywhere.\n\nMSP was the main base for [[Northwest Airlines]] starting in 1926 and became the main base of regional carrier [[North Central Airlines]] in 1952. North Central merged with [[Southern Airways]] to form [[Republic Airlines (1979\u20131986)|Republic Airlines]] in 1979; Republic then merged with Northwest in 1986. The combined carrier came to control 79% of traffic at the airport, and merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] in 2010.\n\nGround was broken for the current Charles Lindbergh terminal building on October 26, 1958.<ref name=\"funfacts\">{{cite web|title=Fun Facts|url=http://www.mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|accessdate=June 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609090625/http://mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The US $8.5 million, 600,000 square foot (56,000 m<sup>2</sup>) terminal with 24 gates on two concourses was designed by Lyle George Landstrom<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|title=Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport, Lindbergh Terminal, 4300 Glumack Drive, Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=|access-date=October 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729230512/http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|archive-date=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> who worked for Cerny Associates and completed on January 13, 1962 and operations began on January 21, 1962.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /><ref name=\"arch\">{{cite journal |date=2002|title=Architecture Minnesota|journal=Architecture Minnesota|volume=28|issue=1|page=49|publisher=Minnesota Society American Institute of Architects}}</ref> Pier D (formerly the Gold Concourse, now Concourse C) was completed in 1971 and Pier A (formerly the Green Concourse, now Concourse G) was completed in 1972 as part of an expansion of the terminal designed by Cerny Associates.<ref name=\"arch\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport: Looking Back and Moving Forward|first=Patrick|last=Hogan|url=http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|year=2013|accessdate=May 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712062310/http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|archive-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This project also involved rebuilding the existing concourses into bi-level structures equipped with [[Gate (airport)|holding rooms]] and [[jet bridge]]s.<ref name=\"arch\" /> It handles airlines such as Delta, United and others.

Ironically, MSP was selected in part for notorious winter climate, yet the filming period remained stubbornly fair-weathered, forcing film crews to employ copious amounts of fake snow. As filming had to take place during normal airport operations, several features of the airport itself, such as the color-based labeling of different concourses, were present in the movie. This labeling system was replaced beginning in 2000 with the more familiar system of lettered concourses.\n\nDue in part to aircraft noise in south Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, proposals were made in the 1990s to build a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro in [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] to handle larger jets and more international traffic.<ref>{{cite web |title=MSP Intl.

A citizen group named ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket) was created in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions. Later, in 2004, the MAC voted to reduce funding for the soundproofing projects, saying in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Minneapolis Mayor [[R. T. Rybak]], who had been a founding member of ROAR, promised that the city would challenge the changes.\n\nThe Hubert H. Humphrey Terminal was built in 2001. It is used mostly for charter and low cost airlines, including Minnesota-based [[Sun Country Airlines|Sun Country]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]], but is also used for [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]] and [[JetBlue]].

Northwest operated 747-400s from Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Hong Kong and Osaka in 1998; both were dropped later that year. Northwest also operated DC-10s Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Oslo and Frankfurt, but they too were dropped. From the early 1990s to the 2000s (decade), [[KLM]] flew 747s and MD-11s from Amsterdam to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. In part because of the Delta/KLM joint venture, KLM did not serve Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul with its own aircraft between 2004 and March 2017, when service resumed. Beginning in the summer of 2013 [[Air France]] commenced non-stop, seasonal Airbus A340-300 flights from [[Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. Service switches to a Boeing 777-200ER in 2019. [[Condor Airlines]] began non-stop seasonal 767-300 service to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul from Frankfurt in the summer of 2014.\n\n[[Great Lakes Airlines]] added services to small communities that had lost service from the legacy carriers in the 2010s, but hub status was removed in 2014, with the airline blaming a lack of qualified pilots. Some service moved to other airports, while other service was picked up by [[Air Choice One]] and [[Boutique Air]].\n\nThe [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] typically screens about 34,000 people at MSP daily and screens about 18,000 checked bags. The airport's current record for passengers and bags was set on February 5, 2018, which was the day after [[Super Bowl LII]]. That record is 60,883 passengers screened at TSA checkpoints and 34,368 checked bags screened.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|title=One Day After 60K-Plus Passengers, MSP Officials Overjoyed|work=KSTP|access-date=February 7, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207015952/http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|archive-date=February 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For the event, the TSA brought in more than 100 additional agents and 20 canines to MSP for the expected number of passengers.\n\n===Future===\nIn 2004 Northwest Airlines proposed expanding the Lindbergh Terminal 1 to accommodate growing flight operations in a plan known as the ''MSP 2020 Vision''. The proposed expansion included moving all airlines other than [[Northwest Airlines]] and its [[SkyTeam]] alliance partners to the Humphrey Terminal 2. This caused increased concern about Northwest Airlines' control of the Minneapolis/St. Paul commercial air service market with some claiming that Northwest was using its market position to inflate airfares. While [[AirTran Airways]] voiced opposition to the plan, [[American Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]] remained neutral on the move since both had exclusive terminals at their own main hubs. Despite the merger between Northwest and [[Delta Air Lines]], there are still plans in place to carry out these expansions. In August 2015, the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) approved a plan that looks out to the year 2035. At the meeting the airlines were split into three groups: All [[SkyTeam]] airlines, [[Southwest Airlines]] and all other passenger airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111800/https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe final plan includes three phases through 2020, 2030 and 2035.

Several large [[parking ramp]]s are available for [[automobiles|cars]]. Most other connections are made at the Hub Building and adjacent Transit Center, which has city and shuttle bus, [[taxicab|taxi]], [[light-rail]] and [[renting|rental]] car service. Two [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Airport Trams|trams]] ([[people mover]]s) are at the airport. One carries passengers from the main section of Lindbergh Terminal 1 to the Hub Building and another runs along [[Concourse]] C in that terminal.\n\nThe airport is near [[Fort Snelling]], the site of one of the earliest United States government settlements in the area. Both the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] rivers flow nearby. [[Minnesota State Highway 5]] provides the closest entrance to the Lindbergh Terminal 1, just a short distance from [[Interstate 494]]. The Humphrey Terminal 2 is accessed via the 34th Avenue exit from I-494, which runs past [[Fort Snelling National Cemetery]]. Delta Air Lines has hangars arranged along I-494 and 34th Avenue, so it's possible to see airliners undergoing maintenance while driving past.\n\n===Runways===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport covers 2,930 acres (1,186 ha) and has four [[runway]]s, all with high intensity lights.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nRunway 17/35 opened in October 2005. Prior to that time, a number of buildings (including several hangars and the [[Richfield, Minnesota|City of Richfield]]'s Rich Acres Golf Course) were demolished to make way for the runway protection zone of the new runway.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Aircraft approaching Runway 35 fly slightly east of the [[Mall of America]], overfly [[Interstate 494]] and land seconds later. Due to noise concerns from south [[Minneapolis]], between August 13, 2007 and October 18, 2007, Runway 17/35 was used regularly during construction on Runway 12R/30L.\n\n===Terminals===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport has two terminals with a total of 131 gates, both of which were named for famous Minnesotans: the Lindbergh Terminal 1 (named after the aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]]) and the smaller Humphrey Terminal 2 (named for former [[United States Vice President|US Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]). The terminals are on different sides of the airfield and not interconnected; one who wishes to transfer between terminals must take the free Light Rail.\n\n'''Lindbergh Terminal 1''', the larger of the two terminals, has seven concourses, lettered A\u2013G, although they are all interconnected and can be accessed by either the north or south security checkpoints. Terminal 1 currently has 117 gates. Concourse C has a tram that goes from Gate C1 to gate C27, with a stop in the middle near Gate C12. There is a skyway that connects concourse G with concourse C. All international arrivals at Terminal 1 from airports without border pre-clearance are handled at concourse G. Terminal 1 houses the [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] hub, as well as [[Air Canada]], [[Air Choice One]], [[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]], [[American Airlines|American]], [[Boutique Air]], [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], [[Spirit Airlines|Spirit]] and [[United Airlines|United]]. Delta operates two Sky Clubs within the terminal, while United operates a United Club in Concourse E.\n\n'''Humphrey Terminal 2''', consists entirely of Concourse H. The old Humphrey Terminal 2, built in 1986, was rebuilt in 2001 to expand capacity and give passengers a more seamless experience.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /> The terminal now has 14 gates and houses the primary hub for [[Sun Country Airlines]], as well as [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]], [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]].\n\n===Ground transportation===\nThe terminal buildings are directly located off of [[Minnesota State Highway 5]]. Several other major highways that border the airport are [[Minnesota State Highway 62 (Hennepin-Dakota Counties)|Minnesota State Highway 62]], [[Minnesota State Highway 77]], and [[Interstate 494]].\n\n[[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] operates bus route 54 to MSP.

Soon after, in 1921, the airport was renamed \"Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field\" for the [[World War I]] pilots Ernest Groves Wold and Cyrus Foss Chamberlain. [[Howard Hughes]] briefly stopped at Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field on his round the world flight in 1938. In 1944 the site was renamed to \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metropolitan Airport/Wold-Chamberlain Field\", with \"International\" replacing \"Metropolitan\" four years later. Today it is rare to see the Wold\u2013Chamberlain portion of the name used anywhere.\n\nMSP was the main base for [[Northwest Airlines]] starting in 1926 and became the main base of regional carrier [[North Central Airlines]] in 1952. North Central merged with [[Southern Airways]] to form [[Republic Airlines (1979\u20131986)|Republic Airlines]] in 1979; Republic then merged with Northwest in 1986. The combined carrier came to control 79% of traffic at the airport, and merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] in 2010.\n\nGround was broken for the current Charles Lindbergh terminal building on October 26, 1958.<ref name=\"funfacts\">{{cite web|title=Fun Facts|url=http://www.mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|accessdate=June 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609090625/http://mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The US $8.5 million, 600,000 square foot (56,000 m<sup>2</sup>) terminal with 24 gates on two concourses was designed by Lyle George Landstrom<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|title=Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport, Lindbergh Terminal, 4300 Glumack Drive, Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=|access-date=October 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729230512/http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|archive-date=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> who worked for Cerny Associates and completed on January 13, 1962 and operations began on January 21, 1962.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /><ref name=\"arch\">{{cite journal |date=2002|title=Architecture Minnesota|journal=Architecture Minnesota|volume=28|issue=1|page=49|publisher=Minnesota Society American Institute of Architects}}</ref> Pier D (formerly the Gold Concourse, now Concourse C) was completed in 1971 and Pier A (formerly the Green Concourse, now Concourse G) was completed in 1972 as part of an expansion of the terminal designed by Cerny Associates.<ref name=\"arch\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport: Looking Back and Moving Forward|first=Patrick|last=Hogan|url=http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|year=2013|accessdate=May 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712062310/http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|archive-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This project also involved rebuilding the existing concourses into bi-level structures equipped with [[Gate (airport)|holding rooms]] and [[jet bridge]]s.<ref name=\"arch\" /> It handles airlines such as Delta, United and others.

Ironically, MSP was selected in part for notorious winter climate, yet the filming period remained stubbornly fair-weathered, forcing film crews to employ copious amounts of fake snow. As filming had to take place during normal airport operations, several features of the airport itself, such as the color-based labeling of different concourses, were present in the movie. This labeling system was replaced beginning in 2000 with the more familiar system of lettered concourses.\n\nDue in part to aircraft noise in south Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, proposals were made in the 1990s to build a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro in [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] to handle larger jets and more international traffic.<ref>{{cite web |title=MSP Intl.

A citizen group named ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket) was created in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions. Later, in 2004, the MAC voted to reduce funding for the soundproofing projects, saying in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Minneapolis Mayor [[R. T. Rybak]], who had been a founding member of ROAR, promised that the city would challenge the changes.\n\nThe Hubert H. Humphrey Terminal was built in 2001. It is used mostly for charter and low cost airlines, including Minnesota-based [[Sun Country Airlines|Sun Country]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]], but is also used for [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]] and [[JetBlue]].

Northwest operated 747-400s from Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Hong Kong and Osaka in 1998; both were dropped later that year. Northwest also operated DC-10s Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Oslo and Frankfurt, but they too were dropped. From the early 1990s to the 2000s (decade), [[KLM]] flew 747s and MD-11s from Amsterdam to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. In part because of the Delta/KLM joint venture, KLM did not serve Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul with its own aircraft between 2004 and March 2017, when service resumed. Beginning in the summer of 2013 [[Air France]] commenced non-stop, seasonal Airbus A340-300 flights from [[Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. Service switches to a Boeing 777-200ER in 2019. [[Condor Airlines]] began non-stop seasonal 767-300 service to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul from Frankfurt in the summer of 2014.\n\n[[Great Lakes Airlines]] added services to small communities that had lost service from the legacy carriers in the 2010s, but hub status was removed in 2014, with the airline blaming a lack of qualified pilots. Some service moved to other airports, while other service was picked up by [[Air Choice One]] and [[Boutique Air]].\n\nThe [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] typically screens about 34,000 people at MSP daily and screens about 18,000 checked bags. The airport's current record for passengers and bags was set on February 5, 2018, which was the day after [[Super Bowl LII]]. That record is 60,883 passengers screened at TSA checkpoints and 34,368 checked bags screened.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|title=One Day After 60K-Plus Passengers, MSP Officials Overjoyed|work=KSTP|access-date=February 7, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207015952/http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|archive-date=February 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For the event, the TSA brought in more than 100 additional agents and 20 canines to MSP for the expected number of passengers.\n\n===Future===\nIn 2004 Northwest Airlines proposed expanding the Lindbergh Terminal 1 to accommodate growing flight operations in a plan known as the ''MSP 2020 Vision''. The proposed expansion included moving all airlines other than [[Northwest Airlines]] and its [[SkyTeam]] alliance partners to the Humphrey Terminal 2. This caused increased concern about Northwest Airlines' control of the Minneapolis/St. Paul commercial air service market with some claiming that Northwest was using its market position to inflate airfares. While [[AirTran Airways]] voiced opposition to the plan, [[American Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]] remained neutral on the move since both had exclusive terminals at their own main hubs. Despite the merger between Northwest and [[Delta Air Lines]], there are still plans in place to carry out these expansions. In August 2015, the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) approved a plan that looks out to the year 2035. At the meeting the airlines were split into three groups: All [[SkyTeam]] airlines, [[Southwest Airlines]] and all other passenger airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111800/https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe final plan includes three phases through 2020, 2030 and 2035.

Several large [[parking ramp]]s are available for [[automobiles|cars]]. Most other connections are made at the Hub Building and adjacent Transit Center, which has city and shuttle bus, [[taxicab|taxi]], [[light-rail]] and [[renting|rental]] car service. Two [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Airport Trams|trams]] ([[people mover]]s) are at the airport. One carries passengers from the main section of Lindbergh Terminal 1 to the Hub Building and another runs along [[Concourse]] C in that terminal.\n\nThe airport is near [[Fort Snelling]], the site of one of the earliest United States government settlements in the area. Both the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] rivers flow nearby. [[Minnesota State Highway 5]] provides the closest entrance to the Lindbergh Terminal 1, just a short distance from [[Interstate 494]]. The Humphrey Terminal 2 is accessed via the 34th Avenue exit from I-494, which runs past [[Fort Snelling National Cemetery]]. Delta Air Lines has hangars arranged along I-494 and 34th Avenue, so it's possible to see airliners undergoing maintenance while driving past.\n\n===Runways===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport covers 2,930 acres (1,186 ha) and has four [[runway]]s, all with high intensity lights.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nRunway 17/35 opened in October 2005. Prior to that time, a number of buildings (including several hangars and the [[Richfield, Minnesota|City of Richfield]]'s Rich Acres Golf Course) were demolished to make way for the runway protection zone of the new runway.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Aircraft approaching Runway 35 fly slightly east of the [[Mall of America]], overfly [[Interstate 494]] and land seconds later. Due to noise concerns from south [[Minneapolis]], between August 13, 2007 and October 18, 2007, Runway 17/35 was used regularly during construction on Runway 12R/30L.\n\n===Terminals===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport has two terminals with a total of 131 gates, both of which were named for famous Minnesotans: the Lindbergh Terminal 1 (named after the aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]]) and the smaller Humphrey Terminal 2 (named for former [[United States Vice President|US Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]). The terminals are on different sides of the airfield and not interconnected; one who wishes to transfer between terminals must take the free Light Rail.\n\n'''Lindbergh Terminal 1''', the larger of the two terminals, has seven concourses, lettered A\u2013G, although they are all interconnected and can be accessed by either the north or south security checkpoints. Terminal 1 currently has 117 gates. Concourse C has a tram that goes from Gate C1 to gate C27, with a stop in the middle near Gate C12. There is a skyway that connects concourse G with concourse C. All international arrivals at Terminal 1 from airports without border pre-clearance are handled at concourse G. Terminal 1 houses the [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] hub, as well as [[Air Canada]], [[Air Choice One]], [[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]], [[American Airlines|American]], [[Boutique Air]], [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], [[Spirit Airlines|Spirit]] and [[United Airlines|United]]. Delta operates two Sky Clubs within the terminal, while United operates a United Club in Concourse E.\n\n'''Humphrey Terminal 2''', consists entirely of Concourse H. The old Humphrey Terminal 2, built in 1986, was rebuilt in 2001 to expand capacity and give passengers a more seamless experience.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /> The terminal now has 14 gates and houses the primary hub for [[Sun Country Airlines]], as well as [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]], [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]].\n\n===Ground transportation===\nThe terminal buildings are directly located off of [[Minnesota State Highway 5]]. Several other major highways that border the airport are [[Minnesota State Highway 62 (Hennepin-Dakota Counties)|Minnesota State Highway 62]], [[Minnesota State Highway 77]], and [[Interstate 494]].\n\n[[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] operates bus route 54 to MSP.

Nevertheless, Bukhtishu II was in turn called to the city to treat the [[Al-Hadi|Caliph al-Hadi]], who was gravely ill. He was unable to establish himself in Baghdad until 787 CE, when [[Harun al-Rashid|Caliph Harun al-Rashid]] was suffering violently painful headaches. He successfully treated Harun al-Rashid and in gratitude the caliph made him physician-in-chief, a post he held onto until his death in 801 C.E.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">H.A.R. Gibb, ed.

In 791 CE, Bukhtishu II recommended Jibril as a physician to [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar the Barmakid]], the [[vizier]] of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. Despite the recommendation, Jibril did not succeed his father until 805 CE, after he successfully treated one of Harun al-Rashid's slaves, thereby winning the confidence of the caliph.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>   \n\t\nDuring Jibril's time in Baghdad, he advised Harun al-Rashid in the building of its first hospital.<ref name=\"Timothy S. Miller, The Knights\">Timothy S. Miller, \"The Knights\"</ref> The hospital and connected observatory was modeled after the one in Gondeshapur where Jibril had studied medicine and served as the director.<ref>Majid Fahkry, \"Philosophy\"</ref> Jibril also served as the director of this new hospital, which Harun al-Rashid named after himself.<ref name=\"Timothy S. Miller, The Knights\"/>\n\t\nThe Abbasid court physicians gained high standing and trust once accepted and employed by the caliph, as illustrated by the anecdote in which Harun al-Rashid used Jibril to try to humble his vizier Yahya al-Barmaki on an occasion when Yahya entered the caliph's presence without first gaining permission. In his collection of prose, [[Tha'alibi]] cites a story he heard from al-Babbagha:\n<blockquote>\"Bakhtishu\u2019 ibn Jibril relates from his father\u2026Then al-Rashid turned to me and said, \u2018Jibril, is there anyone who would come before you without your permission in your own house?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, nor would anyone hope to do that.\u2019 He said: \u2018So what is the matter with us that people come in here without permission?\u2019\"</blockquote>\nAfter this exchange, Yahya skillfully reminds Harun al-Rashid that he had been granted the privilege of entering his presence without permission by asking the caliph if a change had been made in court etiquette.<ref>Andras Hamori, \"A Sampling\"</ref> \n\t\nBeing a part of such court interactions, Jibril would occasionally approach the caliph with a level of frankness not allowed most attendants. During Harun al-Rashid's final illness, Jibril's matter-of-fact responses to the caliph won him disgrace and soon after he was condemned to death. He was saved from execution by [[Fadl ibn al-Rabi]] and subsequently became the physician of [[al-Amin]]. After [[al-Ma'mun]] gained power, Jibril again faced imprisonment, but was needed to treat Hasan ibn Sahl and thus was released in 817 CE. Three years later he was replaced by his son-in-law, Mikha\u2019il, but was again called to Baghdad in 827 CE when Mikha\u2019il was unable to treat the caliph. He died in the favor of the caliph sometime between 827 and 829 CE and, being Christian, was buried in the Monastery of St. Sergius in [[Ctesiphon]] which is in modern-day Iraq, on the east bank of the Tigris.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> \n\t\nDuring the ninth and tenth century, the Bukhtishus had a virtual monopoly on the practice of medicine in Baghdad.<ref>P.M.

Browne, Arabian Medicine, 57</ref>\n\t\n[[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] gained Jibril's his recommendation after studying Greek for several years, which allowed him to become known in later centuries in both the Near East and in Europe for his translations.<ref>Edward G.

After his father's death, his mother married another physician. Jibrail III began studying medicine exclusively in Baghdad, where he went penniless after the death of his mother. After treating an envoy from [[Kirman]], he was called to [[Shiraz]] by the [[Buyid]] ruler [['Adud al-Dawla]] but soon after he returned to Baghdad.

Nevertheless, Bukhtishu II was in turn called to the city to treat the [[Al-Hadi|Caliph al-Hadi]], who was gravely ill. He was unable to establish himself in Baghdad until 787 CE, when [[Harun al-Rashid|Caliph Harun al-Rashid]] was suffering violently painful headaches. He successfully treated Harun al-Rashid and in gratitude the caliph made him physician-in-chief, a post he held onto until his death in 801 C.E.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">H.A.R. Gibb, ed.

In 791 CE, Bukhtishu II recommended Jibril as a physician to [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar the Barmakid]], the [[vizier]] of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. Despite the recommendation, Jibril did not succeed his father until 805 CE, after he successfully treated one of Harun al-Rashid\u2019s slaves, thereby winning the confidence of the caliph.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>   \n\t\nDuring Jibril\u2019s time in Baghdad, he advised Harun al-Rashid in the building of its first hospital.<ref name=\"Timothy S. Miller, The Knights\">Timothy S. Miller, \"The Knights\"</ref> The hospital and connected observatory was modeled after the one in Gondeshapur where Jibril had studied medicine and served as the director.<ref>Majid Fahkry, \"Philosophy\"</ref> Jibril also served as the director of this new hospital, which Harun al-Rashid named after himself.<ref name=\"Timothy S. Miller, The Knights\"/>\n\t\nThe Abbasid court physicians gained high standing and trust once accepted and employed by the caliph, as illustrated by the anecdote in which Harun al-Rashid used Jibril to try to humble his vizier Yahya al-Barmaki on an occasion when Yahya entered the caliph\u2019s presence without first gaining permission. In his collection of prose, [[Tha'alibi]] cites a story he heard from al-Babbagha:\n<blockquote>\"Bakhtishu\u2019 ibn Jibril relates from his father\u2026Then al-Rashid turned to me and said, \u2018Jibril, is there anyone who would come before you without your permission in your own house?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, nor would anyone hope to do that.\u2019 He said: \u2018So what is the matter with us that people come in here without permission?\u2019\"</blockquote>\nAfter this exchange, Yahya skillfully reminds Harun al-Rashid that he had been granted the privilege of entering his presence without permission by asking the caliph if a change had been made in court etiquette.<ref>Andras Hamori, \"A Sampling\"</ref> \n\t\nBeing a part of such court interactions, Jibril would occasionally approach the caliph with a level of frankness not allowed most attendants. During Harun al-Rashid\u2019s final illness, Jibril\u2019s matter-of-fact responses to the caliph won him disgrace and soon after he was condemned to death. He was saved from execution by [[Fadl ibn al-Rabi]] and subsequently became the physician of [[al-Amin]]. After [[al-Ma'mun]] gained power, Jibril again faced imprisonment, but was needed to treat Hasan ibn Sahl and thus was released in 817 CE. Three years later he was replaced by his son-in-law, Mikha\u2019il, but was again called to Baghdad in 827 CE when Mikha\u2019il was unable to treat the caliph. He died in the favor of the caliph sometime between 827 and 829 CE and, being Christian, was buried in the Monastery of St. Sergius in [[Ctesiphon]] which is in modern-day Iraq, on the east bank of the Tigris.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> \n\t\nDuring the ninth and tenth century, the Bukhtishus had a virtual monopoly on the practice of medicine in Baghdad.<ref>P.M.

Browne, Arabian Medicine, 57</ref>\n\t\n[[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] gained Jibril's his recommendation after studying Greek for several years, which allowed him to become known in later centuries in both the Near East and in Europe for his translations.<ref>Edward G.

After his father\u2019s death, his mother married another physician. Jibrail III began studying medicine exclusively in Baghdad, where he went penniless after the death of his mother. After treating an envoy from [[Kirman]], he was called to [[Shiraz]] by the [[Buyid]] ruler [['Adud al-Dawla]] but soon after he returned to Baghdad. He only left Baghdad for short consultations, even declining an offer from the [[Fatimid]] [[al-Aziz]] who wished to establish him in [[Cairo]].

It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 1860. In a four-way contest, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] ticket of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Hannibal Hamlin]] emerged triumphant. The election of Lincoln served as the [[Origins of the American Civil War|primary catalyst of the American Civil War]].\n\nThe United States had become increasingly divided during the 1850s over sectional disagreements, especially regarding the extension of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] into the [[United States territories|territories]]. Incumbent President [[James Buchanan]], like his predecessor [[Franklin Pierce]], was a northern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] with sympathies for the [[Southern United States|South]]. During the mid-to-late 1850s, the anti-slavery Republican Party became a major political force in the wake of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in the 1857 case of ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''. By 1860, the Republican Party had replaced the defunct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] as the major opposition to the Democrats. A group of former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and [[Know Nothing]]s formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], which sought to avoid secession by pushing aside the issue of slavery.\n\nThe [[1860 Republican National Convention]] nominated Lincoln, a moderate former Congressman from [[Illinois]], as its standard-bearer. The Republican Party platform promised not to interfere with slavery in the states, but opposed the further extension of slavery into the territories. The first [[1860 Democratic National Convention]] adjourned without agreeing on a nominee, but a second convention nominated Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois for president. Douglas's support for the concept of [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], which called for [[Freeport Doctrine|each individual territory to decide on the status of slavery]], alienated many Southern Democrats. The Southern Democrats, with the support of President Buchanan, held their own convention and nominated Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] of [[Kentucky]] for president. The [[1860 Constitutional Union Convention]] nominated a ticket led by former Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of [[Tennessee]].\n\nDespite minimal support in the South, Lincoln won a plurality of the popular vote and a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. The divisions among the Republicans' opponents were not in themselves decisive in ensuring the Republican capture of the [[White House]], as Lincoln received absolute majorities in states that combined for a majority of the electoral votes. Lincoln's main opponent in the North was Douglas, who finished second in several states but only won the [[Slave states and free states|slave state]] of [[Missouri]] and three electors from the free state of [[New Jersey]]. Bell won three Southern states, while Breckinridge swept the remainder of the South. The election of Lincoln led to the secession of several states in the South, and the Civil War soon began, with the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]]. The election was the first of six consecutive victories for the Republican Party.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Nominations==\nThe 1860 presidential election conventions were unusually tumultuous, due in particular to a split in the Democratic Party that led to rival conventions.\n\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{Main|1860 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"30\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |<big>'''Republican Party Ticket, 1860'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#CE2029; width:200px;\" |[[Abraham Lincoln|{{color|white|Abraham Lincoln}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#CE2029; width:200px;\" |[[Hannibal Hamlin|{{color|white|Hannibal Hamlin}}]]\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:pink;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\" |'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\" |'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n|[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-26 by Hesler, 1860 (cropped).jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|[[File:Hannibal Hamlin, photo portrait seated, c1860-65-retouched-crop.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]<br />for [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|Illinois's 7th]]<br /><small>(1847\u20131849)</small>\n|[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Maine]]<br /><small>(1848\u20131857 & 1857\u20131861)</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Abraham Lincoln#1860 Presidential nomination and campaign|'''Campaign''']]\n|}\n\nRepublican candidates:\n\n* Abraham Lincoln, former representative from Illinois\n* William Seward, senator from New York\n* Simon Cameron, senator from Pennsylvania\n* Salmon P.

With the Democrats in disarray and a sweep of the Northern states possible, the Republicans felt confident going into their convention in [[Chicago]]. [[William H. Seward]] from New York was considered the front-runner, followed by [[Abraham Lincoln]] from Illinois, [[Salmon P. Chase]] from Ohio, and Missouri's [[Edward Bates]].\n\nAs the convention developed, however, it was revealed that Seward, Chase, and Bates had each alienated factions of the Republican Party. Delegates were concerned that Seward was too closely identified with the radical wing of the party, and his moves toward the center had alienated the radicals. Chase, a former Democrat, had alienated many of the former Whigs by his coalition with the Democrats in the late 1840s. He had also opposed tariffs demanded by Pennsylvania, and\u2014critically\u2014had opposition from his own delegation from Ohio. Bates outlined his positions on the extension of slavery into the territories and equal constitutional rights for all citizens, positions that alienated his supporters in the border states and Southern conservatives. [[German Americans]] in the party opposed Bates because of his past association with the [[Know Nothing]]s.\n\nSince it was essential to carry the West, and because Lincoln had a national reputation from his debates and speeches as the most articulate moderate, he won the party's nomination for president on the third ballot on May 18, 1860. Senator [[Hannibal Hamlin]] from Maine was nominated for vice-president, defeating [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|Cassius Clay]] from Kentucky. Hamlin was surprised by his nomination saying he was \"astonished\" and that he \"neither expected nor desired it.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Foner |title=The Fiery Trial |publisher=W.W.

Houston's supporters at the gathering did not nominate a vice-presidential candidate, since they expected later gatherings to carry out that function. Later mass meetings were held in northern cities, such as New York City on May 30, 1860, but they too failed to nominate a vice-presidential candidate. Houston, never enthusiastic about running for the Presidency, soon became convinced that he had no chance of winning and that his candidacy would only make it easier for the Republican candidate to win.

In the states of the \"Upper\" South, later known as the \"[[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]]\" (Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri along with the Kansas territories), unionist popular votes were scattered among Lincoln, Douglas, and Bell, to form a majority in all four. In the \"Middle\" South states, there was a unionist majority divided between Douglas and Bell in Virginia and Tennessee; in North Carolina and Arkansas, the unionist (Bell and Douglas) vote approached a majority. Texas was the only Middle South state that Breckinridge carried convincingly. In three of the six \"Deep\" South states, unionists (Bell and Douglas) won divided majorities in Georgia and Louisiana or neared it in Alabama. Breckinridge convincingly carried only three of the six states of the Deep South (South Carolina, Florida, and Mississippi).<ref name=\"CameinSecond\">{{cite journal |last1=Hindley |first1=Meredith |title=The Man Who Came in Second |journal=Humanities |date=November\u2013December 2010 |volume=31 |issue=6 |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/novemberdecember/feature/the-man-who-came-in-second |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> These three Deep South states were all among the four Southern states with the lowest white populations; together, they held only nine percent of Southern whites.<ref>Freehling, William W., The Road to Disunion: Volume II.

Texas, with five percent of the total wartime South's population, voted 75 percent Breckinridge. Kentucky and Missouri, with one-fourth the total population, voted 73 percent pro-union Bell, Douglas and Lincoln. In comparison, the six states of the Deep South making up one-fourth the Confederate voting population, split 57 percent Breckinridge versus 43 percent for the two pro-union candidates.{{refn|\"Deep South\" here in presidential popular votes refers to Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. It excludes South Carolina from the calculation, because in 1860 it chose presidential electors in the state legislature, without a popular vote.|group=\"nb\"}} The four states that were admitted to the Confederacy after Fort Sumter held almost half its population, and voted a narrow combined majority of 53 percent for the pro-union candidates.\n\nIn the eleven states that would later declare their secession from the Union and be controlled by Confederate armies, ballots for Lincoln were cast only in Virginia,{{refn|Ballots were printed sheets, usually printed by the party, with the name of the candidate(s) and the names of presidential electors who were pledged to that presidential candidate. Voters brought the ballot to the polling station and dropped it publicly into the election box. In order to receive any votes, a candidate (or his party) had to have ballots printed and organize a group of electors pledged to that candidate. Except in some border areas, the Republican party did not attempt any organization in the South and did not print ballots there because almost no one was willing to acknowledge publicly they were voting for Lincoln for fear of violent retribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/union_or_secession/doc/republican_ballot|title=Republican ballot 1860|accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://housedivided.dickinson.edu/sites/blogdivided/2010/07/19/election-of-1860-read-your-ballot|title=Election of 1860 \u2013 'Read Your Ballot'|accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\nwhere he received 1,929 votes (1.15 percent of the total).<ref name=HarpWeek/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/docs/1860_election_returns.pdf|title=1860 Election Returns in Virginia, by County|accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of the votes Lincoln received were cast in border counties of what would soon become [[West Virginia]] \u2013 the future state accounted for 1,832 of Lincoln's 1,929 votes.<ref>[http://www.virginiamemory.com/docs/1860_election_returns.pdf?_ga=1.106676996.686399364.1492562750 Results by county in Virginia]</ref>\n\nLincoln received no votes at all in 121 of the state's then-145 counties (including 31 of the 50 that would form West Virginia), received a single vote in three counties and received ten or fewer votes in nine of the 24 counties where he polled votes. Lincoln's best results, by far, were in the four counties that comprised the state's [[Northern Panhandle of West Virginia|northern panhandle]], a region which had long felt alienated from Richmond and which was economically and culturally linked to its neighbors Ohio and Pennsylvania and which would become the key driver in the successful effort to form a separate state. [[Hancock County, West Virginia|Hancock County]] (Virginia's northernmost at the time) returned Lincoln's best result \u2013 he polled over 40% of the vote there and finished in second place (Lincoln polled only eight votes fewer than Breckinridge). Of the 97 votes cast for Lincoln in the state's post-1863 boundaries, 93 were polled in four counties (all along the [[Potomac River]]) and four were tallied in the coastal city of [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]].<ref name=HarpWeek/>\n\nSome key differences between modern elections and the those of the mid-nineteenth century are that at the time, there was no secret ballot anywhere in the United States, that candidates were responsible for printing and distributing their own ballots (a service that was typically done by supportive newspaper publishers) and that in order to distribute valid ballots for a presidential election in a state, candidates needed citizens eligible to vote in that state who would pledge to vote for the candidate in the Electoral College. This meant that even if a voter had access to a ballot for Lincoln, casting one in favor of him in a strongly pro-slavery county would incur (at minimum) social ostracization (of course, casting a vote for Breckinridge in a strongly abolitionist county ran a voter the same risk). In ten southern slave states, no citizen would publicly pledge to vote for Abraham Lincoln. In most of Virginia, no publisher would print ballots for Lincoln's pledged electors.<ref name=HarpWeek/>\n\nIn the four slave states that did not secede (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware), Lincoln came in fourth in every state except Delaware (where he finished third). Within the fifteen slave states, Lincoln won only two counties out of 996, Missouri's [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Gasconade County, Missouri|Gasconade Counties]].<ref name=HarpWeek>{{cite web|url=http://elections.harpweek.com/1860/Overview-1860-2.htm  |title=HarpWeek 1860 Election Overview|accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref> In the 1856 election, the Republican candidate for president had received no votes at all in twelve of the fourteen slave states with a popular vote (these being the same states as in the 1860 election, plus Missouri and Virginia).\n\n==Results==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| caption_align = center\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n| image1    = LincolnInauguration1861a.jpg\n| width1    = 323\n| alt1      = the unfinished Capitol dome, 1860\n| caption1  = '''Inauguration''' of Abraham Lincoln<br />the Capitol, March 4, 1861\n| image2    = ElectoralCollege1860.svg\n| width2    = 220\n| alt2      = 1860 Electoral College map with 35 states\n| caption2  = state '''Election''' results<br />by Electoral College vote\n}}\n\nThe election was held on Tuesday, November 6, 1860, and was noteworthy for exaggerated sectionalism and voter enthusiasm in a country that was soon to dissolve into civil war.

South Carolina had no popular vote.]]\n\nLincoln won the Electoral College with less than 40 percent of the popular vote nationwide by carrying states above the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] and north of the Ohio River, plus the states of California and Oregon in the [[Western United States|Far West]]. Unlike every preceding president-elect, Lincoln did not carry even one slave state.\n\nBallots were not distributed for Lincoln in ten of the southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Lincoln was the first President-elect to poll no votes in ''any'' state which had a popular vote. It should be further noted that, prior to introduction of the [[secret ballot]] in the 1880s, the concept of [[ballot access]] did not exist in the sense it does today in that there was no standardized state-issued ballot for a candidate to \"appear\" on. Instead, presidential ballots were printed and distributed by agents of the candidates and their parties, who organized slates of would-be electors publicly pledged to vote for a particular candidate. The 1860 presidential election was the only such occasion prior to the introduction of the secret ballot where a winning candidate was so unpopular in a particular region that it was impossible to organize and print ballots for a slate of eligible voters pledged to vote for that candidate in every state.\n\nSince 1860, Republican presidential candidates have managed to poll votes in every state (other than unreconstructed Southern states prior to 1872) whereas national Democratic candidates have occasionally failed to appear on all state ballots since the introduction of the secret ballot, including three elections{{refn|In [[1892 United States presidential election|1892]], [[Grover Cleveland]] was not on the ballot in [[1892 United States presidential election in Colorado|Colorado]], [[1892 United States presidential election in Idaho|Idaho]], [[1892 United States presidential election in Kansas|Kansas]], [[1892 United States presidential election in North Dakota|North Dakota]], or [[1892 United States presidential election in Wyoming|Wyoming]], while neither [[1948 United States presidential election in Alabama|Harry Truman in 1948]] nor [[1964 United States presidential election in Alabama|Lyndon Johnson in 1964]] were on the ballot in Alabama.|group=\"nb\"}} where the Democratic candidate won the presidency, but never to the same extent as in 1860.\n\nLincoln won the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|second-lowest share of the popular vote]] among all winning presidential candidates in U.S. history.{{refn|[[John Quincy Adams]], who won the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]] in a vote of the House of Representatives, won 30.9% of the popular vote, less than the share received by Andrew Jackson.

The Republican victory resulted from the concentration of votes in the free states, which together controlled a majority of the presidential electors.<ref>Chadwick, Bruce. \"Lincoln for President: an unlikely candidate, an audacious strategy, and the victory no one saw coming\" (2009) Ch. 10 ''The Eleventh Hour''. p. 289 {{ISBN|978-1-4022-2504-8}}</ref> Lincoln's strategy was deliberately focused, in collaboration with Republican Party Chairman [[Thurlow Weed]], on expanding on the states Fr\u00e9mont won four years earlier. New York was critical with 35 Electoral College votes, 11.5 percent of the total; with Pennsylvania (27) and Ohio (23), a candidate could collect more than half (85) of the votes needed. The [[Wide Awakes]] young Republican men's organization massively expanded registered voter lists, and although Lincoln was not even on the ballot in most southern states, population increases in the free states had far exceeded those seen in the slave states for many years before the election of 1860, hence free states dominated in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].<ref>Ziegler-McPherson, Christina A.; ''Selling America : Immigration Promotion and the Settlement of the American Continent, 1607-1914'', pp. 34-36 {{ISBN|1440842094}}</ref>\n\nThe split in the Democratic party is sometimes held responsible for Lincoln's victory,<ref>''e.g.'', the 1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', vol, 15, p. 171</ref> however, despite the fact that Lincoln won the election with less than forty percent of the popular vote, much of the anti-Republican vote was \"wasted\" in Southern states where no ballots for Lincoln were circulated.

While Bell retired to his family business, quietly supporting his state's secession, Breckinridge served as a Confederate general. He finished second in the Electoral College with 72 votes, carrying eleven of fifteen slave states (including South Carolina, whose electors were chosen by the state legislature, not popular vote). Breckinridge stood a distant third in national popular vote at eighteen percent, but accrued 50 to 75 percent in the first seven states that would form the [[Confederate States of America]]. He took nine of the eleven states that eventually joined, plus the border slave states of Delaware and Maryland, losing only Virginia and Tennessee. Breckinridge received very little support in the free states, showing some strength only in California, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.\n\nBell carried three slave states (Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia) and lost Maryland by only 722 votes. Nevertheless, he finished a remarkable second in all slave states won by Breckinridge or Douglas. He won 45 to 47 percent in Maryland, Tennessee and North Carolina and canvassed respectably with 36 to 40 percent in Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida. Bell himself had hoped that he would take over the former support of the extinct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in free states, but the majority of this support went to Lincoln.<ref name=\"Ballot\">Davies, Gareth and Zelizer, Julian E.; ''America at the Ballot Box: Elections and Political History'', pp. 65-66 {{ISBN|0812291360}}</ref> Thus, except for running mate Everett's home state of Massachusetts, and California, Bell received even less support in the free states than did Breckinridge, and consequently came in last in the national popular vote at 12 percent.\n\nDouglas was the only candidate who won electoral votes in both slave and free states (free New Jersey and slave Missouri). His support was the most widespread geographically; he finished second behind Lincoln in the popular vote with 29.5 percent, but last in the Electoral College. Douglas attained a 28 to 47 percent share in the states of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Trans-Mississippi West, but slipped to 19 to 39 percent in New England. Outside his regional section, Douglas took 15 to 17 percent of the popular vote total in the slave states of Kentucky, Alabama, and Louisiana, then 10 percent or less in the nine remaining slave states. Douglas, in his \"Norfolk Doctrine\", reiterated in North Carolina, promised to keep the Union together by coercion if states proceeded to secede. The popular vote for Lincoln and Douglas combined was seventy percent of the turnout.\n\nThe 1860 Republican ticket was the first successful national ticket that did not feature a Southerner, and the election marked the end of Southern political dominance in the United States. Between 1789 and 1860, Southerners had been president for two-thirds of the era, and had held the offices of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tem of the Senate]] during much of that time. Moreover, since 1791, Southerners had comprised a majority of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Liberty Equality Power: A History of the American People, Volume I: To 1877| page=403| edition=6th| last1=Murrin| first1=John M.| last2=Johnson| first2=Paul E.| last3=McPherson| first3=James M.| last4=Fahs| first4=Alice| last5=Gerstle| first5=Gary| last6=Rosenberg| first6=Emily S.| last7=Rosenberg| first7=Norman L. |publisher= Wadsworth, Cengage Learning |location=Boston| isbn=978-0-495-91587-4| date=January 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=<sup>(a)</sup>|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Abraham Lincoln]]|vp_name=[[Hannibal Hamlin]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[Illinois]]|vp_state=[[Maine]]|pv=1,865,908|pv_pct=39.82%|ev=180}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[John C.

These states then formed the \"[[Confederate States of America]]\".\n\nSeveral other states also considered declaring secession at this time: \n\n* Missouri convened a secession convention, which voted against secession and adjourned permanently.\n* Arkansas convened a secession convention, which voted against secession and adjourned temporarily.\n<ref>[https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/secession-convention-6304/ Secession Convention] ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas''</ref>\n* Virginia convened a secession convention, which voted against secession, but remained in session.\n* Tennessee held a referendum on having a secession convention, which failed.\n* North Carolina held a referendum on having a secession convention, which failed.<ref>[https://www.ncdcr.gov/blog/2015/05/20/secession-vote-and-realigned-allegiance Secession Vote and Realigned Allegiance] North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources</ref>\n\nAll of this secessionist activity was motivated by fear for the institution of slavery in the South. If the President (and by extension appointed Federal officials in the South, such as US District Attorneys, US Marshals, postmasters, and Federal judges) opposed slavery, slavery might collapse. There were fears that abolitionist agents would infiltrate the South and foment slave insurrections. (Noted secessionist [[William Lowndes Yancey]], speaking at New York's Cooper Institute in October 1860, asserted that with abolitionists in power, \"Emissaries will percolate between master [and] slave as water between the crevices of rocks underground. They will be found everywhere, with strychnine to put in our wells.\"<ref>{{cite book | author=Walther, Eric H. | year=2006 | title=William Lowndes Yancey: The Coming of the Civil War | isbn=978-0-7394-8030-4 |page=262}}</ref>) Less radical Southerners thought that with Northern anti-slave dominance of the Federal government, slavery would eventually be abolished, regardless of present constitutional limits.<ref>[[Avery Craven]], [http://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-growth-of-southern-nationalism-1848-1861/ ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism, 1848\u20131861''], 1953. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-0006-6}}, p. 391, 394, 396.</ref>\n\nBertram Wyatt-Brown argues that secessionists desired independence as necessary for their honor. They could no longer tolerate Northern state attitudes that regarded slave ownership as a great sin and Northern politicians who insisted on stopping the spread of slavery.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mary A. |last=Decredico |chapter=Sectionalism and the Secession Crisis |editor-first=John B. |editor-last=Boles |title=A Companion to the American South |year=2004 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vANndXTE8g4C&pg=PA243 |page=243 }}</ref> <ref>Wyatt-Brown, Bertram.

However, these \"conditional Unionists\" also hoped that when faced with secession, Northerners would stifle anti-slavery rhetoric and accept pro-slavery rules for the Territories. It was this group which prevented immediate secession in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.\n\nLincoln took office on 4 March 1861. He took no action against the secessionists in the seven \"Confederate\" states, but also declared that secession had no legal validity and refused to surrender Federal property in those states. (He also reiterated his opposition to slavery anywhere in the Territories.) This stand-off continued until mid-April, when Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] ordered Confederate troops to bombard and capture [[Fort Sumter]].\n\nLincoln then called for troops to put down rebellion. This wiped out the possibility that the crisis could be resolved by compromise. Nearly all \"conditional Unionists\" joined with the secessionists. The Virginia convention and the reconvened Arkansas convention both declared secession, as did the legislatures of Tennessee and North Carolina; all four states joined the Confederacy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[American election campaigns in the 19th century]]\n* [[Electoral history of Abraham Lincoln]]\n* [[History of the United States (1849\u20131865)]]\n* [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|History of the United States Democratic Party]]\n* [[History of the United States Republican Party]]\n* [[John Hanks]]\n* [[Third Party System]]\n* [[1860 and 1861 United States House of Representatives elections]]\n* [[1860 and 1861 United States Senate elections]]\n* [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist| group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | ref=Carwardine  |first=Richard |last=Carwardine | authorlink = Richard Carwardine |title=Lincoln |publisher=Pearson Education Ltd |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-582-03279-8}}\n* {{cite book|author=Chadwick, Bruce | authorlink = Bruce Chadwick |title=Lincoln for President: An Unlikely Candidate, An Audacious Strategy, and the Victory No One Saw Coming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UUDW_c4mEoC&pg=PA108|year=2010|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4022-2858-2}}\n* Decredico, Mary A.  \"Sectionalism and the Secession Crisis,\" in John B.

It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 1860. In a four-way contest, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] ticket of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Hannibal Hamlin]] emerged triumphant. The election of Lincoln served as the [[Origins of the American Civil War|primary catalyst of the American Civil War]].\n\nThe United States had become increasingly divided during the 1850s over sectional disagreements, especially regarding the extension of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] into the [[United States territories|territories]]. Incumbent President [[James Buchanan]], like his predecessor [[Franklin Pierce]], was a northern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] with sympathies for the [[Southern United States|South]]. During the mid-to-late 1850s, the anti-slavery Republican Party became a major political force in the wake of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in the 1857 case of ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''. By 1860, the Republican Party had replaced the defunct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] as the major opposition to the Democrats. A group of former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and [[Know Nothing]]s formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], which sought to avoid secession by pushing aside the issue of slavery.\n\nThe [[1860 Republican National Convention]] nominated Lincoln, a moderate former Congressman from [[Illinois]], as its standard-bearer. The Republican Party platform promised not to interfere with slavery in the states, but opposed the further extension of slavery into the territories. The first [[1860 Democratic National Convention]] adjourned without agreeing on a nominee, but a second convention nominated Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois for president. Douglas's support for the concept of [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], which called for [[Freeport Doctrine|each individual territory to decide on the status of slavery]], alienated many Southern Democrats. The Southern Democrats, with the support of President Buchanan, held their own convention and nominated Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] of [[Kentucky]] for president. The [[1860 Constitutional Union Convention]] nominated a ticket led by former Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of [[Tennessee]].\n\nDespite minimal support in the South, Lincoln won a plurality of the popular vote and a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. The divisions among the Republicans' opponents were not in themselves decisive in ensuring the Republican capture of the [[White House]], as Lincoln received absolute majorities in states that combined for a majority of the electoral votes. Lincoln's main opponent in the North was Douglas, who finished second in several states but only won the [[Slave states and free states|slave state]] of [[Missouri]] and three electors from the free state of [[New Jersey]]. Bell won three Southern states, while Breckinridge swept the remainder of the South. The election of Lincoln led to the secession of several states in the South, and the Civil War soon began, with the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]]. The election was the first of six consecutive victories for the Republican Party.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Nominations==\nThe 1860 presidential election conventions were unusually tumultuous, due in particular to a split in the Democratic Party that led to rival conventions.\n\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{Main|1860 Republican National Convention}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"30\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |<big>'''Republican Party Ticket, 1860'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#CE2029; width:200px;\" |[[Abraham Lincoln|{{color|white|Abraham Lincoln}}]]\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#CE2029; width:200px;\" |[[Hannibal Hamlin|{{color|white|Hannibal Hamlin}}]]\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:pink;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\" |'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\" |'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n|[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-26 by Hesler, 1860 (cropped).jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|[[File:Hannibal Hamlin, photo portrait seated, c1860-65-retouched-crop.jpg|center|200x200px]]\n|-\n| Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]]<br />for [[Illinois's 7th congressional district|Illinois's 7th]]<br /><small>(1847\u20131849)</small>\n|[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Maine]]<br /><small>(1848\u20131857 & 1857\u20131861)</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Abraham Lincoln#1860 Presidential nomination and campaign|'''Campaign''']]\n|}\n\nRepublican candidates:\n\n* Abraham Lincoln, former representative from Illinois\n* William Seward, senator from New York\n* Simon Cameron, senator from Pennsylvania\n* Salmon P.

With the Democrats in disarray and a sweep of the Northern states possible, the Republicans felt confident going into their convention in [[Chicago]]. [[William H. Seward]] from New York was considered the front-runner, followed by [[Abraham Lincoln]] from Illinois, [[Salmon P. Chase]] from Ohio, and Missouri's [[Edward Bates]].\n\nAs the convention developed, however, it was revealed that Seward, Chase, and Bates had each alienated factions of the Republican Party. Delegates were concerned that Seward was too closely identified with the radical wing of the party, and his moves toward the center had alienated the radicals. Chase, a former Democrat, had alienated many of the former Whigs by his coalition with the Democrats in the late 1840s. He had also opposed tariffs demanded by Pennsylvania, and\u2014critically\u2014had opposition from his own delegation from Ohio. Bates outlined his positions on the extension of slavery into the territories and equal constitutional rights for all citizens, positions that alienated his supporters in the border states and Southern conservatives. [[German Americans]] in the party opposed Bates because of his past association with the [[Know Nothing]]s.\n\nSince it was essential to carry the West, and because Lincoln had a national reputation from his debates and speeches as the most articulate moderate, he won the party's nomination for president on the third ballot on May 18, 1860. Senator [[Hannibal Hamlin]] from Maine was nominated for vice-president, defeating [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|Cassius Clay]] from Kentucky. Hamlin was surprised by his nomination saying he was \"astonished\" and that he \"neither expected nor desired it.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Foner |title=The Fiery Trial |publisher=W.W.

The platform promised tariffs protecting industry and workers, a [[Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]] granting free farmland in the West to settlers, and the funding of a [[transcontinental railroad]].

This larger group met immediately in Baltimore's Institute Hall, with Cushing again presiding. They adopted the pro-slavery platform rejected at Charleston, and nominated [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C.

This convention affirmed the nominations of Breckinridge and Lane.<ref name=\"FreehlingWilliam\" />\n\nBesides the Democratic Parties in the southern states, the Breckinridge/Lane ticket was also supported by the Buchanan administration. Buchanan's own continued prestige in his home state of [[Pennsylvania]] ensured that Breckinridge would be the principal Democratic candidate in that populous state.

On April 20, 1860, the party held what it termed a national convention to nominate Houston for president on the [[San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site|San Jacinto Battlefield]] in [[Texas]]. Houston's supporters at the gathering did not nominate a vice-presidential candidate, since they expected later gatherings to carry out that function. Later mass meetings were held in northern cities, such as New York City on May 30, 1860, but they too failed to nominate a vice-presidential candidate. Houston, never enthusiastic about running for the Presidency, soon became convinced that he had no chance of winning and that his candidacy would only make it easier for the Republican candidate to win.

Nonetheless, loyal army officers in Virginia, Kansas and South Carolina warned Lincoln of military preparations to the contrary. Secessionists threw their support behind Breckinridge in an attempt either to force the anti-Republican candidates to coordinate their electoral votes or throw the election into the House of Representatives, where the selection of the president would be made by the representatives elected in 1858, before the Republican majorities in both House and Senate achieved in 1860 were seated in the new [[37th United States Congress|37th Congress]]. Mexican War hero [[Winfield Scott]] suggested to Lincoln that he assume the powers of a commander-in-chief before inauguration. However, historian Bruce Chadwick observes that Lincoln and his advisors ignored the widespread alarms and threats of secession as mere election trickery.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIndeed, voting in the South was not as monolithic as the Electoral College map would make it seem. Economically, culturally, and politically, the South was made up of three regions. In the states of the \"Upper\" South, later known as the \"[[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]]\" (Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri along with the Kansas territories), unionist popular votes were scattered among Lincoln, Douglas, and Bell, to form a majority in all four. In the \"Middle\" South states, there was a unionist majority divided between Douglas and Bell in Virginia and Tennessee; in North Carolina and Arkansas, the unionist (Bell and Douglas) vote approached a majority. Texas was the only Middle South state that Breckinridge carried convincingly. In three of the six \"Deep\" South states, unionists (Bell and Douglas) won divided majorities in Georgia and Louisiana or neared it in Alabama. Breckinridge convincingly carried only three of the six states of the Deep South (South Carolina, Florida, and Mississippi).<ref name=\"CameinSecond\">{{cite journal |last1=Hindley |first1=Meredith |title=The Man Who Came in Second |journal=Humanities |date=November\u2013December 2010 |volume=31 |issue=6 |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/novemberdecember/feature/the-man-who-came-in-second |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> These three Deep South states were all among the four Southern states with the lowest white populations; together, they held only nine percent of Southern whites.<ref>Freehling, William W., The Road to Disunion: Volume II.

Texas, with five percent of the total wartime South's population, voted 75 percent Breckinridge. Kentucky and Missouri, with one-fourth the total population, voted 73 percent pro-union Bell, Douglas and Lincoln. In comparison, the six states of the Deep South making up one-fourth the Confederate voting population, split 57 percent Breckinridge versus 43 percent for the two pro-union candidates.{{refn|\"Deep South\" here in presidential popular votes refers to Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.

Voters brought the ballot to the polling station and dropped it publicly into the election box. In order to receive any votes, a candidate (or his party) had to have ballots printed and organize a group of electors pledged to that candidate.

Lincoln's best results, by far, were in the four counties that comprised the state's [[Northern Panhandle of West Virginia|northern panhandle]], a region which had long felt alienated from Richmond and which was economically and culturally linked to its neighbors Ohio and Pennsylvania and which would become the key driver in the successful effort to form a separate state. [[Hancock County, West Virginia|Hancock County]] (Virginia's northernmost at the time) returned Lincoln's best result \u2013 he polled over 40% of the vote there and finished in second place (Lincoln polled only eight votes fewer than Breckinridge).

This meant that even if a voter had access to a ballot for Lincoln, casting one in favor of him in a strongly pro-slavery county would incur (at minimum) social ostracization (of course, casting a vote for Breckinridge in a strongly abolitionist county ran a voter the same risk). In ten southern slave states, no citizen would publicly pledge to vote for Abraham Lincoln. In most of Virginia, no publisher would print ballots for Lincoln's pledged electors.<ref name=HarpWeek/>\n\nIn the four slave states that did not secede (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware), Lincoln came in fourth in every state except Delaware (where he finished third).

Unlike every preceding president-elect, Lincoln did not carry even one slave state.\n\nBallots were not distributed for Lincoln in ten of the southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Lincoln was the first President-elect to poll no votes in ''any'' state which had a popular vote. It should be further noted that, prior to introduction of the [[secret ballot]] in the 1880s, the concept of [[ballot access]] did not exist in the sense it does today in that there was no standardized state-issued ballot for a candidate to \"appear\" on. Instead, presidential ballots were printed and distributed by agents of the candidates and their parties, who organized slates of would-be electors publicly pledged to vote for a particular candidate. The 1860 presidential election was the only such occasion prior to the introduction of the secret ballot where a winning candidate was so unpopular in a particular region that it was impossible to organize and print ballots for a slate of eligible voters pledged to vote for that candidate in every state.\n\nSince 1860, Republican presidential candidates have managed to poll votes in every state (other than unreconstructed Southern states prior to 1872) whereas national Democratic candidates have occasionally failed to appear on all state ballots since the introduction of the secret ballot, including three elections{{refn|In [[1892 United States presidential election|1892]], [[Grover Cleveland]] was not on the ballot in [[1892 United States presidential election in Colorado|Colorado]], [[1892 United States presidential election in Idaho|Idaho]], [[1892 United States presidential election in Kansas|Kansas]], [[1892 United States presidential election in North Dakota|North Dakota]], or [[1892 United States presidential election in Wyoming|Wyoming]], while neither [[1948 United States presidential election in Alabama|Harry Truman in 1948]] nor [[1964 United States presidential election in Alabama|Lyndon Johnson in 1964]] were on the ballot in Alabama.|group=\"nb\"}} where the Democratic candidate won the presidency, but never to the same extent as in 1860.\n\nLincoln won the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|second-lowest share of the popular vote]] among all winning presidential candidates in U.S. history.{{refn|[[John Quincy Adams]], who won the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]] in a vote of the House of Representatives, won 30.9% of the popular vote, less than the share received by Andrew Jackson.

The [[Wide Awakes]] young Republican men's organization massively expanded registered voter lists, and although Lincoln was not even on the ballot in most southern states, population increases in the free states had far exceeded those seen in the slave states for many years before the election of 1860, hence free states dominated in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].<ref>Ziegler-McPherson, Christina A.; ''Selling America : Immigration Promotion and the Settlement of the American Continent, 1607-1914'', pp. 34-36 {{ISBN|1440842094}}</ref>\n\nThe split in the Democratic party is sometimes held responsible for Lincoln's victory,<ref>''e.g.'', the 1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', vol, 15, p. 171</ref> however, despite the fact that Lincoln won the election with less than forty percent of the popular vote, much of the anti-Republican vote was \"wasted\" in Southern states where no ballots for Lincoln were circulated. At most, a single opponent nationwide would only have deprived Lincoln of California, Oregon, and four New Jersey electors,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1892/12/26/archives/newjerseys-vote-in-1860-how-the-electoral-college-happened-to-be.html |title=New Jersey's Vote in 1860 |newspaper=NY Times |date=December 26, 1892}}</ref> whose combined total of eleven electoral votes would have made no difference to the result; every other state won by the Republicans was won by a clear majority of the vote. In the four states of New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and New Jersey where anti-Lincoln votes did combine into [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]], Lincoln still won three and split New Jersey.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''The Emergence of Lincoln: Prologue to Civil War'' (1950), p. 312</ref> If the opposition had formed fusion tickets in every state, Lincoln still would have received 169 electoral votes, 17 more than the 152 required to win the Electoral College.<ref>Potter, ''The impending crisis, 1848\u20131861'' (1976) p. 437</ref><ref>Luthin, ''The First Lincoln Campaign'' p. 227</ref>\n\nLike Lincoln, Breckinridge and Bell won no electoral votes outside of their respective sections. While Bell retired to his family business, quietly supporting his state's secession, Breckinridge served as a Confederate general. He finished second in the Electoral College with 72 votes, carrying eleven of fifteen slave states (including South Carolina, whose electors were chosen by the state legislature, not popular vote). Breckinridge stood a distant third in national popular vote at eighteen percent, but accrued 50 to 75 percent in the first seven states that would form the [[Confederate States of America]]. He took nine of the eleven states that eventually joined, plus the border slave states of Delaware and Maryland, losing only Virginia and Tennessee. Breckinridge received very little support in the free states, showing some strength only in California, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.\n\nBell carried three slave states (Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia) and lost Maryland by only 722 votes. Nevertheless, he finished a remarkable second in all slave states won by Breckinridge or Douglas. He won 45 to 47 percent in Maryland, Tennessee and North Carolina and canvassed respectably with 36 to 40 percent in Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida. Bell himself had hoped that he would take over the former support of the extinct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in free states, but the majority of this support went to Lincoln.<ref name=\"Ballot\">Davies, Gareth and Zelizer, Julian E.; ''America at the Ballot Box: Elections and Political History'', pp. 65-66 {{ISBN|0812291360}}</ref> Thus, except for running mate Everett's home state of Massachusetts, and California, Bell received even less support in the free states than did Breckinridge, and consequently came in last in the national popular vote at 12 percent.\n\nDouglas was the only candidate who won electoral votes in both slave and free states (free New Jersey and slave Missouri). His support was the most widespread geographically; he finished second behind Lincoln in the popular vote with 29.5 percent, but last in the Electoral College. Douglas attained a 28 to 47 percent share in the states of the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Trans-Mississippi West, but slipped to 19 to 39 percent in New England. Outside his regional section, Douglas took 15 to 17 percent of the popular vote total in the slave states of Kentucky, Alabama, and Louisiana, then 10 percent or less in the nine remaining slave states. Douglas, in his \"Norfolk Doctrine\", reiterated in North Carolina, promised to keep the Union together by coercion if states proceeded to secede. The popular vote for Lincoln and Douglas combined was seventy percent of the turnout.\n\nThe 1860 Republican ticket was the first successful national ticket that did not feature a Southerner, and the election marked the end of Southern political dominance in the United States. Between 1789 and 1860, Southerners had been president for two-thirds of the era, and had held the offices of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tem of the Senate]] during much of that time. Moreover, since 1791, Southerners had comprised a majority of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Liberty Equality Power: A History of the American People, Volume I: To 1877| page=403| edition=6th| last1=Murrin| first1=John M.| last2=Johnson| first2=Paul E.| last3=McPherson| first3=James M.| last4=Fahs| first4=Alice| last5=Gerstle| first5=Gary| last6=Rosenberg| first6=Emily S.| last7=Rosenberg| first7=Norman L. |publisher= Wadsworth, Cengage Learning |location=Boston| isbn=978-0-495-91587-4| date=January 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=<sup>(a)</sup>|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Abraham Lincoln]]|vp_name=[[Hannibal Hamlin]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[Illinois]]|vp_state=[[Maine]]|pv=1,865,908|pv_pct=39.82%|ev=180}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[John C.

These states then formed the \"[[Confederate States of America]]\".\n\nSeveral other states also considered declaring secession at this time: \n\n* Missouri convened a secession convention, which voted against secession and adjourned permanently.\n* Arkansas convened a secession convention, which voted against secession and adjourned temporarily.\n<ref>[https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/secession-convention-6304/ Secession Convention] ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas''</ref>\n* Virginia convened a secession convention, which voted against secession, but remained in session.\n* Tennessee held a referendum on having a secession convention, which failed.\n* North Carolina held a referendum on having a secession convention, which failed.<ref>[https://www.ncdcr.gov/blog/2015/05/20/secession-vote-and-realigned-allegiance Secession Vote and Realigned Allegiance] North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources</ref>\n\nAll of this secessionist activity was motivated by fear for the institution of slavery in the South. If the President (and by extension appointed Federal officials in the South, such as US District Attorneys, US Marshals, postmasters, and Federal judges) opposed slavery, slavery might collapse. There were fears that abolitionist agents would infiltrate the South and foment slave insurrections. (Noted secessionist [[William Lowndes Yancey]], speaking at New York's Cooper Institute in October 1860, asserted that with abolitionists in power, \"Emissaries will percolate between master [and] slave as water between the crevices of rocks underground. They will be found everywhere, with strychnine to put in our wells.\"<ref>{{cite book | author=Walther, Eric H. | year=2006 | title=William Lowndes Yancey: The Coming of the Civil War | isbn=978-0-7394-8030-4 |page=262}}</ref>) Less radical Southerners thought that with Northern anti-slave dominance of the Federal government, slavery would eventually be abolished, regardless of present constitutional limits.<ref>[[Avery Craven]], [http://lsupress.org/books/detail/the-growth-of-southern-nationalism-1848-1861/ ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism, 1848\u20131861''], 1953. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-0006-6}}, p. 391, 394, 396.</ref>\n\nBertram Wyatt-Brown argues that secessionists desired independence as necessary for their honor. They could no longer tolerate Northern state attitudes that regarded slave ownership as a great sin and Northern politicians who insisted on stopping the spread of slavery.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mary A. |last=Decredico |chapter=Sectionalism and the Secession Crisis |editor-first=John B. |editor-last=Boles |title=A Companion to the American South |year=2004 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vANndXTE8g4C&pg=PA243 |page=243 }}</ref> <ref>Wyatt-Brown, Bertram.

However, these \"conditional Unionists\" also hoped that when faced with secession, Northerners would stifle anti-slavery rhetoric and accept pro-slavery rules for the Territories. It was this group which prevented immediate secession in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.\n\nLincoln took office on 4 March 1861. He took no action against the secessionists in the seven \"Confederate\" states, but also declared that secession had no legal validity and refused to surrender Federal property in those states. (He also reiterated his opposition to slavery anywhere in the Territories.) This stand-off continued until mid-April, when Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] ordered Confederate troops to bombard and capture [[Fort Sumter]].\n\nLincoln then called for troops to put down rebellion. This wiped out the possibility that the crisis could be resolved by compromise. Nearly all \"conditional Unionists\" joined with the secessionists. The Virginia convention and the reconvened Arkansas convention both declared secession, as did the legislatures of Tennessee and North Carolina; all four states joined the Confederacy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[American election campaigns in the 19th century]]\n* [[Electoral history of Abraham Lincoln]]\n* [[History of the United States (1849\u20131865)]]\n* [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|History of the United States Democratic Party]]\n* [[History of the United States Republican Party]]\n* [[John Hanks]]\n* [[Third Party System]]\n* [[1860 and 1861 United States House of Representatives elections]]\n* [[1860 and 1861 United States Senate elections]]\n* [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist| group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | ref=Carwardine  |first=Richard |last=Carwardine | authorlink = Richard Carwardine |title=Lincoln |publisher=Pearson Education Ltd |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-582-03279-8}}\n* {{cite book|author=Chadwick, Bruce | authorlink = Bruce Chadwick |title=Lincoln for President: An Unlikely Candidate, An Audacious Strategy, and the Victory No One Saw Coming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UUDW_c4mEoC&pg=PA108|year=2010|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4022-2858-2}}\n* Decredico, Mary A.  \"Sectionalism and the Secession Crisis,\" in John B.
