It is the fourth main game in the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'' series]] and was released worldwide on November 10, 2015, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. The game is set within an [[open world]] [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] environment that encompasses the city of [[Boston]] and the surrounding [[Massachusetts]] region known as \"The Commonwealth\". The main story takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and 210 years after \"The Great War\", which caused [[Nuclear holocaust|catastrophic nuclear devastation]] across the United States.\n\nThe player assumes control of a character referred to as the \"Sole Survivor\", who emerges from a long-term cryogenic stasis in Vault 111, an underground nuclear [[fallout shelter]]. After witnessing the murder of their spouse and kidnapping of their son, the Sole Survivor ventures out into the Commonwealth to search for their missing child. The player explores the game's dilapidated world, completes various quests, helps out factions, and acquires experience points to level up and increase the abilities of their character. New features to the series include the ability to develop and manage settlements and an extensive crafting system where materials scavenged from the environment can be used to craft drugs and explosives, upgrade weapons and armor, and construct, furnish and improve settlements. ''Fallout 4'' also marks the first game in the series to feature full voice acting for the protagonist.\n\n''Fallout 4'' received positive reviews from critics with many praising the world depth, player freedom, overall amount of content, crafting, and soundtrack, while criticism was mainly directed at the game's visuals and technical issues. The game was a commercial and critical success, generating {{US$|750 million|long=no}} within the first 24 hours of its launch, and received numerous accolades from various gaming publications and award events, including the respective awards for Game of the Year and Best Game at the [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] and [[British Academy Games Awards]]. Bethesda has released [[Fallout 4 downloadable content|six downloadable content]] add-ons, including the expansions ''[[Fallout 4: Far Harbor|Far Harbor]]'' and ''[[Fallout 4: Nuka-World|Nuka-World]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Fallout 4'' is an [[action role-playing game]] set in an [[open world]] environment. Gameplay is similar to that of ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', the two previous primary iterations in the series. Returning features include a camera that can switch between a [[First person (video games)|first-person]] and [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. ''Fallout 4'' introduces features including a layered armor system, base-building, a dialogue system featuring 111,000 lines of dialogue,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/09/05/bethesda-completes-recording-of-fallout-4-39-s-111-000-lines-of-dialogue.aspx|title=Bethesda Completes Recording Of Fallout 4's 111,000 Lines Of Dialogue|first=Kyle|last=Hilliard|date=September 5, 2015|accessdate=October 19, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> and a crafting system which implements every lootable object in the game.

If the player has discovered a certain location they may [[fast travel]] to it. Weapons can be customized too; the game includes over 50 guns, which can be crafted with a variety of modifications, such as barrel types and laser focus, with over 700 modifications available. Power Armor has been redesigned to be more like a vehicle than an equipable suit of armor, requiring energy cores and being essentially dead weight without it<ref name=\"Fo4 Trailer\">{{cite AV media |people=Bethesda Softworks |date=June 15, 2015 |title=Fallout 4 \u2013 E3 Showcase World Premiere |medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2BkLqMef4 |access-date=June 28, 2015 |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]]}}</ref> and can be modified, allowing the player to add items such as a jetpack or selecting separate types of armor for each part of the suit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-4-screenshots-and-art-show-customisation-mutants-more/|title=Fallout 4 screenshots show jetpacks, mutants, more|last=Sykes|first=Tom|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\nA new feature to the series is the ability to craft and deconstruct settlements and buildings. The player can select and break down many in-game objects and structures, and use them to freely build their own structures. In addition, the towns can be powered with working electricity, using a power line system. Merchants and [[non-player character]]s can inhabit the player's settlements, for which the player must provide sustenance by growing food in makeshift patches and building water pumps. The player can build various defenses around their settlements, such as turrets and traps, to defend against random attacks.<ref name=\"crafting\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-crafting-system-is-bonkers-1711322298|title=Fallout 4's Crafting System Looks Awesome|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|date=June 14, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fallout 4 V.A.T.S.

The player can find game cartridges, which can be played on the Pip-Boy or a terminal. A new feature for the Pip-Boy interface is a downloadable application for iOS, Android, and Windows smartphones and tablets. This optional app allows players to access the Pip-Boy interface on a separate screen, and play the collected game cartridges when not playing the main game. Another returning gameplay feature is the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.). While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is slowed down (instead of stopped entirely as in previous entries), and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of \"[[bullet time]]\". Various actions cost points, limiting the actions of each combatant during a period of time, and the player can target specific body parts for attacks to inflict specific injuries; headshots can be used for quick kills or to blind, legs can be targeted to slow enemy movement, and opponents can be disarmed by shooting at their weapons.

The system represents seven statistics, namely strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck. When the player earns enough [[experience point]]s to gain a new level, they unlock an ability. When the player allocates more points to a statistic, more abilities can be unlocked. These perks can be upgraded to improve the protagonist's efficiency and to further unlock abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/24/9036527/fallout-4-romance-options-upgrades-special-customization-progression|title=How Fallout 4 handles romance, character progression and more|first=Griffin|last=McElroy|date=July 24, 2015|accessdate=July 25, 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> There are about 275 perks available for the player to unlock.

For the first time in the series, these companions can interact with the environment on the player character's behalf. For example, if the player character does not have required skills to hack a terminal or pick a lock, they can order the companion to do it for them. Any companion present besides Dogmeat will react to certain player actions in one of four ways (love, like, dislike, or hate), which either raises or lowers their \"affinity\". Raising a companion's affinity to 1,000 points will result in them \"idolizing\" the player and granting a specific perk. The companion will leave if affinity drops low enough, and some actions can turn them hostile on sight. {{Clear}}\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Fallout 4'' takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and 210 years after the Great War, a war between the United States and China over natural resources that ended in a [[nuclear holocaust]] in 2077. The setting is a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Retrofuturism|retro-future]], covering a region that includes [[Boston]] and other parts of [[New England]] known as \"The Commonwealth\". Unlike the previous titles, ''Fallout 4''{{'}}s story begins on the day the bombs dropped: October 23, 2077.\n\nThe game takes place in an alternate version of history that sees the 1940s and 1950s aesthetics such as diners and a drive-in theater. The design and technology advance in the directions imagined at the time. The resulting universe is thus a [[Retrofuturism|retro-futuristic]] one, where the technology has evolved enough to produce [[Directed-energy weapon|laser weapons]], [[Genetic engineering|manipulate genes]] and create nearly-autonomous [[artificial intelligence]], but all within the confines of 1950s solutions such as the widespread use of atomic power and [[vacuum tube]]s, as well as having the integrated circuitry of the digital age. The architecture, advertisements and general living styles are also depicted to be largely unchanged since the 1950s, while including contemporary products, such as a robotic rocking horse for children in one advertisement, or posters for the underground Vaults that play a central role in the storyline of the game.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThere are four main factions that the player can choose to support throughout the story; the Brotherhood of Steel, an anti-[[Android (robot)|synth]] faction hoping to preserve technology in the Commonwealth; the Institute, a secretive organization that specializes in the creation of synths; the Minutemen; a faction that aims to drive out raiders and other threats to the Commonwealth; and the Railroad, a secretive organization dedicated to rescuing synths from the Institute.\n\n=== Characters ===\nThe player's character (voiced by either [[Brian T.

The player character is at home with their spouse (Nate or Nora depending on the player character's gender), their son Shaun, and Codsworth. A Vault-Tec representative admits the family into Vault 111, the local [[fallout shelter]]. Moments later, a news bulletin warns of an incoming nuclear attack. As the detonation occurs, the family evacuates to the Vault, where they are tricked into entering [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] tubes and [[cryonics|frozen alive]]. After an unknown number of years, they are reawakened by two strangers, who murder the player's spouse and kidnap Shaun. The player is put back into cryogenic sleep and awakens again when the life support system malfunctions. The player, nicknamed the \"Sole Survivor\" of Vault 111, vows to avenge their spouse's death and find Shaun.\n\nThe Sole Survivor heads home to find Sanctuary Hills in ruins. They reunite with Codsworth, revealing that 210 years have passed since the war. Codsworth suggests that the Survivor goes to Concord for help. The Survivor finds and befriends Dogmeat, and assists the Minutemen faction in evacuating to Sanctuary Hills. The Sole Survivor travels to Diamond City, a fortified settlement based in the ruins of [[Fenway Park]], where they meet Piper. There, they learn about a secretive organization called the Institute that has been terrifying the Commonwealth by kidnapping people and replacing them with \"synths\", synthetic humans indistinguishable from real humans.\n\nWith the help of Nick Valentine, the Sole Survivor uncovers the identity of their spouse's killer: Conrad Kellogg ([[Keythe Farley]]). After learning from Kellogg that Shaun is being held in the Institute, the Sole Survivor kills him and retrieves a cybernetic implant from his brain to access his memories. During this time, the Brotherhood of Steel arrives in the Commonwealth on the ''Prydwen'', an [[airship]]. The Sole Survivor learns from Brian Virgil (Matthew Waterson), an ex-Institute scientist, that teleportation is the only way to enter the Institute. After the Survivor retrieves a chip and decodes it with the help of the Railroad, Virgil provides the blueprints for a teleportation device, which the Sole Survivor constructs by allying with the Brotherhood, Minutemen, or Railroad.\n\nThe Sole Survivor successfully enters the Institute and discovers that Shaun is the Institute's director. Shaun, now an old man calling himself Father ([[Tony Amendola]]), reveals that he was kidnapped by Kellogg to become a specimen for synth experiments due to his pure pre-war DNA, and that the Sole Survivor remained in stasis for a further sixty years before being reawakened. He invites the Sole Survivor to join the Institute. If accepted, Shaun reveals that he is dying of cancer and wishes for the Survivor to become his successor. After initiating a purge in the Commonwealth, wiping out the Brotherhood and Railroad, the Survivor assumes control of the Institute after Shaun's death. Otherwise, the Sole Survivor devises a plan with their faction to fight the Institute. Siding with the Brotherhood or Railroad will force the Sole Survivor to destroy the other faction. The Sole Survivor detonates a nuclear reactor, destroying the Institute. After this feat, if the Survivor sided with the Minutemen, they must lastly wipe out any remaining hostile faction. Otherwise, they will remain neutral.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:ToddHoward2010sm.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Todd Howard (video game designer)|Todd Howard]], game director of both ''Fallout 4'' and ''[[Fallout 3]]'', in 2010]]\n\nThe initial plans for ''Fallout 4'' were formed in 2009, when director Todd Howard wanted to explore the world of ''Fallout'' before the bombs fell.

It is the fourth main game in the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'' series]] and was released worldwide on November 10, 2015, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. The game is set within an [[open world]] [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] environment that encompasses the city of [[Boston]] and the surrounding [[Massachusetts]] region known as \"The Commonwealth\". The main story takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and 210 years after \"The Great War\", which caused [[Nuclear holocaust|catastrophic nuclear devastation]] across the United States.\n\nThe player assumes control of a character referred to as the \"Sole Survivor\", who emerges from a long-term cryogenic stasis in Vault 111, an underground nuclear [[fallout shelter]]. After witnessing the murder of their spouse and kidnapping of their son, the Sole Survivor ventures out into the Commonwealth to search for their missing child. The player explores the game's dilapidated world, completes various quests, helps out factions, and acquires experience points to level up and increase the abilities of their character. New features to the series include the ability to develop and manage settlements and an extensive crafting system where materials scavenged from the environment can be used to craft drugs and explosives, upgrade weapons and armor, and construct, furnish and improve settlements. ''Fallout 4'' also marks the first game in the series to feature full voice acting for the protagonist.\n\n''Fallout 4'' received positive reviews from critics with many praising the world depth, player freedom, overall amount of content, crafting, and soundtrack, while criticism was mainly directed at the game's visuals and technical issues. The game was a commercial and critical success, generating {{US$|750 million|long=no}} within the first 24 hours of its launch, and received numerous accolades from various gaming publications and award events, including the respective awards for Game of the Year and Best Game at the [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] and [[British Academy Games Awards]]. Bethesda has released [[Fallout 4 downloadable content|six downloadable content]] add-ons, including the expansions ''[[Fallout 4: Far Harbor|Far Harbor]]'' and ''[[Fallout 4: Nuka-World|Nuka-World]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Fallout 4'' is an [[action role-playing game]] set in an [[open world]] environment. Gameplay is similar to that of ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', the two previous primary iterations in the series. Returning features include a camera that can switch between a [[First person (video games)|first-person]] and [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. ''Fallout 4'' introduces features including a layered armor system, base-building, a dialogue system featuring 111,000 lines of dialogue,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/09/05/bethesda-completes-recording-of-fallout-4-39-s-111-000-lines-of-dialogue.aspx|title=Bethesda Completes Recording Of Fallout 4's 111,000 Lines Of Dialogue|first=Kyle|last=Hilliard|date=September 5, 2015|accessdate=October 19, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> and a crafting system which implements every lootable object in the game. Enemies such as Mole Rats, Raiders, Super Mutants, Deathclaws, and Feral Ghouls return, along with the companion [[Dogmeat (Fallout)|Dogmeat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-4s-dogmeat-cannot-be-killed/|title=Fallout 4's Dogmeat cannot be killed|first=Andy|last=Chalk|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe player has the ability to freely roam in the game's world and leave a conversation at any time. If the player has discovered a certain location they may [[fast travel]] to it. Weapons can be customized too; the game includes over 50 guns, which can be crafted with a variety of modifications, such as barrel types and laser focus, with over 700 modifications available. Power Armor has been redesigned to be more like a vehicle than an equipable suit of armor, requiring energy cores and being essentially dead weight without it<ref name=\"Fo4 Trailer\">{{cite AV media |people=Bethesda Softworks |date=June 15, 2015 |title=Fallout 4 \u2013 E3 Showcase World Premiere |medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2BkLqMef4 |access-date=June 28, 2015 |publisher=[[Bethesda Softworks]]}}</ref> and can be modified, allowing the player to add items such as a jetpack or selecting separate types of armor for each part of the suit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-4-screenshots-and-art-show-customisation-mutants-more/|title=Fallout 4 screenshots show jetpacks, mutants, more|last=Sykes|first=Tom|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\nA new feature to the series is the ability to craft and deconstruct settlements and buildings. The player can select and break down many in-game objects and structures, and use them to freely build their own structures. In addition, the towns can be powered with working electricity, using a power line system. Merchants and [[non-player character]]s can inhabit the player's settlements, for which the player must provide sustenance by growing food in makeshift patches and building water pumps. The player can build various defenses around their settlements, such as turrets and traps, to defend against random attacks.<ref name=\"crafting\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-crafting-system-is-bonkers-1711322298|title=Fallout 4's Crafting System Looks Awesome|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|date=June 14, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fallout 4 V.A.T.S.

The player can find game cartridges, which can be played on the Pip-Boy or a terminal. A new feature for the Pip-Boy interface is a downloadable application for iOS, Android, and Windows smartphones and tablets. This optional app allows players to access the Pip-Boy interface on a separate screen, and play the collected game cartridges when not playing the main game. Another returning gameplay feature is the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.). While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is slowed down (instead of stopped entirely as in previous entries), and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of \"[[bullet time]]\". Various actions cost points, limiting the actions of each combatant during a period of time, and the player can target specific body parts for attacks to inflict specific injuries; headshots can be used for quick kills or to blind, legs can be targeted to slow enemy movement, and opponents can be disarmed by shooting at their weapons. Unlike previous games, in which the player had a random chance to inflict a critical hit, they are now performed manually through V.A.T.S.<ref name=\"First Gameplay\">{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2015/06/15/e3-2015-fallout-4s-first-gameplay-and-story-details|title=E3 2015: Fallout 4's First Gameplay Details|last=Ingenito|first=Vince|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 14, 2015|accessdate=June 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the game, players are given points to spend on a character progression system called [[Fallout (video game)#SPECIAL system|S.P.E.C.I.A.L.]]. The system represents seven statistics, namely strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck. When the player earns enough [[experience point]]s to gain a new level, they unlock an ability. When the player allocates more points to a statistic, more abilities can be unlocked. These perks can be upgraded to improve the protagonist's efficiency and to further unlock abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/24/9036527/fallout-4-romance-options-upgrades-special-customization-progression|title=How Fallout 4 handles romance, character progression and more|first=Griffin|last=McElroy|date=July 24, 2015|accessdate=July 25, 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> There are about 275 perks available for the player to unlock.

For the first time in the series, these companions can interact with the environment on the player character's behalf. For example, if the player character does not have required skills to hack a terminal or pick a lock, they can order the companion to do it for them. Any companion present besides Dogmeat will react to certain player actions in one of four ways (love, like, dislike, or hate), which either raises or lowers their \"affinity\". Raising a companion's affinity to 1,000 points will result in them \"idolizing\" the player and granting a specific perk. The companion will leave if affinity drops low enough, and some actions can turn them hostile on sight. {{Clear}}\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Fallout 4'' takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and 210 years after the Great War, a war between the United States and China over natural resources that ended in a [[nuclear holocaust]] in 2077. The setting is a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Retrofuturism|retro-future]], covering a region that includes [[Boston]] and other parts of [[New England]] known as \"The Commonwealth\". Unlike the previous titles, ''Fallout 4''{{'}}s story begins on the day the bombs dropped: October 23, 2077.\n\nThe game takes place in an alternate version of history that sees the 1940s and 1950s aesthetics such as diners and a drive-in theater. The design and technology advance in the directions imagined at the time. The resulting universe is thus a [[Retrofuturism|retro-futuristic]] one, where the technology has evolved enough to produce [[Directed-energy weapon|laser weapons]], [[Genetic engineering|manipulate genes]] and create nearly-autonomous [[artificial intelligence]], but all within the confines of 1950s solutions such as the widespread use of atomic power and [[vacuum tube]]s, as well as having the integrated circuitry of the digital age. The architecture, advertisements and general living styles are also depicted to be largely unchanged since the 1950s, while including contemporary products, such as a robotic rocking horse for children in one advertisement, or posters for the underground Vaults that play a central role in the storyline of the game.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nThere are four main factions that the player can choose to support throughout the story; the Brotherhood of Steel, an anti-[[Android (robot)|synth]] faction hoping to preserve technology in the Commonwealth; the Institute, a secretive organization that specializes in the creation of synths; the Minutemen; a faction that aims to drive out raiders and other threats to the Commonwealth; and the Railroad, a secretive organization dedicated to rescuing synths from the Institute.\n\n=== Characters ===\nThe player's character (voiced by either [[Brian T. Delaney]] or [[Courtenay Taylor]]) takes shelter in Vault 111, emerging exactly 210 years later on October 23, 2287, and assuming the name of the \"Sole Survivor\".<ref name=\"guardiane3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/15/fallout-4-release-date-and-details-plus-dishonored-2|title=Fallout 4: release date and details, plus Dishonored 2|last=Stuart|first=Keith|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> There are thirteen possible companions in the story.

The other six possible companions are Cait (Katy Townsend), an Irish-accented cage fighter; Curie ([[Sophie Simone Cortina]]), a robot scientist turned Synth; Danse ([[Peter Jessop]]), a Brotherhood of Steel Paladin; MacCready ([[Matthew Mercer]]), a mercenary; Strong ([[Sean Schemmel]]), a human-sympathetic Super Mutant; and X6-88 (David Paluck), an Institute Courser.

The player character is at home with their spouse (Nate or Nora depending on the player character's gender), their son Shaun, and Codsworth. A Vault-Tec representative admits the family into Vault 111, the local [[fallout shelter]]. Moments later, a news bulletin warns of an incoming nuclear attack. As the detonation occurs, the family evacuates to the Vault, where they are tricked into entering [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] tubes and [[cryonics|frozen alive]]. After an unknown number of years, they are reawakened by two strangers, who murder the player's spouse and kidnap Shaun. The player is put back into cryogenic sleep and awakens again when the life support system malfunctions. The player, nicknamed the \"Sole Survivor\" of Vault 111, vows to avenge their spouse's death and find Shaun.\n\nThe Sole Survivor heads home to find Sanctuary Hills in ruins. They reunite with Codsworth, revealing that 210 years have passed since the war. Codsworth suggests that the Survivor goes to Concord for help. The Survivor finds and befriends Dogmeat, and assists the Minutemen faction in evacuating to Sanctuary Hills. The Sole Survivor travels to Diamond City, a fortified settlement based in the ruins of [[Fenway Park]], where they meet Piper. There, they learn about a secretive organization called the Institute that has been terrifying the Commonwealth by kidnapping people and replacing them with \"synths\", synthetic humans indistinguishable from real humans.\n\nWith the help of Nick Valentine, the Sole Survivor uncovers the identity of their spouse's killer: Conrad Kellogg ([[Keythe Farley]]). After learning from Kellogg that Shaun is being held in the Institute, the Sole Survivor kills him and retrieves a cybernetic implant from his brain to access his memories. During this time, the Brotherhood of Steel arrives in the Commonwealth on the ''Prydwen'', an [[airship]]. The Sole Survivor learns from Brian Virgil (Matthew Waterson), an ex-Institute scientist, that teleportation is the only way to enter the Institute. After the Survivor retrieves a chip and decodes it with the help of the Railroad, Virgil provides the blueprints for a teleportation device, which the Sole Survivor constructs by allying with the Brotherhood, Minutemen, or Railroad.\n\nThe Sole Survivor successfully enters the Institute and discovers that Shaun is the Institute's director. Shaun, now an old man calling himself Father ([[Tony Amendola]]), reveals that he was kidnapped by Kellogg to become a specimen for synth experiments due to his pure pre-war DNA, and that the Sole Survivor remained in stasis for a further sixty years before being reawakened. He invites the Sole Survivor to join the Institute. If accepted, Shaun reveals that he is dying of cancer and wishes for the Survivor to become his successor. After initiating a purge in the Commonwealth, wiping out the Brotherhood and Railroad, the Survivor assumes control of the Institute after Shaun's death. Otherwise, the Sole Survivor devises a plan with their faction to fight the Institute. Siding with the Brotherhood or Railroad will force the Sole Survivor to destroy the other faction. The Sole Survivor detonates a nuclear reactor, destroying the Institute. After this feat, if the Survivor sided with the Minutemen, they must lastly wipe out any remaining hostile faction. Otherwise, they will remain neutral.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:ToddHoward2010sm.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Todd Howard (video game designer)|Todd Howard]], game director of both ''Fallout 4'' and ''[[Fallout 3]]'', in 2010]]\n\nThe initial plans for ''Fallout 4'' were formed in 2009, when director Todd Howard wanted to explore the world of ''Fallout'' before the bombs fell. Thus, a team began production on the game that year, including [[Istvan Pely]], lead artist of ''[[Fallout 3]]'', after finishing that game's [[downloadable content]] (DLC). Meanwhile, development on ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' had Bethesda's full attention, and after that game released in 2011, the studio continued to regularly support it until 2013 with updates and DLC.

The mistake was corrected and so Germany was placed 7th over Norway. Israel and Norway both received 2 points less than originally and Croatia, Malta, Portugal, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia and Turkey all received one point less than indicated during the broadcast.\n:2. {{note|b}} In 2009, Croatia qualified through the back-up jury selection. \n:3. If a country had won the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. In addition from 2004-2007, the top ten countries who were not members of the big four did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. If, for example, Germany and France placed inside the top ten, the countries who placed 11th and 12th were advanced to the following year's grand final along with the rest of the top ten countries. Serbia & Montenegro decided to withdraw from the competition even tho they finished in the top ten the previous year, so the country that placed 11th (which was Croatia) got the spot in the final instead.</small>\n\n==Awards==\n===Barbara Dex Award===\n{{further|Barbara Dex Award}}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!Year\n!Performer\n!Host city\n!{{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|{{Escyr|2016}}\n|[[Nina Kralji\u0107]]\n|{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Stockholm]]\n|{{center|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2016/05/22/barbara-dex-award-2016-nina-kraljic-wins-eurovisions-worst-dressed/142524/|title=Barbara Dex Award 2016: Croatia\u2019s Nina Kraljic tops Eurovision\u2019s Worst Dressed list|publisher=[[Wiwibloggs]]|date=22 May 2016|accessdate=8 December 2019|first=William Lee|last=Adams}}</ref>}}\n|}\n\n==Related involvement==\n===Heads of delegation===\nThe public broadcaster of each participating country in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU's contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event.

The mistake was corrected and so Germany was placed 7th over Norway. Israel and Norway both received 2 points less than originally and Croatia, Malta, Portugal, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia and Turkey all received one point less than indicated during the broadcast.\n:2. {{note|b}} In 2009, Croatia qualified through the back-up jury selection. \n:3. If a country had won the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. In addition from 2004-2007, the top ten countries who were not members of the big four did not have to compete in the semi-finals the following year. If, for example, Germany and France placed inside the top ten, the countries who placed 11th and 12th were advanced to the following year's grand final along with the rest of the top ten countries. Serbia & Montenegro decided to withdraw from the competition even tho they finished in the top ten the previous year, so the country that placed 11th (which was Croatia) got the spot in the final instead.</small>\n\n==Awards==\n===Barbara Dex Award===\n{{further|Barbara Dex Award}}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!Year\n!Performer\n!Host city\n!{{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|{{Escyr|2016}}\n|[[Nina Kralji\u0107]]\n|{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Stockholm]]\n|{{center|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiwibloggs.com/2016/05/22/barbara-dex-award-2016-nina-kraljic-wins-eurovisions-worst-dressed/142524/|title=Barbara Dex Award 2016: Croatia\u2019s Nina Kraljic tops Eurovision\u2019s Worst Dressed list|publisher=[[Wiwibloggs]]|date=22 May 2016|accessdate=8 December 2019|first=William Lee|last=Adams}}</ref>}}\n|}\n\n==Related involvement==\n===Heads of delegation===\nThe public broadcaster of each participating country in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU's contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event.

His family includes his parents, his grandmother, and his four sisters. Pandurang's relationship with his father is a difficult one, and they have been estranged since Pandurang was a boy. His father, who typifies the patriarchal family head, beats his son in childhood for wandering around in the company of friends. He does not allow the young boy to learn to play flute, or to perform in his school's plays. Pandurang considers his father excessively money-minded, materialistic, selfish, unscrupulous, and dictatorial. In sharp contrast to his relationship with his father, Pandurang loves his mother and his sisters dearly.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nAfter passing his local school's matriculation examination, Pandurang moves to [[Pune]] to attend college.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/> While studying, Pandurang lives in a hostel. He decides to make the most of college life, and becomes the secretary of the college debating society, prefect of the hostel, and directs a play at the college Annual Day function. Out of kindness, he gives responsibility for management of the hostel mess to one of his poorer friends. But, although Pandurang tries to help everyone around him, he ultimately discovers that his friends are using him. Finally, when he fails his exams badly and his financial position deteriorates, his father becomes angered by Pandurang's life-style. Pandurang learns a lesson: that good deeds do not count for much in life.<ref name=\"George1993\">{{cite book|editor-last=George|editor-first=K. M.|editor-link=K. M.

Even his father now hesitates to ask him to mend his ways. He is shaken by the untimely death of his younger sister, Mani, but otherwise has no care for anything. In consequence, he fails his exam. After unsuccessful attempts to find work in the city, ultimately Pandurang returns to his village, his mind \"existentially vacant\". He is now one among many unemployed youngsters of the village. As Pandurang tries to understand their views on life, their sorrows and their joys, the true meaning of life begins to dawn.<ref name=\"George1993\"/>\n\n==Theme and techniques==\nThe main theme of ''Kosala'' is [[Social alienation|alienation]].<ref name=\"Chitre1969\"/> The novel is influenced by [[existential philosophy]],<ref name=\"NatarajanNelson1996\"/> exploring existentialist ideas such as an obsession with birth and death, dread, alienation, and absurdity. Like other [[Existentialism#Literature|existential novels]], ''Kosala'' uses the [[First-person narrative|first person point of view]] to recount an individual's experiences, and in this exploration raises many questions regarding the [[meaning of life]] and the value of existence. It is considered the first existential novel in Marathi literature.<ref>{{cite thesis|first=Dattatraya Dnyandev|last=Khaladkar |title=Existentialism in the Selected American and Marathi Novels: a Comparative Study|chapter=Existentialism in Marathi Novels |chapter-url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/9899/7/07_chapter%203.pdf |year=2010 |publisher=Department of English, Shivaji University |location=Kolhapur|type=Ph.D|pages=144\u2013145|hdl=10603/9899}}</ref>\n\nThe novel's protagonist, Pandurang, has been described as a \"quintessential [[antihero|anti-hero]]\",<ref name=\"Padgaonkar1997\">{{cite journal|last=Padgaonkar|first=Latika|title=Cocoon by Bhalchandra Nemade (Book Review)|journal=The Book Review|volume=21|year=1997|publisher=C.

Later on in the novel, this estrangement develops into a major theme of mute revolt on the part of the younger generation, against the patriarchal system of values so characteristic of traditional Indian life. Pandurang has not so far found anything meaningful in his experience of village life. The same experience of meaninglessness repeats itself in his college life too in Pune, spread over six years.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe novel has been written in an epistolary fashion, where it reads like a number of diary entries. The language of the protagonist, Sangvikar, is an instrument in divulging his worldview. He uses a Marathi dialect spoken in rural Maharashtra. Despite the pessimistic undertones, there is an element of humour throughout the novel.  Another technique employed by the author is that the narration describes \"historical investigations\" often undertaken by Sangvikar and his friend Suresh Bapat, which ultimately uncover to them the absurdity and pathos of their conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It uses oblique, irrelevant humour as a serious moral strategy to unmask the phoneyness of society and culture.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe narrative of the novel fuses different types of genres such as the autobiography, the diary, the novel, the Indian folktales, folk narratives, and medieval saint literature.

His family includes his parents, his grandmother, and his four sisters. Pandurang's relationship with his father is a difficult one, and they have been estranged since Pandurang was a boy. His father, who typifies the patriarchal family head, beats his son in childhood for wandering around in the company of friends. He does not allow the young boy to learn to play flute, or to perform in his school's plays. Pandurang considers his father excessively money-minded, materialistic, selfish, unscrupulous, and dictatorial. In sharp contrast to his relationship with his father, Pandurang loves his mother and his sisters dearly.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nAfter passing his local school's matriculation examination, Pandurang moves to [[Pune]] to attend college.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/> While studying, Pandurang lives in a hostel. He decides to make the most of college life, and becomes the secretary of the college debating society, prefect of the hostel, and directs a play at the college Annual Day function. Out of kindness, he gives responsibility for management of the hostel mess to one of his poorer friends. But, although Pandurang tries to help everyone around him, he ultimately discovers that his friends are using him. Finally, when he fails his exams badly and his financial position deteriorates, his father becomes angered by Pandurang's life-style. Pandurang learns a lesson: that good deeds do not count for much in life.<ref name=\"George1993\">{{cite book|editor-last=George|editor-first=K. M.|editor-link=K. M.

Even his father now hesitates to ask him to mend his ways. He is shaken by the untimely death of his younger sister, Mani, but otherwise has no care for anything. In consequence, he fails his exam. After unsuccessful attempts to find work in the city, ultimately Pandurang returns to his village, his mind \"existentially vacant\". He is now one among many unemployed youngsters of the village. As Pandurang tries to understand their views on life, their sorrows and their joys, the true meaning of life begins to dawn.<ref name=\"George1993\"/>\n\n==Theme and techniques==\nThe main theme of ''Kosala'' is [[Social alienation|alienation]].<ref name=\"Chitre1969\"/> The novel is influenced by [[existential philosophy]],<ref name=\"NatarajanNelson1996\"/> exploring existentialist ideas such as an obsession with birth and death, dread, alienation, and absurdity. Like other [[Existentialism#Literature|existential novels]], ''Kosala'' uses the [[First-person narrative|first person point of view]] to recount an individual's experiences, and in this exploration raises many questions regarding the [[meaning of life]] and the value of existence. It is considered the first existential novel in Marathi literature.<ref>{{cite thesis|first=Dattatraya Dnyandev|last=Khaladkar |title=Existentialism in the Selected American and Marathi Novels: a Comparative Study|chapter=Existentialism in Marathi Novels |chapter-url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/9899/7/07_chapter%203.pdf |year=2010 |publisher=Department of English, Shivaji University |location=Kolhapur|type=Ph.D|pages=144\u2013145|hdl=10603/9899}}</ref>\n\nThe novel's protagonist, Pandurang, has been described as a \"quintessential [[antihero|anti-hero]]\",<ref name=\"Padgaonkar1997\">{{cite journal|last=Padgaonkar|first=Latika|title=Cocoon by Bhalchandra Nemade (Book Review)|journal=The Book Review|volume=21|year=1997|publisher=C.

Later on in the novel, this estrangement develops into a major theme of mute revolt on the part of the younger generation, against the patriarchal system of values so characteristic of traditional Indian life. Pandurang has not so far found anything meaningful in his experience of village life. The same experience of meaninglessness repeats itself in his college life too in Pune, spread over six years.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe novel has been written in an epistolary fashion, where it reads like a number of diary entries. The language of the protagonist, Sangvikar, is an instrument in divulging his worldview. He uses a Marathi dialect spoken in rural Maharashtra. Despite the pessimistic undertones, there is an element of humour throughout the novel.  Another technique employed by the author is that the narration describes \"historical investigations\" often undertaken by Sangvikar and his friend Suresh Bapat, which ultimately uncover to them the absurdity and pathos of their conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It uses oblique, irrelevant humour as a serious moral strategy to unmask the phoneyness of society and culture.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe narrative of the novel fuses different types of genres such as the autobiography, the diary, the novel, the Indian folktales, folk narratives, and medieval saint literature. The language used in the novel are standard, archaic, urban, non-urban dialects, slangs, jargons, and sometimes poetic and rhetoric.<ref name=\"Gurjarpadhye2014\"/> ''Kosala'' is said to have been inspired partially by [[J.

When the band members got into the studio, The Rev recorded all the drums in one take, and the other members of the band added their parts to what he had laid down. Zacky Vengeance played lead guitar originally. Then, when Synyster Gates joined the band in early 2001, they recorded a heavy metal version of \"To End the Rapture\" with Gates playing lead guitar. This heavy metal version was first seen on the \"[[Warmness on the Soul]]\" single, and was later featured on the re-release of ''Sounding the Seventh Trumpet''. This is the only album to feature bassist Justin Sane, whom is also credited as playing piano on the original releases. He was briefly replaced by Dameon Ash as a touring bassist after the touring cycle, whom was then replaced by [[Johnny Christ]].\n\n==Release==\nThe release date of this album is theorized in many sources. On the band's official website, it's given as January 31, 2001. However, on archived versions of the website, news updates explain that the album, distributed by Lumberjack Distributions, was originally planned for a late April 2001 release. Due to unknown reasons, it had to be pushed back multiple times, at first for a June 10, then for a June 20 release. A [[Loudwire]] article about the album's 17th anniversary gives July 24 as the actual release date.<ref name=\"Loudwire\">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/avenged-sevenfold-sounding-the-seventh-trumpet-album-anniversary/ |title=17 Years Ago: Avenged Sevenfold Introduce Themselves With \u2018Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\u2019 |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=2017-07-24 |accessdate=2018-11-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n|rev2 = ''[[Kerrang!]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>''[[Kerrang!]]'' issue 880 (November 24, 2001).</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Ultimate Guitar]]''\n|rev3score=8.5/10<ref>{{cite web |title=Avenged Sevenfold: Sounding The Seventh Trumpet {{!}} Reviews @ Ultimate-Guitar.com |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/avenged_sevenfold/sounding_the_seventh_trumpet/ |website=[[Ultimate Guitar]] |accessdate=3 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n}}\n''Sounding the Seventh Trumpet'' was generally well received by critics.

When the band members got into the studio, The Rev recorded all the drums in one take, and the other members of the band added their parts to what he had laid down. Zacky Vengeance played lead guitar originally. Then, when Synyster Gates joined the band in early 2001, they recorded a heavy metal version of \"To End the Rapture\" with Gates playing lead guitar. This heavy metal version was first seen on the \"[[Warmness on the Soul]]\" single, and was later featured on the re-release of ''Sounding the Seventh Trumpet''. This is the only album to feature bassist Justin Sane, whom is also credited as playing piano on the original releases. He was briefly replaced by Dameon Ash as a touring bassist after the touring cycle, whom was then replaced by [[Johnny Christ]].\n\n==Release==\nThe release date of this album is theorized in many sources. On the band's official website, it's given as January 31, 2001. However, on archived versions of the website, news updates explain that the album, distributed by Lumberjack Distributions, was originally planned for a late April 2001 release. Due to unknown reasons, it had to be pushed back multiple times, at first for a June 10, then for a June 20 release. A [[Loudwire]] article about the album's 17th anniversary gives July 24 as the actual release date.<ref name=\"Loudwire\">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/avenged-sevenfold-sounding-the-seventh-trumpet-album-anniversary/ |title=17 Years Ago: Avenged Sevenfold Introduce Themselves With \u2018Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\u2019 |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=2017-07-24 |accessdate=2018-11-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n|rev2 = ''[[Kerrang!]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>''[[Kerrang!]]'' issue 880 (November 24, 2001).</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Ultimate Guitar]]''\n|rev3score=8.5/10<ref>{{cite web |title=Avenged Sevenfold: Sounding The Seventh Trumpet {{!}} Reviews @ Ultimate-Guitar.com |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/avenged_sevenfold/sounding_the_seventh_trumpet/ |website=[[Ultimate Guitar]] |accessdate=3 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n}}\n''Sounding the Seventh Trumpet'' was generally well received by critics.
