This location was relocated and expanded to two storefronts at the corner of NE 19th Avenue and NE 169th Street the following year<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of NMB Library |url=https://www.citynmb.com/1048/The-History-of-NMB-Library |website=City of North Miami Beach |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>. In 1961, however, the city ended its attachment with the City of Miami Library System and became an independent library.\u2028\u2028 After residents of the City of North Miami Beach voted to build a permanent location for the library in 1964, a new building was constructed on 164th Street and opened in 1965. Renovations to this facility in 1981 and 1994 grew the branch from its original 10,000 square feet to make room for the library's expanding collection.\n\nThe North Miami Beach Library offers a variety of services to the residents of North Miami Beach, such as access to study and meeting rooms, employment resources, early literacy programs, voter registration forms, citizenship materials, and passport assistance. Computers, printers, copiers, scanners, and fax machine services are also available. \u2028\u2028The library's dedicated teen area, known as the Discovery District, is a space specifically designed to provide library patrons aged 13-19 with a place to read, study, or work on school projects<ref>{{cite web |title=Discovery District |url=https://nmblib.weebly.com/d2-discovery-district.html |website=North Miami Beach Public Library |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>.
