Her husband Eustace [[cruelty to animals|regularly mistreats him]]. Ironically, given his name, Courage is a genuine coward and he often expresses his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks. Regardless, he still goes to great lengths to protect his owners. To the end, he often gets injured, sometimes quite brutally, and only surviving through his determination and/or pure luck. Despite his cowardice, Courage is very clever and resourceful when the situation demands it, outsmarting the villains most of the time. He also often displays super strength, carrying Muriel and Eustace with relative ease. Aiding him at saving the day is a self-aware, sarcastic and seemingly omniscient computer that he keeps in the attic. He got his name when Muriel found him as a puppy alone in an alley and remarked that he must be quite brave to be there by himself.<ref name=\"Remembrance of Courage Past\"/>\n\n=== Muriel Bagge===\n[[File:Muriel Bagge.jpg|thumb|right|Muriel Bagge|240x240px]]\n:''Voiced by [[Howard Hoffman]] (pilot) and [[Thea White]] (series)''\n\n'''Muriel Bagge''' is Courage's owner and Eustace's wife. She is an elderly, overweight, kind, hard-working Scottish woman who took Courage in when he was an abandoned puppy.<ref name=\"Remembrance of Courage Past\"/> Muriel often carries a rolling pin that she hits Eustace with whenever he harasses Courage. She also likes tea and usually tends to her garden, as well as being an accomplished [[sitar]] player. Muriel also has a great fondness for cooking; however, her recipes tend to include an excessive amount of [[vinegar]], much to the distaste of both her dog and husband. Most of all, she loves sitting in her rocking chair with Courage on her lap and watching television. Due to her kindness and sweet nature, Muriel is an easy (and often attractive) target for [[Villain of the week|villains]].\n\n=== Eustace Bagge===\n[[File:EustaceBagge.jpg|thumb|right|Eustace Bagge|211x211px]]\n:''Voiced by [[Howard Hoffman]] (pilot), [[Lionel Wilson (voice actor)|Lionel Wilson]] (Episodes 1\u201333),<ref name=\"voicechasers\"/> [[Arthur Anderson (actor)|Arthur Anderson]] (Episodes 34\u201352), and [[Wallace Shawn]] (The Fog of Courage)<ref name=\"voicechasers\"/>''\n\n'''Eustace Bagge''' is Muriel's husband. He is an elderly, skinny, jaded, disgruntled, cynical, and greedy farmer who is interested in money and obsessed with his truck. Eustace is also the current owner of the farmhouse, which was previously owned by his now-deceased brother Horst. Eustace regularly mistreats Courage out of jealousy and calls him a \"stupid dog\". Eustace wears glasses identical in appearance to Muriel's, and his brown hat shields his bald head. Eustace often refers to Courage simply as \"Dog\" and rarely addresses him by name. He regularly demeans Muriel as well; in one episode, Muriel develops [[amnesia]] and Eustace takes advantage of this by simply convincing her that she is a \"slave woman\", making her do all the chores and cooking around the house.<ref name=\"Dr. Le Quack, Amnesia specialist\">{{Cite episode|title=Dr. Le Quack, Amnesia Specialist|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=1999-11-19|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 1: 1999\u20132000|season=1|number=2|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref> Still, he does love his wife, as evidenced by his concern for her well-being in a few episodes.

They decide to attack the farm because they are not getting enough water and because Muriel harvests the eggplant with the periscope, angering them because they believe it is unjust to eat an eggplant. The eggplants take Muriel captive for her treatment of the eggplant, but Courage eventually saves her and floods the chasing army of eggplants, causing them to take root and leave the farm alone. This episode is the only time the eggplants make an appearance.\n\n=== Eliza and Elisa Stitch ===\n: ''Voiced by [[Fran Brill]]''\n\n'''Eliza and Elisa Stitch''' are a pair of [[conjoined twin]] sisters who attempt to be immortal by sewing other women's souls into a quilt. They did this by making them put a symbol on a piece of [[fabric]], turning the person into quilt material, then they say a chant \"Weave believe belong weave believe belong leave the circle never weave this quilt forever.\" This almost happened to Muriel until Courage stopped them.\n\n=== Mona Lisa ===\n'''[[Mona Lisa]]''' is a woman painted by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and is a work of art long adored by Muriel. After the Bagges are inadvertently locked inside the [[Louvre]], an eerie alignment of the planets occurs and the exhibits come to life including ''Mona Lisa'' and ''[[The Thinker]]''. Mona Lisa attempts to get the Thinker to kiss her, but he only thinks about it, true to his title. She ends up with another male statue after Courage hits him with Cupid's arrow and holds up her picture. She willingly went back to her painting with the male statue and let Muriel go. She only appears in the episode \"So in Louvre Are We Two\".\n\n=== The Thinker ===\n'''[[The Thinker]]''' is the masterpiece of [[Auguste Rodin]] who goes on a date with ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' during the episode. He is constantly saying, \"Let me think.\" every time Mona Lisa suggests something that they should do. His thinking got in the way though, and he ended up alone in a painting after the planets were no longer aligned. He also only appears in the episode \"So in Louvre Are We Two\".\n\n=== Conway the Contaminationist ===\n'''Conway the Contaminationist''' is an elderly man claiming to be 193 years old, and who also claims that a filthy environment is \"better\" and \"healthier\" than a clean one (\"Out with the good air, in with the bad\"). He only appears in the episode of the same name, in which he pollutes the Bagge farm and convinces Muriel and Eustace to be filthy as well. Eventually, Courage has to literally clean up Conway's act and sends him away in a large balloon full of the filth that was brought into the house.\n\n=== Chief Wicky Wicky ===\n'''Chief Wicky Wicky''' is the leader of an island tribe looking for someone to sacrifice to their volcano god. Eventually he sees there is no volcano god, and becomes quite friendly.\n\n=== The Space Whale ===\n'''The Space Whale''' is a giant whale from space who is capable of devouring planets, asteroids, ships, and comets. After it attempts to eat a pair of Star-Makers, the male squid sacrifices himself to save the female by exploding into stars that destroys them both. Like the Star-Makers, the Space Whale is the last of its kind.\n\n=== Fishionary ===\n:''Voiced by [[Susan Sarandon]]\n\nThe '''Fishionary''' is a purple female fish who serves as a missionary for the Fish Judges and their octopus coworker. She comes to the farm and takes the Bagges and Courage to the Judges' domain in a bus and falsely accuses them of pulling crimes against seas creatures and the Judges had them sentenced to a giant fishbowl while wearing gills that allow them to breathe water until they become fish. After Courage escapes back to the farm with the Bagges using the Fishionary's bus, he and the Judges discover her living in the Bagges house and that she has betrayed them. The Bagges are released from the bowl and the Fishionary took their place.\n\n== Minor characters ==\n\n=== The Three Government Ninjas ===\n\n'''The Three Government Ninjas''' are three ninjas that work for the US government who wear the numbers 1, 2, and 3 respectively on their shirts. They are seen in a few episodes such as \"Invisible Muriel\" and \"The Last of the Starmakers\", assisting the general and the lieutenant in cover-ups of paranormal affairs. In \"Invisible Muriel\", they are shown to be quite stupid; they mistook Courage for Muriel's son, didn't notice they were walking past the invisibility diamond during a chase with Courage, and let Muriel go (with Courage hiding under her apron) since she was made visible again.\n\n=== Space Dino ===\n'''Space Dino''' is a dinosaur-like alien that stands on an asteroid outside Earth's atmosphere, and is always seen with a tennis racket, which he uses to hit celestial objects. In the episode \"1,000 Years of Courage\", the Space Dino hits a meteor, which strikes Earth and causes time to progress 1,000 years into the future (taking Courage, Eustace, and Muriel into a new civilization of talking bananas), and later causes another meteor to strike the Earth (sending Courage and his owners back to the past).\n\n=== Courage's Parents ===\n\n'''Courage's Parents''' whose appearances resemble Courage's, except his father had a moustache and his mother wore a hat with a flower on top and holding a blue purse. They were sent into space by Cruel Veterinarian.<ref name=\"Remembrance of Courage Past\"/> Not much is known about his parents or even their names, although Courage's father was called Henry during one of the flashbacks, as they were seen only in \"Remembrance of Courage Past\" centering on flashbacks to his parents in the veterinarian's office, where Courage last saw his parents.<ref name=\"Remembrance of Courage Past\"/> They were launched into space by the veterinarian, and Courage avoided a similar fate by escaping through a garbage chute, where he was found by Muriel. The veterinarian was trapped in the rocket, and transported to the planet where Courage's parents and other dogs resided.<ref name=\"Remembrance of Courage Past\"/>\n\n=== Kitty and Bunny ===\n''Voiced by [[Katie Griffin]] and Barbara McCulloh''\n\n'''Kitty and Bunny''' are a female cat and a rabbit who are best friends. They appeared in the episode \"The Mask\" where Bunny is held captive by her abusive boyfriend Mad Dog and Kitty tries to save her unintentionally getting help from Courage even though he's kept in the dark about the situation and is terrified of Kitty. Courage later rescued Bunny and defeated Mad Dog and his gang. Bunny gives Courage a kiss on the cheek and Kitty awaited Bunny at the Amtrak passenger train's rear, where they both reunited. Bunny told Kitty that Courage saved her life. Kitty then admitted that she had been wrong about dogs and helped Bunny onto a train she was on. The two thanked Courage and rode off together. Kitty's mask was later used by Eustace to protect his face from explosions while he fixed the boiler.\n\n=== Icket Bagge ===\n'''Icket Bagge''' is Eustace's and Horst's deceased father, Ma Bagge's husband, and Muriel's father-in-law. He is mentioned in the episodes \"The Sandwhale Strikes\" and \"Mother's Day\". He has an appearance very close to Eustace's, except he has a beard. He apparently was very brave and big; as Ma quotes, \"You [Eustace] couldn't fill his shoes!\". This is no exaggeration, as his shoes were rather huge compared to his son. It is unknown how his relationship with Eustace was, whether he treated Eustace poorly like Horst and Ma or he treated Eustace with respect.\n\n=== The Duck Brothers ===\n:''Voiced by [[Will Ryan]]''\n\n'''The Duck Brothers''' are three space ducks who are brothers. Their names are Donnie, Clyde, and Payne. One of them is always laying eggs even though he is male. They appear in two episodes, the first in which two of them abduct Muriel and place a mind-control device on her for their own purposes. Courage tries to rescue Muriel, only to find that the duck brothers were planning a rescue mission of their own (to save the other duck brother, who has been captured by the United States Government and is about to be made into dinner.) Courage volunteers to be mind-controlled instead, and they save the third brother. The three duck brothers reunite and leave. Two of the brothers make a cameo appearance in \"Ball of Revenge\", where they play guitars and perform as the half-time show.\n\n=== The Hunchback of Nowhere ===\n: ''Voiced by [[Rick Jones (voice actor)|Rick Jones]]''\n\n'''The Hunchback of Nowhere''' is a strange and enigmatic character who has made only one appearance in the first season, in an episode of the same name. In appearance he is a short, facially-deformed little man who is hunchbacked, carrying with him a series of bells. Traveling across Nowhere in the middle of a rainy season, the Hunchback tried to find sanctuary among the locals only to be turned away by them based on his disfigured appearance. However, he is friendly and makes friends with Courage in the barn, where the Hunchback goes after being turned away by Eustace. He finally teaches Eustace that it is what is on the inside that counts.\n\n=== The Sandman ===\n'''[[Sandman]]''' is the king of sleep who resides in a tall castle that is apparently made of sand in the middle of a forest, counting sheep indefinitely in a futile attempt to go to sleep.\n\n=== The Star-Maker ===\n'''The Star-Maker''' is a [[squid]] from space who landed on Earth with her unhatched offspring. She and her mate are the last of their kind. After her mate died from saving them from a space whale, she escapes to Earth to hatch the eggs. Eustace called the US government, who contained the squid in a mobile laboratory, but Courage manages to hatch her offspring, who flew up into space to make new stars. Afterwards, she died peacefully and her body became a garden of large flowers and bushes.\n\n=== The Magic Tree ===\n:''Voiced by [[Peter Fernandez]]''\n\n'''The Magic Tree''' is a magical tree that Courage grows, capable of making ideas and dreams come true. It can also talk. It grants wishes, whether they are good or bad, and it ends up granting a wish for Eustace which causes Muriel's head to swell up. Eustace then considers it a threat and decides to chop the tree down and Courage has to defend it for three days in order to cure Muriel. Although Eustace had a bit of sympathy, he chose to cut it down anyway. After the tree has been cut down and before it dies, it tells Courage how to cure Muriel. The tree had the last laugh against Eustace as the episode ended with Eustace's head swollen up just like Muriel's had been.\n\n=== Carmen the Serpent ===\n\n'''Carmen the Serpent''' is a monstrous, one-eyed [[sea serpent]] who lives in the Evil River, who is \"evil\" according to a sea-captain. The sea-captain fools the Bagges under the false promise of a luxury cruise, only to reveal that he actually [[Shanghaiing|shanghaied]] them to sail through the Evil River to find and hunt down Carmen. The sea-serpent kidnaps Muriel and takes her to her cave and starts singing opera to her. Courage comes to Muriel's rescue, only to realize that Carmen was not trying to harm Muriel. Courage helps Carmen to dodge and defeat the evil captain.\n\n=== Twin Raccoons ===\n\n'''Twin Raccoons''' are two raccoon brothers who are revealed as [[bandit]]s. They attack Courage and kidnap Muriel because they wanted her as a parent. Muriel feels pity on them and accepts them like her own [[adoption|adopted]] children.<ref name=\"Campsite of Terror\">{{Cite episode|title=Freaky Fred|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=2002-02-08|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 3: 2002|season=3|number=2|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref> At the end of the episode, Muriel's place has been taken over by Eustace as a new parent.<ref name=\"Campsite of Terror\"/>\n\nThey reappear in \"Farmer Hunter, Farmer Hunted\" as audience members in the ''Hunt for Knowledge'' game show, however their names are \"'''Hugo''' & '''Herman'''\".<ref name=\"Campsite of Terror\"/>\n\n=== Duncan ===\n'''Duncan''' is the storm-goddess's pet dog who looks similar to Courage who gets lost.<ref name=\"Stormy Weather\">{{Cite episode|title=Stormy Weather|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=2002-03-15|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 3: 2002|season=3|number=4|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref> The storm-goddess mistakes Courage for Duncan and tries to take him, but Muriel argues with her (as such, the storm-goddess angrily destroys the farmhouse with a storm). Mr. (Charlie) Rat tells Courage where Duncan is.<ref name=\"Stormy Weather\"/> Courage looks for Duncan and finally finds him in a sewer licking the God-Bone, a bone that no dog can ever stop licking once licked.<ref name=\"Stormy Weather\"/>\n\n=== The Librarian ===\n'''The Librarian''' appears only in the episode \"Wrath of the Librarian\". She never speaks, she just says \"Shhh\" while the lion statues in front of the library do the talking.\n\n=== Clyde the Fog Spirit ===\n:''Voiced by [[John R. Dilworth]]\n'''Clyde the Fog Spirit''' appears in the [[computer animation|computer animated]] special [[List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Special|\"The Fog of Courage\"]] who comes to the farm to get the amulet that apparently belongs to the Fog Ghost's long lost love.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Courage The Cowardly Dog Characters, List Of}}\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television animation]]\n[[Category:Cartoon Network-related lists]]\n[[Category:Courage the Cowardly Dog|Characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1996]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1999]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2016}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Courage the Cowardly Dog'' characters}}\nThis is a list of characters from the [[Cartoon Network]] [[animated series]], ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]''.\n\n== Main characters ==\n\n=== Courage ===\n[[File:Courage-Dog.jpg|thumb|right|Courage|201x201px]]\n:''Voiced by [[Howard Hoffman]] (pilot) and [[Marty Grabstein]] (series)''<ref name=\"voicechasers\">{{cite web|title=Courage the Cowardly Dog (1999, Animated series)|url=http://voicechasers.com/database/showprod.php?prodid=669|publisher=Voicechasers|accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref>\n\n'''Courage''' is the [[title character]] and [[protagonist]] of the series. An overly frightened [[pink]] [[beagle]] [[dog]] who lives in Nowhere, [[Kansas]], Courage was abandoned as a [[puppy]] after his parents were sent into outer space,<ref name=\"Remembrance of Courage Past\">{{Cite episode|title=Remembrance of Courage Past|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=2002-11-22|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 4: 2002|season=4|number=13|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref> but was [[pet adoption|adopted]] by Muriel Bagge. Her husband Eustace [[cruelty to animals|regularly mistreats him]]. Ironically, given his name, Courage is a genuine coward and he often expresses his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks. Regardless, he still goes to great lengths to protect his owners. To the end, he often gets injured, sometimes quite brutally, and only surviving through his determination and/or pure luck. Despite his cowardice, Courage is very clever and resourceful when the situation demands it, outsmarting the villains most of the time. He also often displays super strength, carrying Muriel and Eustace with relative ease. Aiding him at saving the day is a self-aware, sarcastic and seemingly omniscient computer that he keeps in the attic. He got his name when Muriel found him as a puppy alone in an alley and remarked that he must be quite brave to be there by himself.<ref name=\"Remembrance of Courage Past\"/>\n\n=== Muriel Bagge===\n[[File:Muriel Bagge.jpg|thumb|right|Muriel Bagge|240x240px]]\n:''Voiced by [[Howard Hoffman]] (pilot) and [[Thea White]] (series)''\n\n'''Muriel Bagge''' is Courage's owner and Eustace's wife. She is an elderly, overweight, kind, hard-working Scottish woman who took Courage in when he was an abandoned puppy.<ref name=\"Remembrance of Courage Past\"/> Muriel often carries a rolling pin that she hits Eustace with whenever he harasses Courage. She also likes tea and usually tends to her garden, as well as being an accomplished [[sitar]] player. Muriel also has a great fondness for cooking; however, her recipes tend to include an excessive amount of [[vinegar]], much to the distaste of both her dog and husband. Most of all, she loves sitting in her rocking chair with Courage on her lap and watching television. Due to her kindness and sweet nature, Muriel is an easy (and often attractive) target for [[Villain of the week|villains]].\n\n=== Eustace Bagge===\n[[File:EustaceBagge.jpg|thumb|right|Eustace Bagge|211x211px]]\n:''Voiced by [[Howard Hoffman]] (pilot), [[Lionel Wilson (voice actor)|Lionel Wilson]] (Episodes 1\u201333),<ref name=\"voicechasers\"/> [[Arthur Anderson (actor)|Arthur Anderson]] (Episodes 34\u201352), and [[Wallace Shawn]] (The Fog of Courage)<ref name=\"voicechasers\"/>''\n\n'''Eustace Bagge''' is Muriel's husband. He is an elderly, skinny, jaded, disgruntled, cynical, and greedy farmer who is interested in money and obsessed with his truck. Eustace is also the current owner of the farmhouse, which was previously owned by his now-deceased brother Horst. Eustace regularly mistreats Courage out of jealousy and calls him a \"stupid dog\". Eustace wears glasses identical in appearance to Muriel's, and his brown hat shields his bald head. Eustace often refers to Courage simply as \"Dog\" and rarely addresses him by name. He regularly demeans Muriel as well; in one episode, Muriel develops [[amnesia]] and Eustace takes advantage of this by simply convincing her that she is a \"slave woman\", making her do all the chores and cooking around the house.<ref name=\"Dr. Le Quack, Amnesia specialist\">{{Cite episode|title=Dr. Le Quack, Amnesia Specialist|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=1999-11-19|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 1: 1999\u20132000|season=1|number=2|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref> Still, he does love his wife, as evidenced by his concern for her well-being in a few episodes. Eustace is commonly the subject of an unpleasant ending, whether it being a backfire of his [[get-rich-quick scheme]] or the villain of the episode going after him, or better yet, getting his comeuppance at the end, often in quite brutal or fatal ways.\n\n[[Lionel Wilson (voice actor)|Lionel Wilson]] originally voiced the character, but left midway through the third season (and eventually died five months after the show ended<ref>{{cite news|title=Lionel Wilson, Who Gave Voice To Tom Terrific, Is Dead at 79|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/24/arts/lionel-wilson-who-gave-voice-to-tom-terrific-is-dead-at-79.html|work=The New York Times|date=May 24, 2003|accessdate=2011-06-03}}</ref>) and was replaced by [[Arthur Anderson (actor)|Arthur Anderson]]. However, some vocals and sounds of grunting, laughing, screaming and catchphrases from Wilson have been used while Anderson was recording. In the 2014 short titled ''The Fog of Courage'', [[Wallace Shawn]] replaced Anderson as the voice of Eustace.\n\n== Supporting characters ==\n\n=== Computer ===\n:''Voiced by Simon Prebble (series) and Paul Schoeffler (The Fog of Courage)''\n\nCourage's computer that speaks with an English accent and gives him advice on how to deal with crazy situations. He is very cynical and sarcastic towards Courage and has a habit of regularly cracking jokes in any situation.\n\n=== Dr. Vindaloo ===\n:''Voiced by [[Paul Schoeffler]]''<ref name=voicechasers />\n'''Dr. Vindaloo''' is an [[Indian people|Indian]] doctor with a thick accent, whom Eustace and Muriel see when something is wrong. He is one of the few characters in the series who can perfectly understand what Courage is trying to say. He diagnoses his patients as not having serious problems or that there is nothing that he can do, but has, on occasion, been a great help, as in \"Invisible Muriel\", where he managed to discover how to return Muriel to normal.\n\n=== Ma Bagge ===\n:''Voiced by [[Billie Lou Watt]]<ref name=voicechasers />''\n'''Ma Bagge''' is the mother of Eustace and Horst and Muriel's mother-in-law, who shares a love-hate relationship with the farmer. She also lives in a trailer. She is also the widow of Icket Bagge. Like Eustace she is actually bald but wears a wig and looks almost identical to her son, but much shorter. Like Eustace, Ma is insecure due to being bald, but she does have her teeth. It is learned that Ma and Horst's ill treatment was part of Eustace's negative personality.\n\n=== Horst Bagge ===\n:''Voiced by [[Peter Fernandez]]''\n'''Horst Bagge''' is Eustace's deceased older brother and Muriel's brother-in-law, who was a [[hunter]]. The cause of his death is unknown. He was the former owner of the farmhouse as seen in a flashback in the episode \"Farmer Hunter, Farmer Hunted\".\n\n=== Professor Frith ===\n:''Voiced by [[Simon Prebble]]''\n'''Professor Frith''' is a man with a thick moustache and thick eyebrows who appears in several roles throughout the series.

They take pleasure in fighting each other (i.e. by firing artillery or dropping sixteen-ton weights), and are usually doing so while trying to solve an important problem.\n\n=== Nowhere Newsman ===\n:''Voiced by [[John R. Dilworth]]''\n'''Nowhere Newsman''' is a local TV news reporter. The Nowhere Newsman introduces every episode stating, \"We interrupt this program to bring you the ''Courage the Cowardly Dog'' show.\"<ref name=\"intro\">Opening intro of ''Courage the Cowardly Dog''. Cartoon Network.</ref> He is also seen in some episodes when the television is on, conveying news about the antagonist.\n\n=== Charlie the Mouse ===\n:''Voiced by Tom McKeon''\n'''Charlie''' is a delivery mouse and a personal friend of Courage's. He usually helps Courage out which would usually lead to the dialogue between one another. He is usually referred to as Mr. Mouse, but his first name is revealed as Charlie in the episode \"The Mask\". His interaction with Courage often end with Courage exclaiming \"Thanks, Mr. Mouse!\", to which he replies \"No prob.\"\n\n=== Shirley the Medium ===\n:''Voiced by [[Mary Testa]]''<ref name=\"voicechasers\"/>\n'''Shirley the Medium''' is a small [[green]] [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] garbed as a [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] [[Romani people|Gypsy]] [[Fortune-telling|fortune-teller]] with a [[Romania]]n accent who resides in a dilapidated [[Travel trailer|caravan]]. She has a strong dislike of Eustace (whom she always refers to as \"the stupid one\") because he is greedy and selfish and she places Eustace under curses a lot to get him to be a better person. Shirley is one of Courage's three confidants, the others being the Computer and Dr. Vindaloo, and helps him occasionally by casting and reciting spells and playing the [[saxophone]] in-between verses.\n\n== Major antagonists ==\n\n=== Katz === \n:''Voiced by [[Paul Schoeffler]]<ref name=\"voicechasers\"/>''\n\n'''Katz''' is a [[Catbert|red]], lanky [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[cat]] with a posh English accent. He is Courage's [[Archenemy|nemesis]] and the show's most recurring antagonist, though Muriel and Eustace consistently fail to recognize him. He specializes in scam businesses and is extremely sadistic. Many of his businesses involve torturing or outright killing his customers; for example, in \"Night at the Katz Motel,\" he fed his motel residents to flesh-eating spiders,<ref name=\"A Night at the Katz Motel\">{{Cite episode|title=A Night at the Katz Motel|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=1999-11-12|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 1: 1999\u20132000|season=1|number=1a|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref> and in \"Klub Katz,\" he transformed the vacationers into [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] machines to fight for him gladiator-style.<ref name=\"Klub Katz\">{{Cite episode|title=Klub Katz|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=2000-03-16|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 1: 1999\u20132000|season=1|number=11b|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref> All of his businesses enforce a strict \"No Dogs Allowed\" policy, forcing Courage to sneak in. He often challenges Courage to ironically banal games such as wall-ball and staring contests, which Courage invariably loses; nevertheless, he is always defeated in the end.\n\n=== Le Quack ===\n:''Voiced by [[Paul Schoeffler]]<ref name=\"voicechasers\"/>''\n\n'''Le Quack''' is a French [[Confidence trick|con-artist]] [[duck]], who first appears early in the show's first season, in which he has a fake amnesia-specialist license; he comes to the Bagges' house when Muriel suffers from [[amnesia]].<ref name=\"Dr. Le Quack, Amnesia specialist\" /> Since then, he frequently returns and manages to dupe Courage's owners into helping him commit crime sprees.<ref name=\"Dr. Le Quack, Amnesia specialist\" />\n\n=== The Chicken from Outer Space ===\n:''Voiced by [[Howard Hoffman]]''\n\n'''The Chicken from Outer Space''' is the show's first villain, introduced by the pilot episode of the same name. His eggs are mutagenic and whoever eats them will turn into one. In his first appearance he tries to take over the farm, he lays eggs in the chicken coop which were eaten by Eustace and ends up being shot by his own laser gun, turning into a headless roast chicken. He later returns in \"The Revenge of The Chicken from Outer Space\" where he wants to use a plunger to rip off Courage's head and put it on his roasted body. He ends up ripping off Eustace's head and tries to destroy Courage but is then blown up in his space ship when a rocket blasts into it. In \"Son of the Chicken from Outer Space\", his three-headed son is sent to Earth to avenge him and kill Courage. Unfortunately, like their father, they are no match for the timid dog and fear that they will never be able to go home until Courage is dead. Feeling sympathy for them, Courage helps them by taking fake pictures to make it look like they succeeded in killing him and fool their mother into thinking that their mission was a success.<ref name=\"The Chicken from Outer Space\">{{Cite episode|title=The Chicken from Outer Space|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=1996-02-18|number=0a|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Pilot (1996)|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref>\n\n=== Di Lung ===\n:''Voiced by Tim Chi Ly''\n\n'''Di Lung''' is a young [[Chinese American]] inventor. He also likes to verbally and physically abuse Courage whenever he sees him, and often does his experiments on him. He made his debut appearance in the episode \"Hothead\". He is very inconsiderate and rude and usually gets caught in the middle of the chaos happening in Nowhere, prompting him to shout his catchphrase of \"Watch where you're going, ya foo!\", which is a [[running gag]] in the series.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Hothead|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=1999-11-26|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 1: 1999\u20132000|season=1|number=3|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref> Di Lung has two aunts: one good and one bad, who are both the Empresses of China; thus, this could make him royalty.<ref name=\"Squatting Tiger, Hidden Dog\">{{Cite episode|title=Squatting Tiger, Hidden Dog|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=2002-10-25|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 4: 2002|season=4|number=8|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref> He is also the inventor of Mecha Courage.<ref name=\"Courage vs. Mecha-Courage\">{{Cite episode|title=Courage vs. Mecha-Courage|series=Courage the Cowardly Dog|airdate=2002-01-12|episodelink=List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes#Season 3: 2002|season=3|number=1|network=Cartoon Network}}</ref>\n\n=== The Snowman ===\n:''Voiced by [[Paul Schoeffler]]''\n\n'''The Snowman''' is a talking snowman believed to be the [[endangered species|last of his kind]] due to [[global warming]].

Courage manages to save Muriel from having hers removed. He is defeated when Courage causes him to fall into a frozen lake, making him the first \"frozen snowman\". However, he returns in \"The Snowman's Revenge\" where he turns the farmhouse into the West Pole and freezes Eustace and Muriel and tells Courage how he lost his home and friends. In the end, Courage fixes the North Pole and brings back the Snowman's friends and Ivana, his girlfriend, and is reunited with them.\n\n== Minor antagonists ==\n\n=== Benton Tarentella and Erroll Van Volkheim ===\n:''Voiced by [[Peter Fernandez]] (Benton) and [[Paul Schoeffler]] (Erroll)''\n'''Benton Tarentella''' (''a pun of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'') and '''Erroll Van Volkheim''' (''a pun of [[Erich Von Stroheim]] and [[Errol Flynn]]'') are a zombified duo of murderers/[[snuff film]] directors.
