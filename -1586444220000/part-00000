[[Ful medames]] (dish of cooked fava beans), one of Egypt's several national dishes, is typical. It is seasoned with salt and cumin, garnished with vegetable oil and optionally with [[tahini]], chopped parsley, chopped tomato, garlic, onion, lemon juice, chili pepper and often served topped with a boiled egg. It is scooped up and eaten with the staple whole wheat pita bread called ''Eish Masri'' or ''Eish Baladi'' ([[Egyptian Arabic]]: {{lang|arz|\u0639\u064a\u0634}} {{IPA-arz|\u0295e\u02d0\u0283|}}; [[Modern Standard Arabic]]: ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfay\u0161}}'') and usually accompanied by ''ta\u02bfamiya'' ({{lang-arz|\u0637\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0629}}) which is the local variant of [[falafel]] made with fava beans, fresh cut homemade [[French fries]] and various fresh or pickled vegetables (called [[torshi]]). Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy). Fried eggs with [[pastirma]] is also a common breakfast food in Egypt.\n\n=== Malawi ===\nFor breakfast, some children in Malawi eat porridge, [[cornbread]], savory [[fritter]]s, boiled starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, [[sweet potato]]es, or [[pumpkin]], and drink [[Sweet tea|sweet black tea]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html|title=What Kids Around the World Eat for Breakfast|last=Whitaker|first=Hannah|date=2014-10-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Morocco===\n[[File:Rghaif (detalle).jpg|thumb|right|[[Msemen]], a common breakfast in [[Moroccan cuisine]]]]\nFor breakfast, many Moroccans eat bread, harsha (semolina griddle cakes), or [[msemen]] (oiled pancakes) with olive oil, tea, and different kinds of Moroccan crepes.<ref name=\"fescooking.com\">{{cite web|url=http://fescooking.com/come-cook-with-us/the-art-of-moroccan-cuisine|title=The Art of Moroccan Cuisine \u2013 Cooking Classes in Morocco &#124; Fes Cooking and Cultural Tours|author=Special Events|date=18 July 2013|publisher=Fescooking.com|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\n[[Nigeria]] has over 250 different ethnic groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html|title=Africa :: Nigeria|publisher=cia.gov}}</ref> with a corresponding variety of cuisines.

Both of these cakes can be served with porridge and sugar known as ''koko''. For the south western [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] people (Il\u00e9 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1) one of the most common breakfasts is ''[[\u00d2g\u00ec]]''\u2014 a porridge made from corn, usually served with [[evaporated milk]]. \u00d2g\u00ec is eaten with ''[[Acaraj\u00e9]]'' (akara) or ''[[Moin Moin|Moi moi]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-25/food/fo-44786_1_nigerian-bean-cakes|title=Nigerian Bean Cakes Make a Hearty Breakfast|last=Dosti|first=Rose|date=25 February 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> Both are made from ground bean paste; akara is fried in oil, and moi moi is wrapped in leaves or foil and then steamed. \u00d2g\u00ec can also be steamed in leaves to harden it and eaten with akara or moi moi for breakfast.

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

Each dish is designed to be sampled and diners can go through a large selection of dim sum quickly accompanied by a generous amount of good tea. ''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular. In modern times, dim sum is commonly prepared and served in [[Yum cha|Yum Cha]] restaurants rather than at home because of the skill and efforts involved in the preparation.\n\n===Bangladesh===\nThe typical Bangladeshi breakfast consists of flour-based flat breads such as [[chapati]], [[roti]] or [[paratha]], served with a curry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Usually the curry can be vegetable, home-fried potatoes or scrambled eggs. The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

Frequently breakfast can be as simple as butter and jam on bread with tea. Iranians prefer to drink their hot black tea with sugar. Traditional cooked dishes for breakfast include [[haleem]] (wheat and chicken/lamb/turkey porridge eaten with cinnamon) or [[Khash (dish)|kale pache]] (sheep's feet, stomach, and other offal), adasi (green lentil soup), fried/boiled/soft-boiled eggs, ''omlet'' (eggs cooked in tomato sauce).\n\n===Israel===\n{{main|Israeli breakfast}}\n[[File:The 7 Breakfasts - Espresso Bar.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Israeli breakfast]]]]\nThe Israeli breakfast is a mix of culinary influences from eastern Europe, [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Yishuv]] culture, [[Maghreb cuisine|North African cuisine]], and [[Levantine cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonvoyageurs.com/2016/05/15/israeli-breakfast/|title=The Israeli breakfast \u2013 Best in the world!|last1=Gagnon|first1=Lynn|date=15 May 2016|website=BonVoyageurs|publisher=|access-date=19 May 2016}}</ref> It usually consists of a range of cheeses along with sliced vegetables, scrambled eggs (or another kind of fried egg)<ref name=\"Dubois\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GDy_1w83KEUC&pg=PA122&dq=%22Israeli+breakfast%22#v=onepage&q=%22Israeli%20breakfast%22&f=false|title=Cultures of the World: Israel|last=Dubois|first=Jill|last2=Rosh|first2=Mair|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|year=2004|isbn=9780761416692|location=[[Singapore]]|page=122|jfm=}}</ref><ref name=\"Marks\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&pg=PT563&dq=%22Israeli+breakfast%22|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|last=Marks|first=Gil|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year=2010|isbn=9780544186316|location=[[Boston]]|jfm=|authorlink=Gil Marks}}</ref> and bread, served with spreads like butter, jam, or honey.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

[[Indiana University Press]]. p. 331.</ref> Breakfast also often consists of open sandwiches. The sandwich is buttered (with margarine), with toppings such as [[prosciutto]] and yellow [[cheese]].\n\n===Albania===\nIn [[Albania]] the breakfast often consists of a scone, milk, tea, eggs, jam or cheese. Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]].

[[Whole-grain]] porridges with regular milk or butter are also eaten by some. More ample breakfasts may include fish, a diverse array of cheese, eggs, bacon, breads, and hot and cold cereals eaten in various combinations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pastries such as [[croissants]] or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' have become increasingly common since the 1990s.\n\n===Poland===\nThe traditional Polish breakfast is a large spread with a variety of sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals.

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast.

Hungarian breakfast is typically an [[open sandwich]] made with fresh bread or toast, butter, cheese or different cream cheeses, ''[[t\u00far\u00f3]]'' cheese or ''[[Liptauer|k\u00f6r\u00f6z\u00f6tt]]'' (Liptauer cheese spread), cold cuts such as ham, liver [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]] (called ''[[Braunschweiger (sausage)|m\u00e1jkr\u00e9m]]'', or ''[[Liverwurst|ken\u0151m\u00e1jas]]''), bacon, [[salami]], [[beef tongue]], [[mortadella]], ''[[Head cheese|diszn\u00f3sajt]]'' ([[head cheese]]), and different Hungarian sausages or [[kolb\u00e1sz]].<ref>Gundel's Hungarian Cookbook, Karoly Gundel, p. 34</ref> Eggs (fried, scrambled or boiled), [[French toast]] called ''bund\u00e1s keny\u00e9r'' and vegetables (such as peppers, bell peppers, tomatoes, radishes, scallions, and cucumber) may also form part of a Hungarian breakfast. Sometimes a simple breakfast will consist of a cup of milk, tea, or coffee taken with one or more pastries, bread rolls (including crescent-shaped [[kifli]]), toast, other pastries with different fillings (sweet and savory), butter, jam, or honey and a [[bun]] or a [[strudel]]<ref>J\u00f3zsef Venesz {{ISBN|963-13-0219-9}}: Corvina Press 1977.</ref> or cereal like [[muesli]], [[yogurt]], [[kefir]], and perhaps fruit.\n\n===Iceland===\nA typical Icelandic breakfast for children is oatmeal porridge.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Italy===\nThe traditional breakfast in [[Italy]] simply consists of a [[latte|caff\u00e8 latte]] (hot coffee with milk) with bread or rolls, butter and jam&nbsp;\u2013 known as ''prima colazione'' or just ''colazione''. ''Fette biscottate'' (a cookie-like hard bread often eaten with hazelnut chocolate spread or butter and jam) and [[biscuit|biscotti]] (cookies) are commonly eaten. Hot coffee may be sometimes replaced by hot tea, depending on personal taste. Children often drink hot chocolate, plain milk, hot milk with [[barley]] coffee, or hot milk with very little coffee. Cereals, yogurt, and fruit juices are also common. If breakfast is eaten in a ''bar'' (coffee shop), it is composed of ''cappuccino'' and ''cornetto'' (frothed hot milk with coffee and a pastry).<ref>The Silver Spoon {{ISBN|88-7212-223-6}}, 1997 ed.</ref>\n\n===Latvia===\nTypical Latvian breakfast usually consists of open sandwiches with toppings made of vegetables, fish, eggs, or cheese. As in Finland they are often buttered with margarine. Curd mixed with vegetables and salt as well as other sour milk products are very popular as well. Very often light oat porridge is eaten too.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">And the New Scandinavian Cuisine Marcus Samuelsson {{ISBN|0618109412}}</ref> In general light, sour, and salty tasting food is common for morning meal. Latvians usually drink coffee for breakfast.\n\n===Malta===\nOn the island of [[Malta]], breakfast integrates both [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine|continental]] elements. Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]]. Another type of sweet toppings are the chocolate toppings; the Dutch have chocolate toppings in all variations: ''[[hagelslag]]'' (chocolate sprinkles), ''[[Vlokken|chocoladevlokken]]'' (chocolate flakes) (both typically Dutch), and ''chocoladepasta ''([[chocolate spread]]).<ref name=\"wintle\">{{cite book|last=Wintle|first=Michael|editor=Thomas M.

On special occasions, such as Easter, Christmas, Mother's Day etc., breakfast is usually the same, but with a wider range of choices (i.e. premium cheeses, special ham, hot buns, croissants etc.).\n\nA 2012 opinion poll concluded that the Dutch believe that breakfast should be a more important meal than it is and that more time should be spent on it; almost three-quarters of those polled ate their sandwiches in less than fifteen minutes, and blame for an all-too quick breakfast was placed on \"fast\" breakfast products. A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg. The poll also concluded that men are more interested than women in having breakfast with their partner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nu.nl/lifestyle/2934751/nederland-wil-ontbijt-terug-kaart.html|title=Nederland wil ontbijt terug op de kaart|date=16 October 2012|publisher=[[Nu.nl]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Norway===\n80% of Norwegians eat breakfast (''frokost'') daily, mostly at home.

[[Whole-grain]] porridges with regular milk or butter are also eaten by some. More ample breakfasts may include fish, a diverse array of cheese, eggs, bacon, breads, and hot and cold cereals eaten in various combinations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pastries such as [[croissants]] or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' have become increasingly common since the 1990s.\n\n===Poland===\nThe traditional Polish breakfast is a large spread with a variety of sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. In recent years, Romanians have also started to serve cereal with dried fruits and milk instead of the traditional breakfast, though that is not yet very widespread.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stiripesurse.ro/micul-dejun-in-lume-unde-si-ce-se-mananca-dimineata_956272.html |location=Bucharest|work=\u0218tiri pe surse |title=Micul dejun \u00een lume - unde \u0219i ce se m\u0103n\u00e2nc\u0103 diminea\u021ba| date= 20 May 2015}}</ref> According to a 2014 study, 35% of Romanians eat cooked dishes such as omelet or fried eggs and 15% eat sandwiches.

In [[Madrid]], ''churros'' are somewhat smaller and shaped like a [[charity ribbon]].{{clarify|date=October 2015}} This meal is normally served in cafeter\u00edas but it is not a regular or usual breakfast at Madrid homes. The usual one is the same as in the rest of Spain: coffee with milk or [[Cola Cao]], orange juice, biscuits or toasts, with butter and jam.\n\nIn the North, East and West it is more common to have a cup of coffee (usually with milk) or [[Cola Cao]] and a toast with a choice of [[olive oil]] and salt, [[tomato]] and olive oil, [[butter]], jam, p\u00e2t\u00e9, ''[[jam\u00f3n serrano]]'' (cured ham), and other options like ''[[Sobrassada|sobrasada]]'' (a raw cured spiced sausage that is easy to spread),<ref>Unesco, [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00394 The Mediterranean diet]</ref> and in [[Andalucia]], ''[[pring\u00e1]]''. Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> \n\n==== Traditional ====\nThere are two different type of breakfasts: traditional and quick.

The root \"Ecles\", found in several village names, is an exception to this. A popular theory is that the word denoted the site of a building recognised by the Anglo-Saxons as a church and feature of the landscape.

The [[factory system]] was also introduced; in 1835, 1,124&nbsp;people were employed in cotton mills, and two mills used [[power loom]]s. Local hand-produced specialities included striped [[cotton]] ticks, checks, [[Nankeen]]s and Camrays. Two cotton mills are visible on the 1845 [[Ordnance Survey]] map of the area. The area also became renowned for its production of [[silk]], with two mills at Eccles and one at [[Patricroft]].

The foundry was completed the following year with a design based upon [[assembly line]] production. In 1839 Nasmyth invented the [[steam hammer]], which enabled the manufacture of forgings at a scale and speed not seen before. In the same year the foundry started to manufacture railway [[locomotive]]s, with&nbsp;109 built by 1853.

Two earlier Eccles mills had been destroyed by fire, resulting in significant local unemployment. Designed by Potts, Son and Hennings of Manchester, [[Bolton]] and [[Oldham]], it was opened in 1906. The imposing mill contained a multi-storey spinning mill, engine house and extensive weaving sheds.<ref name=\"GUSwarehouse\">{{Citation | title = Addition of the former GUS warehouse, Worsley Road, Eccles, to the council's list of buildings of local architectural or historic interest | url = http://services.salford.gov.uk/solar_documents/PLMB010408C.DOC | format = DOC | publisher = salford.gov.uk | accessdate = 16 February 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327154721/http://services.salford.gov.uk/solar_documents/PLMB010408C.DOC | archivedate = 27 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nEarly housing in the village consisted of groups of [[Thatching|thatched]] [[cottage]]s clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after the establishment of the [[local board of health]] new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply was a local [[Water well|well]]. During the latter half of the 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=102\u2013105}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] provided many local residents with jobs; 1,888&nbsp;people were employed on the section of the new canal at Barton.

Opinions as to the quality of the road were mainly negative; writing in 1795, [[John Aikin]] said \"Much Labour and a very great expense of money have been expended on the roads of this parish, but they still remain in a very indifferent state, and from one plain and obvious cause, the immoderate weights drawn in carts and waggons.\"<ref name=\"Johnstonpp7274\">{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=72\u201374.}}</ref>  On the poor quality roads, the Liverpool to Manchester [[stagecoach]] took almost an entire day to make the journey. Matters appear to have improved by the 19th century, along with the opening of several more trust roads throughout the parish. In the early part of the 19th century some existing routes were widened and straightened, including the modern-day Regent Road in Salford.  All the roads except one were surfaced with boulders.<ref name=\"Johnstonpp7274\"/> In 1832 a daily [[Bus|omnibus]] service from Manchester reached Eccles and Pendleton. In 1877, following the laying of tracks in the road, horse-drawn trams were used; these eventually gave way in 1902 to electric trams under the control of the Salford Corporation. Motorised buses were introduced in 1938.<ref name=\"Johnstonpp7274\"/>\n\n[[File:Eccles railway station greater manchester.png|left|thumb|[[Eccles railway station]]]]\n\nThe opening of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] on 15 September 1830 was a pivotal moment in transport history.

A demolition programme commenced in January 1967, with some residents re-housed in newly built housing stock. The council also had to arrange for the purchase of land at the interchange with the present-day [[M60 motorway|M60]], and to re-route part of the [[Thirlmere Aqueduct]].  Construction began on 8 December 1969, along a route limited by the existence of housing estates, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the M62 junction at Worsley, and the Bridgewater Canal. Consideration was given to the route of the disused Eccles-Tyldesley-Wigan railway line; the height of the motorway was lowered to accommodate a new railway bridge in case the line was ever re-instated.

One is that the \"Eccles\" place-name is derived from the [[Romano-British]] ''Ecles'' or ''Eglys'', itself derived from the Ancient Greek ''[[Christian Church|Ecclesia]]''.<ref name=\"Kenyonpp9596\">{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1991|pp=95\u201396.}}</ref>  Following the arrival in AD&nbsp;613 of the invading [[Anglo-Saxons]] at Lancashire, many existing British place-names, especially rivers and hills (the [[River Irwell]] for example), survived intact. The root \"Ecles\", found in several village names, is an exception to this. A popular theory is that the word denoted the site of a building recognised by the Anglo-Saxons as a church and feature of the landscape. Eccles appears to have been such a village, and ''Ecles'' may be the likely source of the modern name.<ref name=\"Johnstonpp14\">{{Harvnb|Johnston|1962|pp=1\u20134}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Gelling|Nicolaisen|Richards|1970|p=88.}}</ref>  In Kenyon's ''Origins of Lancashire'' (1991), however, the author suggests that this may not be the case as there is not an exact correlation between \"Eccles\" place-names and pre-''[[Domesday Book|Domesday]]'' [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]] in south Lancashire.<ref name=\"Kenyonpp9596\"/>\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nPre-historic finds in the parish of Eccles include [[Dugout (boat)|dugout boats]] found at [[Barton-upon-Irwell]], an [[Arrowhead (stone age)|arrowhead]], a [[spear]] and [[axe]]s at [[Winton, Greater Manchester|Winton]], which taken together appear to suggest the existence of a hunting and travelling society.

Opinions as to the quality of the road were mainly negative; writing in 1795, [[John Aikin]] said \"Much Labour and a very great expense of money have been expended on the roads of this parish, but they still remain in a very indifferent state, and from one plain and obvious cause, the immoderate weights drawn in carts and waggons.\"<ref name=\"Johnstonpp7274\">{{Harvnb|Johnston|1967|pp=72\u201374.}}</ref>  On the poor quality roads, the Liverpool to Manchester [[stagecoach]] took almost an entire day to make the journey. Matters appear to have improved by the 19th century, along with the opening of several more trust roads throughout the parish. In the early part of the 19th century some existing routes were widened and straightened, including the modern-day Regent Road in Salford.  All the roads except one were surfaced with boulders.<ref name=\"Johnstonpp7274\"/> In 1832 a daily [[Bus|omnibus]] service from Manchester reached Eccles and Pendleton. In 1877, following the laying of tracks in the road, horse-drawn trams were used; these eventually gave way in 1902 to electric trams under the control of the Salford Corporation. Motorised buses were introduced in 1938.<ref name=\"Johnstonpp7274\"/>\n\n[[File:Eccles railway station greater manchester.png|left|thumb|[[Eccles railway station]]]]\n\nThe opening of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] on 15 September 1830 was a pivotal moment in transport history.

The railway provided a link between Eccles (located on the existing Liverpool and Manchester line) and Wigan. In 1870 an additional branch line from this, the Roe Green Loopline, was opened to Bolton to support the surrounding collieries, the largest of which was at Mosley Common.<ref name=\"subbritmonton\"/> The London and North Western Railway also built a line from [[Patricroft railway station]] to [[Molyneux Junction]], via [[Clifton Hall Tunnel]] (built in 1849).<ref name=\"Collacott\">{{Harvnb|Collacott|1985|p=8.}}</ref>  The line connected with the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844\u20131859|East Lancashire Railway]] to [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester|Radcliffe]] and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]].

The Borough Council had previously formed the Eccles Borough Council's General Purposes Committee, which from December 1962 began to purchase land for the route of the new road, while overseeing a powerful public relations scheme. A demolition programme commenced in January 1967, with some residents re-housed in newly built housing stock. The council also had to arrange for the purchase of land at the interchange with the present-day [[M60 motorway|M60]], and to re-route part of the [[Thirlmere Aqueduct]].  Construction began on 8 December 1969, along a route limited by the existence of housing estates, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the M62 junction at Worsley, and the Bridgewater Canal. Consideration was given to the route of the disused Eccles-Tyldesley-Wigan railway line; the height of the motorway was lowered to accommodate a new railway bridge in case the line was ever re-instated.

Roman Catholics living in Eccles originally attended worship at a chapel on the de Trafford estate, south of the Irwell, however the chapel was demolished and replaced by All Saints' Church. The first Rector of the Roman Catholic Parish of Eccles parish was, from 1879, a Father Sharrocks. The first public Catholic procession in Eccles since the Reformation of the 1530s took place on 18 August 1889.<ref name=\"Rowbottom 2001 pp=11\u201313\"/>\n\nThe Grade II* listed St Andrew's church in St Andrew's Parish was built in the 1870s and opened in 1879 (the tower was added in 1889).

There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see [[list of scientific journals]]). Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' publish articles and [[scientific paper]]s across a wide range of scientific fields. Scientific journals contain articles that have been [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]]ed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Although scientific journals are superficially similar to haha [[professional]] [[magazine]]s, they are actually quite different. Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine. The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the [[scientific method]]. If they are describing experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results. Each such journal article becomes part of the permanent scientific record.\n\n==Scope==\nArticles in scientific journals can be used in research and higher education. Scientific articles allow researchers to keep up to date with the developments of their field and direct their own research. An essential part of a scientific article is citation of earlier work. The impact of articles and journals is often assessed by counting citations ([[citation impact]]). Some classes are partially devoted to the explication of classic articles, and [[seminar]] classes can consist of the presentation by each student of a classic or current paper. Schoolbooks and textbooks have been written usually only on established topics, while the latest research and more obscure topics are only accessible through scientific articles. In a scientific research group or [[academic department]] it is usual for the content of current scientific journals to be discussed in [[journal club]]s. Public funding bodies often require the results to be published in scientific journals. Academic credentials for promotion into academic ranks are established in large part by the number and impact of scientific articles published. Many doctoral programs allow for [[thesis by publication]], where the candidate is required to publish a certain number of scientific articles.\n\n==Wording==\nArticles tend to be highly technical, representing the latest theoretical research and experimental results in the field of science covered by the journal. They are often incomprehensible to anyone except for researchers in the field and advanced students. In some subjects this is inevitable given the nature of the content. Usually, rigorous rules of [[scientific writing]] are enforced by the editors; however, these rules may vary from journal to journal, especially between journals from different publishers. Articles are usually either original articles reporting completely new results or reviews of current literature. There are also scientific publications that bridge the gap between articles and books by publishing thematic volumes of chapters from different authors. Many journals have a regional focus, specializing in publishing papers from a particular geographic region, like ''[[African Invertebrates]]''.\n\n== History ==\nThe history of scientific journals dates from 1665, when the French ''[[Journal des s\u00e7avans]]'' and the English ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' first began systematically publishing research results. Over a thousand, mostly [[ephemeral]], were founded in the 18th century, and the number has increased rapidly after that.<ref>D. A. Kronick, ''History of Scientific and Technical Periodicals'', 2nd ed. Scarecrow, 1976</ref>\n\nPrior to mid-20th century, [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]] was not always necessary, but gradually it became essentially compulsory.\n\n== Publishing process ==\nThe authors of scientific articles are active researchers instead of journalists; typically, a graduate student or a researcher writes a paper with a professor. As such, the authors are unpaid and receive no compensation from the journal. However, their funding bodies may require them to publish in scientific journals. The paper is submitted to the journal office, where the '''editor''' considers the paper for appropriateness, potential scientific impact and novelty. If the journal's editor considers the paper appropriate, the paper is submitted to [[scholarly peer review]]. Depending on the field, journal and paper, the paper is sent to 1\u20133 '''reviewers''' for evaluation before they can be granted permission to publish. Reviewers are expected to check the paper for soundness of its scientific argument, i.e. if the data collected or considered in the paper support the conclusion offered. Novelty is also key: existing work must be appropriately considered and referenced, and new results improving on the state of the art presented. Reviewers are usually unpaid and not a part of the journal staff\u2014instead, they should be \"peers\", i.e. researchers in the same field as the paper in question.\n\n== Standards and impact ==\nThe standards that a journal uses to determine publication can vary widely. Some journals, such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[PNAS]]'', and ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', have a reputation of publishing articles that mark a fundamental breakthrough in their respective fields.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} In many fields, a formal or informal hierarchy of scientific journals exists; the most prestigious journal in a field tends to be the most selective in terms of the articles it will select for publication, and usually will also have the highest [[impact factor]]. In some countries, journal rankings can be utilized for funding decisions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/publication-forum/background|title=Background - julkaisufoorumi.fi|website=julkaisufoorumi.fi|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930090021/http://www.julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/publication-forum/background|archivedate=30 September 2017}}</ref> and even evaluation of individual researchers, although they are poorly suited for that purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/evaluations/faq|title=FAQ - julkaisufoorumi.fi|website=julkaisufoorumi.fi|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127065227/http://www.julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/evaluations/faq|archivedate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reproducibility and replicability ==\nFor scientific journals, [[reproducibility]] and [[replicability]] of the scientific results are core concepts that allow other scientists to check and reproduce the results under the same conditions described in the paper or at least similar conditions and produce similar results with similar [[measurements]] of the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] or carried out under changed conditions of measurement.\n\n==Types of articles==\n{{further information|Scientific paper}}\n{{see also|Academic publishing#Categories of papers{{!}}Categories of academic articles}}\n\n[[File:1665 phil trans vol i title.png|thumb|Cover of the first volume of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', the first journal in the world exclusively devoted to science]]\n\nThere are several types of journal articles; the exact terminology and definitions vary by field and specific journal, but often include:\n*'''Letters''' (also called ''communications'', and not to be confused with ''letters to the editor'') are short descriptions of important current research findings that are usually fast-tracked for immediate publication because they are considered urgent.\n*'''Research notes''' are short descriptions of current research findings that are considered less urgent or important than ''Letters''.\n*'''Articles''' are usually between five and twenty pages and are complete descriptions of current original research findings, but there are considerable variations between scientific fields and journals\u201480-page articles are not rare in [[mathematics]] or [[theoretical computer science]].\n*'''Supplemental articles''' contain a large volume of tabular [[data]] that is the result of current research and may be dozens or hundreds of pages with mostly numerical data. Some journals now only publish this data electronically on the Internet. Supplemental information also contains other voluminous material not appropriate for the main body of the article, like descriptions of routine procedures, derivations of equations, source code, non-essential data, spectra or other such miscellaneous information.\n*'''[[Review article]]s''' do not cover original research but rather accumulate the results of many different ''articles'' on a particular topic into a coherent narrative about the state of the art in that field. Review articles provide information about the topic and also provide journal references to the original research. Reviews may be entirely narrative, or may provide quantitative summary estimates resulting from the application of [[meta-analysis|meta-analytical methods]].\n*'''[[Data paper]]s''' are articles dedicated to describe datasets. This type of article is becoming popular and journals exclusively dedicated to them have been established, e.g. ''[[Scientific_Data_(journal)|Scientific Data]]'' and ''[[Earth_Observation|Earth System Science Data]]''.\n*'''[[Video paper]]s''' are a recent addition to practice of scientific publications.

Such articles begin with an ''[[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]'', which is a one-to-four-paragraph summary of the paper. The ''introduction'' describes the background for the research including a discussion of similar research. The ''materials and methods'' or ''experimental'' section provides specific details of how the research was conducted.

These may be quite expensive, sometimes much more than the cost for a print subscription, although this may reflect the number of people who will be using the license\u2014while a print subscription is the cost for one person to receive the journal; a site-license can allow thousands of people to gain access.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nPublications by [[scholarly societies]], also known as not-for-profit-publishers, usually cost less than commercial publishers, but the prices of their scientific journals are still usually several thousand dollars a year. In general, this money is used to fund the activities of the scientific societies that run such journals, or is invested in providing further scholarly resources for scientists; thus, the money remains in and benefits the scientific sphere.\n\nDespite the transition to electronic publishing, the [[serials crisis]] persists.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Harvard University says it can't afford journal publishers' prices |first=Ian |last=Sample |journal=The Guardian |date=24 April 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207164109/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices |archivedate=7 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\nConcerns about cost and open access have led to the creation of free-access journals such as the [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS) family and partly open or reduced-cost journals such as the ''[[Journal of High Energy Physics]]''. However, professional editors still have to be paid, and PLoS still relies heavily on donations from foundations to cover the majority of its operating costs; smaller journals do not often have access to such resources.\n\nBased on statistical arguments, it has been shown that electronic [[publishing]] online, and to some extent [[open access]], both provide wider dissemination and increase the average number of citations an article receives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ |title=Online Or Invisible? |authorlink=Steve Lawrence (computer scientist) |first=Steve |last=Lawrence |publisher=[[NEC Research Institute]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316145522/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ |archivedate=2007-03-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Copyright==\nTraditionally, the author of an article was required to transfer the [[copyright]] to the journal publisher. Publishers claimed this was necessary in order to protect authors' rights, and to coordinate permissions for reprints or other use. However, many authors, especially those active in the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement, found this unsatisfactory,<ref name=Di_Cosmo>{{Cite journal\n |issn        = 1684-5285\n |volume      = 7\n |issue       = 3\n |pages       = 41\u20138\n |last        = Di Cosmo\n |first       = Roberto\n |authorlink  = Roberto Di Cosmo\n |title       = The Role of Public Administrations in The ICT Era\n |journal     = UPGRADE: The European Journal for the Informatics Professional\n |date        = June 2006\n |url         = http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/full-III-06.pdf\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717185237/http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/full-III-06.pdf\n |archivedate = 2011-07-17\n}}</ref> and have used their influence to effect a gradual move towards a license to publish instead. Under such a system, the publisher has permission to edit, print, and distribute the article commercially, but the authors retain the other rights themselves.\n\nEven if they retain the copyright to an article, most journals allow certain rights to their authors. These rights usually include the ability to reuse parts of the paper in the author's future work, and allow the author to distribute a limited number of copies. In the print format, such copies are called reprints; in the electronic format, they are called [[postprints]]. Some publishers, for example the [[American Physical Society]], also grant the author the right to post and update the article on the author's or employer's website and on free e-print servers, to grant permission to others to use or reuse figures, and even to reprint the article as long as no fee is charged.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forms.aps.org/author/copyfaq.html |title=APS Copyright Policies and Frequently Asked Questions |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009083902/http://forms.aps.org/author/copyfaq.html |archivedate=2006-10-09 }}</ref> The rise of open access journals, in which the author retains the copyright but must pay a publication charge, such as the [[Public Library of Science]] family of journals, is another recent response to copyright concerns.<ref>[https://io9.gizmodo.com/5796054/is-it-time-to-end-copyright-for-scientific-journals Is it time to end copyright for scientific journals?] Gizmodo, 2011</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of scientific journals]]\n* [[Academic journal]]\n* [[Academic authorship]]\n* [[Academic conference]]\n* [[Citation index]]\n* [[Copyright policies of scientific publishers]]\n* [[Mega journal]]\n* [[Open access journal]]\n* [[Publish or perish]]\n* [[Scientific writing]]\n* [[San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* A.J.

There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see [[list of scientific journals]]). Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' publish articles and [[scientific paper]]s across a wide range of scientific fields. Scientific journals contain articles that have been [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]]ed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Although scientific journals are superficially similar to [[professional]] [[magazine]]s, they are actually quite different. Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine. The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the [[scientific method]]. If they are describing experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results. Each such journal article becomes part of the permanent scientific record.\n\n==Scope==\nArticles in scientific journals can be used in research and higher education. Scientific articles allow researchers to keep up to date with the developments of their field and direct their own research. An essential part of a scientific article is citation of earlier work. The impact of articles and journals is often assessed by counting citations ([[citation impact]]). Some classes are partially devoted to the explication of classic articles, and [[seminar]] classes can consist of the presentation by each student of a classic or current paper. Schoolbooks and textbooks have been written usually only on established topics, while the latest research and more obscure topics are only accessible through scientific articles. In a scientific research group or [[academic department]] it is usual for the content of current scientific journals to be discussed in [[journal club]]s. Public funding bodies often require the results to be published in scientific journals. Academic credentials for promotion into academic ranks are established in large part by the number and impact of scientific articles published. Many doctoral programs allow for [[thesis by publication]], where the candidate is required to publish a certain number of scientific articles.\n\n==Wording==\nArticles tend to be highly technical, representing the latest theoretical research and experimental results in the field of science covered by the journal. They are often incomprehensible to anyone except for researchers in the field and advanced students. In some subjects this is inevitable given the nature of the content. Usually, rigorous rules of [[scientific writing]] are enforced by the editors; however, these rules may vary from journal to journal, especially between journals from different publishers. Articles are usually either original articles reporting completely new results or reviews of current literature. There are also scientific publications that bridge the gap between articles and books by publishing thematic volumes of chapters from different authors. Many journals have a regional focus, specializing in publishing papers from a particular geographic region, like ''[[African Invertebrates]]''.\n\n== History ==\nThe history of scientific journals dates from 1665, when the French ''[[Journal des s\u00e7avans]]'' and the English ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' first began systematically publishing research results. Over a thousand, mostly [[ephemeral]], were founded in the 18th century, and the number has increased rapidly after that.<ref>D. A. Kronick, ''History of Scientific and Technical Periodicals'', 2nd ed. Scarecrow, 1976</ref>\n\nPrior to mid-20th century, [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]] was not always necessary, but gradually it became essentially compulsory.\n\n== Publishing process ==\nThe authors of scientific articles are active researchers instead of journalists; typically, a graduate student or a researcher writes a paper with a professor. As such, the authors are unpaid and receive no compensation from the journal. However, their funding bodies may require them to publish in scientific journals. The paper is submitted to the journal office, where the '''editor''' considers the paper for appropriateness, potential scientific impact and novelty. If the journal's editor considers the paper appropriate, the paper is submitted to [[scholarly peer review]]. Depending on the field, journal and paper, the paper is sent to 1\u20133 '''reviewers''' for evaluation before they can be granted permission to publish. Reviewers are expected to check the paper for soundness of its scientific argument, i.e. if the data collected or considered in the paper support the conclusion offered. Novelty is also key: existing work must be appropriately considered and referenced, and new results improving on the state of the art presented. Reviewers are usually unpaid and not a part of the journal staff\u2014instead, they should be \"peers\", i.e. researchers in the same field as the paper in question.\n\n== Standards and impact ==\nThe standards that a journal uses to determine publication can vary widely. Some journals, such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[PNAS]]'', and ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', have a reputation of publishing articles that mark a fundamental breakthrough in their respective fields.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} In many fields, a formal or informal hierarchy of scientific journals exists; the most prestigious journal in a field tends to be the most selective in terms of the articles it will select for publication, and usually will also have the highest [[impact factor]]. In some countries, journal rankings can be utilized for funding decisions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/publication-forum/background|title=Background - julkaisufoorumi.fi|website=julkaisufoorumi.fi|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930090021/http://www.julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/publication-forum/background|archivedate=30 September 2017}}</ref> and even evaluation of individual researchers, although they are poorly suited for that purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/evaluations/faq|title=FAQ - julkaisufoorumi.fi|website=julkaisufoorumi.fi|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127065227/http://www.julkaisufoorumi.fi/en/evaluations/faq|archivedate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reproducibility and replicability ==\nFor scientific journals, [[reproducibility]] and [[replicability]] of the scientific results are core concepts that allow other scientists to check and reproduce the results under the same conditions described in the paper or at least similar conditions and produce similar results with similar [[measurements]] of the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] or carried out under changed conditions of measurement.\n\n==Types of articles==\n{{further information|Scientific paper}}\n{{see also|Academic publishing#Categories of papers{{!}}Categories of academic articles}}\n\n[[File:1665 phil trans vol i title.png|thumb|Cover of the first volume of the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', the first journal in the world exclusively devoted to science]]\n\nThere are several types of journal articles; the exact terminology and definitions vary by field and specific journal, but often include:\n*'''Letters''' (also called ''communications'', and not to be confused with ''letters to the editor'') are short descriptions of important current research findings that are usually fast-tracked for immediate publication because they are considered urgent.\n*'''Research notes''' are short descriptions of current research findings that are considered less urgent or important than ''Letters''.\n*'''Articles''' are usually between five and twenty pages and are complete descriptions of current original research findings, but there are considerable variations between scientific fields and journals\u201480-page articles are not rare in [[mathematics]] or [[theoretical computer science]].\n*'''Supplemental articles''' contain a large volume of tabular [[data]] that is the result of current research and may be dozens or hundreds of pages with mostly numerical data. Some journals now only publish this data electronically on the Internet. Supplemental information also contains other voluminous material not appropriate for the main body of the article, like descriptions of routine procedures, derivations of equations, source code, non-essential data, spectra or other such miscellaneous information.\n*'''[[Review article]]s''' do not cover original research but rather accumulate the results of many different ''articles'' on a particular topic into a coherent narrative about the state of the art in that field. Review articles provide information about the topic and also provide journal references to the original research. Reviews may be entirely narrative, or may provide quantitative summary estimates resulting from the application of [[meta-analysis|meta-analytical methods]].\n*'''[[Data paper]]s''' are articles dedicated to describe datasets. This type of article is becoming popular and journals exclusively dedicated to them have been established, e.g. ''[[Scientific_Data_(journal)|Scientific Data]]'' and ''[[Earth_Observation|Earth System Science Data]]''.\n*'''[[Video paper]]s''' are a recent addition to practice of scientific publications.

Such articles begin with an ''[[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]'', which is a one-to-four-paragraph summary of the paper. The ''introduction'' describes the background for the research including a discussion of similar research. The ''materials and methods'' or ''experimental'' section provides specific details of how the research was conducted. The ''results and discussion'' section describes the outcome and implications of the research, and the ''conclusion'' section places the research in context and describes avenues for further exploration.\n\nIn addition to the above, some scientific journals such as ''Science'' will include a news section where scientific developments (often involving political issues) are described.

Almost all such articles are eventually published in traditional journals, which still provide an important role in [[quality control]], archiving papers, and establishing scientific credit.\n\n==Cost==\n{{main article|Academic publishing#Publishers and business aspects}}\n{{see also|Academic journal#Costs}}\n\nMany scientists and librarians have long protested the cost of journals, especially as they see these payments going to large for-profit publishing houses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmm-online.com/channel/elsevier-begins-outreach-as-push-back-on-publisher-threatens-to-widen/article/225855/|title=Elsevier begins outreach as push-back on publisher threatens to widen|last=Weinstein|first=Deborah|date=1 Feb 2012|website=MM&M|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215023645/https://www.mmm-online.com/channel/elsevier-begins-outreach-as-push-back-on-publisher-threatens-to-widen/article/225855/|archivedate=2018-02-15}}</ref> To allow their researchers online access to journals, many universities purchase ''site licenses'', permitting access from anywhere in the university, and, with appropriate authorization, by university-affiliated users at home or elsewhere. These may be quite expensive, sometimes much more than the cost for a print subscription, although this may reflect the number of people who will be using the license\u2014while a print subscription is the cost for one person to receive the journal; a site-license can allow thousands of people to gain access.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nPublications by [[scholarly societies]], also known as not-for-profit-publishers, usually cost less than commercial publishers, but the prices of their scientific journals are still usually several thousand dollars a year. In general, this money is used to fund the activities of the scientific societies that run such journals, or is invested in providing further scholarly resources for scientists; thus, the money remains in and benefits the scientific sphere.\n\nDespite the transition to electronic publishing, the [[serials crisis]] persists.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Harvard University says it can't afford journal publishers' prices |first=Ian |last=Sample |journal=The Guardian |date=24 April 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207164109/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices |archivedate=7 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\nConcerns about cost and open access have led to the creation of free-access journals such as the [[Public Library of Science]] (PLoS) family and partly open or reduced-cost journals such as the ''[[Journal of High Energy Physics]]''. However, professional editors still have to be paid, and PLoS still relies heavily on donations from foundations to cover the majority of its operating costs; smaller journals do not often have access to such resources.\n\nBased on statistical arguments, it has been shown that electronic [[publishing]] online, and to some extent [[open access]], both provide wider dissemination and increase the average number of citations an article receives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ |title=Online Or Invisible? |authorlink=Steve Lawrence (computer scientist) |first=Steve |last=Lawrence |publisher=[[NEC Research Institute]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316145522/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/online-nature01/ |archivedate=2007-03-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Copyright==\nTraditionally, the author of an article was required to transfer the [[copyright]] to the journal publisher. Publishers claimed this was necessary in order to protect authors' rights, and to coordinate permissions for reprints or other use. However, many authors, especially those active in the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement, found this unsatisfactory,<ref name=Di_Cosmo>{{Cite journal\n |issn        = 1684-5285\n |volume      = 7\n |issue       = 3\n |pages       = 41\u20138\n |last        = Di Cosmo\n |first       = Roberto\n |authorlink  = Roberto Di Cosmo\n |title       = The Role of Public Administrations in The ICT Era\n |journal     = UPGRADE: The European Journal for the Informatics Professional\n |date        = June 2006\n |url         = http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/full-III-06.pdf\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717185237/http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/full-III-06.pdf\n |archivedate = 2011-07-17\n}}</ref> and have used their influence to effect a gradual move towards a license to publish instead. Under such a system, the publisher has permission to edit, print, and distribute the article commercially, but the authors retain the other rights themselves.\n\nEven if they retain the copyright to an article, most journals allow certain rights to their authors. These rights usually include the ability to reuse parts of the paper in the author's future work, and allow the author to distribute a limited number of copies. In the print format, such copies are called reprints; in the electronic format, they are called [[postprints]]. Some publishers, for example the [[American Physical Society]], also grant the author the right to post and update the article on the author's or employer's website and on free e-print servers, to grant permission to others to use or reuse figures, and even to reprint the article as long as no fee is charged.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forms.aps.org/author/copyfaq.html |title=APS Copyright Policies and Frequently Asked Questions |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009083902/http://forms.aps.org/author/copyfaq.html |archivedate=2006-10-09 }}</ref> The rise of open access journals, in which the author retains the copyright but must pay a publication charge, such as the [[Public Library of Science]] family of journals, is another recent response to copyright concerns.<ref>[https://io9.gizmodo.com/5796054/is-it-time-to-end-copyright-for-scientific-journals Is it time to end copyright for scientific journals?] Gizmodo, 2011</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of scientific journals]]\n* [[Academic journal]]\n* [[Academic authorship]]\n* [[Academic conference]]\n* [[Citation index]]\n* [[Copyright policies of scientific publishers]]\n* [[Mega journal]]\n* [[Open access journal]]\n* [[Publish or perish]]\n* [[Scientific writing]]\n* [[San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* A.J.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory.

In addition to majors, Kellogg offers \"pathways\" to students who want to build expertise in certain industries. These include data analytics, entrepreneurship, growth and scaling, healthcare, real estate, social impact, and venture capital & private equity.\n\n====One-year MBA====\nKellogg offers a one-year MBA program for students who have already completed a specified list of prerequisite courses, including undergraduate-level financial accounting, statistics, finance, economics, marketing, and operations. The one-year program began in 1965 and has more than 3,500 graduates around the world. Program graduates include [[Robert Eckert]] '77, former chairman and CEO, [[Mattel]]; Richard Lenny '77, former chairman and CEO, the [[The Hershey Company|Hershey Company]]; and [[Thomas J.

Within the E&W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.\n\n====MMM====\nGraduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the [[Segal Design Institute]] at the [[Robert R.

Since then, more than 950 Kellogg Ph.D. alumni have gone on to positions within academia and business. Seven programs of study are offered: Accounting Information and Management, Finance, Management and Organizations, Management and Organizations and Sociology, Managerial Economics and Strategy, Marketing, and Operations Management.

The exchange partner schools offer the chance to learn about business from a different perspective, experience another culture, and network with students, faculty, and professionals from around the world. The International Exchange Program at the Kellogg School was started in 1980 with a vision to promote a cultural interchange of ideas and provide a greater understanding of cross-cultural trade and business practices. Since that time, more than 1,000 Kellogg School students have participated in the exchange program with schools from over 20 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Thailand, and U.K.\n\nBeginning in 1996, Kellogg established joint Executive MBA programs with the Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel; WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China; the School of Business and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; INSEAD campuses in France and Singapore; and the Schulich School of Management at York University in Toronto.\n\nThe Kellogg EMBA program offers students the opportunity to complete an elective course during Live-In Week at one of the Kellogg School's Global Partner Institutions in Tel Aviv, Israel; Vallendar, Germany; Toronto, Canada; or Hong Kong.\n\nKellogg offers joint executive MBA degree programs with\u2014and grant Kellogg degrees to\u2014these schools:\n\n*School of Business and Management at [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] in Hong Kong\n*Recanati Graduate School of Management at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]]\n*[[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management]] in Germany\n*[[Schulich School of Business]] at [[York University]] in Toronto, Canada\n*[[Guanghua School of Management]] at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guanghua.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|title=Guanghua \u2013 Kellogg}}</ref>\n\n=== Student profile ===\n46% of the students in Kellogg's full-time MBA program for the Class of 2020 are women.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

Kellogg Graduate School of Management.'' The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory. Even before the Kellogg gift, the school had been expanding its research-focused faculty: In 1978 alone, the school added six additional \"named\" professorships and two new research professorships.<ref name=\"Cent\"/>\n\nIn 2001, in an effort to improve the school's image, its name was shortened to the ''Kellogg School of Management''.<ref name=\"Cent\">{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home|access-date=February 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111051745/http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|archive-date=January 11, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history (2009 - today) ===\nIn June 2009, Kellogg announced that [[Dipak C.

In addition to majors, Kellogg offers \"pathways\" to students who want to build expertise in certain industries. These include data analytics, entrepreneurship, growth and scaling, healthcare, real estate, social impact, and venture capital & private equity.\n\n====One-year MBA====\nKellogg offers a one-year MBA program for students who have already completed a specified list of prerequisite courses, including undergraduate-level financial accounting, statistics, finance, economics, marketing, and operations. The one-year program began in 1965 and has more than 3,500 graduates around the world.

Within the E&W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.\n\n====MMM====\nGraduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the [[Segal Design Institute]] at the [[Robert R.

Since then, more than 950 Kellogg Ph.D. alumni have gone on to positions within academia and business. Seven programs of study are offered: Accounting Information and Management, Finance, Management and Organizations, Management and Organizations and Sociology, Managerial Economics and Strategy, Marketing, and Operations Management. The program is full-time on the Evanston campus. Students typically graduate in five years.\n\n====Kellogg Asset Management Practicum====\nStudents declaring a finance major may choose to follow the asset management track, a special set of courses offered by the Kellogg finance department. At the core of the asset management track is a yearlong experiential learning course sequence, the Asset Management Practicum (FINC 933, 934, 935, and 936). In the practicum \u2013 a for-credit course with limited enrollment \u2013 students manage a portfolio under the guidance of faculty from the finance and accounting departments.

The exchange partner schools offer the chance to learn about business from a different perspective, experience another culture, and network with students, faculty, and professionals from around the world. The International Exchange Program at the Kellogg School was started in 1980 with a vision to promote a cultural interchange of ideas and provide a greater understanding of cross-cultural trade and business practices. Since that time, more than 1,000 Kellogg School students have participated in the exchange program with schools from over 20 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Thailand, and U.K.\n\nBeginning in 1996, Kellogg established joint Executive MBA programs with the Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel; WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China; the School of Business and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; INSEAD campuses in France and Singapore; and the Schulich School of Management at York University in Toronto.\n\nThe Kellogg EMBA program offers students the opportunity to complete an elective course during Live-In Week at one of the Kellogg School's Global Partner Institutions in Tel Aviv, Israel; Vallendar, Germany; Toronto, Canada; or Hong Kong.\n\nKellogg offers joint executive MBA degree programs with\u2014and grant Kellogg degrees to\u2014these schools:\n\n*School of Business and Management at [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] in Hong Kong\n*Recanati Graduate School of Management at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]]\n*[[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management]] in Germany\n*[[Schulich School of Business]] at [[York University]] in Toronto, Canada\n*[[Guanghua School of Management]] at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guanghua.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|title=Guanghua \u2013 Kellogg}}</ref>\n\n=== Student profile ===\n46% of the students in Kellogg's full-time MBA program for the Class of 2020 are women.

The park district was established in 1935 through the initiative of members of the League of Women Voters, to address the need for a public swimming pool in the community. The City of DeKalb gave the first four parks to the District: Annie's Woods, Huntley Park, Liberty Park, and Hopkins Park. By 1960, the district had eight parks and by 1970 twelve. Initially the main services provided focused on swimming and use of the outdoor parks. But as lifestyles changed, so did the district.\n\nIn the mid 1960s, the City gave the Ellwood House mansion to the district. In 1970, the park district hired its first full-time executive director and by 1980, the district had a pool, acquired Haish Gymnasium and Buena Vista, a nine-hole golf course. In 1985, the park district purchased River Heights, a second nine-hole golf course, which was later developed into an 18-hole course.\n\nNew parks were acquired as conservation areas in order to preserve floodplain lands and wildlife habitat. Other parks were established as community-wide active recreation facilities designed to serve all types of recreational uses. In addition to this system of parks the district established the Kishwaukee Kiwanis pathway system totaling over 8 miles in length, connecting DeKalb with Sycamore and the Great Western Trail to the east.\n\nIn 2000 the district opened the Sports and Recreation Center, a multi-function facility that features in indoor field of over 1 acre, clear-span space with synthetic field turf. The park district provides year-round athletic and recreation programs including day camps, youth baseball and softball, adult softball leagues both indoors and outdoors, swimming lessons, golf lessons, karate, tennis, adult and youth basketball leagues, indoor soccer, fitness classes, and preschool.\n\nToday the DeKalb Park District park system includes 44 parks totaling over 700 acres: community parks, neighborhood parks, passive parks and linear parks. Notable parks and facilities include:\n*River Heights Golf Course\n*Buena Vista Golf Course\n*Hopkins Park Pool and Community Center\n*Nehring Center for Culture and Tourism\n*[[Ellwood House]] Museum and Park\n\n==Government==\nDeKalb is governed by a [[Council-Manager government]].  Policy is developed by an elected [[City Council]] then implemented by an appointed professional City Manager. DeKalb's City Council is made up of a [[Mayor]], elected at-large, and seven alderpersons, elected by ward. Each serves a four-year term, with half the council being elected every two years. A City Clerk is also elected every four years who serves as the official record keeper of the city.  City council meetings are held the second and fourth Mondays of every month.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Council Position'''\n|'''Name of Member'''\n|-\n|Mayor\n|Jerry Smith\n\n|-\n|First Ward\n|Carolyn Morris\n|-\n|Second Ward\n|Bill Finucane\n|-\n|Third Ward\n|Tracy Smith\n\n|-\n|Fourth Ward\n|Patrick Fagan\n|-\n|Fifth Ward\n|Scott McAdams\n|-\n|Sixth Ward\n|Mike Verbic\n|-\n|Seventh Ward\n|Anthony Faivre\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Source: City of Dekalb Website<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofdekalb.com/333/City-Council|title=City Council {{!}} DeKalb, IL|website=www.cityofdekalb.com|language=en|access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Education==\nThere are 11 public schools, one private school, one university and one public library.{{cite web |url=http://mywikicity.com/wiki/index.php?title=DeKalb |title=DeKalb |website=mywikicity.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306105726/http://mywikicity.com/wiki/index.php?title=DeKalb |archivedate=March 6, 2008 |accessdate=December 8, 2016 }}\n\n===Northern Illinois University===\n[[Image:Altgeld Hall-1st bldg on campus ever.JPG|thumb|left|Altgeld Hall, the first building to be constructed at NIU]]\n\n[[Northern Illinois University]] (NIU) was founded in DeKalb as the Northern Illinois State Normal School in 1895.

The population was 43,862 according to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 39,018 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The city is named after decorated [[Franconia]]n-French war hero [[Johann de Kalb]], who died during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nFounded in 1856, DeKalb became important in the development and manufacture of [[barbed wire]], especially for agriculture and raising livestock.  While agricultural related industries remain a facet of the city, together with health and services, the city's largest employer in the 21st century is [[Northern Illinois University]] founded in DeKalb in 1895.  Located about 50 miles from Chicago, the city is part of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].\n\n==History==\nDeKalb was originally called Huntley's Grove,<ref name=\"cityofdekalb.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofdekalb.com/854/History-of-DeKalb|title=History of DeKalb - DeKalb, IL|website=www.cityofdekalb.com}}</ref> and under the latter name was [[plat]]ted in 1853.<ref>{{cite book|last=Callary|first=Edward|title=Place Names of Illinois|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvHgwa-XImcC&pg=PA90|date=September 29, 2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-09070-7|page=90}}</ref> The name is for Baron Johann de Kalb, a major general in the American Revolutionary War.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA63|year=1908|page=63}}</ref> A post office has been in operation at DeKalb since 1849.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postalhistory.com/postoffices.asp?task=display&state=IL&county=DeKalb|title=DeKalb County|publisher=Jim Forte Postal History|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}</ref> \nThe development of barbed wire is key in the history of DeKalb. Joseph Glidden, who developed barbed wire, was a historic citizen of DeKalb. Glidden would ultimately be known as the \u201cFather of Barbed Wire\u201d. Glidden began to mass-produce his invention, and eventually sold half of the company to Isaac L. Ellwood. Together, the two formed the Barb Fence Company.<ref name=\"cityofdekalb.com\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nThe city of DeKalb is in northern Illinois, United States, roughly 55 miles west of downtown Chicago and roughly 30 miles southeast of Rockford, IL.

The park district was established in 1935 through the initiative of members of the League of Women Voters, to address the need for a public swimming pool in the community. The City of DeKalb gave the first four parks to the District: Annie's Woods, Huntley Park, Liberty Park, and Hopkins Park. By 1960, the district had eight parks and by 1970 twelve. Initially the main services provided focused on swimming and use of the outdoor parks. But as lifestyles changed, so did the district.\n\nIn the mid 1960s, the City gave the Ellwood House mansion to the district. In 1970, the park district hired its first full-time executive director and by 1980, the district had a pool, acquired Haish Gymnasium and Buena Vista, a nine-hole golf course. In 1985, the park district purchased River Heights, a second nine-hole golf course, which was later developed into an 18-hole course.\n\nNew parks were acquired as conservation areas in order to preserve floodplain lands and wildlife habitat. Other parks were established as community-wide active recreation facilities designed to serve all types of recreational uses. In addition to this system of parks the district established the Kishwaukee Kiwanis pathway system totaling over 8 miles in length, connecting DeKalb with Sycamore and the Great Western Trail to the east.\n\nIn 2000 the district opened the Sports and Recreation Center, a multi-function facility that features in indoor field of over 1 acre, clear-span space with synthetic field turf. The park district provides year-round athletic and recreation programs including day camps, youth baseball and softball, adult softball leagues both indoors and outdoors, swimming lessons, golf lessons, karate, tennis, adult and youth basketball leagues, indoor soccer, fitness classes, and preschool.\n\nToday the DeKalb Park District park system includes 44 parks totaling over 700 acres: community parks, neighborhood parks, passive parks and linear parks. Notable parks and facilities include:\n*River Heights Golf Course\n*Buena Vista Golf Course\n*Hopkins Park Pool and Community Center\n*Nehring Center for Culture and Tourism\n*[[Ellwood House]] Museum and Park\n\n==Government==\nDeKalb is governed by a [[Council-Manager government]].  Policy is developed by an elected [[City Council]] then implemented by an appointed professional City Manager. DeKalb's City Council is made up of a [[Mayor]], elected at-large, and seven alderpersons, elected by ward. Each serves a four-year term, with half the council being elected every two years.

suspended public and private school classes for the week of March 16, as well as all large-scale public gatherings.\n\nOn March 15, 2020, at approximately 8pm AST, Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes announced that there would be a lockdown on all inbound international travel commencing at midnight of March 16, 2020 and ending on March 31, 2020. An exception to this inbound travel lockdown would be granted to Aruba residents. A travel advisory would also be instituted for residents, advising against outbound travel at this time. To this date Aruba had two confirmed Corona Virus cases. It is important to note that this lockdown does not apply to outbound travel for international travelers currently in Aruba \u2013 they will be able to take their return flight home.\n\nOn March 16 to 17th the 3rd case of the coronavirus was reported, a doctor who recently travelled to New York for her vacation. She did not show any symptoms, but was tested, and the results of the test showed she was positive for the virus.\n\nMarch 17, 2020 \u2013 Fourth case of coronavirus announced. Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes has just announced a fourth case of COVID-19 coronavirus in Aruba. The person who tested positive for the coronavirus is a tourist.\n\nMarch 20, 2020 \u2013 Fifth case of coronavirus announced. The patient is an employee of the airport, who arrived back from New York, where he was on vacation. This was discovered a day after there was public protest over the lack of measures on the airport to protect employees against contagion.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=24 luchthavenmedewerkers uit voorzorg in quarantaine|date=March 20, 2020|work=Amigoe Aruba|access-date=|url-status=live|publisher=Amigoe}}</ref>\n\nMarch 21, 2020 \u2013 Three more cases have been announced, bringing the total to eight. It concerns two people from outside of Aruba (one from [[New York City|New York]] and one from [[Miami]]).

Several cases are employees of Respaldo, the mental health institute of Aruba, which is situated close to the hospital. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitaruba.com/news/general/corona-virus-and-travel-to-aruba/|title=Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Travel to Aruba {{!}} VisitAruba News|date=2020-03-26|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nMarch 27, 2020 \u2013 Five new cases on this day are reported, bringing the island to 33 cases.

An exception to this inbound travel lockdown would be granted to Aruba residents. A travel advisory would also be instituted for residents, advising against outbound travel at this time. To this date Aruba had two confirmed Corona Virus cases. It is important to note that this lockdown does not apply to outbound travel for international travelers currently in Aruba \u2013 they will be able to take their return flight home.\n\nOn March 16 to 17th the 3rd case of the coronavirus was reported, a doctor who recently travelled to New York for her vacation. She did not show any symptoms, but was tested, and the results of the test showed she was positive for the virus.\n\nMarch 17, 2020 \u2013 Fourth case of coronavirus announced. Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes has just announced a fourth case of COVID-19 coronavirus in Aruba. The person who tested positive for the coronavirus is a tourist.\n\nMarch 20, 2020 \u2013 Fifth case of coronavirus announced. The patient is an employee of the airport, who arrived back from New York, where he was on vacation. This was discovered a day after there was public protest over the lack of measures on the airport to protect employees against contagion.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=24 luchthavenmedewerkers uit voorzorg in quarantaine|date=March 20, 2020|work=Amigoe Aruba|access-date=|url-status=live|publisher=Amigoe}}</ref>\n\nMarch 21, 2020 \u2013 Three more cases have been announced, bringing the total to eight.

The park district was established in 1935 through the initiative of members of the League of Women Voters, to address the need for a public swimming pool in the community. The City of DeKalb gave the first four parks to the District: Annie's Woods, Huntley Park, Liberty Park, and Hopkins Park. By 1960, the district had eight parks and by 1970 twelve. Initially the main services provided focused on swimming and use of the outdoor parks. But as lifestyles changed, so did the district.\n\nIn the mid 1960s, the City gave the Ellwood House mansion to the district. In 1970, the park district hired its first full-time executive director and by 1980, the district had a pool, acquired Haish Gymnasium and Buena Vista, a nine-hole golf course. In 1985, the park district purchased River Heights, a second nine-hole golf course, which was later developed into an 18-hole course.\n\nNew parks were acquired as conservation areas in order to preserve floodplain lands and wildlife habitat. Other parks were established as community-wide active recreation facilities designed to serve all types of recreational uses. In addition to this system of parks the district established the Kishwaukee Kiwanis pathway system totaling over 8 miles in length, connecting DeKalb with Sycamore and the Great Western Trail to the east.\n\nIn 2000 the district opened the Sports and Recreation Center, a multi-function facility that features in indoor field of over 1 acre, clear-span space with synthetic field turf. The park district provides year-round athletic and recreation programs including day camps, youth baseball and softball, adult softball leagues both indoors and outdoors, swimming lessons, golf lessons, karate, tennis, adult and youth basketball leagues, indoor soccer, fitness classes, and preschool.\n\nToday the DeKalb Park District park system includes 44 parks totaling over 700 acres: community parks, neighborhood parks, passive parks and linear parks. Notable parks and facilities include:\n*River Heights Golf Course\n*Buena Vista Golf Course\n*Hopkins Park Pool and Community Center\n*Nehring Center for Culture and Tourism\n*[[Ellwood House]] Museum and Park\n\n==Government==\nDeKalb is governed by a [[Council-Manager government]].  Policy is developed by an elected [[City Council]] then implemented by an appointed professional City Manager. DeKalb's City Council is made up of a [[Mayor]], elected at-large, and seven alderpersons, elected by ward. Each serves a four-year term, with half the council being elected every two years. A City Clerk is also elected every four years who serves as the official record keeper of the city.  City council meetings are held the second and fourth Mondays of every month.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Council Position'''\n|'''Name of Member'''\n|-\n|Mayor\n|Jerry Smith\n\n|-\n|First Ward\n|Carolyn Morris\n|-\n|Second Ward\n|Bill Finucane\n|-\n|Third Ward\n|Tracy Smith\n\n|-\n|Fourth Ward\n|Patrick Fagan\n|-\n|Fifth Ward\n|Scott McAdams\n|-\n|Sixth Ward\n|Mike Verbic\n|-\n|Seventh Ward\n|Anthony Faivre\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Source: City of Dekalb Website<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofdekalb.com/333/City-Council|title=City Council {{!}} DeKalb, IL|website=www.cityofdekalb.com|language=en|access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Education==\nThere are 11 public schools, one private school, one university and one public library.{{cite web |url=http://mywikicity.com/wiki/index.php?title=DeKalb |title=DeKalb |website=mywikicity.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306105726/http://mywikicity.com/wiki/index.php?title=DeKalb |archivedate=March 6, 2008 |accessdate=December 8, 2016 }}\n\n===Northern Illinois University===\n[[Image:Altgeld Hall-1st bldg on campus ever.JPG|thumb|left|Altgeld Hall, the first building to be constructed at NIU]]\n\n[[Northern Illinois University]] (NIU) was founded in DeKalb as the Northern Illinois State Normal School in 1895.

The population was 43,862 according to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 39,018 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The city is named after decorated [[Franconia]]n-French war hero [[Johann de Kalb]], who died during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nFounded in 1856, DeKalb became important in the development and manufacture of [[barbed wire]], especially for agriculture and raising livestock.  While agricultural related industries remain a facet of the city, together with health and services, the city's largest employer in the 21st century is [[Northern Illinois University]] founded in DeKalb in 1895.  Located about 50 miles from Chicago, the city is part of the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].\n\n==History==\nDeKalb was originally called Huntley's Grove,<ref name=\"cityofdekalb.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofdekalb.com/854/History-of-DeKalb|title=History of DeKalb - DeKalb, IL|website=www.cityofdekalb.com}}</ref> and under the latter name was [[plat]]ted in 1853.<ref>{{cite book|last=Callary|first=Edward|title=Place Names of Illinois|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvHgwa-XImcC&pg=PA90|date=September 29, 2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-09070-7|page=90}}</ref> The name is for Baron Johann de Kalb, a major general in the American Revolutionary War.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chicago and North Western Railway Company|title=A History of the Origin of the Place Names Connected with the Chicago & North Western and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OspBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA63|year=1908|page=63}}</ref> A post office has been in operation at DeKalb since 1849.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postalhistory.com/postoffices.asp?task=display&state=IL&county=DeKalb|title=DeKalb County|publisher=Jim Forte Postal History|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}</ref> \nThe development of barbed wire is key in the history of DeKalb. Joseph Glidden, who developed barbed wire, was a historic citizen of DeKalb. Glidden would ultimately be known as the \u201cFather of Barbed Wire\u201d. Glidden began to mass-produce his invention, and eventually sold half of the company to Isaac L. Ellwood. Together, the two formed the Barb Fence Company.<ref name=\"cityofdekalb.com\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nThe city of DeKalb is in northern Illinois, United States, roughly 55 miles west of downtown Chicago and roughly 30 miles southeast of Rockford, IL.

The park district was established in 1935 through the initiative of members of the League of Women Voters, to address the need for a public swimming pool in the community. The City of DeKalb gave the first four parks to the District: Annie's Woods, Huntley Park, Liberty Park, and Hopkins Park. By 1960, the district had eight parks and by 1970 twelve. Initially the main services provided focused on swimming and use of the outdoor parks. But as lifestyles changed, so did the district.\n\nIn the mid 1960s, the City gave the Ellwood House mansion to the district. In 1970, the park district hired its first full-time executive director and by 1980, the district had a pool, acquired Haish Gymnasium and Buena Vista, a nine-hole golf course. In 1985, the park district purchased River Heights, a second nine-hole golf course, which was later developed into an 18-hole course.\n\nNew parks were acquired as conservation areas in order to preserve floodplain lands and wildlife habitat. Other parks were established as community-wide active recreation facilities designed to serve all types of recreational uses. In addition to this system of parks the district established the Kishwaukee Kiwanis pathway system totaling over 8 miles in length, connecting DeKalb with Sycamore and the Great Western Trail to the east.\n\nIn 2000 the district opened the Sports and Recreation Center, a multi-function facility that features in indoor field of over 1 acre, clear-span space with synthetic field turf. The park district provides year-round athletic and recreation programs including day camps, youth baseball and softball, adult softball leagues both indoors and outdoors, swimming lessons, golf lessons, karate, tennis, adult and youth basketball leagues, indoor soccer, fitness classes, and preschool.\n\nToday the DeKalb Park District park system includes 44 parks totaling over 700 acres: community parks, neighborhood parks, passive parks and linear parks. Notable parks and facilities include:\n*River Heights Golf Course\n*Buena Vista Golf Course\n*Hopkins Park Pool and Community Center\n*Nehring Center for Culture and Tourism\n*[[Ellwood House]] Museum and Park\n\n==Government==\nDeKalb is governed by a [[Council-Manager government]].  Policy is developed by an elected [[City Council]] then implemented by an appointed professional City Manager. DeKalb's City Council is made up of a [[Mayor]], elected at-large, and seven alderpersons, elected by ward. Each serves a four-year term, with half the council being elected every two years.

Despite [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] not formally being at war, the Dutch advanced up the [[Hooghly River]]. They met a mixed force of British and local troops at [[Chinsurah]], just outside [[Calcutta]]. The British, under Colonel [[Francis Forde (army officer)|Francis Forde]], defeated the Dutch, forcing them to withdraw. The British engaged and defeated the ships the Dutch used to deliver the troops in a separate naval battle on November 24.\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the British capture and destruction of the French outpost at [[Chandernagore]] in 1757, [[Mir Jafar]], the [[Nawab of Bengal]], opened secret negotiations with representatives of the [[Dutch East India Company]] to bring troops into Dutch holdings in the area with the goal of using against the British. Britain and the [[Dutch Republic]] were at peace, although tensions were high due to the [[Seven Years' War]], and [[British East India Company]] administrator [[Robert Clive]] was preoccupied with fighting the French. The Dutch directors of the outpost at [[Chinsurah]], not far from Chandernagore, seeing an opportunity to expand their influence, agreed to send additional troops to Chinsurah. A fleet of seven ships, containing more than fifteen hundred European and Malay troops, came from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] and arrived at the mouth of the [[Hooghly River]] in October 1759, while the Nawab was meeting with Clive in [[Calcutta]].\n\nThe Nawab had been forced to ask the British for assistance against threats on his northern border in the interim, and told Clive that he would return to [[Hugli-Chinsura|Hooghly]], summon the Dutch directors, and demand the departure of their ships. After meeting with the Dutch, he informed Clive that he had granted the Dutch some privileges, and that they would leave as soon as circumstances permitted. This news, combined with reports that the Dutch were recruiting in and around Chinsurah, led Clive to treat the situation as a real military threat.\n\nOf four ships he had available, Clive sent one out in an attempt to request assistance from [[Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet|Admiral Cornish]], who was patrolling the coast. The Dutch captured this ship when they seized several smaller British vessels on the Hooghly River. Clive called out the militia and put out calls for volunteers, increased the fortifications on the river batteries, and sent Colonel [[Francis Forde (army officer)|Francis Forde]] with five hundred men toward Chandernagore with an eye toward capturing the Dutch outpost at Barnagore and intercepting the Dutch should they try to take Chandernagore.\n\nThe Dutch landed their troops on the northern shore of the Hooghly on 21 November, just beyond the range of the English river batteries, and marched for Chinsurah.\n\n==Events==\n===Naval battle===\nThe three remaining British ships had followed the Dutch ships up the river at some distance. When the Dutch had finished landing the troops, the Dutch ships began moving down the river. On 23 November, Commodore Charles Wilson, commander of the British flotilla, indicated that he wanted to pass the Dutch, who threatened to fire on the British if they did. The next day, after the rejection of an ultimatum from Clive demanding restitution for the earlier Dutch seizures, the two fleets engaged. In a two-hour battle, the ''Duke of Dorset'' forced the Dutch flagship ''Vlissingen'' to [[striking the colors|strike her colours]], while ''Hardwicke'' and ''Calcutta'' chased off two ships and grounded a third before the remaining ships also struck their colours. (Other British ships arriving at the mouth of the river eventually captured the two remaining fleeing Dutch ships.)\n\n===Chandernagore (Now Chandannagar)===\nOn the night of 23 November, Forde and his men encamped near Chandernagore, having successfully taken control of Barnagore (Now Baranagar). The Dutch, hoping to trap Forde between the arriving troops and the Chinsurah garrison, sent their arriving troops out to camp in the ruins of Chandernagore that night. The following morning the two forces engaged.\n\nForde's men routed the Dutch, forcing them back to Chinsurah, and captured the Dutch field artillery. There additional troops sent from Calcutta joined Forde, raising the size of his force to about 1200 men. The Nawab also sent 100 cavalry to the British camp, ostensibly to assist the British; these were likely placed to observe the battle and side with the victors.\n\nWith reports from prisoners that the Dutch reinforcements would be arriving the next day, Forde rushed a message to Clive in Calcutta requesting advice, as attacking the Dutch force could be viewed as an act of war. Clive responded by writing on the back of Forde's message, \"Dear Forde&mdash;Fight them immediately\", and sending it back.\n\n===Biderra===\nForde chose as his location the plain of Biderra, between Chinsurah and Chandernagore. His troops occupied the village of Biderra on the right and a mango grove to the left; a wide ditch secured the center. At about 10 on the morning of 25 November, the Dutch force arrived. As soon as they came within range, Forde ordered his field artillery to fire. The Dutch continued to advance in spite of the British fire until they reached the ditch, something they had not apparently been aware of. When the front of the Dutch lines stopped, the rear continued to press forward, throwing the Dutch forces into confusion. As their position was then within range of British musket fire, they suffered significant casualties before managing to turn retreat. At this point Forde sent out his cavalry, inviting the nawab's men to join the charge. However, the nawab's men held back and did not join the British until the second charge, when it seemed clear they would be victorious.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe British victory was so complete that, of the Dutch troops sent, only sixteen Europeans successfully reached Chinsurah.\n\nIn the wake of their victory, the British overthrew Mir Jafar and replaced him with his son-in-law [[Mir Kasim Ali Khan]]. Along with the [[Battle of Plassey]], the battle helped establish British supremacy in Bengal. The battle did not affect Dutch neutrality and they remained one of the few European states not involved in the war.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Great Britain in the Seven Years War]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Harvey, Robert.

Clive responded by writing on the back of Forde's message, \"Dear Forde&mdash;Fight them immediately\", and sending it back.\n\n===Biderra===\nForde chose as his location the plain of Biderra, between Chinsurah and Chandernagore. His troops occupied the village of Biderra on the right and a mango grove to the left; a wide ditch secured the center. At about 10 on the morning of 25 November, the Dutch force arrived. As soon as they came within range, Forde ordered his field artillery to fire. The Dutch continued to advance in spite of the British fire until they reached the ditch, something they had not apparently been aware of. When the front of the Dutch lines stopped, the rear continued to press forward, throwing the Dutch forces into confusion. As their position was then within range of British musket fire, they suffered significant casualties before managing to turn retreat. At this point Forde sent out his cavalry, inviting the nawab's men to join the charge. However, the nawab's men held back and did not join the British until the second charge, when it seemed clear they would be victorious.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe British victory was so complete that, of the Dutch troops sent, only sixteen Europeans successfully reached Chinsurah.\n\nIn the wake of their victory, the British overthrew Mir Jafar and replaced him with his son-in-law [[Mir Kasim Ali Khan]]. Along with the [[Battle of Plassey]], the battle helped establish British supremacy in Bengal. The battle did not affect Dutch neutrality and they remained one of the few European states not involved in the war.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Great Britain in the Seven Years War]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Harvey, Robert.
