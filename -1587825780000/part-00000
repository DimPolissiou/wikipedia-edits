One such sawmill \u2013 located at the east end of the present [[Lake Carasaljo]] \u2013 was known as Three Partners Mill from at least 1789 until at least 1814. From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-[[smelting]] operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.\n\nLakewood's developers thought that \"Bricksburg\" didn't capture their vision for the community, and the names \"Brightwood\" and \"Lakewood\" were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, \"Lakewood\" was chosen, and the [[United States Postal Service]] approved the name in March 1880.<ref>[http://www.villageprofile.com/newjersey/lakewood/01/topic.html History of Lakewood], VillageProfile.com.

One such sawmill \u2013 located at the east end of the present [[Lake Carasaljo]] \u2013 was known as Three Partners Mill from at least 1789 until at least 1814. From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-[[smelting]] operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.\n\nLakewood's developers thought that \"Bricksburg\" didn't capture their vision for the community, and the names \"Brightwood\" and \"Lakewood\" were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, \"Lakewood\" was chosen, and the [[United States Postal Service]] approved the name in March 1880.<ref>[http://www.villageprofile.com/newjersey/lakewood/01/topic.html History of Lakewood], VillageProfile.com.

{"title_page": "Philosophy for Children", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=June 2009}}\n'''Philosophy for Children''', sometimes abbreviated to '''P4C''', is a movement that aims to teach [[reasoning]] and argumentative skills to [[children]]. There are also related methods sometimes called \"''Philosophy for Young People''\" or \"''Philosophy for Kids''\". Often the hope is that this will be a key influential move towards a more democratic form of [[democracy]].<ref>Laurence Splitter and Ann M. Sharp, Teaching for Better Thinking, ACER: Melbourne.</ref> However, there is also a long tradition within [[higher education]] of developing alternative methods for teaching philosophy both in schools and colleges (see ''\"[[philosophy education]]\"'').<ref>See, for example, Philosophy 4 Skool, by Michael Brett, http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/philinschool.htm accessed July 19, 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough the noted [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Jean Piaget]] was of the impression that children were not capable of [[critical thinking]] until age 11 or 12, the experience of many philosophers and teachers with young children gives reason to believe that children benefit from philosophical inquiry even in early primary school. Furthermore, there is [[empirical evidence]] that teaching children [[reasoning]] skills early in life greatly improves other [[cognitive]] and [[academic]] skills and greatly assists learning in general.<ref>k.J. Topping and S. Trickey (2007) \"Collaborative Philosophical Inquiry for School Children\", British Journal of Educational Psychology, Dec 77(4).</ref>\n\n==Method==\n\nThe pedagogy of philosophy for children is diverse. However, many practitioners including those working in the tradition of [[Matthew Lipman]] and the [http://www.montclair.edu/cehs/academics/centers-and-institutes/iapc/index.html Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children] emphasize the use of a community of inquiry method which has roots in the work of philosopher [[John Dewey]].<ref>Jennifer Bleazby (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools, Routledge: New York and London.</ref> The term \"inquiry\" is preferred to \"lesson\" because the emphasis is on the group inquiring together into questions with the teacher as a facilitator rather than the authoritative source of information.\n\n===Questions and pictures as stimuli for conversation===\n\nAs a basis for discussing philosophy with children, the questions used (\u201cWhat is friendship?\u201d, \u201cDo animals have feelings?\u201d, and \u201cWhat is happiness?\u201d) are of crucial importance. The German educational scientist Michael Siegmund recommends asking children a philosophical question along with an inspiring picture. Together, the image and question create an opening for discussing philosophy. Among other things, natural landscapes, pictures of animals and people, certain social situations, or even fantasy pictures can be used. This dual method can be used as early as at daycare for children ages 4 and up, as well as at school or with family.<ref>Siegmund, Michael (2019) Philosophy for Children and Teenagers: The best 123 questions: Including many pictures that will encourage the joint thinking process, BoD, Norderstedt.</ref>\n\n===Stories as stimuli for conversation===\n\nAlong with pictures, stories can also lead to discussions of philosophy with children. A story can thus be an occasion to start a philosophical conversation with children. Adults can ask the children philosophical questions while they are reading aloud as well. Stories, combined with profound questions, can inspire children and promote their creativity and imagination. Adults can either add \u201cphilosophical questions\u201d to \u201cclassic\u201d stories and fairy tales themselves, or use special children's books for discussing philosophy with children. Michael Siegmund recommends stories in which animals are the main characters and child-friendly questions are asked. Possible topics may include poverty and wealth, friendship and family, happiness, freedom, environmental pollution, justice, and more.<ref>Siegmund, Michael (2020) Philosophy for Children. Grandpa Carl the Owl and his Grandson Nils the Owl, BoD, Norderstedt.</ref>\n\n==Notable proponents and their styles in the world==\n\nOne of the salient differences between proponents of philosophy for children is in their choice of stimuli - starting points for discussions. [[Matthew Lipman]], called \"the most influential figure\" in helping young students develop philosophical thinking by Gareth Matthews, is credited with starting the Philosophy for Children movement in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/education/15lipman.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Douglas | last=Martin | title=Matthew Lipman, Philosopher and Educator, Dies at 87 | date=2011-01-14}}</ref> After witnessing political upheaval taking place on University campuses nationwide in the 1960s, Lipman realized that philosophical and critical thinking should be encouraged much earlier in the academic setting. He founded the ''Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children''<ref>[http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/ Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]</ref> at Montclair State University (then Montclair State College) in 1974. Lipman's method involves reading philosophically stimulating narrative to children and encouraging them to come up with philosophical questions in response.  The questions set the agenda for a collaborative inquiry where the teacher acts as both facilitator and co-inquirer. The lessons are dialogue based with students usually sitting in a circle and taking turns at suggesting solutions, expressing opinions, putting forth arguments and counter arguments, providing examples, constructing criteria and building on each other's ideas with the aim of coming to a settlement regarding the initial philosophical questions that stimulated the dialogue. Lipman's ideas about learning, pedagogy and curriculum are heavily influenced by the educational and philosophical ideas of the American pragmatist philosopher John Dewey.<ref>Bleazby, Jennifer (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools. Routledge: New York and London.</ref> Many of the materials used by the IAPC are philosophical children's novels that were published by Lipman, including ''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery'', which he published in 1969.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pritchard|first=Michael|title=Philosophy for Children|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/children/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-07-04}}</ref> Others have built on Lipman's ideas and developed further teaching resources and learning activities that complement his original Philosophy for Children novels and pedagogical approach, such as Phil Cam's popular teaching resources <ref>Cam, Phil (2012) Teaching Ethics in Schools. ACER: Melbourne</ref><ref>Cam, Phil (1993-97) Thinking Stories, Hale and Iremonger.</ref> Lipman wrote the world's first systematic pre-college philosophy curriculum and created both masters and doctoral programs in the field of Philosophy for Children. He also founded ''Thinking: The Journal of Philosophy for Children''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.montclair.edu/iapc/|title=Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-04}}</ref>\n\n[[Gareth Matthews]] worked with a variety of students, but primarily with students in late primary school (5th grade and thereabouts). Matthews' method was to get the students to actively create philosophical settings, to \u201cmake the philosophical problem their own\u201d. One of his best-known techniques was to provide the beginning of a philosophically provocative story. He then recorded/transcribes student comments, put them in the mouths of characters in the story, and brought the story continuation to the next class session for further discussion. Such interactions are compiled in his book ''Dialogues With Children''.\n\nKarin Murris of Witwatersrand University, South Africa and Joanna Haynes of Plymouth University, England, have popularised the use of children's picture books as an alternative to purpose-written materials. Tom Wartenberg of Mount Holyoke, Massachusetts has also written a large number of discussion plans for philosophising with picture books.\n\nJana Mohr Lone has written about children's philosophical thinking and the benefits of encouraging children to engage in philosophical inquiry.\n\nEllen Duthie, together with her team based in Spain, researches and develops the possibilities of [http://www.wonderponderonline.com Visual Philosophy for Children] (and adults), exploring different ways of engaging and stimulating philosophical dialogue through visuals in her Wonder Ponder series of books.    \n\nThere is particular diversity in the UK, owing to the large number of competing and collaborating freelance trainers each emphasising different strands of the pedagogy. Roger Sutcliffe's practice includes the use of news stories; Steve Williams has emphasised the importance of dialogues that model argument as well as raising philosophical issues; [[Will ord|Will Ord]] emphasises the use of striking photos, often containing contrasts that suggest opposing concepts.;<ref>http://www.thinkingeducation.co.uk/p4c.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Jason Buckley advocates a more physical, game-based approach and \"Philosophy in Role\", in which children philosophise within a story as characters confronted with a variety of problems.\n\n[http://www.sapere.org.uk/ SAPERE] is the UK's leading provider of P4C training.

His contribution to evolving the idea of p4c involves young people becoming novice critical theory action researchers and meaningful members of communities of inquiry focused on human flourishing for every person. Another key component of Barry's P4c\u00b2 is the importance of children gaining ontological weight from participation in their communities of inquiry by understanding the meaning of quality in praxis in a transformational way through TQ Theory.

There are also related methods sometimes called \"''Philosophy for Young People''\" or \"''Philosophy for Kids''\". Often the hope is that this will be a key influential move towards a more democratic form of [[democracy]].<ref>Laurence Splitter and Ann M. Sharp, Teaching for Better Thinking, ACER: Melbourne.</ref> However, there is also a long tradition within [[higher education]] of developing alternative methods for teaching philosophy both in schools and colleges (see ''\"[[philosophy education]]\"'').<ref>See, for example, Philosophy 4 Skool, by Michael Brett, http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/philinschool.htm accessed July 19, 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough the noted [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Jean Piaget]] was of the impression that children were not capable of [[critical thinking]] until age 11 or 12, the experience of many philosophers and teachers with young children gives reason to believe that children benefit from philosophical inquiry even in early primary school. Furthermore, there is [[empirical evidence]] that teaching children [[reasoning]] skills early in life greatly improves other [[cognitive]] and [[academic]] skills and greatly assists learning in general.<ref>k.J. Topping and S. Trickey (2007) \"Collaborative Philosophical Inquiry for School Children\", British Journal of Educational Psychology, Dec 77(4).</ref>\n\n==Method==\n\nThe pedagogy of philosophy for children is diverse. However, many practitioners including those working in the tradition of [[Matthew Lipman]] and the [http://www.montclair.edu/cehs/academics/centers-and-institutes/iapc/index.html Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children] emphasize the use of a community of inquiry method which has roots in the work of philosopher [[John Dewey]].<ref>Jennifer Bleazby (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools, Routledge: New York and London.</ref> The term \"inquiry\" is preferred to \"lesson\" because the emphasis is on the group inquiring together into questions with the teacher as a facilitator rather than the authoritative source of information.\n\n===Questions and pictures as stimuli for conversation===\n\nAs a basis for discussing philosophy with children, the questions used (\u201cWhat is friendship?\u201d, \u201cDo animals have feelings?\u201d, and \u201cWhat is happiness?\u201d) are of crucial importance. The German educational scientist Michael Siegmund recommends asking children a philosophical question along with an inspiring picture. Together, the image and question create an opening for discussing philosophy. Among other things, natural landscapes, pictures of animals and people, certain social situations, or even fantasy pictures can be used. This dual method can be used as early as at daycare for children ages 4 and up, as well as at school or with family.<ref>Siegmund, Michael (2019) Philosophy for Children and Teenagers: The best 123 questions: Including many pictures that will encourage the joint thinking process, BoD, Norderstedt.</ref>\n\n===Stories as stimuli for conversation===\n\nAlong with pictures, stories can also lead to discussions of philosophy with children. A story can thus be an occasion to start a philosophical conversation with children. Adults can ask the children philosophical questions while they are reading aloud as well. Stories, combined with profound questions, can inspire children and promote their creativity and imagination. Adults can either add \u201cphilosophical questions\u201d to \u201cclassic\u201d stories and fairy tales themselves, or use special children's books for discussing philosophy with children. Michael Siegmund recommends stories in which animals are the main characters and child-friendly questions are asked. Possible topics may include poverty and wealth, friendship and family, happiness, freedom, environmental pollution, justice, and more.<ref>Siegmund, Michael (2020) Philosophy for Children. Grandpa Carl the Owl and his Grandson Nils the Owl, BoD, Norderstedt.</ref>\n\n==Notable proponents and their styles in the world==\n\nOne of the salient differences between proponents of philosophy for children is in their choice of stimuli - starting points for discussions. [[Matthew Lipman]], called \"the most influential figure\" in helping young students develop philosophical thinking by Gareth Matthews, is credited with starting the Philosophy for Children movement in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/education/15lipman.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Douglas | last=Martin | title=Matthew Lipman, Philosopher and Educator, Dies at 87 | date=2011-01-14}}</ref> After witnessing political upheaval taking place on University campuses nationwide in the 1960s, Lipman realized that philosophical and critical thinking should be encouraged much earlier in the academic setting. He founded the ''Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children''<ref>[http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/ Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]</ref> at Montclair State University (then Montclair State College) in 1974. Lipman's method involves reading philosophically stimulating narrative to children and encouraging them to come up with philosophical questions in response.  The questions set the agenda for a collaborative inquiry where the teacher acts as both facilitator and co-inquirer. The lessons are dialogue based with students usually sitting in a circle and taking turns at suggesting solutions, expressing opinions, putting forth arguments and counter arguments, providing examples, constructing criteria and building on each other's ideas with the aim of coming to a settlement regarding the initial philosophical questions that stimulated the dialogue. Lipman's ideas about learning, pedagogy and curriculum are heavily influenced by the educational and philosophical ideas of the American pragmatist philosopher John Dewey.<ref>Bleazby, Jennifer (2013) Social Reconstruction Learning: Dualism, Dewey and Philosophy in Schools. Routledge: New York and London.</ref> Many of the materials used by the IAPC are philosophical children's novels that were published by Lipman, including ''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery'', which he published in 1969.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pritchard|first=Michael|title=Philosophy for Children|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/children/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-07-04}}</ref> Others have built on Lipman's ideas and developed further teaching resources and learning activities that complement his original Philosophy for Children novels and pedagogical approach, such as Phil Cam's popular teaching resources <ref>Cam, Phil (2012) Teaching Ethics in Schools. ACER: Melbourne</ref><ref>Cam, Phil (1993-97) Thinking Stories, Hale and Iremonger.</ref> Lipman wrote the world's first systematic pre-college philosophy curriculum and created both masters and doctoral programs in the field of Philosophy for Children.

Matthews' method was to get the students to actively create philosophical settings, to \u201cmake the philosophical problem their own\u201d. One of his best-known techniques was to provide the beginning of a philosophically provocative story. He then recorded/transcribes student comments, put them in the mouths of characters in the story, and brought the story continuation to the next class session for further discussion. Such interactions are compiled in his book ''Dialogues With Children''.\n\nKarin Murris of Witwatersrand University, South Africa and Joanna Haynes of Plymouth University, England, have popularised the use of children's picture books as an alternative to purpose-written materials. Tom Wartenberg of Mount Holyoke, Massachusetts has also written a large number of discussion plans for philosophising with picture books.\n\nJana Mohr Lone has written about children's philosophical thinking and the benefits of encouraging children to engage in philosophical inquiry.\n\nEllen Duthie, together with her team based in Spain, researches and develops the possibilities of [http://www.wonderponderonline.com Visual Philosophy for Children] (and adults), exploring different ways of engaging and stimulating philosophical dialogue through visuals in her Wonder Ponder series of books.    \n\nThere is particular diversity in the UK, owing to the large number of competing and collaborating freelance trainers each emphasising different strands of the pedagogy. Roger Sutcliffe's practice includes the use of news stories; Steve Williams has emphasised the importance of dialogues that model argument as well as raising philosophical issues; [[Will ord|Will Ord]] emphasises the use of striking photos, often containing contrasts that suggest opposing concepts.;<ref>http://www.thinkingeducation.co.uk/p4c.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Jason Buckley advocates a more physical, game-based approach and \"Philosophy in Role\", in which children philosophise within a story as characters confronted with a variety of problems.\n\n[http://www.sapere.org.uk/ SAPERE] is the UK's leading provider of P4C training.

They make use of carefully structured questioning strategies and also the introduction of thinking skills in order to develop good thinking habits from a young age.

Another key component of Barry's P4c\u00b2 is the importance of children gaining ontological weight from participation in their communities of inquiry by understanding the meaning of quality in praxis in a transformational way through TQ Theory.

We shot on set of course, and I was in the scenes I have with other actors, but the beauty of this process is you can go back and reiterate, keep informing and honing beats and moments. So J.J., after we shot last year, we've had a series of sessions where I'd be in London at The Imaginarium, my studio, while he\u2019s been directing from L.A., and we've literally been creating further additions and iterations to the character. That's been fascinating. And in the meantime I've been able to see the look and design of the character grow and change as the performances change.

I was very high up, totally on my own, away from everybody else, but acting with them ... we used sort of a \"Kongolizer\" method of having sound come out of speakers to give a sense of scale and distance for the character.

The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] \"evolution\" of the system. In the most common version, the [[trajectory|trajectories]] of atoms and molecules are determined by [[Numerical integration|numerically solving]] [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's equations of motion]] for a system of interacting particles, where [[Force (physics)|forces]] between the particles and their [[potential energy|potential energies]] are often calculated using [[interatomic potential]]s or [[molecular mechanics]] [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]]. The method is applied mostly in [[chemical physics]], [[materials science]], and [[biophysics]].\n\nBecause molecular systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible to determine the properties of such [[complex systems]] analytically; MD simulation circumvents this problem by using [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] methods. However, long MD simulations are mathematically [[condition number|ill-conditioned]], generating cumulative errors in numerical integration that can be minimized with proper selection of algorithms and parameters, but not eliminated entirely.\n\nFor systems which obey the [[ergodic hypothesis]], the evolution of one molecular dynamics simulation may be used to determine macroscopic [[thermodynamic]] properties of the system: the time averages of an ergodic system correspond to [[microcanonical ensemble]] averages. MD has also been termed \"statistical mechanics by numbers\" and \"[[Laplace]]'s vision of [[Newtonian mechanics]]\" of predicting the future by animating nature's forces<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4066-2_13 |chapter=Pursuing Laplace's Vision on Modern Computers |title=Mathematical Approaches to Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics |series=The IMA Volumes in Mathematics and its Applications |year=1996 |last1=Schlick |first1=Tamar |volume=82 |pages=219\u2013247 |isbn=978-0-387-94838-6 }}</ref> and allowing insight into molecular motion on an atomic scale.\n\n== History ==\nMD was originally developed in the early 1950s, following the earlier successes with [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s, which themselves date back to the eighteenth century, in the [[Buffon's needle problem]] for example, but were popularized for statistical mechanics at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] by Rosenbluth and Metropolis in what is known today as [[Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm]]. Interest in the time evolution of N-body systems dates much earlier to the fifteenth century, beginning with Newton, and continued into the sixteenth century largely with a focus on celestial mechanics and issues such as the stability of the solar system. Many of the numerical methods used today were developed during this time period, which predates use of computers; for example, the most common integration algorithm used today, the [[Verlet integration]] algorithm, was used as early as 1791 by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]]. Numerical calculations with these algorithms can be considered to be MD \"by hand.\" \n\nAs early as 1941, integration of the many-body equations of motion was carried out with analog computers. Some undertook the labor-intensive work of modeling atomic motion by constructing physical models, e.g., using macroscopic spheres. The aim was to arrange them in such as way as to replicate the structure of a liquid and use this to examine its behavior. [[J.D. Bernal]] said, in 1962: \"''... I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inches. I tried to do this in the first place as casually as possible, working in my own office, being interrupted every five minutes or so and not remembering what I had done before the interruption.''\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Bakerian Lecture, 1962 The structure of liquids |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

MD is frequently used to refine 3-dimensional structures of [[protein]]s and other [[macromolecule]]s based on experimental constraints from [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]]. In physics, MD is used to examine the dynamics of atomic-level phenomena that cannot be observed directly, such as thin film growth and ion-subplantation, and also to examine the physical properties of [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] devices that have not or cannot yet be created. In biophysics and [[structural biology]], the method is frequently applied to study the motions of macromolecules such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s, which can be useful for interpreting the results of certain biophysical experiments and for modeling interactions with other molecules, as in [[ligand docking]]. In principle MD can be used for [[De novo protein structure prediction|ab initio prediction]] of [[protein structure]] by simulating [[protein folding|folding]] of the [[polypeptide chain]] from [[random coil]].\n\nThe results of MD simulations can be tested through comparison to experiments that measure molecular dynamics, of which a popular method is NMR spectroscopy. MD-derived structure predictions can be tested through community-wide experiments in Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ([[CASP]]), although the method has historically had limited success in this area. [[Michael Levitt]], who shared the [[Nobel Prize]] partly for the application of MD to proteins, wrote in 1999 that CASP participants usually did not use the method due to \"''... a central embarrassment of molecular mechanics, namely that energy minimization or molecular dynamics generally leads to a model that is less like the experimental structure.''\"<ref name=\"Koehl\">{{cite journal |last1= Koehl |first1= P. |authorlink2= Michael Levitt |last2= Levitt |first2= Michael |year= 1999 |title= A brighter future for protein structure prediction |url= |journal= [[Nature Structural Biology]] |volume= 6 |issue= 2|pages= 108\u2013111|doi= 10.1038/5794 |pmid= 10048917 }}</ref> Improvements in computational resources permitting more and longer MD trajectories, combined with modern improvements in the quality of [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] parameters, have yielded some improvements in both structure prediction and [[homology model]] refinement, without reaching the point of practical utility in these areas; many identify force field parameters as a key area for further development.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Raval|first1=A|last2=Piana|first2=S|last3=Eastwood|first3=MP|last4=Dror|first4=RO|last5=Shaw|first5=DE|title=Refinement of protein structure homology models via long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.|journal=Proteins|date=August 2012|volume=80|issue=8|pages=2071\u20139|pmid=22513870|doi=10.1002/prot.24098}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=KA|last2=Lin|first2=YS|last3=Das|first3=R|last4=Pande|first4=VS|title=Are Protein Force Fields Getting Better?

This is a crude approximation because hydrogen bonds have a partially [[quantum mechanical]] and [[Quantum chemistry|chemical]] nature. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions are usually calculated using the [[Relative permittivity|dielectric constant]] of [[vacuum]], although the surrounding aqueous solution has a much higher dielectric constant. Using the [[macroscopic]] dielectric constant at short interatomic distances is questionable. Finally, [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals interactions]] in MD are usually described by [[Lennard-Jones potential]]s based on the [[Fritz London]] theory that is only applicable in vacuum. However, all types of van der Waals forces are ultimately of electrostatic origin and therefore depend on [[Permittivity|dielectric properties of the environment]].<ref name=\"Israelachvili\">[[Jacob Israelachvili|Israelachvili, Jacob]] (1992). ''Intermolecular and surface forces.'' Academic Press, San Diego.</ref> The direct measurement of attraction forces between different materials (as [[Hamaker constant]]) shows that \"the interaction between hydrocarbons across water is about 10% of that across vacuum\".<ref name=\"Israelachvili\" /> The environment-dependence of van der Waals forces is neglected in standard simulations, but can be included by developing polarizable force fields.\n\n== Design constraints ==\n\nDesign of a molecular dynamics simulation should account for the available computational power. Simulation size (''n'' = number of particles), timestep, and total time duration must be selected so that the calculation can finish within a reasonable time period. However, the simulations should be long enough to be relevant to the time scales of the natural processes being studied. To make statistically valid conclusions from the simulations, the time span simulated should match the [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] of the natural process. Otherwise, it is analogous to making conclusions about how a human walks when only looking at less than one footstep.

[http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/md.html Molecular Dynamics - Parallel Algorithms]. sandia.gov</ref>\n\nDuring a classical MD simulation, the most CPU intensive task is the evaluation of the [[Force field (chemistry)|potential]] as a function of the particles' internal coordinates. Within that energy evaluation, the most expensive one is the non-bonded or non-covalent part. In [[Big O notation]], common molecular dynamics simulations [[analysis of algorithms|scale]] by <math>O(n^2)</math> if all pair-wise [[electrostatic]] and [[van der Waals forces|van der Waals interactions]] must be accounted for explicitly. This computational cost can be reduced by employing electrostatics methods such as particle mesh [[Ewald summation]] ( <math>O(n \\log(n))</math> ), particle\u2013particle-particle\u2013mesh ([[P3M]]), or good spherical cutoff methods ( <math>O(n)</math> ). {{citation needed |date=December 2017}}\n\nAnother factor that impacts total CPU time needed by a simulation is the size of the integration timestep. This is the time length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid [[discretization]] errors (i.e., smaller than the period related to fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1&nbsp;femtosecond (10<sup>\u221215</sup> s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE [[constraint algorithm]], which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.<ref name=\"Streett\">{{cite journal |author=Streett WB, Tildesley DJ, Saville G |year=1978 |title=Multiple time-step methods in molecular dynamics |journal=Mol Phys |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=639\u2013648 |doi=10.1080/00268977800100471|bibcode= 1978MolPh..35..639S |last2=Tildesley |last3=Saville}}</ref><ref name=\"Tuckerman1991\">{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1991 |title=Molecular dynamics algorithm for multiple time scales: systems with long range forces |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=6811\u20136815 |doi=10.1063/1.460259|bibcode= 1991JChPh..94.6811T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}</ref><ref name=\"Tuckerman1992\">{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1992 |title=Reversible multiple time scale molecular dynamics |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=1990\u20132001 |doi=10.1063/1.463137|bibcode= 1992JChPh..97.1990T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}</ref>\n\nFor simulating molecules in a solvent, a choice should be made between [[Water model|explicit]] and [[implicit solvent]]. Explicit solvent particles (such as the [[TIP3P]], SPC/E and [[Flexible SPC water model|SPC-f]] water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach. Using an explicit solvent is computationally expensive, requiring inclusion of roughly ten times more particles in the simulation. But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. This is especially important to reproduce [[chemical kinetics]].\n\nIn all kinds of molecular dynamics simulations, the simulation box size must be large enough to avoid [[boundary condition]] artifacts. Boundary conditions are often treated by choosing fixed values at the edges (which may cause artifacts), or by employing [[periodic boundary conditions]] in which one side of the simulation loops back to the opposite side, mimicking a bulk phase (which may cause artifacts too).\n\n=== Microcanonical ensemble (NVE) ===\n\nIn the [[microcanonical ensemble]], the system is isolated from changes in moles (N), volume (V), and energy (E). It corresponds to an [[adiabatic process]] with no heat exchange. A microcanonical molecular dynamics trajectory may be seen as an exchange of potential and kinetic energy, with total energy being conserved. For a system of N particles with coordinates <math>X</math> and velocities <math>V</math>, the following pair of first order differential equations may be written in [[Newton's notation for differentiation|Newton's notation]] as\n\n:<math>F(X) = -\\nabla U(X)=M\\dot{V}(t)</math>\n:<math>V(t) = \\dot{X} (t).</math>\n\nThe potential energy function <math>U(X)</math> of the system is a function of the particle coordinates <math>X</math>. It is referred to simply as the ''potential'' in physics, or the ''force field'' in chemistry. The first equation comes from [[Newton's laws of motion]]; the force <math>F</math> acting on each particle in the system can be calculated as the negative gradient of <math>U(X)</math>.\n\nFor every time step, each particle's position <math>X</math> and velocity <math>V</math> may be integrated with a [[symplectic integrator]] method such as [[Verlet integration]]. The time evolution of <math>X</math> and <math>V</math> is called a trajectory. Given the initial positions (e.g., from theoretical knowledge) and velocities (e.g., randomized Gaussian), we can calculate all future (or past) positions and velocities.\n\nOne frequent source of confusion is the meaning of [[temperature]] in MD. Commonly we have experience with macroscopic temperatures, which involve a huge number of particles. But temperature is a statistical quantity. If there is a large enough number of atoms, statistical temperature can be estimated from the ''instantaneous temperature'', which is found by equating the kinetic energy of the system to ''nk<sub>B</sub>T''/2 where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.\n\nA temperature-related phenomenon arises due to the small number of atoms that are used in MD simulations. For example, consider simulating the growth of a copper film starting with a substrate containing 500 atoms and a deposition energy of 100 eV. In the real world, the 100 eV from the deposited atom would rapidly be transported through and shared among a large number of atoms (<math>10^{10}</math> or more) with no big change in temperature. When there are only 500 atoms, however, the substrate is almost immediately vaporized by the deposition. Something similar happens in biophysical simulations. The temperature of the system in NVE is naturally raised when macromolecules such as proteins undergo exothermic conformational changes and binding.\n\n=== Canonical ensemble (NVT) ===\n\nIn the [[canonical ensemble]], amount of substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved. It is also sometimes called constant temperature molecular dynamics (CTMD). In NVT, the energy of endothermic and exothermic processes is exchanged with a thermostat.\n\nA variety of thermostat algorithms are available to add and remove energy from the boundaries of an MD simulation in a more or less realistic way, approximating the [[canonical ensemble]]. Popular methods to control temperature include velocity rescaling, the [[Nos\u00e9\u2013Hoover thermostat]], Nos\u00e9\u2013Hoover chains, the [[Berendsen thermostat]], the [[Andersen thermostat]] and [[Langevin dynamics]]. The Berendsen thermostat might introduce the [[flying ice cube]] effect, which leads to unphysical translations and rotations of the simulated system.\n\nIt is not trivial to obtain a [[canonical ensemble]] distribution of conformations and velocities using these algorithms. How this depends on system size, thermostat choice, thermostat parameters, time step and integrator is the subject of many articles in the field.\n\n=== Isothermal\u2013isobaric (NPT) ensemble ===\n\nIn the [[isothermal\u2013isobaric ensemble]], amount of substance (N), pressure (P) and temperature (T) are conserved. In addition to a thermostat, a barostat is needed. It corresponds most closely to laboratory conditions with a flask open to ambient temperature and pressure.\n\nIn the simulation of biological membranes, [[isotropic]] pressure control is not appropriate. For lipid bilayers, pressure control occurs under constant membrane area (NPAT) or constant surface tension \"gamma\" (NP\u03b3T).\n\n=== Generalized ensembles ===\n\nThe [[replica exchange]] method is a generalized ensemble. It was originally created to deal with the slow dynamics of disordered spin systems. It is also called parallel tempering.

In chemistry and biology this is usually referred to as a [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] and in materials physics as an [[interatomic potential]]. Potentials may be defined at many levels of physical accuracy; those most commonly used in chemistry are based on [[molecular mechanics]] and embody a [[classical mechanics]] treatment of particle-particle interactions that can reproduce structural and [[conformational change]]s but usually cannot reproduce [[chemical reaction]]s.\n\nThe reduction from a fully quantum description to a classical potential entails two main approximations. The first one is the [[Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation]], which states that the dynamics of electrons are so fast that they can be considered to react instantaneously to the motion of their nuclei. As a consequence, they may be treated separately. The second one treats the nuclei, which are much heavier than electrons, as point particles that follow classical Newtonian dynamics. In classical molecular dynamics, the effect of the electrons is approximated as one potential energy surface, usually representing the ground state.\n\nWhen finer levels of detail are needed, potentials based on [[quantum mechanics]] are used; some methods attempt to create hybrid [[QM/MM|classical/quantum]] potentials where the bulk of the system is treated classically but a small region is treated as a quantum system, usually undergoing a chemical transformation.\n\n=== Empirical potentials ===\n\nEmpirical potentials used in chemistry are frequently called [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]], while those used in materials physics are called [[interatomic potential]]s.\n\nMost [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] in chemistry are empirical and consist of a summation of bonded forces associated with [[chemical bond]]s, bond angles, and bond [[dihedral angle|dihedrals]], and non-bonded forces associated with [[van der Waals force]]s and [[electrostatic charge]]. Empirical potentials represent quantum-mechanical effects in a limited way through ad-hoc functional approximations. These potentials contain free parameters such as [[electrostatic charge|atomic charge]], van der Waals parameters reflecting estimates of [[atomic radius]], and equilibrium [[bond length]], angle, and dihedral; these are obtained by fitting against detailed electronic calculations (quantum chemical simulations) or experimental physical properties such as [[Young's modulus|elastic constants]], lattice parameters and [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] measurements.\n\nBecause of the non-local nature of non-bonded interactions, they involve at least weak interactions between all particles in the system. Its calculation is normally the bottleneck in the speed of MD simulations. To lower the computational cost, [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] employ numerical approximations such as shifted cutoff radii, [[reaction field method|reaction field]] algorithms, particle mesh [[Ewald summation]], or the newer particle\u2013particle-particle\u2013mesh ([[P3M]]).\n\nChemistry force fields commonly employ preset bonding arrangements (an exception being ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]]'' dynamics), and thus are unable to model the process of chemical bond breaking and reactions explicitly. On the other hand, many of the potentials used in physics, such as those based on the [[bond order potential|bond order formalism]] can describe several different coordinations of a system and bond breaking.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Sinnott |first1= S.

This allows for a dynamic redistribution of charge between atoms which responds to the local chemical environment.\n\nFor many years, polarizable MD simulations have been touted as the next generation.

This is a consequence of the [[Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation]]. In excited states, chemical reactions or when a more accurate representation is needed, electronic behavior can be obtained from first principles by using a quantum mechanical method, such as [[density functional theory]]. This is named Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD). Due to the cost of treating the electronic degrees of freedom, the computational cost of these simulations is far higher than classical molecular dynamics. This implies that AIMD is limited to smaller systems and shorter times.\n\n''[[Ab initio]]'' [[quantum mechanical]] and [[Quantum chemistry|chemical]] methods may be used to calculate the [[potential energy surface|potential energy]] of a system on the fly, as needed for conformations in a trajectory. This calculation is usually made in the close neighborhood of the [[reaction coordinate]]. Although various approximations may be used, these are based on theoretical considerations, not on empirical fitting. ''Ab initio'' calculations produce a vast amount of information that is not available from empirical methods, such as density of electronic states or other electronic properties. A significant advantage of using ''ab initio'' methods is the ability to study reactions that involve breaking or formation of covalent bonds, which correspond to multiple electronic states.\n\n=== Hybrid QM/MM ===\n{{Main|QM/MM}}\nQM (quantum-mechanical) methods are very powerful. However, they are computationally expensive, while the MM (classical or molecular mechanics) methods are fast but suffer from several limits (require extensive parameterization; energy estimates obtained are not very accurate; cannot be used to simulate reactions where covalent bonds are broken/formed; and are limited in their abilities for providing accurate details regarding the chemical environment). A new class of method has emerged that combines the good points of QM (accuracy) and MM (speed) calculations. These methods are termed mixed or hybrid quantum-mechanical and molecular mechanics methods (hybrid QM/MM).<ref>The methodology for such methods was introduced by Warshel and coworkers. In the recent years have been pioneered by several groups including: [[Arieh Warshel]] ([[University of Southern California]]), Weitao Yang ([[Duke University]]), Sharon Hammes-Schiffer ([[The Pennsylvania State University]]), Donald Truhlar and Jiali Gao ([[University of Minnesota]]) and Kenneth Merz ([[University of Florida]]).</ref>\n\nThe most important advantage of hybrid QM/MM method is the speed. The cost of doing classical molecular dynamics (MM) in the most straightforward case scales O(n<sup>2</sup>), where n is the number of atoms in the system. This is mainly due to electrostatic interactions term (every particle interacts with every other particle). However, use of cutoff radius, periodic pair-list updates and more recently the variations of the particle-mesh Ewald's (PME) method has reduced this to between O(n) to O(n<sup>2</sup>). In other words, if a system with twice as many atoms is simulated then it would take between two and four times as much computing power. On the other hand, the simplest ''ab initio'' calculations typically scale O(n<sup>3</sup>) or worse (restricted [[Hartree\u2013Fock]] calculations have been suggested to scale ~O(n<sup>2.7</sup>)). To overcome the limit, a small part of the system is treated quantum-mechanically (typically active-site of an enzyme) and the remaining system is treated classically.\n\nIn more sophisticated implementations, QM/MM methods exist to treat both light nuclei susceptible to quantum effects (such as hydrogens) and electronic states. This allows generating hydrogen wave-functions (similar to electronic wave-functions). This methodology has been useful in investigating phenomena such as hydrogen tunneling. One example where QM/MM methods have provided new discoveries is the calculation of hydride transfer in the enzyme liver [[alcohol dehydrogenase]]. In this case, [[quantum tunneling]] is important for the hydrogen, as it determines the reaction rate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Billeter |first1=Salomon R. |last2=Webb |first2=Simon P. |last3=Agarwal |first3=Pratul K. |last4=Iordanov |first4=Tzvetelin |last5=Hammes-Schiffer |first5=Sharon |title=Hydride Transfer in Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase:\u00a0 Quantum Dynamics, Kinetic Isotope Effects, and Role of Enzyme Motion |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=November 2001 |volume=123 |issue=45 |pages=11262\u201311272 |doi=10.1021/ja011384b |pmid=11697969 }}</ref>\n\n=== Coarse-graining and reduced representations ===\n\nAt the other end of the detail scale are [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained]] and lattice models. Instead of explicitly representing every atom of the system, one uses \"pseudo-atoms\" to represent groups of atoms. MD simulations on very large systems may require such large computer resources that they cannot easily be studied by traditional all-atom methods. Similarly, simulations of processes on long timescales (beyond about 1 microsecond) are prohibitively expensive, because they require so many time steps.

For example, instead of treating all four atoms of a CH<sub>3</sub> methyl group explicitly (or all three atoms of CH<sub>2</sub> methylene group), one represents the whole group with one pseudo-atom. It must, of course, be properly parameterized so that its van der Waals interactions with other groups have the proper distance-dependence. Similar considerations apply to the bonds, angles, and torsions in which the pseudo-atom participates. In this kind of united atom representation, one typically eliminates all explicit hydrogen atoms except those that have the capability to participate in hydrogen bonds (''polar hydrogens''). An example of this is the [[CHARMM]] 19 force-field.\n\nThe polar hydrogens are usually retained in the model, because proper treatment of hydrogen bonds requires a reasonably accurate description of the directionality and the electrostatic interactions between the donor and acceptor groups. A hydroxyl group, for example, can be both a hydrogen bond donor, and a hydrogen bond acceptor, and it would be impossible to treat this with one OH pseudo-atom. About half the atoms in a protein or nucleic acid are non-polar hydrogens, so the use of united atoms can provide a substantial savings in computer time.\n\n== Incorporating solvent effects ==\nIn many simulations of a solute-solvent system the main focus is on the behavior of the solute with little interest of the solvent behavior particularly in those solvent molecules residing in regions far from the solute molecule.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molecular Modelling: Principles and Applications|last=Leach|first=Dr Andrew|date=30 January 2001|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780582382107|edition= 2nd|location=Harlow|language=English|id={{ASIN|0582382106|country=uk}} }}</ref> Solvents may influence the dynamic behavior of solutes via random collisions and by imposing a frictional drag on the motion of the solute through the solvent. The use of non-rectangular periodic boundary conditions, stochastic boundaries and solvent shells can all help reduce the number of solvent molecules required and enable a larger proportion of the computing time to be spent instead on simulating the solute. It is also possible to incorporate the effects of a solvent without needing any explicit solvent molecules present. One example of this approach is to use a [[Potential of mean force|potential mean force]] (PMF) which describes how the free energy changes as a particular coordinate is varied. The free energy change described by PMF contains the averaged effects of the solvent.\n\n== Long-range forces ==\nA long range interaction is an interaction in which the spatial interaction falls off no faster than <math>r^{-d}</math> where <math>d</math> is the dimensionality of the system. Examples include charge-charge interactions between ions and dipole-dipole interactions between molecules. Modelling these forces presents quite a challenge as they are significant over a distance which may be larger than half the box length with simulations of many thousands of particles. Though one solution would be to significantly increase the size of the box length, this brute force approach is less than ideal as the simulation would become computationally very expensive. Spherically truncating the potential is also out of the question as unrealistic behaviour may be observed when the distance is close to the cut off distance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Computer Simulation of Liquids|last=Allen|first=Michael P.|last2=Tildesley|first2=Dominic J.|date=2017-08-22|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198803201|edition= 2nd|location=|pages=216|language=English|id={{ASIN|0198803206|country=uk}} }}</ref>\n\n== Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) ==\n\nSteered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, or force probe simulations, apply forces to a protein in order to manipulate its structure by pulling it along desired degrees of freedom.

The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] \"evolution\" of the system. In the most common version, the [[trajectory|trajectories]] of atoms and molecules are determined by [[Numerical integration|numerically solving]] [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's equations of motion]] for a system of interacting particles, where [[Force (physics)|forces]] between the particles and their [[potential energy|potential energies]] are often calculated using [[interatomic potential]]s or [[molecular mechanics]] [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]]. The method is applied mostly in [[chemical physics]], [[materials science]], and the [[biophysics]].\n\nBecause molecular systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible to determine the properties of such [[complex systems]] analytically; MD simulation circumvents this problem by using [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] methods. However, long MD simulations are mathematically [[condition number|ill-conditioned]], generating cumulative errors in numerical integration that can be minimized with proper selection of algorithms and parameters, but not eliminated entirely.\n\nFor systems which obey the [[ergodic hypothesis]], the evolution of one molecular dynamics simulation may be used to determine macroscopic [[thermodynamic]] properties of the system: the time averages of an ergodic system correspond to [[microcanonical ensemble]] averages. MD has also been termed \"statistical mechanics by numbers\" and \"[[Laplace]]'s vision of [[Newtonian mechanics]]\" of predicting the future by animating nature's forces<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4066-2_13 |chapter=Pursuing Laplace's Vision on Modern Computers |title=Mathematical Approaches to Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics |series=The IMA Volumes in Mathematics and its Applications |year=1996 |last1=Schlick |first1=Tamar |volume=82 |pages=219\u2013247 |isbn=978-0-387-94838-6 }}</ref> and allowing insight into molecular motion on an atomic scale.\n\n== History ==\nMD was originally developed in the early 1950s, following the earlier successes with [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s, which themselves date back to the eighteenth century, in the [[Buffon's needle problem]] for example, but were popularized for statistical mechanics at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] by Rosenbluth and Metropolis in what is known today as [[Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm]]. Interest in the time evolution of N-body systems dates much earlier to the fifteenth century, beginning with Newton, and continued into the sixteenth century largely with a focus on celestial mechanics and issues such as the stability of the solar system. Many of the numerical methods used today were developed during this time period, which predates use of computers; for example, the most common integration algorithm used today, the [[Verlet integration]] algorithm, was used as early as 1791 by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]]. Numerical calculations with these algorithms can be considered to be MD \"by hand.\" \n\nAs early as 1941, integration of the many-body equations of motion was carried out with analog computers. Some undertook the labor-intensive work of modeling atomic motion by constructing physical models, e.g., using macroscopic spheres. The aim was to arrange them in such as way as to replicate the structure of a liquid and use this to examine its behavior. [[J.D. Bernal]] said, in 1962: \"''... I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inches. I tried to do this in the first place as casually as possible, working in my own office, being interrupted every five minutes or so and not remembering what I had done before the interruption.''\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Bakerian Lecture, 1962 The structure of liquids |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

MD is frequently used to refine 3-dimensional structures of [[protein]]s and other [[macromolecule]]s based on experimental constraints from [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]]. In physics, MD is used to examine the dynamics of atomic-level phenomena that cannot be observed directly, such as thin film growth and ion-subplantation, and also to examine the physical properties of [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] devices that have not or cannot yet be created. In biophysics and [[structural biology]], the method is frequently applied to study the motions of macromolecules such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s, which can be useful for interpreting the results of certain biophysical experiments and for modeling interactions with other molecules, as in [[ligand docking]]. In principle MD can be used for [[De novo protein structure prediction|ab initio prediction]] of [[protein structure]] by simulating [[protein folding|folding]] of the [[polypeptide chain]] from [[random coil]].\n\nThe results of MD simulations can be tested through comparison to experiments that measure molecular dynamics, of which a popular method is NMR spectroscopy. MD-derived structure predictions can be tested through community-wide experiments in Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ([[CASP]]), although the method has historically had limited success in this area. [[Michael Levitt]], who shared the [[Nobel Prize]] partly for the application of MD to proteins, wrote in 1999 that CASP participants usually did not use the method due to \"''... a central embarrassment of molecular mechanics, namely that energy minimization or molecular dynamics generally leads to a model that is less like the experimental structure.''\"<ref name=\"Koehl\">{{cite journal |last1= Koehl |first1= P. |authorlink2= Michael Levitt |last2= Levitt |first2= Michael |year= 1999 |title= A brighter future for protein structure prediction |url= |journal= [[Nature Structural Biology]] |volume= 6 |issue= 2|pages= 108\u2013111|doi= 10.1038/5794 |pmid= 10048917 }}</ref> Improvements in computational resources permitting more and longer MD trajectories, combined with modern improvements in the quality of [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] parameters, have yielded some improvements in both structure prediction and [[homology model]] refinement, without reaching the point of practical utility in these areas; many identify force field parameters as a key area for further development.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Raval|first1=A|last2=Piana|first2=S|last3=Eastwood|first3=MP|last4=Dror|first4=RO|last5=Shaw|first5=DE|title=Refinement of protein structure homology models via long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.|journal=Proteins|date=August 2012|volume=80|issue=8|pages=2071\u20139|pmid=22513870|doi=10.1002/prot.24098}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=KA|last2=Lin|first2=YS|last3=Das|first3=R|last4=Pande|first4=VS|title=Are Protein Force Fields Getting Better?

Simulation size (''n'' = number of particles), timestep, and total time duration must be selected so that the calculation can finish within a reasonable time period. However, the simulations should be long enough to be relevant to the time scales of the natural processes being studied. To make statistically valid conclusions from the simulations, the time span simulated should match the [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] of the natural process. Otherwise, it is analogous to making conclusions about how a human walks when only looking at less than one footstep.

[http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/md.html Molecular Dynamics - Parallel Algorithms]. sandia.gov</ref>\n\nDuring a classical MD simulation, the most CPU intensive task is the evaluation of the [[Force field (chemistry)|potential]] as a function of the particles' internal coordinates. Within that energy evaluation, the most expensive one is the non-bonded or non-covalent part. In [[Big O notation]], common molecular dynamics simulations [[analysis of algorithms|scale]] by <math>O(n^2)</math> if all pair-wise [[electrostatic]] and [[van der Waals forces|van der Waals interactions]] must be accounted for explicitly. This computational cost can be reduced by employing electrostatics methods such as particle mesh [[Ewald summation]] ( <math>O(n \\log(n))</math> ), particle\u2013particle-particle\u2013mesh ([[P3M]]), or good spherical cutoff methods ( <math>O(n)</math> ). {{citation needed |date=December 2017}}\n\nAnother factor that impacts total CPU time needed by a simulation is the size of the integration timestep. This is the time length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid [[discretization]] errors (i.e., smaller than the period related to fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1&nbsp;femtosecond (10<sup>\u221215</sup> s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE [[constraint algorithm]], which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.<ref name=\"Streett\">{{cite journal |author=Streett WB, Tildesley DJ, Saville G |year=1978 |title=Multiple time-step methods in molecular dynamics |journal=Mol Phys |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=639\u2013648 |doi=10.1080/00268977800100471|bibcode= 1978MolPh..35..639S |last2=Tildesley |last3=Saville}}</ref><ref name=\"Tuckerman1991\">{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1991 |title=Molecular dynamics algorithm for multiple time scales: systems with long range forces |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=6811\u20136815 |doi=10.1063/1.460259|bibcode= 1991JChPh..94.6811T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}</ref><ref name=\"Tuckerman1992\">{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1992 |title=Reversible multiple time scale molecular dynamics |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=1990\u20132001 |doi=10.1063/1.463137|bibcode= 1992JChPh..97.1990T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}</ref>\n\nFor simulating molecules in a solvent, a choice should be made between [[Water model|explicit]] and [[implicit solvent]]. Explicit solvent particles (such as the [[TIP3P]], SPC/E and [[Flexible SPC water model|SPC-f]] water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach. Using an explicit solvent is computationally expensive, requiring inclusion of roughly ten times more particles in the simulation. But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. This is especially important to reproduce [[chemical kinetics]].\n\nIn all kinds of molecular dynamics simulations, the simulation box size must be large enough to avoid [[boundary condition]] artifacts. Boundary conditions are often treated by choosing fixed values at the edges (which may cause artifacts), or by employing [[periodic boundary conditions]] in which one side of the simulation loops back to the opposite side, mimicking a bulk phase (which may cause artifacts too).\n\n=== Microcanonical ensemble (NVE) ===\n\nIn the [[microcanonical ensemble]], the system is isolated from changes in moles (N), volume (V), and energy (E). It corresponds to an [[adiabatic process]] with no heat exchange. A microcanonical molecular dynamics trajectory may be seen as an exchange of potential and kinetic energy, with total energy being conserved. For a system of N particles with coordinates <math>X</math> and velocities <math>V</math>, the following pair of first order differential equations may be written in [[Newton's notation for differentiation|Newton's notation]] as\n\n:<math>F(X) = -\\nabla U(X)=M\\dot{V}(t)</math>\n:<math>V(t) = \\dot{X} (t).</math>\n\nThe potential energy function <math>U(X)</math> of the system is a function of the particle coordinates <math>X</math>. It is referred to simply as the ''potential'' in physics, or the ''force field'' in chemistry. The first equation comes from [[Newton's laws of motion]]; the force <math>F</math> acting on each particle in the system can be calculated as the negative gradient of <math>U(X)</math>.\n\nFor every time step, each particle's position <math>X</math> and velocity <math>V</math> may be integrated with a [[symplectic integrator]] method such as [[Verlet integration]]. The time evolution of <math>X</math> and <math>V</math> is called a trajectory. Given the initial positions (e.g., from theoretical knowledge) and velocities (e.g., randomized Gaussian), we can calculate all future (or past) positions and velocities.\n\nOne frequent source of confusion is the meaning of [[temperature]] in MD. Commonly we have experience with macroscopic temperatures, which involve a huge number of particles. But temperature is a statistical quantity. If there is a large enough number of atoms, statistical temperature can be estimated from the ''instantaneous temperature'', which is found by equating the kinetic energy of the system to ''nk<sub>B</sub>T''/2 where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.\n\nA temperature-related phenomenon arises due to the small number of atoms that are used in MD simulations. For example, consider simulating the growth of a copper film starting with a substrate containing 500 atoms and a deposition energy of 100 eV. In the real world, the 100 eV from the deposited atom would rapidly be transported through and shared among a large number of atoms (<math>10^{10}</math> or more) with no big change in temperature. When there are only 500 atoms, however, the substrate is almost immediately vaporized by the deposition. Something similar happens in biophysical simulations. The temperature of the system in NVE is naturally raised when macromolecules such as proteins undergo exothermic conformational changes and binding.\n\n=== Canonical ensemble (NVT) ===\n\nIn the [[canonical ensemble]], amount of substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved. It is also sometimes called constant temperature molecular dynamics (CTMD). In NVT, the energy of endothermic and exothermic processes is exchanged with a thermostat.\n\nA variety of thermostat algorithms are available to add and remove energy from the boundaries of an MD simulation in a more or less realistic way, approximating the [[canonical ensemble]]. Popular methods to control temperature include velocity rescaling, the [[Nos\u00e9\u2013Hoover thermostat]], Nos\u00e9\u2013Hoover chains, the [[Berendsen thermostat]], the [[Andersen thermostat]] and [[Langevin dynamics]]. The Berendsen thermostat might introduce the [[flying ice cube]] effect, which leads to unphysical translations and rotations of the simulated system.\n\nIt is not trivial to obtain a [[canonical ensemble]] distribution of conformations and velocities using these algorithms. How this depends on system size, thermostat choice, thermostat parameters, time step and integrator is the subject of many articles in the field.\n\n=== Isothermal\u2013isobaric (NPT) ensemble ===\n\nIn the [[isothermal\u2013isobaric ensemble]], amount of substance (N), pressure (P) and temperature (T) are conserved. In addition to a thermostat, a barostat is needed. It corresponds most closely to laboratory conditions with a flask open to ambient temperature and pressure.\n\nIn the simulation of biological membranes, [[isotropic]] pressure control is not appropriate. For lipid bilayers, pressure control occurs under constant membrane area (NPAT) or constant surface tension \"gamma\" (NP\u03b3T).\n\n=== Generalized ensembles ===\n\nThe [[replica exchange]] method is a generalized ensemble. It was originally created to deal with the slow dynamics of disordered spin systems. It is also called parallel tempering. The replica exchange MD (REMD) formulation<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sugita |first1=Yuji |last2=Okamoto |first2=Yuko |title=Replica-exchange molecular dynamics method for protein folding |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |date=November 1999 |volume=314 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=141\u2013151 |doi=10.1016/S0009-2614(99)01123-9 |bibcode= 1999CPL...314..141S }}</ref> tries to overcome the multiple-minima problem by exchanging the temperature of non-interacting replicas of the system running at several temperatures.\n\n== Potentials in MD simulations ==\n{{Main|Interatomic potential|Force field (chemistry)|l2=Force field|Comparison of force field implementations}}\nA molecular dynamics simulation requires the definition of a [[function (mathematics)|potential function]], or a description of the terms by which the particles in the simulation will interact. In chemistry and biology this is usually referred to as a [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] and in materials physics as an [[interatomic potential]]. Potentials may be defined at many levels of physical accuracy; those most commonly used in chemistry are based on [[molecular mechanics]] and embody a [[classical mechanics]] treatment of particle-particle interactions that can reproduce structural and [[conformational change]]s but usually cannot reproduce [[chemical reaction]]s.\n\nThe reduction from a fully quantum description to a classical potential entails two main approximations. The first one is the [[Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation]], which states that the dynamics of electrons are so fast that they can be considered to react instantaneously to the motion of their nuclei. As a consequence, they may be treated separately. The second one treats the nuclei, which are much heavier than electrons, as point particles that follow classical Newtonian dynamics. In classical molecular dynamics, the effect of the electrons is approximated as one potential energy surface, usually representing the ground state.\n\nWhen finer levels of detail are needed, potentials based on [[quantum mechanics]] are used; some methods attempt to create hybrid [[QM/MM|classical/quantum]] potentials where the bulk of the system is treated classically but a small region is treated as a quantum system, usually undergoing a chemical transformation.\n\n=== Empirical potentials ===\n\nEmpirical potentials used in chemistry are frequently called [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]], while those used in materials physics are called [[interatomic potential]]s.\n\nMost [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] in chemistry are empirical and consist of a summation of bonded forces associated with [[chemical bond]]s, bond angles, and bond [[dihedral angle|dihedrals]], and non-bonded forces associated with [[van der Waals force]]s and [[electrostatic charge]]. Empirical potentials represent quantum-mechanical effects in a limited way through ad-hoc functional approximations. These potentials contain free parameters such as [[electrostatic charge|atomic charge]], van der Waals parameters reflecting estimates of [[atomic radius]], and equilibrium [[bond length]], angle, and dihedral; these are obtained by fitting against detailed electronic calculations (quantum chemical simulations) or experimental physical properties such as [[Young's modulus|elastic constants]], lattice parameters and [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] measurements.\n\nBecause of the non-local nature of non-bonded interactions, they involve at least weak interactions between all particles in the system. Its calculation is normally the bottleneck in the speed of MD simulations. To lower the computational cost, [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] employ numerical approximations such as shifted cutoff radii, [[reaction field method|reaction field]] algorithms, particle mesh [[Ewald summation]], or the newer particle\u2013particle-particle\u2013mesh ([[P3M]]).\n\nChemistry force fields commonly employ preset bonding arrangements (an exception being ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]]'' dynamics), and thus are unable to model the process of chemical bond breaking and reactions explicitly. On the other hand, many of the potentials used in physics, such as those based on the [[bond order potential|bond order formalism]] can describe several different coordinations of a system and bond breaking.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Sinnott |first1= S.

The simplest choice, employed in many popular [[force field (chemistry)|force fields]], is the \"pair potential\", in which the total potential energy can be calculated from the sum of energy contributions between pairs of atoms. Therefore, these force fields are also called \"additive force fields\". An example of such a pair potential is the non-bonded [[Lennard\u2013Jones potential]] (also termed the 6\u201312 potential), used for calculating van der Waals forces.\n\n:<math>\nU(r) = 4\\varepsilon \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6} \\right]\n</math>\n\nAnother example is the Born (ionic) model of the ionic lattice. The first term in the next equation is [[Coulomb's law]] for a pair of ions, the second term is the short-range repulsion explained by Pauli's exclusion principle and the final term is the dispersion interaction term. Usually, a simulation only includes the dipolar term, although sometimes the quadrupolar term is also included.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cruz |first1=Fernando J. A.

This is a consequence of the [[Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation]]. In excited states, chemical reactions or when a more accurate representation is needed, electronic behavior can be obtained from first principles by using a quantum mechanical method, such as [[density functional theory]]. This is named Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD). Due to the cost of treating the electronic degrees of freedom, the computational cost of these simulations is far higher than classical molecular dynamics. This implies that AIMD is limited to smaller systems and shorter times.\n\n''[[Ab initio]]'' [[quantum mechanical]] and [[Quantum chemistry|chemical]] methods may be used to calculate the [[potential energy surface|potential energy]] of a system on the fly, as needed for conformations in a trajectory. This calculation is usually made in the close neighborhood of the [[reaction coordinate]]. Although various approximations may be used, these are based on theoretical considerations, not on empirical fitting. ''Ab initio'' calculations produce a vast amount of information that is not available from empirical methods, such as density of electronic states or other electronic properties. A significant advantage of using ''ab initio'' methods is the ability to study reactions that involve breaking or formation of covalent bonds, which correspond to multiple electronic states.\n\n=== Hybrid QM/MM ===\n{{Main|QM/MM}}\nQM (quantum-mechanical) methods are very powerful. However, they are computationally expensive, while the MM (classical or molecular mechanics) methods are fast but suffer from several limits (require extensive parameterization; energy estimates obtained are not very accurate; cannot be used to simulate reactions where covalent bonds are broken/formed; and are limited in their abilities for providing accurate details regarding the chemical environment). A new class of method has emerged that combines the good points of QM (accuracy) and MM (speed) calculations. These methods are termed mixed or hybrid quantum-mechanical and molecular mechanics methods (hybrid QM/MM).<ref>The methodology for such methods was introduced by Warshel and coworkers. In the recent years have been pioneered by several groups including: [[Arieh Warshel]] ([[University of Southern California]]), Weitao Yang ([[Duke University]]), Sharon Hammes-Schiffer ([[The Pennsylvania State University]]), Donald Truhlar and Jiali Gao ([[University of Minnesota]]) and Kenneth Merz ([[University of Florida]]).</ref>\n\nThe most important advantage of hybrid QM/MM method is the speed. The cost of doing classical molecular dynamics (MM) in the most straightforward case scales O(n<sup>2</sup>), where n is the number of atoms in the system. This is mainly due to electrostatic interactions term (every particle interacts with every other particle). However, use of cutoff radius, periodic pair-list updates and more recently the variations of the particle-mesh Ewald's (PME) method has reduced this to between O(n) to O(n<sup>2</sup>). In other words, if a system with twice as many atoms is simulated then it would take between two and four times as much computing power. On the other hand, the simplest ''ab initio'' calculations typically scale O(n<sup>3</sup>) or worse (restricted [[Hartree\u2013Fock]] calculations have been suggested to scale ~O(n<sup>2.7</sup>)). To overcome the limit, a small part of the system is treated quantum-mechanically (typically active-site of an enzyme) and the remaining system is treated classically.\n\nIn more sophisticated implementations, QM/MM methods exist to treat both light nuclei susceptible to quantum effects (such as hydrogens) and electronic states. This allows generating hydrogen wave-functions (similar to electronic wave-functions). This methodology has been useful in investigating phenomena such as hydrogen tunneling. One example where QM/MM methods have provided new discoveries is the calculation of hydride transfer in the enzyme liver [[alcohol dehydrogenase]]. In this case, [[quantum tunneling]] is important for the hydrogen, as it determines the reaction rate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Billeter |first1=Salomon R. |last2=Webb |first2=Simon P. |last3=Agarwal |first3=Pratul K. |last4=Iordanov |first4=Tzvetelin |last5=Hammes-Schiffer |first5=Sharon |title=Hydride Transfer in Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase:\u00a0 Quantum Dynamics, Kinetic Isotope Effects, and Role of Enzyme Motion |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=November 2001 |volume=123 |issue=45 |pages=11262\u201311272 |doi=10.1021/ja011384b |pmid=11697969 }}</ref>\n\n=== Coarse-graining and reduced representations ===\n\nAt the other end of the detail scale are [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained]] and lattice models. Instead of explicitly representing every atom of the system, one uses \"pseudo-atoms\" to represent groups of atoms. MD simulations on very large systems may require such large computer resources that they cannot easily be studied by traditional all-atom methods. Similarly, simulations of processes on long timescales (beyond about 1 microsecond) are prohibitively expensive, because they require so many time steps. In these cases, one can sometimes tackle the problem by using reduced representations, which are also called [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last1=Kmiecik |first1=Sebastian |last2=Gront |first2=Dominik |last3=Kolinski |first3=Michal |last4=Wieteska |first4=Lukasz |last5=Dawid |first5=Aleksandra Elzbieta |last6=Kolinski |first6=Andrzej |title=Coarse-Grained Protein Models and Their Applications |journal=Chemical Reviews |date=22 June 2016 |volume=116 |issue=14 |pages=7898\u20137936 |doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00163 |pmid=27333362 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nExamples for coarse graining (CG) methods are discontinuous molecular dynamics (CG-DMD)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Voegler Smith |first1=Anne |last2=Hall |first2=Carol K. |title=?-Helix formation: Discontinuous molecular dynamics on an intermediate-resolution protein model |journal=Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics |date=15 August 2001 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=344\u2013360 |doi=10.1002/prot.1100 |pmid=11455608 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ding |first1=F |last2=Borreguero |first2=JM |last3=Buldyrey |first3=SV |last4=Stanley |first4=HE |last5=Dokholyan |first5=NV |title=Mechanism for the alpha-helix to beta-hairpin transition |journal=Proteins |date=1 November 2003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=220\u20138 |doi=10.1002/prot.10468 |pmid=14517973 }}</ref> and Go-models.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paci |first1=Emanuele |last2=Vendruscolo |first2=Michele |last3=Karplus |first3=Martin |title=Validity of G\u014d Models: Comparison with a Solvent-Shielded Empirical Energy Decomposition |journal=Biophysical Journal |date=December 2002 |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=3032\u20133038 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75308-3 |pmid=12496075 |pmc=1302383 |bibcode= 2002BpJ....83.3032P }}</ref> Coarse-graining is done sometimes taking larger pseudo-atoms.

For example, instead of treating all four atoms of a CH<sub>3</sub> methyl group explicitly (or all three atoms of CH<sub>2</sub> methylene group), one represents the whole group with one pseudo-atom. It must, of course, be properly parameterized so that its van der Waals interactions with other groups have the proper distance-dependence. Similar considerations apply to the bonds, angles, and torsions in which the pseudo-atom participates. In this kind of united atom representation, one typically eliminates all explicit hydrogen atoms except those that have the capability to participate in hydrogen bonds (''polar hydrogens''). An example of this is the [[CHARMM]] 19 force-field.\n\nThe polar hydrogens are usually retained in the model, because proper treatment of hydrogen bonds requires a reasonably accurate description of the directionality and the electrostatic interactions between the donor and acceptor groups. A hydroxyl group, for example, can be both a hydrogen bond donor, and a hydrogen bond acceptor, and it would be impossible to treat this with one OH pseudo-atom. About half the atoms in a protein or nucleic acid are non-polar hydrogens, so the use of united atoms can provide a substantial savings in computer time.\n\n== Incorporating solvent effects ==\nIn many simulations of a solute-solvent system the main focus is on the behavior of the solute with little interest of the solvent behavior particularly in those solvent molecules residing in regions far from the solute molecule.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molecular Modelling: Principles and Applications|last=Leach|first=Dr Andrew|date=30 January 2001|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780582382107|edition= 2nd|location=Harlow|language=English|id={{ASIN|0582382106|country=uk}} }}</ref> Solvents may influence the dynamic behavior of solutes via random collisions and by imposing a frictional drag on the motion of the solute through the solvent. The use of non-rectangular periodic boundary conditions, stochastic boundaries and solvent shells can all help reduce the number of solvent molecules required and enable a larger proportion of the computing time to be spent instead on simulating the solute. It is also possible to incorporate the effects of a solvent without needing any explicit solvent molecules present. One example of this approach is to use a [[Potential of mean force|potential mean force]] (PMF) which describes how the free energy changes as a particular coordinate is varied. The free energy change described by PMF contains the averaged effects of the solvent.\n\n== Long-range forces ==\nA long range interaction is an interaction in which the spatial interaction falls off no faster than <math>r^{-d}</math> where <math>d</math> is the dimensionality of the system. Examples include charge-charge interactions between ions and dipole-dipole interactions between molecules. Modelling these forces presents quite a challenge as they are significant over a distance which may be larger than half the box length with simulations of many thousands of particles. Though one solution would be to significantly increase the size of the box length, this brute force approach is less than ideal as the simulation would become computationally very expensive. Spherically truncating the potential is also out of the question as unrealistic behaviour may be observed when the distance is close to the cut off distance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Computer Simulation of Liquids|last=Allen|first=Michael P.|last2=Tildesley|first2=Dominic J.|date=2017-08-22|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198803201|edition= 2nd|location=|pages=216|language=English|id={{ASIN|0198803206|country=uk}} }}</ref>\n\n== Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) ==\n\nSteered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, or force probe simulations, apply forces to a protein in order to manipulate its structure by pulling it along desired degrees of freedom.

The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognised game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Fourth Round|fourth qualifying round]] for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of their group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media. Their home kit is primarily red and their away kit white, a reference to their [[Flag of Lebanon|national flag]]. After a steady decline in their [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA ranking]] from 1998 to 2016, Lebanon jumped 66 places (from 147th in 2016 to 81st in 2018) and reached their highest rank to date\u201477th\u2014in September 2018.

football]] since their inception in 1933. The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognised game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Fourth Round|fourth qualifying round]] for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of their group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media.

He uses the nickname '''Smegmaman''' for his matches.\n\n==Darting history==\nMatt Clark first started playing darts at the age of 19 at his local village [[pub]],<ref>[http://www.matt-superman-clark.co.uk/news/reports/matts_report.htm Matt Clark's December 2006 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729005255/http://www.matt-superman-clark.co.uk/news/reports/matts_report.htm |date=29 July 2008 }} from Matt Clark's official website, retrieved 23 July 2008</ref> and after a few years was playing for the [[Kent]] county team. At the age of 24 he began moving towards pro darts attending the Dutch Open where he made the quarter finals of the pairs and singles competitions. Clark appeared in the [[BDO World Darts Championship]] eight successive years, reaching the quarter-finals in 1996.\n\nHe switched to the PDC in 2004 and quickly reached the top 32 in the world rankings. He made his [[PDC World Darts Championship]] debut in 2006 and reached the second round, losing to eventual champion [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]]. He entered the 2007 tournament as the number 31 seed, but lost in the first round to [[Mick McGowan]]. In 2008, Clark lost in the first round to [[Roland Scholten]]. Despite losing, Clark won more legs than Scholten, Clark winning 12 to Scholten's 10. However, he gained revenge on Scholten having qualified for the [[2008 World Matchplay Darts|2008 World Matchplay]] through the Players Championship Order of Merit and defeating him 10\u20134 in the first round. He continued to defeat veteran [[Peter Manley]] 13\u20136 in an upset and reached the quarter-finals, his best performance in the competition, before being defeated by defending champion [[James Wade]], despite checking out at 161 which was the highest checkout of that year's tournament. Prior to the Matchplay Event Matt lost 3 stone in weight which forced him to change his throwing stance.\n\nClark suffered a first round exit in the [[2009 PDC World Darts Championship]], losing to [[Kevin Painter]] in a sudden leg death which Clark missed one dart at double 12 to win.\n\nAfter losing his PDC Tour Card at the end of 2017, Clark decided to play the some of the BDO Tour and the PDC Challenge Tour. A final in the Luxembourg Open and a quarter-final in the Belfry Open were followed by an agonising loss in the BDO World Championship qualifiers when he was one win from qualifying. Clark also made a quarter-final on the Challenge Tour in 2018 before re-entering PDC UK Q-School in January 2019. A last 16 exit on day two put him in a good position to win back his Tour Card, and he did it by right on the third day, beating [[Gavin Carlin]] 5\u20132 in the final to seal a two-year PDC Tour Card. Matt Clark also will be annihilated on Saturday 25th April 2020 in the PDC Home Tour tournament, the other three players in his group consist off Harry Ward, Martijn Kleermaker and Michael Smith.\n\n==World Championship Results==\n\n===BDO===\n* 1996: Quarter Final (lost to [[Les Wallace]] 1\u20134)\n* 1997: 1st Round (lost to [[Andy Fordham]] 2\u20133)\n* 1998: 1st Round (lost to [[Mervyn King (darts player)|Mervyn King]] 0\u20133)\n* 1999: 1st Round (lost to [[Paul Williams (darts player)|Paul Williams]] 2\u20133)\n* 2000: 2nd Round (lost to [[Chris Mason (darts player)|Chris Mason]] 2\u20133)\n* 2001: 2nd Round (lost to [[Kevin Painter]] 1\u20133)\n* 2002: 1st Round (lost to [[Marko Pusa]] 1\u20133)\n* 2003: 1st Round (lost to [[Raymond van Barneveld]] 1\u20133)\n\n===PDC===\n* 2006: 2nd Round (lost to [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] 1\u20134)\n* 2007: 1st Round (lost to [[Mick McGowan]] 1\u20133)\n* 2008: 1st Round (lost to [[Roland Scholten]] 2\u20133)\n* 2009: 1st Round (lost to [[Kevin Painter]] 2\u20133) \n* 2010: 1st Round (lost to [[Mervyn King (darts player)|Mervyn King]] 0\u20133)\n* 2014: 1st Round (lost to [[Vincent van der Voort]] 1\u20133)\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n{| border=\"1px\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border-color:#aaa; margin-bottom:0.5em;\" cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n|+ style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Key'''\n|-\n|style=\"background:#00ff00\"|'''{{abbr|W|Won tournament}}'''\n|style=\"background:#D8BFD8\"|&nbsp;{{abbr|F|Reached final}}&nbsp; \n|style=\"background:yellow\"|{{abbr|SF|Reached semifinal}}\n|style=\"background:#ffebcd\"|{{abbr|QF|Reached quarterfinal}}\n|style=\"background:#afeeee\"|{{abbr|&#35;R|Out in earlier round}}\n|style=\"background:#afeeee\"|{{abbr|RR|Round-robin}}\n|style=\"background:#afeeee\"|{{abbr|Prel.|Preliminary round}}\n|{{abbr|DNQ|Did not qualify}}\n|{{abbr|DNP|Did not participate}}\n|{{abbr|NH|Not held}}\n|}\n\n{{refbegin}}(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Prel.)

He uses the nickname '''Superman''' for his matches.\n\n==Darting history==\nMatt Clark first started playing darts at the age of 19 at his local village [[pub]],<ref>[http://www.matt-superman-clark.co.uk/news/reports/matts_report.htm Matt Clark's December 2006 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729005255/http://www.matt-superman-clark.co.uk/news/reports/matts_report.htm |date=29 July 2008 }} from Matt Clark's official website, retrieved 23 July 2008</ref> and after a few years was playing for the [[Kent]] county team. At the age of 24 he began moving towards pro darts attending the Dutch Open where he made the quarter finals of the pairs and singles competitions. Clark appeared in the [[BDO World Darts Championship]] eight successive years, reaching the quarter-finals in 1996.\n\nHe switched to the PDC in 2004 and quickly reached the top 32 in the world rankings. He made his [[PDC World Darts Championship]] debut in 2006 and reached the second round, losing to eventual champion [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]]. He entered the 2007 tournament as the number 31 seed, but lost in the first round to [[Mick McGowan]]. In 2008, Clark lost in the first round to [[Roland Scholten]]. Despite losing, Clark won more legs than Scholten, Clark winning 12 to Scholten's 10. However, he gained revenge on Scholten having qualified for the [[2008 World Matchplay Darts|2008 World Matchplay]] through the Players Championship Order of Merit and defeating him 10\u20134 in the first round. He continued to defeat veteran [[Peter Manley]] 13\u20136 in an upset and reached the quarter-finals, his best performance in the competition, before being defeated by defending champion [[James Wade]], despite checking out at 161 which was the highest checkout of that year's tournament. Prior to the Matchplay Event Matt lost 3 stone in weight which forced him to change his throwing stance.\n\nClark suffered a first round exit in the [[2009 PDC World Darts Championship]], losing to [[Kevin Painter]] in a sudden leg death which Clark missed one dart at double 12 to win.\n\nAfter losing his PDC Tour Card at the end of 2017, Clark decided to play the some of the BDO Tour and the PDC Challenge Tour. A final in the Luxembourg Open and a quarter-final in the Belfry Open were followed by an agonising loss in the BDO World Championship qualifiers when he was one win from qualifying. Clark also made a quarter-final on the Challenge Tour in 2018 before re-entering PDC UK Q-School in January 2019. A last 16 exit on day two put him in a good position to win back his Tour Card, and he did it by right on the third day, beating [[Gavin Carlin]] 5\u20132 in the final to seal a two-year PDC Tour Card. Matt Clark also will be annihilated on Saturday 25th April 2020 in the PDC Home Tour tournament, the other three players in his group consist off Harry Ward, Martijn Kleermaker and Michael Smith.\n\n==World Championship Results==\n\n===BDO===\n* 1996: Quarter Final (lost to [[Les Wallace]] 1\u20134)\n* 1997: 1st Round (lost to [[Andy Fordham]] 2\u20133)\n* 1998: 1st Round (lost to [[Mervyn King (darts player)|Mervyn King]] 0\u20133)\n* 1999: 1st Round (lost to [[Paul Williams (darts player)|Paul Williams]] 2\u20133)\n* 2000: 2nd Round (lost to [[Chris Mason (darts player)|Chris Mason]] 2\u20133)\n* 2001: 2nd Round (lost to [[Kevin Painter]] 1\u20133)\n* 2002: 1st Round (lost to [[Marko Pusa]] 1\u20133)\n* 2003: 1st Round (lost to [[Raymond van Barneveld]] 1\u20133)\n\n===PDC===\n* 2006: 2nd Round (lost to [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] 1\u20134)\n* 2007: 1st Round (lost to [[Mick McGowan]] 1\u20133)\n* 2008: 1st Round (lost to [[Roland Scholten]] 2\u20133)\n* 2009: 1st Round (lost to [[Kevin Painter]] 2\u20133) \n* 2010: 1st Round (lost to [[Mervyn King (darts player)|Mervyn King]] 0\u20133)\n* 2014: 1st Round (lost to [[Vincent van der Voort]] 1\u20133)\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n{| border=\"1px\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border-color:#aaa; margin-bottom:0.5em;\" cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n|+ style=\"text-align:left\" | '''Key'''\n|-\n|style=\"background:#00ff00\"|'''{{abbr|W|Won tournament}}'''\n|style=\"background:#D8BFD8\"|&nbsp;{{abbr|F|Reached final}}&nbsp; \n|style=\"background:yellow\"|{{abbr|SF|Reached semifinal}}\n|style=\"background:#ffebcd\"|{{abbr|QF|Reached quarterfinal}}\n|style=\"background:#afeeee\"|{{abbr|&#35;R|Out in earlier round}}\n|style=\"background:#afeeee\"|{{abbr|RR|Round-robin}}\n|style=\"background:#afeeee\"|{{abbr|Prel.|Preliminary round}}\n|{{abbr|DNQ|Did not qualify}}\n|{{abbr|DNP|Did not participate}}\n|{{abbr|NH|Not held}}\n|}\n\n{{refbegin}}(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Prel.)

From 1997, MTV Networks Europe established its regionalisation strategy launching localised channels across many European countries/regions.\n\nThis is a list of regional MTV channels still operating in Europe, West Asia, Africa, in order of launch:\n\n*[[MTV Germany]] (March 1997)\n*[[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]] (July 1997)\n*[[MTV Italy]] (September 1997)\n*[[MTV Russia]] (September 1998, relaunched October 2013)\n*[[MTV France]] (June 2000)\n*[[MTV Poland]] (July 2000)\n*[[MTV (Dutch TV channel)|MTV Netherlands]] (September 2000)\n*[[MTV Spain]] (September 2000)\n*[[MTV Romania]] (June 2002; closed February 2019)\n*[[MTV Portugal]] (July 2003)\n*[[MTV Flanders]] (February 2004)\n*[[MTV Ireland]] (February 2004)\n*[[MTV Denmark]] (May 2005)\n*[[MTV Finland]], [[MTV Sweden]], [[MTV Norway]] (September 2005)\n*[[MTV Hungary]] (October 2007)\n*[[MTV Israel]] (October 2007)\n*[[MTV Live HD]] (September 2008)\n*[[MTV Switzerland]] (April 2009)\n*[[MTV Africa|MTV South Africa]] (2015)\n\n==MTV branding==\nUpon its launch in Europe in the late 1980s, MTV Europe made use of MTV US's on-air identity. Overtime, MTV Europe gradually produced its own on-air identity throughout the 1990s. From 1997, MTV's regionalization throughout Europe brought about specialized on-air identity which reflected the tastes and influences from each region. As part of a global rebranding strategy, [[MTV Networks International]] decided to produce a new on-air identity that would air on all MTV channels around the world (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). On 1 July 2009 all 64 MTV channels globally began to share the same on-air branding. This branding made use of a standardised logo, idents and promos<ref name=\"universaleverything\">{{cite web |url=http://www.universaleverything.com/289 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705074052/http://www.universaleverything.com/289 |archive-date=5 July 2009 |url-status=dead |title=Universal Everything |accessdate=18 April 2014  }}</ref> (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). The on-air branding initiative was called '''Pop X1000''' reflecting the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department '''World Design Studio''' in [[Milan]] (home to both [[Fininvest]] and [[Mediaset]]), with additional designs added by other global departments throughout the year. The branding was overseen by [[Universal Everything]]. This branding was adopted by MTV Networks Europe, [[MTV Networks Asia]], [[MTV Networks Africa]] and [[MTV Networks Latin America]]. As part of MTV's rebrand awareness campaign MTV teamed up with Spanish retailer [[Zara (clothing)|ZARA]] in December 2009 to provide branded themed T-shirts and hoodies representing the \"Pop X 1000%\" campaign.<ref name=\"presse\">{{cite web |url=http://presse.mtv.de/scripts/presseinformationen.php3?ACTION=anzeigen&OFFSET=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207054229/http://www.presse.mtv.de/scripts/presseinformationen.php3?ACTION=anzeigen&OFFSET=1 |archive-date=7 February 2007 |url-status=dead |title=Presseservice MTV |author=Alexander Selck/Michael Trammer/Damian Hopa www.sethora.de |accessdate=18 April 2014  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.zara.com/mtv/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206121800/http://www.zara.com/mtv/ |date=6 December 2009 }}</ref> On 8 November 2010 MTV launched its third phase of idents.<ref name=\"creativereview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/november/mtv-55dsl-collaboration-yields-new-idents-and-t-shirts |title=Creative Review \u2013 MTV & 55DSL collaboration yields new idents and T-shirts |publisher=creativereview.co.uk |accessdate=18 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207232546/http://creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/november/mtv-55dsl-collaboration-yields-new-idents-and-t-shirts |archivedate=7 December 2010  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, MTV US rebranded its entire network of channels producing a revised version of the traditional MTV logo.

This came into effect on 1 October 2013.\n\nOn 25 June 2015, MTV International channels were rebranded with a new initiative to get more viewers involved with the channel. MTV launched MTVBump.com where viewers could upload short video clips which will air on MTV channels worldwide (excluding MTV US and MTV Canada). MTV also launched MTV Art Breaks where creative viewers can create special MTV idents. MTV would also launch MTV Creative, another initiative to coincide with MTV Bump.

In the past, the majority of MTV's channels were regulated by authorities based in the UK ([[Ofcom]]) and Poland ([[The National Broadcasting Council]]). However, due to the UK's impending exit from the [[European Union]] the company has relocated many of its broadcasting licenses from the UK to regulators based in the [[Czech Republic]] (RRTV) and the [[Netherlands]].<ref>https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2018/04/26/broadcasters-start-moving-licences-away-from-the-uk/</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Brexit]], all channels operating in the UK will remain under OFCOM, whilst all other channels operated by ViacomCBS International Media Networks for the rest of Europe will be regulated from Poland, Czech Republic and/or the Netherlands.

Overtime, MTV Europe gradually produced its own on-air identity throughout the 1990s. From 1997, MTV's regionalization throughout Europe brought about specialized on-air identity which reflected the tastes and influences from each region. As part of a global rebranding strategy, [[MTV Networks International]] decided to produce a new on-air identity that would air on all MTV channels around the world (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). On 1 July 2009 all 64 MTV channels globally began to share the same on-air branding. This branding made use of a standardised logo, idents and promos<ref name=\"universaleverything\">{{cite web |url=http://www.universaleverything.com/289 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705074052/http://www.universaleverything.com/289 |archive-date=5 July 2009 |url-status=dead |title=Universal Everything |accessdate=18 April 2014  }}</ref> (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). The on-air branding initiative was called '''Pop X1000''' reflecting the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department '''World Design Studio''' in [[Milan]] (home to both [[Fininvest]] and [[Mediaset]]), with additional designs added by other global departments throughout the year. The branding was overseen by [[Universal Everything]]. This branding was adopted by MTV Networks Europe, [[MTV Networks Asia]], [[MTV Networks Africa]] and [[MTV Networks Latin America]].

It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a [[infection|communicable disease]], but do not have a confirmed [[medical diagnosis]]. It is distinct from [[Isolation (health care)|medical isolation]], in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population. Quarantine considerations are often one aspect of [[border control]]. \n\nThe concept of quarantine has been known since biblical times, and is known to have been practised through history in various places. Notable quarantines in modern history include that of the village of [[Eyam]] in 1665 during the [[bubonic plague]] outbreak in England; [[American Samoa|East Samoa]] during the [[Spanish flu|1918 flu pandemic]]; the [[1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak]], and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nEthical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country. In some countries, quarantine is just one of many measures governed by legislation relating to the broader concept of [[biosecurity]]; for example [[biosecurity in Australia|Australian biosecurity]] is governed by the single overarching ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''.  ..........\n\n==Etymology and terminology ==\nThe word ''quarantine'' comes from ''quarantena'', meaning \"forty days\", used in the 14th\u201315th-centuries [[Venetian language]] and designating the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the [[Black Death]] plague [[epidemic]]; it followed the ''trentino'', or thirty-day isolation period, first imposed in 1377 in the [[Republic of Ragusa]], [[Dalmatia]] (modern [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia).<ref name=\"JSM17\"/><ref name=\"Eccles\">{{cite book|editor1=Ronald Eccles|editor2=Olaf Weber|title=Common cold|year=2009|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1|pages=210|edition=Online-Ausg.}}</ref><ref name=\"Mayer\">{{cite web |first= Johanna |last= Mayer |title= The Origin Of The Word 'Quarantine' |date=4 September 2018 |url= https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-word-quarantine/ |access-date=17 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"EID2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3201/eid1902.ET1902|title=Etymologia: Quarantine|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=263|doi-access=free}}</ref> \n\n[[Merriam-Webster]] gives various meanings to the noun form, including \"a period of 40 days\", several relating to ships, \"a state of enforced isolation\", and as \"a restriction on the [[Freedom of movement|movement of people]] and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of [[disease]] or [[Pest (organism)|pests]]\".

All but that of 1897 were concerned with [[cholera]]. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.\n\nThe Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the [[Suez Canal]] route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe. An additional convention was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 Text of the 1903 convention] British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, ''www.fco.gov.uk'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926134555/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 |date=26 September 2012}}, accessed 5 February 2020</ref>\n\nA multilateral international sanitary convention was concluded at Paris on 17 January 1912.<ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 4, pp. 282\u2013413.</ref> This convention was most comprehensive and was designated to replace all previous conventions on that matter.

It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of [[disease notification]] was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, and at the same time state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the [[Red Sea]], it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.\n\n====21st century====\nIn the 21st century, people suspected of carrying infectious diseases have been quarantined, as in the cases of [[Andrew Speaker]] (multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2007) and [[Kaci Hickox]] (Ebola, 2014). Moving infected patients to [[isolation ward]]s and home-based self-quarantine of people potentially exposed was the main way the [[Western African Ebola virus epidemic]] was ended in 2016; members of the 8th [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Emergency Committee criticised international travel restrictions imposed during the epidemic as ineffective due to difficulty of enforcement, and counterproductive as they slowed down aid efforts.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/ihr-ebola-8th-meeting/en/|title=Statement on the 8th meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa|author=|date=|publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> The [[People's Republic of China]] has employed mass quarantines \u2013 firstly of the city of [[Wuhan]] and subsequently of all of [[Hubei]] province (population 55.5 million) \u2013 in the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].\n\nNew developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the [[ambulance bus]], mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under lockdown.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Standard quarantine practices in different countries==\n{{Globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=February 2020}}\n===Australia===\n{{further|Biosecurity in Australia}}\nBiosecurity in Australia is governed by the ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''. The [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] (AQIS) is responsible for border inspection of products brought into Australia, and assesses the risks the products might harm Australian environment. No person, goods and vessels are permitted into Australia without clearance from AQIS. Visitors are required to fill in the information card on arriving in Australia. Besides other risk factors, visitors are required to declare what food and products made of wood and other natural materials they have. Visitors who fail to do so may be subject to a fine of A$220, or may face criminal prosecution and be fined up to A$100,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAustralia has very strict quarantine standards. Quarantine in northern Australia is especially important because of its proximity to South-East Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia.

The first legislation is enforced by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the ''Quarantine Act''.\n\nUnder the ''Quarantine Act'', all travellers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with [[communicable disease]]s or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], they must disclose their whereabouts to a [[Border Services Officer]]. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any [[peace officer]] may arrest without warrant.\n\nA QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveller, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveller who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.\n\nUnder the ''Health of Animals Act'' and ''Plant Protection Act'', inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.\n\nEach province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder the ''Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance'' (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe law allows for a health officer who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.\n\nUnder the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the [[Civil Aid Service]], or member of the [[Auxiliary Medical Service]] can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nTo reduce the risk of introducing [[rabies]] from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|HM Customs and Excise]] pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as [[Pet Passports]], where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate [[vaccine|vaccinations]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad#countries-and-territories Bringing your pet dog, cat or ferret to the UK] ''www.gov.uk'', accessed 27 January 2020</ref>\n\n====British maritime quarantine rules 1711\u20131896====\nThe plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the Quarantine Act 1710 (''[[9 Ann.]]'') The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the [[Baltic states]]. The second act of 1721 was due to the prevalence of plague at [[Marseille]] and other places in [[Provence, France]]. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in [[continental Europe]], and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in [[Messina]]. In 1752 a rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into an act regulating trade with [[the Levant]], and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic states. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine Act was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823\u201324 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act making quarantine only at discretion of the [[privy council]], which recognised yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865\u201366, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean [[bill of health]] from the [[Black Sea]] and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.<ref name=Booker>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7OoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&lpg=PT5&dq= John Booker, ''Maritime Quarantine: The British Experience, c.1650\u20131900,'' in ''The History of Medicine in Context,'' Routledge, 2016.]{{ISBN|1351919849}} ''books.google.com'', accessed 6 February 2020</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an [[indemnity]]. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a \"foul bill\" (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the [[lazaret]]s of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 [[Stangate]] Creek (on the [[Medway]]) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of [[Hulk (ship type)|floating hulks]] were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to [[dew]]s) having been done previously on the ship's deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of [[Customs|Royal Customs]] and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four [[league (unit)|leagues]] of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland.<ref name=Booker/>\n\nAfter 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with [[hide (skin)|hides]] from [[Mogador]] in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the [[Nore]], the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harbouring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each instalment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the [[Public Health Act]] of 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act of 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the [[Local Government Board]] the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the [[Public Health Act 1875]].<ref name=Booker/>\n\nBritish regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to [[yellow fever]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]]. Officers of the Customs, as well as of [[Coast Guard|Royal Coast Guard]] and the [[Board of Trade]] (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the [[Port authority|port sanitary authority]]. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and [[bilge-water]] and [[Sailing ballast|water-ballast]] pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention.

It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a [[infection|communicable disease]], but do not have a confirmed [[medical diagnosis]]. It is distinct from [[Isolation (health care)|medical isolation]], in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population. Quarantine considerations are often one aspect of [[border control]]. \n\nThe concept of quarantine has been known since biblical times, and is known to have been practised through history in various places. Notable quarantines in modern history include that of the village of [[Eyam]] in 1665 during the [[bubonic plague]] outbreak in England; [[American Samoa|East Samoa]] during the [[Spanish flu|1918 flu pandemic]]; the [[1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak]], and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nEthical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country. In some countries, quarantine is just one of many measures governed by legislation relating to the broader concept of [[biosecurity]]; for example [[biosecurity in Australia|Australian biosecurity]] is governed by the single overarching ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''.\n\n==Etymology and terminology ==\nThe word ''quarantine'' comes from ''quarantena'', meaning \"forty days\", used in the 14th\u201315th-centuries [[Venetian language]] and designating the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the [[Black Death]] plague [[epidemic]]; it followed the ''trentino'', or thirty-day isolation period, first imposed in 1377 in the [[Republic of Ragusa]], [[Dalmatia]] (modern [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia).<ref name=\"JSM17\"/><ref name=\"Eccles\">{{cite book|editor1=Ronald Eccles|editor2=Olaf Weber|title=Common cold|year=2009|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1|pages=210|edition=Online-Ausg.}}</ref><ref name=\"Mayer\">{{cite web |first= Johanna |last= Mayer |title= The Origin Of The Word 'Quarantine' |date=4 September 2018 |url= https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-word-quarantine/ |access-date=17 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"EID2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3201/eid1902.ET1902|title=Etymologia: Quarantine|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=263|doi-access=free}}</ref> \n\n[[Merriam-Webster]] gives various meanings to the noun form, including \"a period of 40 days\", several relating to ships, \"a state of enforced isolation\", and as \"a restriction on the [[Freedom of movement|movement of people]] and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of [[disease]] or [[Pest (organism)|pests]]\".

All but that of 1897 were concerned with [[cholera]]. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.\n\nThe Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the [[Suez Canal]] route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe. An additional convention was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 Text of the 1903 convention] British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, ''www.fco.gov.uk'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926134555/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 |date=26 September 2012}}, accessed 5 February 2020</ref>\n\nA multilateral international sanitary convention was concluded at Paris on 17 January 1912.<ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 4, pp. 282\u2013413.</ref> This convention was most comprehensive and was designated to replace all previous conventions on that matter.

It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of [[disease notification]] was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, and at the same time state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the [[Red Sea]], it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.\n\n====21st century====\nIn the 21st century, people suspected of carrying infectious diseases have been quarantined, as in the cases of [[Andrew Speaker]] (multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2007) and [[Kaci Hickox]] (Ebola, 2014). Moving infected patients to [[isolation ward]]s and home-based self-quarantine of people potentially exposed was the main way the [[Western African Ebola virus epidemic]] was ended in 2016; members of the 8th [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Emergency Committee criticised international travel restrictions imposed during the epidemic as ineffective due to difficulty of enforcement, and counterproductive as they slowed down aid efforts.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/ihr-ebola-8th-meeting/en/|title=Statement on the 8th meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa|author=|date=|publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> The [[People's Republic of China]] has employed mass quarantines \u2013 firstly of the city of [[Wuhan]] and subsequently of all of [[Hubei]] province (population 55.5 million) \u2013 in the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].\n\nNew developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the [[ambulance bus]], mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under lockdown.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Standard quarantine practices in different countries==\n{{Globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=February 2020}}\n===Australia===\n{{further|Biosecurity in Australia}}\nBiosecurity in Australia is governed by the ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''. The [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] (AQIS) is responsible for border inspection of products brought into Australia, and assesses the risks the products might harm Australian environment. No person, goods and vessels are permitted into Australia without clearance from AQIS. Visitors are required to fill in the information card on arriving in Australia. Besides other risk factors, visitors are required to declare what food and products made of wood and other natural materials they have. Visitors who fail to do so may be subject to a fine of A$220, or may face criminal prosecution and be fined up to A$100,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAustralia has very strict quarantine standards. Quarantine in northern Australia is especially important because of its proximity to South-East Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia.

The first legislation is enforced by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the ''Quarantine Act''.\n\nUnder the ''Quarantine Act'', all travellers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with [[communicable disease]]s or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], they must disclose their whereabouts to a [[Border Services Officer]]. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any [[peace officer]] may arrest without warrant.\n\nA QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveller, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveller who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.\n\nUnder the ''Health of Animals Act'' and ''Plant Protection Act'', inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.\n\nEach province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder the ''Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance'' (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe law allows for a health officer who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.\n\nUnder the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the [[Civil Aid Service]], or member of the [[Auxiliary Medical Service]] can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nTo reduce the risk of introducing [[rabies]] from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|HM Customs and Excise]] pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as [[Pet Passports]], where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate [[vaccine|vaccinations]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad#countries-and-territories Bringing your pet dog, cat or ferret to the UK] ''www.gov.uk'', accessed 27 January 2020</ref>\n\n====British maritime quarantine rules 1711\u20131896====\nThe plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the Quarantine Act 1710 (''[[9 Ann.]]'') The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the [[Baltic states]]. The second act of 1721 was due to the prevalence of plague at [[Marseille]] and other places in [[Provence, France]]. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in [[continental Europe]], and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in [[Messina]]. In 1752 a rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into an act regulating trade with [[the Levant]], and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic states. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine Act was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823\u201324 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act making quarantine only at discretion of the [[privy council]], which recognised yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865\u201366, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean [[bill of health]] from the [[Black Sea]] and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.<ref name=Booker>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7OoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&lpg=PT5&dq= John Booker, ''Maritime Quarantine: The British Experience, c.1650\u20131900,'' in ''The History of Medicine in Context,'' Routledge, 2016.]{{ISBN|1351919849}} ''books.google.com'', accessed 6 February 2020</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an [[indemnity]]. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a \"foul bill\" (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the [[lazaret]]s of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 [[Stangate]] Creek (on the [[Medway]]) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of [[Hulk (ship type)|floating hulks]] were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to [[dew]]s) having been done previously on the ship's deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of [[Customs|Royal Customs]] and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four [[league (unit)|leagues]] of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland.<ref name=Booker/>\n\nAfter 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with [[hide (skin)|hides]] from [[Mogador]] in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the [[Nore]], the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harbouring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each instalment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the [[Public Health Act]] of 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act of 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the [[Local Government Board]] the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the [[Public Health Act 1875]].<ref name=Booker/>\n\nBritish regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to [[yellow fever]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]]. Officers of the Customs, as well as of [[Coast Guard|Royal Coast Guard]] and the [[Board of Trade]] (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the [[Port authority|port sanitary authority]]. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and [[bilge-water]] and [[Sailing ballast|water-ballast]] pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention.
