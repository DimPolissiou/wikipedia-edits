To allow him to accept that post, he was given a temporary [[Dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]] from his religious vows on the grounds of poor health and love of Humanistic studies, though he remained a priest. [[Pope Leo X]] later made the dispensation permanent, a considerable privilege at the time.\n\n==Education and scholarship==\n[[File:Rotterdam standbeeld Erasmus.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of Erasmus in Rotterdam. It was created by [[Hendrick de Keyser]] in 1622, replacing a stone statue of 1557.]]\n\nIn 1495, with Bishop Henry's consent and a stipend, Erasmus went on to study at the [[University of Paris]], in the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu]], a centre of reforming zeal, under the direction of the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Jan Standonck]], of whose rigors he complained. The University was then the chief seat of [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] learning but already coming under the influence of [[Renaissance]] humanism. For instance, Erasmus became an intimate friend of an Italian humanist [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]], poet and \"professor of humanity\" in Paris.\n\nThe chief centres of Erasmus's activity were [[Paris]], [[Leuven]] (in the [[Duchy of Brabant]], now in [[Belgium]]), [[England]], and Basel; yet he never belonged firmly in any one of these places. In 1499 he was invited to England by [[William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy]], who offered to accompany him on his trip to England. According to Thomas Penn, Erasmus was \"ever susceptible to the charms of attractive, well-connected, and rich young men\".<ref>Thomas Penn, ''The Winter King'', Penguin, 2013</ref> His time in England was fruitful in the making of lifelong friendships with the leaders of English thought in the days of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]: [[John Colet]], [[Thomas More]], [[John Fisher]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[William Grocyn]]. At the [[University of Cambridge]], he was the [[Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity]] and had the option of spending the rest of his life as an English [[professor]]. He stayed at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], from 1510 to 1515.<ref>{{acad|id=ERSS465D|name=Erasmus, Desiderius}}</ref> His rooms were in the \"I\" staircase of Old Court, and he famously hated English ale and English weather.\n\nErasmus suffered from poor health and complained that Queens' could not supply him with enough decent wine (wine was the Renaissance medicine for gallstones, from which Erasmus suffered). Until the early 20th century, Queens' College used to have a corkscrew that was purported to be \"Erasmus' corkscrew\", which was a third of a metre long; even today the college still has what it calls \"Erasmus' chair\".<ref>John Twigg, A History of Queens' College, Cambridge 1448\u20131986 (Woodbridge, Suff.: Boydell Press, 1987).</ref> Today Queens' College has an Erasmus Building and an Erasmus Room. His legacy is marked for someone who complained bitterly about the lack of comforts and luxuries to which he was accustomed. As Queens' was an unusually humanist-leaning institution in the 16th century, [[Queens' College Old Library]] still houses many first editions of Erasmus' publications, many of which were acquired during that period by bequest or purchase, including Erasmus' New Testament translation, which is signed by friend and Polish religious reformer [[Jan Laski|Jan \u0141aski]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Old Library Collections|website=Queens' College Cambridge.

Erasmus was particularly impressed by the Bible teaching of [[John Colet]], who pursued a style more akin to the [[church fathers]] than the [[Scholastics]]. This prompted him, upon his return from England, to master the Greek language, which would enable him to study theology on a more profound level and to prepare a new edition of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate|Bible translation]]. On one occasion he wrote to Colet: <blockquote>\nI cannot tell you, dear Colet, how I hurry on, with all sails set, to holy literature. How I dislike everything that keeps me back, or retards me.<ref name = \"cmsmlw\"/>\n</blockquote>Despite a chronic shortage of money, he succeeded in learning Greek by an intensive, day-and-night study of three years, continuously begging his friends to send him books and money for teachers in his letters.<ref>Huizinga, Dutch edition, pp. 52\u201353.</ref> Discovery in 1506 of [[Lorenzo Valla]]'s ''New Testament Notes'' encouraged Erasmus to continue the study of the New Testament.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Anderson\n | first=Marvin\n | title=Erasmus the Exegete\n | journal=Concordia Theeological Monthly\n | volume=40\n | issue=11\n | year=1969\n | pages=722\u201346\n}}\n</ref>\n\nErasmus preferred to live the life of an independent scholar and made a conscious effort to avoid any actions or formal ties that might inhibit his freedom of intellect and literary expression. Throughout his life, he was offered positions of honor and profit in academia but declined them all, preferring the uncertain but sufficient rewards of independent literary activity. He did however assist his friend John Colet by authoring Greek textbooks and procuring members of staff for the newly established [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/about/history |title = History}}</ref> From 1506 to 1509, he was in Italy: in 1506 he graduated as [[Doctor of Divinity]] at the [[Turin]] [[University of Turin|University]], and he spent part of the time as a proofreader at the publishing house of [[Aldine Press|Aldus Manutius]] in [[Venice]]. According to his letters, he was associated with the Venetian natural philosopher, [[Giulio Camillo]],<ref>''Opus Epistolarum Des. Erasmi Roterdami'', Ed. H.M.Allen, (Oxford University Press, 1937), Ep. 3032: 219\u201322; 2682: 8\u201313.</ref> but, apart from this, he had a less active association with Italian scholars than might have been expected.\n\nHis residence at Leuven, where he lectured at the [[Old University of Leuven|University]], exposed Erasmus to much criticism from those ascetics, academics and clerics hostile to the principles of literary and religious reform and the loose norms of the Renaissance adherents to which he was devoting his life. In 1517, he supported the foundation at the University, by his friend [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]], of the Collegium Trilingue for the study of [[Hebrew]], Latin, and Greek\u2014after the model of the College of the Three Languages at the [[Complutense University of Madrid#Early history|University of Alcal\u00e1]]. However, feeling that the lack of sympathy that prevailed at Leuven at that time was actually a form of mental persecution, he sought refuge in Basel, where under the shelter of Swiss hospitality he could express himself freely. Admirers from all quarters of Europe visited him there and he was surrounded by devoted friends, notably developing a lasting association with the great publisher [[Johann Froben]].\n\nOnly when he had mastered Latin did he begin to express himself on major contemporary themes in [[literature]] and [[religion]]. He felt called upon to use his learning in a purification of the doctrine by returning to the historic documents and original languages of sacred Scripture. He tried to free the methods of scholarship from the rigidity and formalism of medieval traditions, but he was not satisfied with this. His revolt against certain forms of [[Christian monasticism]] and scholasticism was not based on doubts about the truth of doctrine, nor from hostility to the organization of the Church itself, nor from rejection of [[celibacy]] or monastic lifestyles. He saw himself as a preacher of righteousness by an appeal to reason, applied frankly and without fear of the [[magisterium]]. He always intended to remain faithful to Catholic doctrine and therefore was convinced he could criticize frankly virtually everyone and everything. Aloof from entangling obligations, Erasmus was the centre of the literary movement of his time, corresponding with more than five hundred men in the worlds of politics and of thought.\n\n==Spain's Polyglot Bible and Erasmus' Greek New Testament==\n===The First Translation===\nIn 1502, in Spain, Cardinal [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]] had put together a team of Spanish translators to create a Compilation of a Bible in four languages, Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin. Translators for Greek were commissioned from Greece itself and worked closely with Latinists. Cardinal Cisneros's team completed and printed the full new testament, including the Greek translation, in 1514. To do so they developed specific types to print Greek. Cisneros informed Erasmus of the works going on in Spain and may have sent a printed version of the New Testament to him. However, the Spanish team wanted the entire Bible to be released as one single work and withdrew from publication.\n\nThe information and the delay allowed Erasmus to request a \"Publication Privilege\" of four years for the Greek New Testament to ensure that his work would be published first. He obtained it in 1516 from both [[Pope Leo X]], to whom he would dedicate his work, and [[Emperor Maximilian I]]. Erasmus' Greek New Testament was published first, in 1516, forcing the Spanish team of Cisneros to wait until 1520 to publish their [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible]].<ref>Mendoza, J. Carlos Vizuete; Llamazares, Fernando; S\u00e1nchez, Julio Mart\u00edn; Mancha, Universidad de Castilla-La (2002).

Univ de Castilla La Mancha</ref><ref>Bruce Metzger, The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 102.</ref>\n\nIt is hard to say if Erasmus' actions had an effect on delaying the publication of Complutensian Polyglot, causing the Spanish team to take more time, or if it made no difference in their perfectionism. The Spanish copy was approved for publication by the Pope in 1520; however, it was not released until 1522 due to the team's insistence on reviewing and editing. Only fifteen errors have been found in the entire six volumes and four languages of Cisneros's bible, an extraordinarily low number for the time. The fear of them publishing first, though, affected Erasmus's work, rushing him to printing and causing him to forego editing. The result was a large number of translation mistakes, transcription errors, and typos, that required further editions to be printed (see \"[[Erasmus#Spanish polyglot Bible and Erasmus' Greek New Testament#Publication and editions|publication]]\").<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">\"Epistle 694\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus Volume 5'', 167. The Latin is ''pr\u0153cipitatum fuit verius quam editum''.</ref>\n\n===The Translation of Erasmus===\nErasmus had been working for years on two projects: a collation of Greek texts and a fresh Latin New Testament. In 1512, he began his work on this Latin New Testament. He collected all the Vulgate manuscripts he could find to create a [[critical edition]]. Then he polished the language. He declared, \"It is only fair that Paul should address the Romans in somewhat better Latin.\"<ref>\"Epistle 695\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus Vol. 5: Letters 594 to 841, 1517\u20131518'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 172.</ref> In the earlier phases of the project, he never mentioned a Greek text:\n\n<blockquote>My mind is so excited at the thought of emending Jerome\u2019s text, with notes, that I seem to myself inspired by some god. I have already almost finished emending him by collating a large number of ancient manuscripts, and this I am doing at enormous personal expense.<ref>\"Epistle 273\" in Collected ''Works of Erasmus Vol. 2: Letters 142 to 297, 1501\u20131514'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated Wallace K. Ferguson; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 253.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile his intentions for publishing a fresh Latin translation are clear, it is less clear why he included the Greek text. Though some speculate that he intended to produce a critical Greek text or that he wanted to beat the Complutensian Polyglot into print, there is no evidence to support this. He wrote, \"There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me.\"<ref>\"Epistle 305\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus. Vol. 3: Letters 298 to 445, 1514\u20131516'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 32.</ref> He further demonstrated the reason for the inclusion of the Greek text when defending his work:\n\n<blockquote>But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they say, even to a blind man, that often through the translator\u2019s clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes, which we see happen every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep.<ref>\"Epistle 337\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus'' Vol. 3, 134.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSo he included the Greek text to permit qualified readers to verify the quality of his Latin version. But by first calling the final product ''Novum Instrumentum omne'' (\"All of the New Teaching\") and later ''Novum Testamentum omne'' (\"All of the New Testament\") he also indicated clearly that he considered a text in which the Greek and the Latin versions were consistently comparable to be the essential core of the church's New Testament tradition.\n\n===Contribution===\nIn a way it is legitimate to say that Erasmus \"synchronized\" or \"unified\" the Greek and the Latin traditions of the New Testament by producing an updated translation of both simultaneously. Both being part of canonical tradition, he clearly found it necessary to ensure that both were actually present in the same content. In modern terminology, he made the two traditions \"compatible\". This is clearly evidenced by the fact that his Greek text is not just the basis for his Latin translation, but also the other way round: there are numerous instances where he edits the Greek text to reflect his Latin version. For instance, since the last six verses of ''[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]'' were missing from his Greek manuscript, Erasmus translated the Vulgate's text back into Greek. Erasmus also translated the Latin text into Greek wherever he found that the Greek text and the accompanying commentaries were mixed up, or where he simply preferred the Vulgate's reading to the Greek text.<ref>E.g. at Acts 9:6.

After comparing what writings he could find, Erasmus wrote corrections between the lines of the manuscripts he was using (among which was [[Minuscule 2]]) and sent them as proofs to Froben.<ref name=\"SH\">[http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php?authorID=schaff&bookID=encyc02&page=106&view= \"History of the Printed Text\"], in: ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. II: Basilica \u2013 Chambers'', p. 106 ff.</ref> His hurried effort was published by his friend [[Johann Froben]] of Basel in 1516 and thence became the first published Greek New Testament, the ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]], diligenter ab Erasmo Rot. Recognitum et Emendatum''. Erasmus used several Greek manuscript sources because he did not have access to a single complete manuscript. Most of the manuscripts were, however, late Greek manuscripts of the Byzantine textual family and Erasmus used the oldest manuscript the least because \"he was afraid of its supposedly erratic text.\"<ref>Bruce Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'', Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 102.</ref> He also ignored much older and better manuscripts that were at his disposal.<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) ''Tyndale's Testament'', Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, p. 28.</ref>\n\nIn the second (1519) edition, the more familiar term ''Testamentum'' was used instead of ''Instrumentum''. This edition was used by [[Martin Luther]] in his [[Luther Bible|German translation of the Bible]], written for people who could not understand Latin. Together, the first and second editions sold 3,300 copies. By comparison, only 600 copies of the Complutensian Polyglot were ever printed. The first and second edition texts did not include the passage (1 John 5:7\u20138) that has become known as the [[Comma Johanneum]]. Erasmus had been unable to find those verses in any Greek manuscript, but one was supplied to him during production of the third edition.  The Catholic Church decreed that the ''Comma Johanneum'' was open to dispute (2 June 1927), and it is rarely included in modern scholarly translations.\n\nThe third edition of 1522 was probably used by [[Tyndale]] for the first English New Testament (Worms, 1526) and was the basis for the 1550 Robert Stephanus edition used by the translators of the [[Geneva Bible]] and [[King James Version]] of the English Bible. Erasmus published a fourth edition in 1527 containing parallel columns of Greek, Latin Vulgate and Erasmus' Latin texts. In this edition Erasmus also supplied the Greek text of the last six verses of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] (which he had translated from Latin back into Greek in his first edition) from [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Cardinal Ximenez]]'s ''[[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Biblia Complutensis]]''. In 1535 Erasmus published the fifth (and final) edition which dropped the Latin Vulgate column but was otherwise similar to the fourth edition. Later versions of the Greek New Testament by others, but based on Erasmus' Greek New Testament, became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nErasmus dedicated his work to [[Pope Leo X]] as a patron of learning and regarded this work as his chief service to the cause of Christianity. Immediately afterwards, he began the publication of his ''[[Paraphrases of Erasmus|Paraphrases of the New Testament]]'', a popular presentation of the contents of the several books. These, like all of his writings, were published in Latin but were quickly translated into other languages with his encouragement.\n\nErasmus, in his capacity as humanist editor, advised major printers such as [[Aldus Manutius]] on which manuscripts to publish.<ref>Murray, Stuart. 2009. The library: an illustrated history. Chicago, ALA Editions</ref>\n\n==Beginnings of Protestantism==\n\n===Attempts at impartiality in dispute===\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] began in the year following the publication of his [[Novum Instrumentum omne|edition of the Greek New Testament]] (1516) and tested Erasmus' character. The issues between the [[Catholic Church]] and the growing religious movement which would later become known as [[Protestantism]], had become so clear that few could escape the summons to join the debate. Erasmus, at the height of his literary fame, was inevitably called upon to take sides, but partisanship was foreign to his nature and his habits. Despite all his [[Criticism of the Catholic Church|criticism of clerical corruption and abuses within the Catholic Church]],<ref name=\"Hoffmann 1989\"/> which lasted for years and was also directed towards many of the Church's basic doctrines,<ref name=\"Dixon 2012\"/> Erasmus shunned the Reformation movement along with its most [[Radical Reformation|radical and reactionary offshoots]],<ref name=\"Hoffmann 1989\"/>{{quotation needed|date=March 2020}}<!--Applies to the description of some offshoots as 'reactionary'. Also, are those the same as the radical offshoots?--> and sided with neither party.<ref name=\"Hoffmann 1989\"/>\n\nThe world had laughed at his [[satire]], but few had interfered with his activities. He believed that his work so far had commended itself to the best minds and also to the dominant powers in the religious world. Erasmus did not build a large body of supporters with his letters. He chose to write in Greek and Latin, the languages of scholars. His critiques reached an elite but small audience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Peter G.|title=European History in Perspective: The Long European Reformation|year=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-333-64451-5|page=70}}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement with Luther===\n\"Free will does not exist\", according to Luther in his letter ''[[w:On the Bondage of the Will|De Servo Arbitrio]]'' to Erasmus translated into German by [[Justus Jonas]] (1526), in that sin makes human beings completely incapable of bringing themselves to God. Noting Luther's criticism of the Catholic Church, Erasmus described him as \"a mighty trumpet of gospel truth\" while agreeing, \"It is clear that many of the reforms for which Luther calls are urgently needed.\"<ref name=\"Galli, Mark 2000, p. 344\">Galli, Mark, and Olsen, Ted. 131 Christians Everyone Should Know. Nashville: Holman Reference, 2000, p. 344.</ref> He had great respect for Luther, and Luther spoke with admiration of Erasmus' superior learning. Luther hoped for his cooperation in a work which seemed only the natural outcome of his own. In their early correspondence, Luther expressed boundless admiration for all Erasmus had done in the cause of a sound and reasonable Christianity and urged him to join the Lutheran party. Erasmus declined to commit himself, arguing that to do so would endanger his position as a leader in the movement for pure scholarship which he regarded as his purpose in life. Only as an independent scholar could he hope to influence the reform of religion. When Erasmus hesitated to support him, the straightforward Luther became angered that Erasmus was avoiding the responsibility due either to [[cowardice]] or a lack of purpose. However, any hesitancy on the part of Erasmus stemmed, not from lack of courage or conviction, but rather from a concern over the mounting disorder and violence of the reform movement. To [[Philip Melanchthon]] in 1524 he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I know nothing of your church; at the very least it contains people who will, I fear, overturn the whole system and drive the princes into using force to restrain good men and bad alike. The gospel, the word of God, faith, Christ, and Holy Spirit \u2013 these words are always on their lips; look at their lives and they speak quite another language.<ref>{{cite book| chapter=Letter of September 6, 1524| title= Collected Works of Erasmus| year= 1992 | publisher=University of Toronto Press| volume=10| isbn= 0-8020-5976-7 |page= 380 | chapter-url= https://books.google.com/?id=bYVEgXbiunkC&pg=PA380&dq=%22gospel,+the+word+of+God,+faith,+Christ,+and+Holy+Spirit%22#v=onepage&q=%22gospel%2C%20the%20word%20of%20God%2C%20faith%2C%20Christ%2C%20and%20Holy%20Spirit%22&f=false}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAgain, in 1529, he writes \u201cAn epistle against those who falsely boast they are Evangelicals\u201d<ref>Epistola contra quosdam qui se falso iactant evangelicos.</ref> to Vulturius Neocomus ([[w:Gerard Geldenhouwer|Gerardus Geldenhouwer]]).

In book I of his ''Hyperaspistes'' he puts the matter bluntly to Luther:\n<blockquote>We are dealing with this: Would a stable mind depart from the opinion handed down by so many men famous for holiness and miracles, depart from the decisions of the Church, and commit our souls to the faith of someone like you who has sprung up just now with a few followers, although the leading men of your flock do not agree either with you or among themselves \u2013 indeed though you do not even agree with yourself, since in this same ''Assertion''<ref>A reference to Luther's ''Assertio omnium articulorum per bullam Leonis X. novissimam damnatorum'' (Assertion of all the Articles condemned by the Bull of Leo X, 1520), [[Weimar edition of Martin Luther's works|WA]] VII.</ref> you say one thing in the beginning and something else later on, recanting what you said before.<ref>''Collected Works of Erasmus, Controversies: De Libero Arbitrio / Hyperaspistes I'', Peter Macardle, Clarence H.

Erasmus, they said, had laid the egg, and Luther had hatched it. Erasmus wittily dismissed the charge, claiming that Luther had hatched a different bird entirely.<ref>[http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/reynoldserasmusresponsibleluther.pdf ''Concordia Theological Journal''] Was Erasmus Responsible for Luther?

One of the topics he dealt with was free will, a crucial question. In his ''[[De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio]]'' (1524), he lampoons the Lutheran view on free will. He lays down both sides of the argument impartially. The \"Diatribe\" did not encourage any definite action; this was its merit to the Erasmians and its fault in the eyes of the Lutherans. In response, Luther wrote his ''De servo arbitrio'' ([[On the Bondage of the Will]]) (1525), which attacks the \"Diatribe\" and Erasmus himself, going so far as to claim that Erasmus was not a Christian. Erasmus responded with a lengthy, two-part ''Hyperaspistes'' (1526\u201327). In this controversy Erasmus lets it be seen that he would like to claim more for free will than St. Paul and St. Augustine seem to allow according to Luther's interpretation.<ref>Britannica Online Encyclopedia, Desiderius Erasmus ''Dutch humanist and scholar'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/191015/Desiderius-Erasmus/59231/The-Protestant-challenge#ref=ref24610The Protestant challenge]</ref> For Erasmus the essential point is that humans have the freedom of choice.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Watson\n | first=Philip\n | title=Erasmus, Luther and Aquinas\n | journal=Concordia Theological Monthly\n | volume=40\n | issue=11\n | year=1969\n | pages=747\u201358\n }}work\n</ref> The conclusions Erasmus reached drew upon a large array of notable authorities, including, from the Patristic period, Origen, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine, in addition to many leading Scholastic authors, such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. The content of Erasmus' works also engaged with later thought on the state of the question, including the perspectives of the ''via moderna'' school and of Lorenzo Valla, whose ideas he rejected.\n\nAs the popular response to Luther gathered momentum, the social disorders, which Erasmus dreaded and Luther disassociated himself from, began to appear, including the [[German Peasants' War]], the [[Anabaptist]] disturbances in Germany and in the Low Countries, [[iconoclasm]] and the [[radicalization]] of peasants across Europe. If these were the outcomes of reform, he was thankful that he had kept out of it. Yet he was ever more bitterly accused of having started the whole \"tragedy\" (as the Catholics dubbed Protestantism).\n\nWhen the city of Basel definitely adopted the Reformation in 1529, Erasmus gave up his residence there and settled in the imperial town of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]].\n\n[[File:Hans Holbein d. J. - Erasmus - Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Erasmus by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]. [[Louvre]], Paris.]]\n\n===Religious toleration===\nCertain works of Erasmus laid a foundation for [[religious toleration]] and [[ecumenism]]. For example, in ''De libero arbitrio'', opposing certain views of Martin Luther, Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, \"because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived.\" Gary Remer writes, \"Like [[Cicero]], Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors.\"<ref>Remer, Gary, ''Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration'' (University Park: University of Pennsylvania Press 1996), p. 95 {{ISBN|0-271-02811-4}}</ref> Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, \"It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him.\"<ref>Froude, James Anthony\n[https://archive.org/details/lifeandletterse02frougoog/page/n372 <!-- pg=359 quote=erasmus heretics kill. --> ''Life and letters of Erasmus: lectures delivered at Oxford 1893\u20134''] (London: Longmans, Green & Co. 1894), p. 359</ref>\n\n===Sacraments===\nA test of the Reformation was the doctrine of the [[sacrament]]s, and the crux of this question was the observance of the [[Eucharist]]. In 1530, Erasmus published a new edition of the orthodox treatise of [[Algerus]] against the heretic [[Berengar of Tours]] in the eleventh century. He added a dedication, affirming his belief in the reality of the Body of Christ after consecration in the Eucharist, commonly referred to as [[transubstantiation]]. The [[sacramentarian]]s, headed by [[Johannes Oecolampadius|\u0152colampadius]] of Basel, were, as Erasmus says, quoting him as holding views similar to their own in order to try to claim him for their schismatic and \"erroneous\" movement.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Basel - M\u00fcnsterpfalz1.jpg|thumb|[[Basel Minster]], where Erasmus lies buried ]]\nWhen his strength began to fail, he decided to accept an invitation by [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Queen Mary of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands]], to move from Freiburg to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. However, during preparations for the move in 1536, he suddenly died from an attack of [[dysentery]] during a visit to [[Basel]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle= Desiderius Erasmus}}</ref> He had remained loyal to the papal authorities in Rome, but he did not have the opportunity to receive the [[last rites]] of the Catholic Church; the reports of his death do not mention whether he asked for a priest or not. According to Jan van Herwaarden, this is consistent with his view that outward signs were not important; what mattered is the believer's direct relationship with God, which he noted \"as the [Catholic] church believes\". However, Herwaarden observes that \"he did not dismiss the rites and sacraments out of hand but asserted a dying person could achieve a state of salvation without the priestly rites, provided their faith and spirit were attuned to God.\"<ref>\n{{citation\n |author= Jan Van Herwaarden\n |title= Between Saint James and Erasmus: Studies in Late Medieval Religious Life\n |location= Leiden |publisher= BRILL |year= 2003\n |pages= 529\u2013530 |isbn= 9789004129849\n}}\n</ref>\nHe was buried with great ceremony in [[Basel Minster]] (the former [[cathedral]]) there.<ref name=\"Church 1924\"/>\n\nHis last words, as recorded by his friend [[Beatus Rhenanus]], were apparently \"''Dear God''\" ({{lang-nl|Lieve God}}).<ref>Huizinga, Dutch edition, p. 202.</ref> A bronze statue of him was erected in the city of his birth in 1622, replacing an earlier work in stone.\n\n==Writings==\nErasmus wrote both on [[ecclesiastic]] subjects and those of general human interest. By the 1530s, the writings of Erasmus accounted for 10 to 20 percent of all book sales in Europe.<ref>Galli, Mark, and Olsen, Ted. ''131 Christians Everyone Should Know. Nashville: Holman Reference,'' 2000, 343.</ref>  He is credited with coining the adage, \"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.\"  With the collaboration of [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]], he formed a [[paremiography]] (collection) of Latin [[proverb]]s and adages, commonly titled ''[[Adagia]]''.  Erasmus is also generally credited with originating the phrase \"[[Pandora's box]]\", arising through an error in his translation of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Pandora]]'' in which he confused ''pithos'' (storage jar) with ''pyxis'' (box).\n\nHis more serious writings begin early with the ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]],'' the \"Handbook of the Christian Soldier\" (1503) (translated into English a few years later by the young [[William Tyndale]]).  (A more literal translation of ''enchiridion''\u2014\"dagger\"\u2014has been likened to \"the spiritual equivalent of the modern [[Swiss Army knife]].\")<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid.  Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years. New York: Viking, 2010, 599.</ref> In this short work, Erasmus outlines the views of the normal Christian life, which he was to spend the rest of his days elaborating.  The chief evil of the day, he says, is formalism\u2014going through the motions of tradition without understanding their basis in the teachings of Christ.  Forms can teach the soul how to worship God, or they may hide or quench the spirit. In his examination of the dangers of formalism, Erasmus discusses monasticism, saint worship, war, the spirit of class and the foibles of \"society.\"\n\nThe ''Enchiridion'' is more like a sermon than a satire. With it Erasmus challenged common assumptions, painting the clergy as educators who should share the treasury of their knowledge with the laity. He emphasized personal spiritual disciplines and called for a reformation which he characterized as a collective return to the Fathers and Scripture. Most importantly, he extolled the reading of scripture as vital because of its power to transform and motivate toward love. Much like the Brethren of the Common Life, he wrote that the New Testament is the law of Christ people are called to obey and that Christ is the example they are called to imitate.\n\nAccording to [[Ernest Barker]], \"Besides his work on the New Testament, Erasmus laboured also, and even more arduously, on the [[Church Fathers|early Fathers]]. [\u2026] Among the Latin Fathers he edited the works of [[St Jerome]], [[Hilary of Poitiers|St Hilary]], and [[St Augustine]]; among the Greeks he worked on [[Irenaeus]], [[Origen]] and [[Chrysostom]].\"<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1948) ''Traditions of Civility'', chapter 4: The Connection between the Renaissance and the Reformation, pp. 93\u201394, [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref>\n\nErasmus also wrote of the legendary [[Frisians|Frisian]] freedom fighter and rebel [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] (Greate Pier), though more often in criticism than in praise of his exploits.  Erasmus saw him as a dim, brutal man who preferred physical strength to wisdom.<ref name=\"erasmus\">The Age of Erasmus, Lectures Delivered in the Universities of Oxford and London, by P. S.

Erasmus applies the general principles of honor and sincerity to the special functions of the Prince, whom he represents throughout as the servant of the people. ''Education'' was published in 1516, three years after<ref>{{cite book|last=Spielvogel|first=Jackson J.|title=Western Civilization, Eighth Edition, Volume B: 1300\u20131815|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-1-111-34215-9|page=353}}</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]\u2019s ''[[The Prince]]'' was written; a comparison between the two is worth noting. Machiavelli stated that, to maintain control by political force, it is safer for a prince to be feared than loved. Erasmus preferred for the prince to be loved, and strongly suggested a well-rounded education in order to govern justly and benevolently and avoid becoming a source of oppression.\n\nAs a result of his reformatory activities, Erasmus found himself at odds with both of the great parties. His last years were embittered by controversies with men toward whom he was sympathetic. Notable among these was [[Ulrich von Hutten]], a brilliant but erratic genius who had thrown himself into the Lutheran cause and declared that Erasmus, if he had a spark of honesty, would do the same. In his reply in 1523, ''Spongia adversus aspergines Hutteni'', Erasmus displays his skill in [[semantics]]. He accuses Hutten of having misinterpreted his utterances about reform and reiterates his determination never to break with the Church.\n\nThe ''[[Ciceronianus]]'' came out in 1528, attacking the style of Latin that was based exclusively and fanatically on Cicero's writings. Etienne Dolet wrote a riposte titled ''Erasmianus'' in 1535.\n\nErasmus' last major work, published the year of his death, is the ''[[Ecclesiastes of Erasmus|Ecclesiastes]]'' or \"Gospel Preacher\" (Basel, 1536), a massive manual for preachers of around a thousand pages. Though somewhat unwieldy because Erasmus was unable to edit it properly in his old age, it is in some ways the culmination of all of Erasmus' literary and theological learning, offering prospective preachers advice on nearly every conceivable aspect of their vocation with extraordinarily abundant reference to classical and biblical sources.\n\n===''Sileni Alcibiadis'' (1515)===\nErasmus\u2019 ''Sileni Alcibiadis'' is one of his most direct assessments of the need for Church reform. Johann Froben published it first within a revised edition of the ''Adagia'' in 1515, then as a stand-alone work in 1517. This essay has been likened to John Colet's ''Convocation Sermon'', though the styles differ.\n\n''Sileni'' is the plural (Latin) form of ''Silenus'', a creature often related to the Roman wine god [[Bacchus]] and represented in pictorial art as inebriated, merry revellers, variously mounted on donkeys, singing, dancing, playing flutes, etc. [[Alcibiades]] was a Greek politician in the 5th century BCE and a general in the [[Peloponnesian War]]; he figures here more as a character written into some of Plato's dialogues\u2014a young, debauched playboy whom Socrates tries to convince to seek truth instead of pleasure, wisdom instead of pomp and splendor.\n\nThe term ''Sileni''\u2014especially when juxtaposed with the character of Alcibiades\u2014can therefore be understood as an evocation of the notion that something on the inside is more expressive of a person's character than what one sees on the outside. For instance, something or someone ugly on the outside can be beautiful on the inside, which is one of the main points of Plato's dialogues featuring ''Alcibiades'' and the ''Symposion'', in which Alcibiades also appears.\n\nIn support of this, Erasmus states, \"Anyone who looks closely at the inward nature and essence will find that nobody is further from true wisdom than those people with their grand titles, learned bonnets, splendid sashes and bejeweled rings, who profess to be wisdom\u2019s peak\".  Erasmus lists several Sileni and then questions whether Christ is the most noticeable Silenus of them all. The [[Apostles]] were Sileni since they were ridiculed by others. He believes that the things which are the least ostentatious can be the most significant, and that the Church constitutes all Christian people\u2014that despite contemporary references to clergy as the whole of the Church, they are merely its servants. He criticizes those that spend the Church's riches at the people's expense. The true point of the Church is to help people lead Christian lives. Priests are supposed to be pure, yet when they stray, no one condemns them. He criticizes the riches of the popes, believing that it would be better for the Gospel to be most important.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe popularity of his books is reflected in the number of editions and translations that have appeared since the sixteenth century. Ten columns of the catalogue of the British Library are taken up with the enumeration of the works and their subsequent reprints. The greatest names of the classical and patristic world are among those translated, edited, or annotated by Erasmus, including Saint [[Ambrose]], [[Aristotle]], Saint [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], Saint [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], Saint [[John Chrysostom]], [[Cicero]] and Saint Jerome.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn his native Rotterdam, the [[Erasmus Universiteit|University]] and [[Gymnasium Erasmianum]] have been named in his honor. In 2003, a poll showing that most Rotterdammers believed Erasmus to be the designer of the local \"Erasmus Bridge\" instigated the founding of the Erasmus House (Rotterdam),<ref>[http://www.erasmushuisrotterdam.nl/ Erasmushuis]</ref> and the [[Erasmus House (Jakarta)]]<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2000/03/27/dutch-cultural-center-erasmus-huis-turns-30.html Dutch cultural center Erasmus Huis turns 30 ], the ''[[Jakarta Post]]'', 27 March 2000</ref> dedicated to celebrating Erasmus' legacy. Three moments in Erasmus' life are celebrated annually. On 1 April, the city celebrates the publication of his best-known book ''The Praise of Folly''. On 11 July, the ''Night of Erasmus'' celebrates the lasting influence of his work. His birthday is celebrated on 28 October.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nErasmus' reputation and the interpretations of his work have varied over time. Moderate Catholics recognized him as a leading figure in attempts to reform the Church, while Protestants recognized his initial support for Luther's ideas and the groundwork he laid for the future Reformation, especially in biblical scholarship. By the 1560s, however, there was a marked change in reception.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Erasmus censored.png|right|thumb|''Erasmus of Rotterdam'' by Stefan Zweig, which has been censored by the Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]\n\nAccording to [[Franz Anton Knittel]], Erasmus in his ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]]'' did not incorporate the ''[[Comma Johanneum|Comma]]'' from the [[Codex Montfortianus]], because of grammar differences, but used [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglotta]]. According to him the ''Comma'' was known to [[Tertullian]].<ref>Knittel, ''Neue Kritiken \u00fcber den ber\u00fchmten Sprych: Drey sind, die da zeugen im Himmel, der Vater, das Wort, und der heilige Geist, und diese drei sind eins'' Braunschweig 1785</ref>\n\nProtestant views of Erasmus fluctuated depending on region and period, with continual support in his native Netherlands and in cities of the Upper Rhine area. However, following his death and in the late sixteenth century, many Reformation supporters saw Erasmus's critiques of Luther and lifelong support for the universal Catholic Church as damning, and second-generation Protestants were less vocal in their debts to the great humanist. Nevertheless, his reception is demonstrable among Swiss Protestants in the sixteenth century: he had an indelible influence on the biblical commentaries of, for example, Konrad Pellikan, Heinrich Bullinger, and John Calvin, all of whom used both his annotations on the New Testament and his paraphrases of same in their own New Testament commentaries.<ref>{{cite book|title=Erasmus and Calvin on the Foolishness of God: Reason and Emotion in the Christian Philosophy  |last=Essary |first=Kirk |year=2017 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9781487501884}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Erasmus designated his own legacy and his life works were turned over at his death to his friend the Protestant humanist turned remonstrator [[Sebastian Castellio]] for the repair of the breach and divide of Christianity in its Catholic, Anabaptist, and Protestant branches.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sebastian Castellio, 1515-1563; Humanist and Defender of Religious Toleration in a Confessional Age; Translated and Edited by Bruce Gordon  |last=Guggisbert |first=Hans |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Hants England; Burlington, Vermont, USA |isbn=0754630196}}</ref>\n\nBy the coming of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], however, Erasmus increasingly again became a more widely respected cultural symbol and was hailed as an important figure by increasingly broad groups. In a letter to a friend, Erasmus once had written: \"That you are patriotic will be praised by many and easily forgiven by everyone; but in my opinion it is wiser to treat men and things as though we held this world the common fatherland of all.\"<ref>Letter 480, to Bud\u00e9 (ed.

([[Louvre]])]]\n* [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] painted him at least three times, and perhaps as many as seven; some only survive in versions by other artists. His three profile portraits of Erasmus, two (nearly identical) profile portraits and one three-quarters view portrait were all painted in the same year, 1523. Erasmus used the Holbein portraits as gifts for his friends in England, such as [[William Warham]], the Archbishop of Canterbury (as he writes in a letter to Warham regarding the gift portrait, Erasmus quips that \"he might have something of Erasmus should God call him from this place.\") Erasmus spoke favourably of Holbein as an artist and person, but later criticized Holbein whom he had accused of sponging off various patrons to whom Erasmus had recommended, for purposes more of monetary gain than artistic endeavor.\n* [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] also produced portraits of Erasmus, whom he met three times, in the form of an [[engraving]] of 1526 and a preliminary charcoal sketch. Concerning the former Erasmus was unimpressed, declaring it an unfavourable likeness of him. Nevertheless, Erasmus and D\u00fcrer maintained a close friendship, with D\u00fcrer going so far as to solicit Erasmus' support for the Lutheran cause, which Erasmus politely declined. Erasmus wrote a glowing ''[[encomium]]'' about the artist, likening him to famous Greek painter of antiquity [[Apelles]]. Erasmus was deeply affected by his death in 1528.\n* [[Quentin Matsys]] produced the earliest known portraits of Erasmus, including an oil painting in 1517 and a medallion in 1519.\n* In 1622, [[Hendrick de Keyser]] cast a statue of Erasmus in bronze replacing an earlier stone version from 1557.

To allow him to accept that post, he was given a temporary [[Dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]] from his religious vows on the grounds of poor health and love of Humanistic studies, though he remained a priest. [[Pope Leo X]] later made the dispensation permanent, a considerable privilege at the time.\n\n==Education and scholarship==\n[[File:Rotterdam standbeeld Erasmus.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue of Erasmus in Rotterdam. It was created by [[Hendrick de Keyser]] in 1622, replacing a stone statue of 1557.]]\n\nIn 1495, with Bishop Henry's consent and a stipend, Erasmus went on to study at the [[University of Paris]], in the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu]], a centre of reforming zeal, under the direction of the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Jan Standonck]], of whose rigors he complained. The University was then the chief seat of [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] learning but already coming under the influence of [[Renaissance]] humanism. For instance, Erasmus became an intimate friend of an Italian humanist [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]], poet and \"professor of humanity\" in Paris.\n\nThe chief centres of Erasmus's activity were [[Paris]], [[Leuven]] (in the [[Duchy of Brabant]], now in [[Belgium]]), [[England]], and Basel; yet he never belonged firmly in any one of these places. In 1499 he was invited to England by [[William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy]], who offered to accompany him on his trip to England. According to Thomas Penn, Erasmus was \"ever susceptible to the charms of attractive, well-connected, and rich young men\".<ref>Thomas Penn, ''The Winter King'', Penguin, 2013</ref> His time in England was fruitful in the making of lifelong friendships with the leaders of English thought in the days of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]: [[John Colet]], [[Thomas More]], [[John Fisher]], [[Thomas Linacre]] and [[William Grocyn]]. At the [[University of Cambridge]], he was the [[Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity]] and had the option of spending the rest of his life as an English [[professor]]. He stayed at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], from 1510 to 1515.<ref>{{acad|id=ERSS465D|name=Erasmus, Desiderius}}</ref> His rooms were in the \"I\" staircase of Old Court, and he famously hated English ale and English weather.\n\nErasmus suffered from poor health and complained that Queens' could not supply him with enough decent wine (wine was the Renaissance medicine for gallstones, from which Erasmus suffered). Until the early 20th century, Queens' College used to have a corkscrew that was purported to be \"Erasmus' corkscrew\", which was a third of a metre long; even today the college still has what it calls \"Erasmus' chair\".<ref>John Twigg, A History of Queens' College, Cambridge 1448\u20131986 (Woodbridge, Suff.: Boydell Press, 1987).</ref> Today Queens' College has an Erasmus Building and an Erasmus Room. His legacy is marked for someone who complained bitterly about the lack of comforts and luxuries to which he was accustomed. As Queens' was an unusually humanist-leaning institution in the 16th century, [[Queens' College Old Library]] still houses many first editions of Erasmus' publications, many of which were acquired during that period by bequest or purchase, including Erasmus' New Testament translation, which is signed by friend and Polish religious reformer [[Jan Laski|Jan \u0141aski]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Old Library Collections|website=Queens' College Cambridge.

Erasmus was particularly impressed by the Bible teaching of [[John Colet]], who pursued a style more akin to the [[church fathers]] than the [[Scholastics]]. This prompted him, upon his return from England, to master the Greek language, which would enable him to study theology on a more profound level and to prepare a new edition of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate|Bible translation]]. On one occasion he wrote to Colet: <blockquote>\nI cannot tell you, dear Colet, how I hurry on, with all sails set, to holy literature. How I dislike everything that keeps me back, or retards me.<ref name = \"cmsmlw\"/>\n</blockquote>Despite a chronic shortage of money, he succeeded in learning Greek by an intensive, day-and-night study of three years, continuously begging his friends to send him books and money for teachers in his letters.<ref>Huizinga, Dutch edition, pp. 52\u201353.</ref> Discovery in 1506 of [[Lorenzo Valla]]'s ''New Testament Notes'' encouraged Erasmus to continue the study of the New Testament.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Anderson\n | first=Marvin\n | title=Erasmus the Exegete\n | journal=Concordia Theeological Monthly\n | volume=40\n | issue=11\n | year=1969\n | pages=722\u201346\n}}\n</ref>\n\nErasmus preferred to live the life of an independent scholar and made a conscious effort to avoid any actions or formal ties that might inhibit his freedom of intellect and literary expression. Throughout his life, he was offered positions of honor and profit in academia but declined them all, preferring the uncertain but sufficient rewards of independent literary activity. He did however assist his friend John Colet by authoring Greek textbooks and procuring members of staff for the newly established [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/about/history |title = History}}</ref> From 1506 to 1509, he was in Italy: in 1506 he graduated as [[Doctor of Divinity]] at the [[Turin]] [[University of Turin|University]], and he spent part of the time as a proofreader at the publishing house of [[Aldine Press|Aldus Manutius]] in [[Venice]]. According to his letters, he was associated with the Venetian natural philosopher, [[Giulio Camillo]],<ref>''Opus Epistolarum Des. Erasmi Roterdami'', Ed. H.M.Allen, (Oxford University Press, 1937), Ep. 3032: 219\u201322; 2682: 8\u201313.</ref> but, apart from this, he had a less active association with Italian scholars than might have been expected.\n\nHis residence at Leuven, where he lectured at the [[Old University of Leuven|University]], exposed Erasmus to much criticism from those ascetics, academics and clerics hostile to the principles of literary and religious reform and the loose norms of the Renaissance adherents to which he was devoting his life. In 1517, he supported the foundation at the University, by his friend [[Hieronymus van Busleyden]], of the Collegium Trilingue for the study of [[Hebrew]], Latin, and Greek\u2014after the model of the College of the Three Languages at the [[Complutense University of Madrid#Early history|University of Alcal\u00e1]]. However, feeling that the lack of sympathy that prevailed at Leuven at that time was actually a form of mental persecution, he sought refuge in Basel, where under the shelter of Swiss hospitality he could express himself freely. Admirers from all quarters of Europe visited him there and he was surrounded by devoted friends, notably developing a lasting association with the great publisher [[Johann Froben]].\n\nOnly when he had mastered Latin did he begin to express himself on major contemporary themes in [[literature]] and [[religion]]. He felt called upon to use his learning in a purification of the doctrine by returning to the historic documents and original languages of sacred Scripture. He tried to free the methods of scholarship from the rigidity and formalism of medieval traditions, but he was not satisfied with this. His revolt against certain forms of [[Christian monasticism]] and scholasticism was not based on doubts about the truth of doctrine, nor from hostility to the organization of the Church itself, nor from rejection of [[celibacy]] or monastic lifestyles. He saw himself as a preacher of righteousness by an appeal to reason, applied frankly and without fear of the [[magisterium]]. He always intended to remain faithful to Catholic doctrine and therefore was convinced he could criticize frankly virtually everyone and everything. Aloof from entangling obligations, Erasmus was the centre of the literary movement of his time, corresponding with more than five hundred men in the worlds of politics and of thought.\n\n==Spain's Polyglot Bible and Erasmus' Greek New Testament==\n===The First Translation===\nIn 1502, in Spain, Cardinal [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]] had put together a team of Spanish translators to create a Compilation of a Bible in four languages, Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin. Translators for Greek were commissioned from Greece itself and worked closely with Latinists. Cardinal Cisneros's team completed and printed the full new testament, including the Greek translation, in 1514. To do so they developed specific types to print Greek. Cisneros informed Erasmus of the works going on in Spain and may have sent a printed version of the New Testament to him. However, the Spanish team wanted the entire Bible to be released as one single work and withdrew from publication.\n\nThe information and the delay allowed Erasmus to request a \"Publication Privilege\" of four years for the Greek New Testament to ensure that his work would be published first. He obtained it in 1516 from both [[Pope Leo X]], to whom he would dedicate his work, and [[Emperor Maximilian I]]. Erasmus' Greek New Testament was published first, in 1516, forcing the Spanish team of Cisneros to wait until 1520 to publish their [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible]].<ref>Mendoza, J. Carlos Vizuete; Llamazares, Fernando; S\u00e1nchez, Julio Mart\u00edn; Mancha, Universidad de Castilla-La (2002).

Univ de Castilla La Mancha</ref><ref>Bruce Metzger, The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 102.</ref>\n\nIt is hard to say if Erasmus' actions had an effect on delaying the publication of Complutensian Polyglot, causing the Spanish team to take more time, or if it made no difference in their perfectionism. The Spanish copy was approved for publication by the Pope in 1520; however, it was not released until 1522 due to the team's insistence on reviewing and editing. Only fifteen errors have been found in the entire six volumes and four languages of Cisneros's bible, an extraordinarily low number for the time. The fear of them publishing first, though, affected Erasmus's work, rushing him to printing and causing him to forego editing. The result was a large number of translation mistakes, transcription errors, and typos, that required further editions to be printed (see \"[[Erasmus#Spanish polyglot Bible and Erasmus' Greek New Testament#Publication and editions|publication]]\").<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">\"Epistle 694\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus Volume 5'', 167. The Latin is ''pr\u0153cipitatum fuit verius quam editum''.</ref>\n\n===The Translation of Erasmus===\nErasmus had been working for years on two projects: a collation of Greek texts and a fresh Latin New Testament. In 1512, he began his work on this Latin New Testament. He collected all the Vulgate manuscripts he could find to create a [[critical edition]]. Then he polished the language. He declared, \"It is only fair that Paul should address the Romans in somewhat better Latin.\"<ref>\"Epistle 695\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus Vol. 5: Letters 594 to 841, 1517\u20131518'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 172.</ref> In the earlier phases of the project, he never mentioned a Greek text:\n\n<blockquote>My mind is so excited at the thought of emending Jerome\u2019s text, with notes, that I seem to myself inspired by some god. I have already almost finished emending him by collating a large number of ancient manuscripts, and this I am doing at enormous personal expense.<ref>\"Epistle 273\" in Collected ''Works of Erasmus Vol. 2: Letters 142 to 297, 1501\u20131514'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated Wallace K. Ferguson; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 253.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile his intentions for publishing a fresh Latin translation are clear, it is less clear why he included the Greek text. Though some speculate that he intended to produce a critical Greek text or that he wanted to beat the Complutensian Polyglot into print, there is no evidence to support this. He wrote, \"There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me.\"<ref>\"Epistle 305\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus. Vol. 3: Letters 298 to 445, 1514\u20131516'' (tr. R.A.B. Mynors and D.F.S. Thomson; annotated by James K. McConica; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), 32.</ref> He further demonstrated the reason for the inclusion of the Greek text when defending his work:\n\n<blockquote>But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they say, even to a blind man, that often through the translator\u2019s clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes, which we see happen every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep.<ref>\"Epistle 337\" in ''Collected Works of Erasmus'' Vol. 3, 134.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSo he included the Greek text to permit qualified readers to verify the quality of his Latin version. But by first calling the final product ''Novum Instrumentum omne'' (\"All of the New Teaching\") and later ''Novum Testamentum omne'' (\"All of the New Testament\") he also indicated clearly that he considered a text in which the Greek and the Latin versions were consistently comparable to be the essential core of the church's New Testament tradition.\n\n===Contribution===\nIn a way it is legitimate to say that Erasmus \"synchronized\" or \"unified\" the Greek and the Latin traditions of the New Testament by producing an updated translation of both simultaneously. Both being part of canonical tradition, he clearly found it necessary to ensure that both were actually present in the same content. In modern terminology, he made the two traditions \"compatible\". This is clearly evidenced by the fact that his Greek text is not just the basis for his Latin translation, but also the other way round: there are numerous instances where he edits the Greek text to reflect his Latin version. For instance, since the last six verses of ''[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]'' were missing from his Greek manuscript, Erasmus translated the Vulgate's text back into Greek. Erasmus also translated the Latin text into Greek wherever he found that the Greek text and the accompanying commentaries were mixed up, or where he simply preferred the Vulgate's reading to the Greek text.<ref>E.g. at Acts 9:6.

After comparing what writings he could find, Erasmus wrote corrections between the lines of the manuscripts he was using (among which was [[Minuscule 2]]) and sent them as proofs to Froben.<ref name=\"SH\">[http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php?authorID=schaff&bookID=encyc02&page=106&view= \"History of the Printed Text\"], in: ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol. II: Basilica \u2013 Chambers'', p. 106 ff.</ref> His hurried effort was published by his friend [[Johann Froben]] of Basel in 1516 and thence became the first published Greek New Testament, the ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]], diligenter ab Erasmo Rot. Recognitum et Emendatum''. Erasmus used several Greek manuscript sources because he did not have access to a single complete manuscript. Most of the manuscripts were, however, late Greek manuscripts of the Byzantine textual family and Erasmus used the oldest manuscript the least because \"he was afraid of its supposedly erratic text.\"<ref>Bruce Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament. Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'', Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 102.</ref> He also ignored much older and better manuscripts that were at his disposal.<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) ''Tyndale's Testament'', Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, p. 28.</ref>\n\nIn the second (1519) edition, the more familiar term ''Testamentum'' was used instead of ''Instrumentum''. This edition was used by [[Martin Luther]] in his [[Luther Bible|German translation of the Bible]], written for people who could not understand Latin. Together, the first and second editions sold 3,300 copies. By comparison, only 600 copies of the Complutensian Polyglot were ever printed. The first and second edition texts did not include the passage (1 John 5:7\u20138) that has become known as the [[Comma Johanneum]]. Erasmus had been unable to find those verses in any Greek manuscript, but one was supplied to him during production of the third edition.  The Catholic Church decreed that the ''Comma Johanneum'' was open to dispute (2 June 1927), and it is rarely included in modern scholarly translations.\n\nThe third edition of 1522 was probably used by [[Tyndale]] for the first English New Testament (Worms, 1526) and was the basis for the 1550 Robert Stephanus edition used by the translators of the [[Geneva Bible]] and [[King James Version]] of the English Bible. Erasmus published a fourth edition in 1527 containing parallel columns of Greek, Latin Vulgate and Erasmus' Latin texts. In this edition Erasmus also supplied the Greek text of the last six verses of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] (which he had translated from Latin back into Greek in his first edition) from [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Cardinal Ximenez]]'s ''[[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Biblia Complutensis]]''. In 1535 Erasmus published the fifth (and final) edition which dropped the Latin Vulgate column but was otherwise similar to the fourth edition. Later versions of the Greek New Testament by others, but based on Erasmus' Greek New Testament, became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nErasmus dedicated his work to [[Pope Leo X]] as a patron of learning and regarded this work as his chief service to the cause of Christianity. Immediately afterwards, he began the publication of his ''[[Paraphrases of Erasmus|Paraphrases of the New Testament]]'', a popular presentation of the contents of the several books. These, like all of his writings, were published in Latin but were quickly translated into other languages with his encouragement.\n\nErasmus, in his capacity as humanist editor, advised major printers such as [[Aldus Manutius]] on which manuscripts to publish.<ref>Murray, Stuart. 2009. The library: an illustrated history. Chicago, ALA Editions</ref>\n\n==Beginnings of Protestantism==\n\n===Attempts at impartiality in dispute===\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] began in the year following the publication of his [[Novum Instrumentum omne|edition of the Greek New Testament]] (1516) and tested Erasmus' character. The issues between the [[Catholic Church]] and the growing religious movement which would later become known as [[Protestantism]], had become so clear that few could escape the summons to join the debate. Erasmus, at the height of his literary fame, was inevitably called upon to take sides, but partisanship was foreign to his nature and his habits. Despite all his [[Criticism of the Catholic Church|criticism of clerical corruption and abuses within the Catholic Church]],<ref name=\"Hoffmann 1989\"/> which lasted for years and was also directed towards many of the Church's basic doctrines,<ref name=\"Dixon 2012\"/> Erasmus shunned the Reformation movement along with its most [[Radical Reformation|radical and reactionary offshoots]],<ref name=\"Hoffmann 1989\"/>{{quotation needed|date=March 2020}}<!--Applies to the description of some offshoots as 'reactionary'. Also, are those the same as the radical offshoots?--> and sided with neither party.<ref name=\"Hoffmann 1989\"/>\n\nThe world had laughed at his [[satire]], but few had interfered with his activities. He believed that his work so far had commended itself to the best minds and also to the dominant powers in the religious world. Erasmus did not build a large body of supporters with his letters. He chose to write in Greek and Latin, the languages of scholars. His critiques reached an elite but small audience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Peter G.|title=European History in Perspective: The Long European Reformation|year=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-333-64451-5|page=70}}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement with Luther===\n\"Free will does not exist\", according to Luther in his letter ''[[w:On the Bondage of the Will|De Servo Arbitrio]]'' to Erasmus translated into German by [[Justus Jonas]] (1526), in that sin makes human beings completely incapable of bringing themselves to God. Noting Luther's criticism of the Catholic Church, Erasmus described him as \"a mighty trumpet of gospel truth\" while agreeing, \"It is clear that many of the reforms for which Luther calls are urgently needed.\"<ref name=\"Galli, Mark 2000, p. 344\">Galli, Mark, and Olsen, Ted. 131 Christians Everyone Should Know. Nashville: Holman Reference, 2000, p. 344.</ref> He had great respect for Luther, and Luther spoke with admiration of Erasmus' superior learning. Luther hoped for his cooperation in a work which seemed only the natural outcome of his own. In their early correspondence, Luther expressed boundless admiration for all Erasmus had done in the cause of a sound and reasonable Christianity and urged him to join the Lutheran party. Erasmus declined to commit himself, arguing that to do so would endanger his position as a leader in the movement for pure scholarship which he regarded as his purpose in life. Only as an independent scholar could he hope to influence the reform of religion. When Erasmus hesitated to support him, the straightforward Luther became angered that Erasmus was avoiding the responsibility due either to [[cowardice]] or a lack of purpose. However, any hesitancy on the part of Erasmus stemmed, not from lack of courage or conviction, but rather from a concern over the mounting disorder and violence of the reform movement. To [[Philip Melanchthon]] in 1524 he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I know nothing of your church; at the very least it contains people who will, I fear, overturn the whole system and drive the princes into using force to restrain good men and bad alike. The gospel, the word of God, faith, Christ, and Holy Spirit \u2013 these words are always on their lips; look at their lives and they speak quite another language.<ref>{{cite book| chapter=Letter of September 6, 1524| title= Collected Works of Erasmus| year= 1992 | publisher=University of Toronto Press| volume=10| isbn= 0-8020-5976-7 |page= 380 | chapter-url= https://books.google.com/?id=bYVEgXbiunkC&pg=PA380&dq=%22gospel,+the+word+of+God,+faith,+Christ,+and+Holy+Spirit%22#v=onepage&q=%22gospel%2C%20the%20word%20of%20God%2C%20faith%2C%20Christ%2C%20and%20Holy%20Spirit%22&f=false}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAgain, in 1529, he writes \u201cAn epistle against those who falsely boast they are Evangelicals\u201d<ref>Epistola contra quosdam qui se falso iactant evangelicos.</ref> to Vulturius Neocomus ([[w:Gerard Geldenhouwer|Gerardus Geldenhouwer]]).

In book I of his ''Hyperaspistes'' he puts the matter bluntly to Luther:\n<blockquote>We are dealing with this: Would a stable mind depart from the opinion handed down by so many men famous for holiness and miracles, depart from the decisions of the Church, and commit our souls to the faith of someone like you who has sprung up just now with a few followers, although the leading men of your flock do not agree either with you or among themselves \u2013 indeed though you do not even agree with yourself, since in this same ''Assertion''<ref>A reference to Luther's ''Assertio omnium articulorum per bullam Leonis X. novissimam damnatorum'' (Assertion of all the Articles condemned by the Bull of Leo X, 1520), [[Weimar edition of Martin Luther's works|WA]] VII.</ref> you say one thing in the beginning and something else later on, recanting what you said before.<ref>''Collected Works of Erasmus, Controversies: De Libero Arbitrio / Hyperaspistes I'', Peter Macardle, Clarence H.

Erasmus, they said, had laid the egg, and Luther had hatched it. Erasmus wittily dismissed the charge, claiming that Luther had hatched a different bird entirely.<ref>[http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/reynoldserasmusresponsibleluther.pdf ''Concordia Theological Journal''] Was Erasmus Responsible for Luther?

One of the topics he dealt with was free will, a crucial question. In his ''[[De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio]]'' (1524), he lampoons the Lutheran view on free will. He lays down both sides of the argument impartially. The \"Diatribe\" did not encourage any definite action; this was its merit to the Erasmians and its fault in the eyes of the Lutherans. In response, Luther wrote his ''De servo arbitrio'' ([[On the Bondage of the Will]]) (1525), which attacks the \"Diatribe\" and Erasmus himself, going so far as to claim that Erasmus was not a Christian. Erasmus responded with a lengthy, two-part ''Hyperaspistes'' (1526\u201327). In this controversy Erasmus lets it be seen that he would like to claim more for free will than St. Paul and St. Augustine seem to allow according to Luther's interpretation.<ref>Britannica Online Encyclopedia, Desiderius Erasmus ''Dutch humanist and scholar'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/191015/Desiderius-Erasmus/59231/The-Protestant-challenge#ref=ref24610The Protestant challenge]</ref> For Erasmus the essential point is that humans have the freedom of choice.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Watson\n | first=Philip\n | title=Erasmus, Luther and Aquinas\n | journal=Concordia Theological Monthly\n | volume=40\n | issue=11\n | year=1969\n | pages=747\u201358\n }}work\n</ref> The conclusions Erasmus reached drew upon a large array of notable authorities, including, from the Patristic period, Origen, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine, in addition to many leading Scholastic authors, such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. The content of Erasmus' works also engaged with later thought on the state of the question, including the perspectives of the ''via moderna'' school and of Lorenzo Valla, whose ideas he rejected.\n\nAs the popular response to Luther gathered momentum, the social disorders, which Erasmus dreaded and Luther disassociated himself from, began to appear, including the [[German Peasants' War]], the [[Anabaptist]] disturbances in Germany and in the Low Countries, [[iconoclasm]] and the [[radicalization]] of peasants across Europe. If these were the outcomes of reform, he was thankful that he had kept out of it. Yet he was ever more bitterly accused of having started the whole \"tragedy\" (as the Catholics dubbed Protestantism).\n\nWhen the city of Basel definitely adopted the Reformation in 1529, Erasmus gave up his residence there and settled in the imperial town of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]].\n\n[[File:Hans Holbein d. J. - Erasmus - Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Erasmus by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]. [[Louvre]], Paris.]]\n\n===Religious toleration===\nCertain works of Erasmus laid a foundation for [[religious toleration]] and [[ecumenism]]. For example, in ''De libero arbitrio'', opposing certain views of Martin Luther, Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, \"because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived.\" Gary Remer writes, \"Like [[Cicero]], Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors.\"<ref>Remer, Gary, ''Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration'' (University Park: University of Pennsylvania Press 1996), p. 95 {{ISBN|0-271-02811-4}}</ref> Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, \"It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him.\"<ref>Froude, James Anthony\n[https://archive.org/details/lifeandletterse02frougoog/page/n372 <!-- pg=359 quote=erasmus heretics kill. --> ''Life and letters of Erasmus: lectures delivered at Oxford 1893\u20134''] (London: Longmans, Green & Co. 1894), p. 359</ref>\n\n===Sacraments===\nA test of the Reformation was the doctrine of the [[sacrament]]s, and the crux of this question was the observance of the [[Eucharist]]. In 1530, Erasmus published a new edition of the orthodox treatise of [[Algerus]] against the heretic [[Berengar of Tours]] in the eleventh century. He added a dedication, affirming his belief in the reality of the Body of Christ after consecration in the Eucharist, commonly referred to as [[transubstantiation]]. The [[sacramentarian]]s, headed by [[Johannes Oecolampadius|\u0152colampadius]] of Basel, were, as Erasmus says, quoting him as holding views similar to their own in order to try to claim him for their schismatic and \"erroneous\" movement.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Basel - M\u00fcnsterpfalz1.jpg|thumb|[[Basel Minster]], where Erasmus lies buried ]]\nWhen his strength began to fail, he decided to accept an invitation by [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Queen Mary of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands]], to move from Freiburg to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. However, during preparations for the move in 1536, he suddenly died from an attack of [[dysentery]] during a visit to [[Basel]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle= Desiderius Erasmus}}</ref> He had remained loyal to the papal authorities in Rome, but he did not have the opportunity to receive the [[last rites]] of the Catholic Church; the reports of his death do not mention whether he asked for a priest or not. According to Jan van Herwaarden, this is consistent with his view that outward signs were not important; what mattered is the believer's direct relationship with God, which he noted \"as the [Catholic] church believes\". However, Herwaarden observes that \"he did not dismiss the rites and sacraments out of hand but asserted a dying person could achieve a state of salvation without the priestly rites, provided their faith and spirit were attuned to God.\"<ref>\n{{citation\n |author= Jan Van Herwaarden\n |title= Between Saint James and Erasmus: Studies in Late Medieval Religious Life\n |location= Leiden |publisher= BRILL |year= 2003\n |pages= 529\u2013530 |isbn= 9789004129849\n}}\n</ref>\nHe was buried with great ceremony in [[Basel Minster]] (the former [[cathedral]]) there.<ref name=\"Church 1924\"/>\n\nHis last words, as recorded by his friend [[Beatus Rhenanus]], were apparently \"''Dear God''\" ({{lang-nl|Lieve God}}).<ref>Huizinga, Dutch edition, p. 202.</ref> A bronze statue of him was erected in the city of his birth in 1622, replacing an earlier work in stone.\n\n==Writings==\nErasmus wrote both on [[ecclesiastic]] subjects and those of general human interest. By the 1530s, the writings of Erasmus accounted for 10 to 20 percent of all book sales in Europe.<ref>Galli, Mark, and Olsen, Ted. ''131 Christians Everyone Should Know. Nashville: Holman Reference,'' 2000, 343.</ref>  He is credited with coining the adage, \"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.\"  With the collaboration of [[Publio Fausto Andrelini]], he formed a [[paremiography]] (collection) of Latin [[proverb]]s and adages, commonly titled ''[[Adagia]]''.  Erasmus is also generally credited with originating the phrase \"[[Pandora's box]]\", arising through an error in his translation of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Pandora]]'' in which he confused ''pithos'' (storage jar) with ''pyxis'' (box).\n\nHis more serious writings begin early with the ''[[Enchiridion militis Christiani]],'' the \"Handbook of the Christian Soldier\" (1503) (translated into English a few years later by the young [[William Tyndale]]).  (A more literal translation of ''enchiridion''\u2014\"dagger\"\u2014has been likened to \"the spiritual equivalent of the modern [[Swiss Army knife]].\")<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid.  Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years. New York: Viking, 2010, 599.</ref> In this short work, Erasmus outlines the views of the normal Christian life, which he was to spend the rest of his days elaborating.  The chief evil of the day, he says, is formalism\u2014going through the motions of tradition without understanding their basis in the teachings of Christ.  Forms can teach the soul how to worship God, or they may hide or quench the spirit. In his examination of the dangers of formalism, Erasmus discusses monasticism, saint worship, war, the spirit of class and the foibles of \"society.\"\n\nThe ''Enchiridion'' is more like a sermon than a satire. With it Erasmus challenged common assumptions, painting the clergy as educators who should share the treasury of their knowledge with the laity. He emphasized personal spiritual disciplines and called for a reformation which he characterized as a collective return to the Fathers and Scripture. Most importantly, he extolled the reading of scripture as vital because of its power to transform and motivate toward love. Much like the Brethren of the Common Life, he wrote that the New Testament is the law of Christ people are called to obey and that Christ is the example they are called to imitate.\n\nAccording to [[Ernest Barker]], \"Besides his work on the New Testament, Erasmus laboured also, and even more arduously, on the [[Church Fathers|early Fathers]]. [\u2026] Among the Latin Fathers he edited the works of [[St Jerome]], [[Hilary of Poitiers|St Hilary]], and [[St Augustine]]; among the Greeks he worked on [[Irenaeus]], [[Origen]] and [[Chrysostom]].\"<ref>[[Ernest Barker]] (1948) ''Traditions of Civility'', chapter 4: The Connection between the Renaissance and the Reformation, pp. 93\u201394, [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref>\n\nErasmus also wrote of the legendary [[Frisians|Frisian]] freedom fighter and rebel [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] (Greate Pier), though more often in criticism than in praise of his exploits.  Erasmus saw him as a dim, brutal man who preferred physical strength to wisdom.<ref name=\"erasmus\">The Age of Erasmus, Lectures Delivered in the Universities of Oxford and London, by P. S. Allen, Clarendon Press 1914</ref>\n\n[[File:HolbeinErasmusFollymarginalia.jpg|upright|thumb|Marginal drawing of Folly by Hans Holbein in the first edition of Erasmus's ''Praise of Folly'', 1515]]\n\nOne of Erasmus' best-known works, inspired by ''De triumpho stultitiae'' (written by Italian humanist [[Faustino Perisauli]]), is ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'', published under the double title ''Moriae encomium'' (Greek, Latinised) and ''Laus stultitiae'' (Latin).<ref>[http://www.ub.unibas.ch/kadmos/gg/picpage/gg0015_009_tit.htm Early title page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112141116/http://www.ub.unibas.ch/kadmos/gg/picpage/gg0015_009_tit.htm |date=12 November 2007 }}</ref> A satirical attack on superstitions and other traditions of European society in general and the western Church in particular, it was written in 1509, published in 1511, and dedicated to Sir Thomas More, whose name the title puns.\n\nThe ''[[Education of a Christian Prince|Institutio principis Christiani]]''  or \"Education of a Christian Prince''\"'' (Basel, 1516) was written as advice to the young king Charles of Spain (later [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]). Erasmus applies the general principles of honor and sincerity to the special functions of the Prince, whom he represents throughout as the servant of the people. ''Education'' was published in 1516, three years after<ref>{{cite book|last=Spielvogel|first=Jackson J.|title=Western Civilization, Eighth Edition, Volume B: 1300\u20131815|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-1-111-34215-9|page=353}}</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]\u2019s ''[[The Prince]]'' was written; a comparison between the two is worth noting. Machiavelli stated that, to maintain control by political force, it is safer for a prince to be feared than loved. Erasmus preferred for the prince to be loved, and strongly suggested a well-rounded education in order to govern justly and benevolently and avoid becoming a source of oppression.\n\nAs a result of his reformatory activities, Erasmus found himself at odds with both of the great parties. His last years were embittered by controversies with men toward whom he was sympathetic. Notable among these was [[Ulrich von Hutten]], a brilliant but erratic genius who had thrown himself into the Lutheran cause and declared that Erasmus, if he had a spark of honesty, would do the same. In his reply in 1523, ''Spongia adversus aspergines Hutteni'', Erasmus displays his skill in [[semantics]]. He accuses Hutten of having misinterpreted his utterances about reform and reiterates his determination never to break with the Church.\n\nThe ''[[Ciceronianus]]'' came out in 1528, attacking the style of Latin that was based exclusively and fanatically on Cicero's writings. Etienne Dolet wrote a riposte titled ''Erasmianus'' in 1535.\n\nErasmus' last major work, published the year of his death, is the ''[[Ecclesiastes of Erasmus|Ecclesiastes]]'' or \"Gospel Preacher\" (Basel, 1536), a massive manual for preachers of around a thousand pages. Though somewhat unwieldy because Erasmus was unable to edit it properly in his old age, it is in some ways the culmination of all of Erasmus' literary and theological learning, offering prospective preachers advice on nearly every conceivable aspect of their vocation with extraordinarily abundant reference to classical and biblical sources.\n\n===''Sileni Alcibiadis'' (1515)===\nErasmus\u2019 ''Sileni Alcibiadis'' is one of his most direct assessments of the need for Church reform. Johann Froben published it first within a revised edition of the ''Adagia'' in 1515, then as a stand-alone work in 1517. This essay has been likened to John Colet's ''Convocation Sermon'', though the styles differ.\n\n''Sileni'' is the plural (Latin) form of ''Silenus'', a creature often related to the Roman wine god [[Bacchus]] and represented in pictorial art as inebriated, merry revellers, variously mounted on donkeys, singing, dancing, playing flutes, etc. [[Alcibiades]] was a Greek politician in the 5th century BCE and a general in the [[Peloponnesian War]]; he figures here more as a character written into some of Plato's dialogues\u2014a young, debauched playboy whom Socrates tries to convince to seek truth instead of pleasure, wisdom instead of pomp and splendor.\n\nThe term ''Sileni''\u2014especially when juxtaposed with the character of Alcibiades\u2014can therefore be understood as an evocation of the notion that something on the inside is more expressive of a person's character than what one sees on the outside. For instance, something or someone ugly on the outside can be beautiful on the inside, which is one of the main points of Plato's dialogues featuring ''Alcibiades'' and the ''Symposion'', in which Alcibiades also appears.\n\nIn support of this, Erasmus states, \"Anyone who looks closely at the inward nature and essence will find that nobody is further from true wisdom than those people with their grand titles, learned bonnets, splendid sashes and bejeweled rings, who profess to be wisdom\u2019s peak\".  Erasmus lists several Sileni and then questions whether Christ is the most noticeable Silenus of them all. The [[Apostles]] were Sileni since they were ridiculed by others. He believes that the things which are the least ostentatious can be the most significant, and that the Church constitutes all Christian people\u2014that despite contemporary references to clergy as the whole of the Church, they are merely its servants. He criticizes those that spend the Church's riches at the people's expense. The true point of the Church is to help people lead Christian lives. Priests are supposed to be pure, yet when they stray, no one condemns them. He criticizes the riches of the popes, believing that it would be better for the Gospel to be most important.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe popularity of his books is reflected in the number of editions and translations that have appeared since the sixteenth century. Ten columns of the catalogue of the British Library are taken up with the enumeration of the works and their subsequent reprints. The greatest names of the classical and patristic world are among those translated, edited, or annotated by Erasmus, including Saint [[Ambrose]], [[Aristotle]], Saint [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], Saint [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], Saint [[John Chrysostom]], [[Cicero]] and Saint Jerome.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIn his native Rotterdam, the [[Erasmus Universiteit|University]] and [[Gymnasium Erasmianum]] have been named in his honor. In 2003, a poll showing that most Rotterdammers believed Erasmus to be the designer of the local \"Erasmus Bridge\" instigated the founding of the Erasmus House (Rotterdam),<ref>[http://www.erasmushuisrotterdam.nl/ Erasmushuis]</ref> and the [[Erasmus House (Jakarta)]]<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2000/03/27/dutch-cultural-center-erasmus-huis-turns-30.html Dutch cultural center Erasmus Huis turns 30 ], the ''[[Jakarta Post]]'', 27 March 2000</ref> dedicated to celebrating Erasmus' legacy. Three moments in Erasmus' life are celebrated annually. On 1 April, the city celebrates the publication of his best-known book ''The Praise of Folly''. On 11 July, the ''Night of Erasmus'' celebrates the lasting influence of his work. His birthday is celebrated on 28 October.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nErasmus' reputation and the interpretations of his work have varied over time. Moderate Catholics recognized him as a leading figure in attempts to reform the Church, while Protestants recognized his initial support for Luther's ideas and the groundwork he laid for the future Reformation, especially in biblical scholarship. By the 1560s, however, there was a marked change in reception.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Erasmus censored.png|right|thumb|''Erasmus of Rotterdam'' by Stefan Zweig, which has been censored by the Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]\n\nAccording to [[Franz Anton Knittel]], Erasmus in his ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]]'' did not incorporate the ''[[Comma Johanneum|Comma]]'' from the [[Codex Montfortianus]], because of grammar differences, but used [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglotta]]. According to him the ''Comma'' was known to [[Tertullian]].<ref>Knittel, ''Neue Kritiken \u00fcber den ber\u00fchmten Sprych: Drey sind, die da zeugen im Himmel, der Vater, das Wort, und der heilige Geist, und diese drei sind eins'' Braunschweig 1785</ref>\n\nProtestant views of Erasmus fluctuated depending on region and period, with continual support in his native Netherlands and in cities of the Upper Rhine area. However, following his death and in the late sixteenth century, many Reformation supporters saw Erasmus's critiques of Luther and lifelong support for the universal Catholic Church as damning, and second-generation Protestants were less vocal in their debts to the great humanist. Nevertheless, his reception is demonstrable among Swiss Protestants in the sixteenth century: he had an indelible influence on the biblical commentaries of, for example, Konrad Pellikan, Heinrich Bullinger, and John Calvin, all of whom used both his annotations on the New Testament and his paraphrases of same in their own New Testament commentaries.<ref>{{cite book|title=Erasmus and Calvin on the Foolishness of God: Reason and Emotion in the Christian Philosophy  |last=Essary |first=Kirk |year=2017 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9781487501884}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Erasmus designated his own legacy and his life works were turned over at his death to his friend the Protestant humanist turned remonstrator [[Sebastian Castellio]] for the repair of the breach and divide of Christianity in its Catholic, Anabaptist, and Protestant branches.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sebastian Castellio, 1515-1563; Humanist and Defender of Religious Toleration in a Confessional Age; Translated and Edited by Bruce Gordon  |last=Guggisbert |first=Hans |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Hants England; Burlington, Vermont, USA |isbn=0754630196}}</ref>\n\nBy the coming of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], however, Erasmus increasingly again became a more widely respected cultural symbol and was hailed as an important figure by increasingly broad groups. In a letter to a friend, Erasmus once had written: \"That you are patriotic will be praised by many and easily forgiven by everyone; but in my opinion it is wiser to treat men and things as though we held this world the common fatherland of all.\"<ref>Letter 480, to Bud\u00e9 (ed.

([[Louvre]])]]\n* [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] painted him at least three times, and perhaps as many as seven; some only survive in versions by other artists. His three profile portraits of Erasmus, two (nearly identical) profile portraits and one three-quarters view portrait were all painted in the same year, 1523. Erasmus used the Holbein portraits as gifts for his friends in England, such as [[William Warham]], the Archbishop of Canterbury (as he writes in a letter to Warham regarding the gift portrait, Erasmus quips that \"he might have something of Erasmus should God call him from this place.\") Erasmus spoke favourably of Holbein as an artist and person, but later criticized Holbein whom he had accused of sponging off various patrons to whom Erasmus had recommended, for purposes more of monetary gain than artistic endeavor.\n* [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] also produced portraits of Erasmus, whom he met three times, in the form of an [[engraving]] of 1526 and a preliminary charcoal sketch. Concerning the former Erasmus was unimpressed, declaring it an unfavourable likeness of him. Nevertheless, Erasmus and D\u00fcrer maintained a close friendship, with D\u00fcrer going so far as to solicit Erasmus' support for the Lutheran cause, which Erasmus politely declined. Erasmus wrote a glowing ''[[encomium]]'' about the artist, likening him to famous Greek painter of antiquity [[Apelles]]. Erasmus was deeply affected by his death in 1528.\n* [[Quentin Matsys]] produced the earliest known portraits of Erasmus, including an oil painting in 1517 and a medallion in 1519.\n* In 1622, [[Hendrick de Keyser]] cast a statue of Erasmus in bronze replacing an earlier stone version from 1557.

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

Paper presented at a conference on Changing Dynamics: Military-Strategic Issues for a Future South Africa, hosted by the Institute for Defence Politics in conjunction with the Hanns Seidel Foundation, CSIR conference centre, Pretoria, 6 August 1992.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>You will no doubt recall that the Angola accords were signed in Luanda on 22 December 1988. In November 1989 SWAPO won 57% of the votes in the Namibian General Election and immediately requested the help of a British Military Advisory and Training Team following independence on 21 March 1990. The team, initially 55 strong, was duly deployed on 26 March 1990 and the first leaders cadre, for the 1st and 2nd Battalions, was run from 17 April to 2 June. By 1 July, the 1st Battalion, about 1 000 men strong, accompanied by 5 BMATT Advisors, had deployed to the northern border. By November 1990, only four months later, the 5th Battalion had deployed and in early 1991 the 21st Guards Battalion had also been formed, four staff courses had been run, support weapons and logistics training was well advanced (indeed a logistics battalion deployed as early as July 1990) and an operational test exercise had been conducted. In addition the Ministry of Defence, a mixture of civilian and military personnel, was operating as a department of state. No-one would pretend that everything was working perfectly, nevertheless, a great deal had been achieved in the first year following independence. Most people would probably agree that at some 7 500 strong the Army is unnecessarily large, but sensible plans will need to be made for the employment of any surplus soldiers before they are discharged. Integration has not been easy to achieve, at least in part, because of the need to use several interpreters to cope with the wide variety of languages involved. Battalions are made up of approximately 70% ex-PLAN and 30% ex-SWATF. This mixture could have proved explosive but hounded by their BMATT instructors they united in a common task (or perhaps in the face of a common enemy!) and soon realised that they could work well together. At the higher levels, integration has been more patchy, at least in part because of the departure of most white South African and SWATF officers. But the Government's intentions seem clear in that it decided to split the four MOD directorates evenly, appointing two white and two black (ex PLAN) directors. In all this, BMATT Namibia has played a role remarkably similar to that of BMATT Zimbabwe.</blockquote>\n[[File:Namibian Air Force K-8.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Air Force K-8]]\nIn August 1999, a separatist Lozi faction in the [[Caprivi Strip]] launched a coup attempt (see [[Caprivi conflict]]) which was summarily put down by the Namibian Defence Force.<ref>Source [[Lonely Planet]]</ref> The army has conducted security operations along the northern border with [[Angola]].

H.A.B. Shapiro died in 1952; there were 25 students enrolled at that time, and his widow, who had increasingly administered the school as her husband's health declined, then ran the school until 1971, continuing as president emeritus until 1986.<ref>Cote, Joe, [https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/2018/09/gertrude-shapiro \"The Leadership and Legacy of Gertrude Shapiro\"]. Southern New Hampshire University, September 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the school was incorporated and renamed the '''New Hampshire College of Accounting and Commerce'''. The state of [[New Hampshire]] granted the college its charter in 1963, which gave it degree-granting authority. The first [[associate degree]]s were awarded that year, and the first [[bachelor's degree]]s were conferred in 1966. The college became a [[nonprofit institution]] under a [[board of trustees]] in September 1968, and its name was shortened to '''New Hampshire College''' in 1969.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe 1970s were a time of growth and change. The college moved from its downtown Manchester site to the now {{convert|300|acre|adj=on}} campus along the [[Merrimack River]], at the northern border of Manchester with the town of [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]], in 1971. Academic offerings expanded with the introduction of a [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1974,<ref name=\"history\"/> as well as when [[human services]] programs were adopted from [[Franconia College]], which closed in 1978.<ref name=\"lessard\">{{cite web| url=http://www.hippopress.com/read-article/college-satellite-closes-in-manchester |title=College satellite closes in Manchester|publisher=[[Hippo Press|The Hippo]]|date=February 23, 2017|last=Lessard|first=Ryan|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, New Hampshire College received authorization from the [[New Hampshire General Court|New Hampshire legislature]] to offer [[Master of Science]] degrees in business-related subjects, as well as Master of Human Services degrees. (All human services programs would be transferred to [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]] in Massachusetts by the end of the decade.)<ref name=\"lessard\"/> That same year, the college opened its North Campus on the site of the former [[Mount Saint Mary College (New Hampshire)|Mount Saint Mary College]], which had shut down three years earlier. The North Campus became the home of the [[culinary arts]] program, which was established in 1983.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nUltimately, the North Campus was sold,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| title=Hooksett's Mount Saint Mary's to be Converted to Condos| publisher=Brady Sullivan| accessdate=July 18, 2016| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804122255/http://www.bradysullivan.com/downloads/05-2-23.pdf| archivedate=August 4, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> and its academic programs were consolidated back to the main campus. This spurred several major construction projects on the main campus in the mid-1990s: Washington Hall, a [[dormitory|residence hall]]; Webster Hall, home to the School of Business; the Hospitality Center, home of the Quill (a student-run [[restaurant]]) and culinary arts programs; and Belknap Hall, now home to the Institute for Language Education, the School of Education, and several university offices. In 1995, New Hampshire College began offering [[distance learning]] programs through the [[Internet]]. In 1998, academic degrees were expanded to include a [[Ph.D.]] in [[community economic development]] and the [[Doctor of Business Administration]].<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nNew Hampshire College became '''Southern New Hampshire University''' on July 1, 2001.

Rapid revenue growth from the division helped save the struggling main campus where enrollment had slumped.

Southern New Hampshire University, September 12, 2018.</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the school was incorporated and renamed the '''New Hampshire College of Accounting and Commerce'''. The state of [[New Hampshire]] granted the college its charter in 1963, which gave it degree-granting authority. The first [[associate degree]]s were awarded that year, and the first [[bachelor's degree]]s were conferred in 1966. The college became a [[nonprofit institution]] under a [[board of trustees]] in September 1968, and its name was shortened to '''New Hampshire College''' in 1969.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe 1970s were a time of growth and change. The college moved from its downtown Manchester site to the now {{convert|300|acre|adj=on}} campus along the [[Merrimack River]], at the northern border of Manchester with the town of [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]], in 1971. Academic offerings expanded with the introduction of a [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1974,<ref name=\"history\"/> as well as when [[human services]] programs were adopted from [[Franconia College]], which closed in 1978.<ref name=\"lessard\">{{cite web| url=http://www.hippopress.com/read-article/college-satellite-closes-in-manchester |title=College satellite closes in Manchester|publisher=[[Hippo Press|The Hippo]]|date=February 23, 2017|last=Lessard|first=Ryan|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, New Hampshire College received authorization from the [[New Hampshire General Court|New Hampshire legislature]] to offer [[Master of Science]] degrees in business-related subjects, as well as Master of Human Services degrees. (All human services programs would be transferred to [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]] in Massachusetts by the end of the decade.)<ref name=\"lessard\"/> That same year, the college opened its North Campus on the site of the former [[Mount Saint Mary College (New Hampshire)|Mount Saint Mary College]], which had shut down three years earlier.

This spurred several major construction projects on the main campus in the mid-1990s: Washington Hall, a [[dormitory|residence hall]]; Webster Hall, home to the School of Business; the Hospitality Center, home of the Quill (a student-run [[restaurant]]) and culinary arts programs; and Belknap Hall, now home to the Institute for Language Education, the School of Education, and several university offices. In 1995, New Hampshire College began offering [[distance learning]] programs through the [[Internet]].

has been more difficult, and the presence of deepfakes increases the difficulty of classifying videos as genuine or not.<ref name=\":0\" /> AI researcher Alex Champandard has said people should know how fast things can be corrupted with deepfake technology, and that the problem is not a technical one, but rather one to be solved by trust in information and journalism.<ref name=\":0\" /> The primary pitfall is that humanity could fall into an age in which it can no longer be determined whether a medium's content corresponds to the truth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSimilarly, computer science associate professor [[Hao Li]] of the [[University of Southern California]] states that deepfakes created for malicious use, such as fake news, will be even more harmful if nothing is done to spread

''The Financial Times''.</ref>\n\nThe rituals and processes of a Hindu wedding vary widely. Nevertheless, the Hindu wedding ceremony at its core is essentially a [[Vedic]] ''[[yajna]]'' ritual and three key rituals are almost universal: ''[[Kanyadaan (in Hindu wedding)|Kanyadaan]]'', ''[[Panigrahana]]'', and ''[[Saptapadi]]''\u2014which are respectively, giving away of his daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hands near the fire to signify union, and taking seven \u2018steps before fire\u2019.  (Each \u2018step\u2019 is a complete circuit of the fire.)  \n\nAt each step, promises are made by (in the long-form\u2014see below) each to the other.<ref name=jgl2001/> The primary witness of a Hindu marriage is the fire-deity (or the Sacred Fire) ''[[Agni]]'', in the presence of family and friends.<ref name=historyindia2011>\n\nBajpai, S.

Hawaii: Himalayan Academy Publications, {{ISBN|978-1-934145-38-8}}.\n\n</ref> The ceremony is traditionally conducted entirely or at least partially in [[Sanskrit]], considered by [[Hindu]]s as the language of holy ceremonies. The local language of the bride and groom may also be used. The rituals are prescribed in the [[Baudhayana sutras|''Gruhya sutra'']] composed by various ''[[rishis]]'' such as ''[[Baudhayana]]'' and ''[[Ashvalayana]]''. \n\nThe pre-wedding and post-wedding rituals and celebrations vary by region, preference and the resources of the groom, bride and their families. They can range from one day to multi-day events. Pre-wedding ceremonies include [[engagement]], which involves  ''vagdana'' (betrothal) and ''Lagna-patra'' (written declaration),<ref name=rjb1969/> and the arrival of the groom's party at the bride's residence, often as a formal procession with dancing and music. The post-wedding ceremonies may include ''[[Abhisheka|Abhishek]]'', ''[[Anna Prashashan]]'', ''[[Aashirvadah]]'', and ''[[Grihapravesa]]'' &ndash; the welcoming of the bride to her new home. The wedding marks the start of the ''[[Grihastha]]'' (householder) [[Ashrama (stage)| stage of life]] for the new couple.\n\nIn India, by law and tradition, no Hindu marriage is binding or complete unless the ritual of seven steps and vows in presence of fire (''Saptapadi'') is completed by the bride and the groom together.<ref name=thmagoi/> This requirement is under debate, given that several Hindu communities (such as the [[Nair|Nair]]s of [[Kerala]] or [[Bunt (community)|Bunt]]s of [[Tulu Nadu]]) do not observe these rites.<ref name=menski2001/>\n\n==Eight forms of marriage==\n[[File:Hindu Bride, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.jpg|200px|thumb|upright=0.8|A Hindu bride during her wedding.]]\n[[File:Tamil Brahmin Hindu Marraige.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Hindu marriage ceremony.]]\n\nAncient Hindu literature, in for example the ''[[Asvalayana Grhyasutra]]'' and ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', identifies eight forms of marriage.<ref name=rjb1969/>  They are traditionally presented, as here, in order of religious appropriateness (''prashasta'').  They also differ very widely in social acceptability.<ref name=jgl2001>Lochtefeld, J.G. (2001). ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A&ndash;M'', p.&nbsp;427. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}.</ref><ref name=tribune2011>staff article. (September 2011). Eight forms of Hindu Marriage and its custom. ''India Tribune''.</ref>  (Legal aspects are regulated mainly by the [[Hindu Marriage Act, 1955]].)\n\n* ''Brahma'' marriage &ndash; considered the religiously most appropriate marriage, and the most prevalent among Hindus in modern India.  The father finds an educated man and proposes the marriage of that man's daughter to his son. The groom, bride, and families freely concur with the proposal. The two families and relatives meet, the daughter is ceremonially decorated, the father gives away his daughter in betrothal, and a Vedic marriage ceremony is conducted. <ref name=jgl2001/>\n* ''Daiva'' marriage &ndash; the father gives away his daughter along with ornaments to a priest as a sacrificial fee. This form of marriage occurred in ancient times when ''yajna'' sacrifices were prevalent.\n* ''Arsha'' marriage &ndash; the groom gives a cow and a bull to the father of the bride and the father exchanges his daughter in marriage. The groom takes a vow to fulfill his obligations to the bride and family life{{clarification needed|date=November 2018}} (''[[Grihastha |Grihasthashram]]'').\n* ''Prajapatya'' {{clarify | etymology?  Does the word mean something like \u201cpeople\u2019s ceremony\u201d?|date=November 2018}}marriage &ndash; a couple agrees to be married by exchanging some {{clarify | which?  Same as / similar to the Saptapadi vows given below?|date=November 2018}}Sanskrit mantras (vows to each other). This form of marriage is akin to a civil ceremony.\n\nThe above four forms of marriage were considered socially proper, and religiously appropriate &ndash; ''prashasta'' &ndash; under Hinduism, since the rituals include vows from [[Vedic]] scriptures.  Both the bride and groom commit to each other and share responsibilities to their families. The remaining four do not include vows and were considered ''aprashasta'' (inappropriate). <ref name=rjb1969/><ref name=jgl2001/> Among these, two were socially acceptable:\n\n* [[Gandharva marriage|'' Gandharva'' marriage]]{{snd}}the couple simply live together out of love, by mutual consent, consensually consummating their relationship. The marriage is entered into without religious ceremonies and is akin to the Western concept of [[Common-law marriage]].  The [[Kama Sutra]], and, in the [[Mahabharata]], Rishi Kanva, the foster-father of [[Shakuntala]], claim that this form of marriage is ideal.<ref name=rjb1969/><ref name=tribune2011/>\n* ''[[Asura]]'' marriage &ndash; the groom offers a dowry to the father of the bride and the bride; both accept the dowry out of free will, and he receives the bride in exchange. This is akin to marrying off a daughter for money, and is considered inappropriate by Hindu Smriti-writers because greed, not what is best for the woman, can corrupt the selection process.<ref name=rjb1969/>\n\nThe last two forms of marriage were not only inappropriate, but religiously forbidden:\n\n* ''Rakshasa'' marriage &ndash; where the groom forcibly abducts the bride against her will and her family's will. (The word ''[[Rakshasa]]'' means \u201cdevil\u201d.)\n* ''[[Pishacha|Paishacha]]'' marriage &ndash; where the man forces himself on a woman when she is insentient: when she is drugged or drunken or unconscious.\n\nJames Lochtefeld comments that these last two forms were forbidden but the marriages themselves were still recognized in ancient Hindu societies, not to allow these acts but rather to provide the woman and any resulting children with legal protection in the society.<ref name=jgl2001/>\n\n==Key rituals==\n{{Main article|Vivaah}}\nThere is no single standard Hindu marriage ceremony.  Regional variation is prevalent in the sequence of rituals comprising the ceremony.  There is also considerable flexibility within each ritual.  Variation reflects family traditions, local traditions, resources of the families and other factors.  Three key rituals predominate, as follows.<ref name=jgl2001/><ref>Kane, V. (1962). ''History of Dharmasastra''.</ref><ref>Roy, R. (2004). ''Saptapadi &ndash; The Seven Steps''. University of Canterbury, UK: Ph.D. Thesis.</ref>  Two are ''yajna''.<ref name=historyindia2011/>\n\n* ''Kanyadaan'' &ndash; the giving away of his daughter by the father.\n* ''Panigrahana'' &ndash; a ritual in presence of fire, where the groom takes the bride's hand as a sign of their union.\n* ''Saptapadi'' &ndash; the crucial ritual.  The term means \u2018seven steps\u2019, with each step corresponding (in the Long Form) to a pair of vows: groom to the bride, and bride to groom. The vows are pronounced in Sanskrit; sometimes also{{clarify |\u2019\u2019 ie\u2019\u2019 the parties recite each vow in both languages? 7 steps x 2 parties x 2 language, = 28 vows??  Or sometimes \u2018\u2019instead\u2019\u2019 the vows are spoken in the parties\u2019 language rather than in Sanskrit?|date=November 2018}} in the language of the couple.   (For the Short Form see below.)  Like ''Panigrahana'', Saptapadi is performed in presence of fire, and in many weddings, after each of their seven oaths to each other, the groom and bride perform the ritual of ''agnipradakshinam'': walking around the fire, with hands linked or with the ends of their garments tied together. The groom usually leads the bride in the walk.<ref>Sharma, A. (1985). Marriage in the Hindu religious tradition. ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies'', 22&nbsp;(1), 69&ndash;80.</ref> {{clarify | \u201cgroom usually leads\u201d: really?  Or is this how it goes in the Long Form?  For the Short Form, the account in the relevant subsection gives the opposite impression.  All the examples of regional usage there has the bride leading at least the first circuit.\n\n|date=November 2018}}  Fire is the divine witness (to the marriage),<ref name=historyindia2011/> and after Saptapadi the couple are considered husband and wife.\n\n===Kanyadaan===\n[[File:KanyaDaan.jpg|thumb|'' Kanyadaan'' &ndash; a key ritual where the father gifts away from the daughter to the groom. In this picture, the father's hand is on the left, the bride and groom are on the right.]]\nThe Kanyadaan ceremony is performed by the bride\u2019s father.<ref name=prabhu2011/> If the father has died, a guardian of the bride's choosing performs the ritual. The father brings the daughter, then takes the bride's hand and places it in the groom's. This marks the beginning of the ceremony of giving away the bride. The groom accepts the bride's hand, while the ''kama-sukta'' (hymn to love) is pronounced, in the presence of the father, the bride and the groom. The ''Kamasukta'' verse is:<ref name=prabhu2011>Prabhu, P.H. (2011). ''Hindu Social Organization'', pp.&nbsp;164&ndash;165. {{ISBN|978-8171542062}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote><poem>\n''Who offered this maiden? to whom is she offered?''\n''Kama (the god of love) gave her to me, that I may love her''\n''Love is the giver, love is the acceptor''\n''Enter thou, the bride, the ocean of love''\n\n''With love then, I receive thee''\n''May she remain thine, thine own, O God of love''\n''Verily, thou art, prosperity itself''\n''May the heaven bestow thee, may the earth receive thee''\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nAfter this ritual recital, the father asks the groom to not fail the bride in his pursuit of ''dharma'' (moral and lawful life), ''artha'' (wealth) and ''kama'' (love). The groom promises to the bride's father that he shall never fail her in his pursuit of ''dharma'', ''artha'' and ''kama''.<ref name=kanew/> The groom repeats the promise three times.\n\nThis repeated promise by the groom marks the end of the ''kanyadaan'' ritual in the Hindu wedding.\n\n===Panigrahana===\n[[File: Hindu wedding ceremony fire.jpg|right|thumb|A [[yajna]] during a Hindu wedding]]\nThe ritual of ''Panigrahana'' comes after ''Kanyadaan''.  It is sometimes preceded by the ''vivaha-homa'' rite, wherein a symbolic fire is lit by the groom to mark the start of a new household.<ref name=prabhu2011/><ref>Williams, M.M. (1893).

The groom faces west, and while the bride sits in front of him, with her face to the east, he holds her hand while the following [[Rigveda|Rig ved]]<nowiki/>ic mantra is recited:<ref name=rjb1969/><ref name=prabhu2011/>\n\n<blockquote><poem>\n''I take thy hand in mine, yearning for happiness''\n''I ask thee, to live with me, as thy husband''\n''Till both of us, with age, grow old''\n\n''Know this, as I declare, that the Gods''\n''Bhaga, Aryama, Savita and Purandhi, have bestowed thy person, upon me''\n''that I may fulfill, my Dharmas of the householder, with thee''\n\n''This I am, That art thou''\n''The S\u0101man I, the \u0156c thou''\n''The Heavens I, the Earth thou''\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the Gujarati Wedding{{clarify | is the \u201cGujarati Wedding\u201d really something distinct?

In front is the band.]]\nMany Hindu weddings start with the ''[[ Milne (Hindu ritual) | milne]]'' (meeting) and ''[[ Swagatam (Hindu ritual) | swagatam]]'' (welcome) ceremony. This ritual is where the ''[[baraat]]'' (groom's procession party) arrives at the bride's home or the location where the bride is and marriage will be celebrated. The ''baraat'' typically includes dancing and joyous members of groom's family, relatives and friends. On their arrival, there is a ritual where key persons from the groom's side and bride's side are introduced to each other. The introduction is typically followed by ''jai mala'' (garland exchange between bride and groom) and a reception that serves food and drinks. \n\nMany other rituals and ceremonies are sometimes found in Hindu weddings, such as ''[[Vivaah #Madhuparka ceremony | madhuparka]]'', ''[[ Vivaah #Vivaah Homa (sacred fire ritual) | vivaah-homa]]'', ''[[agni-parinayana]]'', ''[[Vivaah #Ashmarohanam (stepping on the grinding stone) | asmarohana]]'', ''[[Vivaah #Laaja Homam | laja homa]]'', ''abhishek'', ''anna-prashashan'', and ''aashir-vadah''.<ref name=rjb1969/><ref name=kanew/> All these ceremonies are carried out at the wedding location, typically at or near the bride's home.<ref name=ft2008/> These additional rituals include the participation of the brothers, sisters, maternal/paternal relatives, guardians, or friends of the bride.\n\nIn some parts of India, such as Gujarat and Northern India, a ''laja homa'' ritual called ''mangal pher\u0101'' is performed where the couple make four circles around holy fire. It follows ''hasta milap'' (meeting of hands of the couple), but precedes ''saptapadi''.  The first three circles is led by the groom, and it represents three of four goals of life considered important in Hindu life &ndash; ''Dharma'', ''Artha'', ''Kama''. The fourth circle is led by bride and it represents the fourth goal of life &ndash; ''Moksha''.<ref>{{\n\ncite book |last=Srinivasan |first=A.V. |title=The Vedic Wedding: Origins, Tradition, and Practice &ndash; Including a step-by-step wedding ceremony in Sanskrit with English |date=2009 |publisher=Periplus |isbn=9780978544300 |pages=64, 132&ndash;152\n\n}}.</ref> After ''saptapadi'', as hymns are being recited, the groom performs ''m\u0101\u0146g [[sindoor]]'' ritual where a saffron or red color powder is marked into the parting of the wife's hair.<ref name=kanew>{{\n\ncite book |last=Kane |first=P.V. |title=History of Dharmasastra \u2013 Ancient and Medieval Civil Law in India |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=531&ndash;538 |date=1974 |publisher=Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute\n\n}}.</ref> Instead of circling the fire and other steps, the rituals and ceremonies may be performed symbolically, such as stepping on small heaps of rice or throwing grains into the fire.<ref name=kanew/><ref name=pauwels>{{\n\ncite book |last=Pauwels |first=H. |title=Only You: The wedding of Rama and Sita - Past and present in the Ramayana, revisited |pages=165\u2013189 |editor-first=M. |editor-last=Bose |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195168327\n\n}}.</ref>\n\nSome rituals involve<ref name=kanew/> rice or other grains, seeds and pastes.

In groom's car, bride and groom sit together, and groom's younger brother drive the car. bride's two sister also come with groom's family, when they arrive to groom house where Hindu family members of the groom welcome the newly wedded couple in a ritual known as ''grihapravesa'' (home coming/entry).<ref name=prabhu2011/> This ceremony typically requires participation of the mother, father, brothers, and sisters, or other guardians of the groom.\n\nAncient literature<ref>\n\nSingh, M.

The body art is produced from a mixture of henna and turmeric. Above a Nepali bride.]]\nIn the Hindu culture of [[Nepal]], marriage rituals are done by the ''Chhetri'' in a sixteen step process that centers on the household. The household is important during the marriage ritual because it is the center of the concept of ''mandala''; the Chhetri's homes are considered to be domestic mandalas and so have roles as householders. The act of marriage brings men and women into the householder role. \n\nMarriage is the most important rite of passage for the Chhetris and is one of the most serious. Women move from their houses to the home of the groom after marriage. The ceremony is done in a precise and careful manner as to not bring bad luck to the families of the bride and groom; certain traditions, for example no one seeing the face of the bride until the end, are followed in order to ensure future prosperity. Prior to the marriage ceremony, there is no kinship between families of the bride and groom and the bride must be a virgin. The marriage ceremony consists of a series of rites that are performed over a two-day period between the houses of the bride and the groom. Within each home the enclosed area in the courtyard (''jagya'') and the kitchen are used the most; the jagya and the kitchen are considered the most important parts of the domestic mandala structure because it is where rice (an important part of the Chhetri's culture) is prepared and consumed. At the end of the ceremony is the establishment of the role of the wife and husband in the husband's home.<ref name=\"Gray 45\u201360\">{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=J.|title=Marriage ritual in Nepal: Space, performance in tacit knowledge|journal=Journal of Ritual Studies|date=2009|volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=45&ndash;60 }}.</ref>\n\nThe first step in the marriage ceremony is called ''Purbanga''. In the kitchen of their homes, the bride and the groom worship the seven Mother Goddesses as so to pay respect to their ancestors and ask for peace. In the second, third, and fourth step, the groom is then blessed by his mother and is taken outside to his jagya where his father and procession (''janti'') carry him and bring gifts for the bride to her house in a ceremony called dul\u00e4h\u00e4 anm\u00e4une. In the fifth step as the groom waits before the house of the bride, gifts of clothes and food are placed around the jagya; the father of the bride then places red paste on the groom's forehead indicating that he is no longer an outsider to his family. The sixth step is the performance of the ''Barani'' or welcoming for the groom and his janti as they enter the jagya. The father purifies the body of the groom using panch\u00e4mrit (nectar from five pure liquids). A small feast is then held for the groom as the next steps in the marriage continue.<ref name=\"Gray 45\u201360\"/>\n\nAfter the small feast, the marriage process for the bride begins. The seventh step takes place in the kitchen of the bride where the process of ''kanya dan'' starts; the bride's parents give their daughter in marriage to her groom thereby allowing the bride to be a part of the groom's lineage and making the father's lineage secondary. After they wash their feet they dress in red and, in the eighth step, sit beside in each other in the jagya. They perform post-marriage rites as they make sacrificial offerings to the fire in the center of the jagya. During these rites the bride and groom perform tasks such as placing red powder in the hair of the bride and the bride eats leftover food of the groom and at the end the now husband gives his wife a personal name for which she is to be called by.<ref name=\"Gray 45\u201360\"/>\n\nAfter the post-marriage ceremony, the married couple being to leave the bride's home. In the ninth step, the husband and wife return to the kitchen of the wife and worship their ancestors and the seven Mother Goddesses. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth step, the couple leave the wife's house as she is given a garland from her parents; the wife and husband enter the jagya and are then escorted out riding on palanquins as they return to their permanent home of the husband. The thirteenth step beings once they enter the jagya of the groom and his virgin sisters welcome the wife in a ceremony called ''arti sy\u00e4l''. They unveil the bride and adorn her with flower garlands and sprinkle puffed rice on her (a sign of prosperity). The fourteenth step is completed once the bride promises gifts to the sisters; she then moves on the fifteenth step where she steps on piles of rice in a path toward the kitchen. The final step is a series of rites, the first of which is the bride worshiping the ancestors and deities of the husband; she then demonstrates her skills in handling rice to the husband's mother and sisters and then they entwine her hair. Finally, the mother unveils the bride again in front of the husband and in a ceremony called ''khutta dhog'', the bride places the foot of the mother on her forehead thereby ending the marriage ceremony.<ref name=\"Gray 45\u201360\"/> ok\n\n==Wedding and married life in Hinduism==\nWhile there are many rituals in Hinduism, such as those at birth and deaths of loved ones, the Hindu wedding is the most important and extensive personal ritual an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life.<ref name=rjb1969/> Typical Hindu families spend significant effort and financial resources to prepare and celebrate weddings.\n\n===Economics===\n[[File:A fancy Indian wedding taking place in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, India.jpg|thumb|A fancy Indian wedding taking place in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, India]]\nIn 2008, Indian weddings market was estimated to be $31 billion a year.<ref name=ft2008/> Various sources estimate India celebrates about 10 million weddings per year,<ref>CBS News.

''The Financial Times''.</ref>\n\nThe rituals and processes of a Hindu wedding vary widely. Nevertheless, the Hindu wedding ceremony at its core is essentially a [[Vedic]] ''[[yajna]]'' ritual and three key rituals are almost universal: ''[[Kanyadaan (in Hindu wedding)|Kanyadaan]]'', ''[[Panigrahana]]'', and ''[[Saptapadi]]''\u2014which are respectively, giving away of his daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hands near the fire to signify union, and taking seven \u2018steps before fire\u2019.  (Each \u2018step\u2019 is a complete circuit of the fire.)  \n\nAt each step, promises are made by (in the long-form\u2014see below) each to the other.<ref name=jgl2001/> The primary witness of a Hindu marriage is the fire-deity (or the Sacred Fire) ''[[Agni]]'', in the presence of family and friends.<ref name=historyindia2011>\n\nBajpai, S.

Hawaii: Himalayan Academy Publications, {{ISBN|978-1-934145-38-8}}.\n\n</ref> The ceremony is traditionally conducted entirely or at least partially in [[Sanskrit]], considered by [[Hindu]]s as the language of holy ceremonies. The local language of the bride and groom may also be used. The rituals are prescribed in the [[Baudhayana sutras|''Gruhya sutra'']] composed by various ''[[rishis]]'' such as ''[[Baudhayana]]'' and ''[[Ashvalayana]]''. \n\nThe pre-wedding and post-wedding rituals and celebrations vary by region, preference and the resources of the groom, bride and their families. They can range from one day to multi-day events. Pre-wedding ceremonies include [[engagement]], which involves  ''vagdana'' (betrothal) and ''Lagna-patra'' (written declaration),<ref name=rjb1969/> and the arrival of the groom's party at the bride's residence, often as a formal procession with dancing and music. The post-wedding ceremonies may include ''[[Abhisheka|Abhishek]]'', ''[[Anna Prashashan]]'', ''[[Aashirvadah]]'', and ''[[Grihapravesa]]'' &ndash; the welcoming of the bride to her new home. The wedding marks the start of the ''[[Grihastha]]'' (householder) [[Ashrama (stage)| stage of life]] for the new couple.\n\nIn India, by law and tradition, no Hindu marriage is binding or complete unless the ritual of seven steps and vows in presence of fire (''Saptapadi'') is completed by the bride and the groom together.<ref name=thmagoi/> This requirement is under debate, given that several Hindu communities (such as the [[Nair|Nair]]s of [[Kerala]] or [[Bunt (community)|Bunt]]s of [[Tulu Nadu]]) do not observe these rites.<ref name=menski2001/>\n\n==Eight forms of marriage==\n[[File:Hindu Bride, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.jpg|200px|thumb|upright=0.8|A Hindu bride during her wedding.]]\n[[File:Tamil Brahmin Hindu Marraige.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Hindu marriage ceremony.]]\n\nAncient Hindu literature, in for example the ''[[Asvalayana Grhyasutra]]'' and ''[[Atharvaveda]]'', identifies eight forms of marriage.<ref name=rjb1969/>  They are traditionally presented, as here, in order of religious appropriateness (''prashasta'').  They also differ very widely in social acceptability.<ref name=jgl2001>Lochtefeld, J.G. (2001). ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A&ndash;M'', p.&nbsp;427. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}.</ref><ref name=tribune2011>staff article. (September 2011). Eight forms of Hindu Marriage and its custom. ''India Tribune''.</ref>  (Legal aspects are regulated mainly by the [[Hindu Marriage Act, 1955]].)\n\n* ''Brahma'' marriage &ndash; considered the religiously most appropriate marriage, and the most prevalent among Hindus in modern India.  The father finds an educated man and proposes the marriage of that man's daughter to his son. The groom, bride, and families freely concur with the proposal. The two families and relatives meet, the daughter is ceremonially decorated, the father gives away his daughter in betrothal, and a Vedic marriage ceremony is conducted. <ref name=jgl2001/>\n* ''Daiva'' marriage &ndash; the father gives away his daughter along with ornaments to a priest as a sacrificial fee. This form of marriage occurred in ancient times when ''yajna'' sacrifices were prevalent.\n* ''Arsha'' marriage &ndash; the groom gives a cow and a bull to the father of the bride and the father exchanges his daughter in marriage. The groom takes a vow to fulfill his obligations to the bride and family life{{clarification needed|date=November 2018}} (''[[Grihastha |Grihasthashram]]'').\n* ''Prajapatya'' {{clarify | etymology?  Does the word mean something like \u201cpeople\u2019s ceremony\u201d?|date=November 2018}}marriage &ndash; a couple agrees to be married by exchanging some {{clarify | which?  Same as / similar to the Saptapadi vows given below?|date=November 2018}}Sanskrit mantras (vows to each other). This form of marriage is akin to a civil ceremony.\n\nThe above four forms of marriage were considered socially proper, and religiously appropriate &ndash; ''prashasta'' &ndash; under Hinduism, since the rituals include vows from [[Vedic]] scriptures.  Both the bride and groom commit to each other and share responsibilities to their families. The remaining four do not include vows and were considered ''aprashasta'' (inappropriate). <ref name=rjb1969/><ref name=jgl2001/> Among these, two were socially acceptable:\n\n* [[Gandharva marriage|'' Gandharva'' marriage]]{{snd}}the couple simply live together out of love, by mutual consent, consensually consummating their relationship. The marriage is entered into without religious ceremonies and is akin to the Western concept of [[Common-law marriage]].  The [[Kama Sutra]], and, in the [[Mahabharata]], Rishi Kanva, the foster-father of [[Shakuntala]], claim that this form of marriage is ideal.<ref name=rjb1969/><ref name=tribune2011/>\n* ''[[Asura]]'' marriage &ndash; the groom offers a dowry to the father of the bride and the bride; both accept the dowry out of free will, and he receives the bride in exchange. This is akin to marrying off a daughter for money, and is considered inappropriate by Hindu Smriti-writers because greed, not what is best for the woman, can corrupt the selection process.<ref name=rjb1969/>\n\nThe last two forms of marriage were not only inappropriate, but religiously forbidden:\n\n* ''Rakshasa'' marriage &ndash; where the groom forcibly abducts the bride against her will and her family's will. (The word ''[[Rakshasa]]'' means \u201cdevil\u201d.)\n* ''[[Pishacha|Paishacha]]'' marriage &ndash; where the man forces himself on a woman when she is insentient: when she is drugged or drunken or unconscious.\n\nJames Lochtefeld comments that these last two forms were forbidden but the marriages themselves were still recognized in ancient Hindu societies, not to allow these acts but rather to provide the woman and any resulting children with legal protection in the society.<ref name=jgl2001/>\n\n==Key rituals==\n{{Main article|Vivaah}}\nThere is no single standard Hindu marriage ceremony.  Regional variation is prevalent in the sequence of rituals comprising the ceremony.  There is also considerable flexibility within each ritual.  Variation reflects family traditions, local traditions, resources of the families and other factors.  Three key rituals predominate, as follows.<ref name=jgl2001/><ref>Kane, V. (1962). ''History of Dharmasastra''.</ref><ref>Roy, R. (2004). ''Saptapadi &ndash; The Seven Steps''. University of Canterbury, UK: Ph.D. Thesis.</ref>  Two are ''yajna''.<ref name=historyindia2011/>\n\n* ''Kanyadaan'' &ndash; the giving away of his daughter by the father.\n* ''Panigrahana'' &ndash; a ritual in presence of fire, where the groom takes the bride's hand as a sign of their union.\n* ''Saptapadi'' &ndash; the crucial ritual.  The term means \u2018seven steps\u2019, with each step corresponding (in the Long Form) to a pair of vows: groom to the bride, and bride to groom. The vows are pronounced in Sanskrit; sometimes also{{clarify |\u2019\u2019 ie\u2019\u2019 the parties recite each vow in both languages? 7 steps x 2 parties x 2 language, = 28 vows??  Or sometimes \u2018\u2019instead\u2019\u2019 the vows are spoken in the parties\u2019 language rather than in Sanskrit?|date=November 2018}} in the language of the couple.   (For the Short Form see below.)  Like ''Panigrahana'', Saptapadi is performed in presence of fire, and in many weddings, after each of their seven oaths to each other, the groom and bride perform the ritual of ''agnipradakshinam'': walking around the fire, with hands linked or with the ends of their garments tied together. The groom usually leads the bride in the walk.<ref>Sharma, A. (1985). Marriage in the Hindu religious tradition. ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies'', 22&nbsp;(1), 69&ndash;80.</ref> {{clarify | \u201cgroom usually leads\u201d: really?  Or is this how it goes in the Long Form?  For the Short Form, the account in the relevant subsection gives the opposite impression.  All the examples of regional usage there has the bride leading at least the first circuit.\n\n|date=November 2018}}  Fire is the divine witness (to the marriage),<ref name=historyindia2011/> and after Saptapadi the couple are considered husband and wife.\n\n===Kanyadaan===\n[[File:KanyaDaan.jpg|thumb|'' Kanyadaan'' &ndash; a key ritual where the father gifts away from the daughter to the groom. In this picture, the father's hand is on the left, the bride and groom are on the right.]]\nThe Kanyadaan ceremony is performed by the bride\u2019s father.<ref name=prabhu2011/> If the father has died, a guardian of the bride's choosing performs the ritual. The father brings the daughter, then takes the bride's hand and places it in the groom's. This marks the beginning of the ceremony of giving away the bride. The groom accepts the bride's hand, while the ''kama-sukta'' (hymn to love) is pronounced, in the presence of the father, the bride and the groom. The ''Kamasukta'' verse is:<ref name=prabhu2011>Prabhu, P.H. (2011). ''Hindu Social Organization'', pp.&nbsp;164&ndash;165. {{ISBN|978-8171542062}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote><poem>\n''Who offered this maiden? to whom is she offered?''\n''Kama (the god of love) gave her to me, that I may love her''\n''Love is the giver, love is the acceptor''\n''Enter thou, the bride, the ocean of love''\n\n''With love then, I receive thee''\n''May she remain thine, thine own, O God of love''\n''Verily, thou art, prosperity itself''\n''May the heaven bestow thee, may the earth receive thee''\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nAfter this ritual recital, the father asks the groom to not fail the bride in his pursuit of ''dharma'' (moral and lawful life), ''artha'' (wealth) and ''kama'' (love). The groom promises to the bride's father that he shall never fail her in his pursuit of ''dharma'', ''artha'' and ''kama''.<ref name=kanew/> The groom repeats the promise three times.\n\nThis repeated promise by the groom marks the end of the ''kanyadaan'' ritual in the Hindu wedding.\n\n===Panigrahana===\n[[File: Hindu wedding ceremony fire.jpg|right|thumb|A [[yajna]] during a Hindu wedding]]\nThe ritual of ''Panigrahana'' comes after ''Kanyadaan''.  It is sometimes preceded by the ''vivaha-homa'' rite, wherein a symbolic fire is lit by the groom to mark the start of a new household.<ref name=prabhu2011/><ref>Williams, M.M. (1893). ''Indian wisdom; or, Examples of the religious, philosophical, and ethical doctrines of the Hindus''. London: Luzac & Co.</ref>\n\n''Panigrahana'' is the 'holding the hand' ritual<ref name=jgl2001/> as a symbol of the bride and groom\u2019s impending marital union, with the groom acknowledging a responsibility to four deities: Bhaga signifying wealth, Aryama signifying heavens/milky way, Savita signifying radiance/new beginning, and Purandhi signifying wisdom. The groom faces west, and while the bride sits in front of him, with her face to the east, he holds her hand while the following [[Rigveda|Rig ved]]<nowiki/>ic mantra is recited:<ref name=rjb1969/><ref name=prabhu2011/>\n\n<blockquote><poem>\n''I take thy hand in mine, yearning for happiness''\n''I ask thee, to live with me, as thy husband''\n''Till both of us, with age, grow old''\n\n''Know this, as I declare, that the Gods''\n''Bhaga, Aryama, Savita and Purandhi, have bestowed thy person, upon me''\n''that I may fulfill, my Dharmas of the householder, with thee''\n\n''This I am, That art thou''\n''The S\u0101man I, the \u0156c thou''\n''The Heavens I, the Earth thou''\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the Gujarati Wedding{{clarify | is the \u201cGujarati Wedding\u201d really something distinct?  Or is this merely an aspect of the familiar regional variability? so all we need to say is \u201cIn Gujarat\u201d?  (Actually, is this too much detail anyway??|date=November 2018}} this step is called ''Hast-Milap'' (literally, \u201cmeeting of hands\u201d). The whole ceremony{{clarify | in Gujarat? or generally?|date=November 2018}} was{{clarify | used to be? or still often is?|date=November 2018}} timed around an auspicious time (''Mauhurat'') for this step and a few decades ago the wedding invitation would even list the time when this event was going to take place.\n\n===Saptapadi \u2013 short form===\n{{Main article|Saptapadi}}\n[[File:Indian wedding.jpg|thumb|A Hindu couple in post-marriage ceremonies, after ''Saptapadi''.

Above is a symbolic arrival of the groom on a horse (''[[baraat]]''), in Nottingham, England. In front is the band.]]\nMany Hindu weddings start with the ''[[ Milne (Hindu ritual) | milne]]'' (meeting) and ''[[ Swagatam (Hindu ritual) | swagatam]]'' (welcome) ceremony. This ritual is where the ''[[baraat]]'' (groom's procession party) arrives at the bride's home or the location where the bride is and marriage will be celebrated. The ''baraat'' typically includes dancing and joyous members of groom's family, relatives and friends. On their arrival, there is a ritual where key persons from the groom's side and bride's side are introduced to each other. The introduction is typically followed by ''jai mala'' (garland exchange between bride and groom) and a reception that serves food and drinks. \n\nMany other rituals and ceremonies are sometimes found in Hindu weddings, such as ''[[Vivaah #Madhuparka ceremony | madhuparka]]'', ''[[ Vivaah #Vivaah Homa (sacred fire ritual) | vivaah-homa]]'', ''[[agni-parinayana]]'', ''[[Vivaah #Ashmarohanam (stepping on the grinding stone) | asmarohana]]'', ''[[Vivaah #Laaja Homam | laja homa]]'', ''abhishek'', ''anna-prashashan'', and ''aashir-vadah''.<ref name=rjb1969/><ref name=kanew/> All these ceremonies are carried out at the wedding location, typically at or near the bride's home.<ref name=ft2008/> These additional rituals include the participation of the brothers, sisters, maternal/paternal relatives, guardians, or friends of the bride.\n\nIn some parts of India, such as Gujarat and Northern India, a ''laja homa'' ritual called ''mangal pher\u0101'' is performed where the couple make four circles around holy fire. It follows ''hasta milap'' (meeting of hands of the couple), but precedes ''saptapadi''.  The first three circles is led by the groom, and it represents three of four goals of life considered important in Hindu life &ndash; ''Dharma'', ''Artha'', ''Kama''. The fourth circle is led by bride and it represents the fourth goal of life &ndash; ''Moksha''.<ref>{{\n\ncite book |last=Srinivasan |first=A.V. |title=The Vedic Wedding: Origins, Tradition, and Practice &ndash; Including a step-by-step wedding ceremony in Sanskrit with English |date=2009 |publisher=Periplus |isbn=9780978544300 |pages=64, 132&ndash;152\n\n}}.</ref> After ''saptapadi'', as hymns are being recited, the groom performs ''m\u0101\u0146g [[sindoor]]'' ritual where a saffron or red color powder is marked into the parting of the wife's hair.<ref name=kanew>{{\n\ncite book |last=Kane |first=P.V. |title=History of Dharmasastra \u2013 Ancient and Medieval Civil Law in India |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=531&ndash;538 |date=1974 |publisher=Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute\n\n}}.</ref> Instead of circling the fire and other steps, the rituals and ceremonies may be performed symbolically, such as stepping on small heaps of rice or throwing grains into the fire.<ref name=kanew/><ref name=pauwels>{{\n\ncite book |last=Pauwels |first=H. |title=Only You: The wedding of Rama and Sita - Past and present in the Ramayana, revisited |pages=165\u2013189 |editor-first=M. |editor-last=Bose |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195168327\n\n}}.</ref>\n\nSome rituals involve<ref name=kanew/> rice or other grains, seeds and pastes.

Rituals include ''darshan'', where the newly married couple are met, blessed and greeted by family and friends of the bride and groom.<ref name=pauwels/>\n\nAfter the Hindu wedding is complete, the bride leaves for groom's home via groom's car. In groom's car, bride and groom sit together, and groom's younger brother drive the car. bride's two sister also come with groom's family, when they arrive to groom house where Hindu family members of the groom welcome the newly wedded couple in a ritual known as ''grihapravesa'' (home coming/entry).<ref name=prabhu2011/> This ceremony typically requires participation of the mother, father, brothers, and sisters, or other guardians of the groom.\n\nAncient literature<ref>\n\nSingh, M.

The body art is produced from a mixture of henna and turmeric. Above a Nepali bride.]]\nIn the Hindu culture of [[Nepal]], marriage rituals are done by the ''Chhetri'' in a sixteen step process that centers on the household. The household is important during the marriage ritual because it is the center of the concept of ''mandala''; the Chhetri's homes are considered to be domestic mandalas and so have roles as householders. The act of marriage brings men and women into the householder role. \n\nMarriage is the most important rite of passage for the Chhetris and is one of the most serious. Women move from their houses to the home of the groom after marriage. The ceremony is done in a precise and careful manner as to not bring bad luck to the families of the bride and groom; certain traditions, for example no one seeing the face of the bride until the end, are followed in order to ensure future prosperity. Prior to the marriage ceremony, there is no kinship between families of the bride and groom and the bride must be a virgin. The marriage ceremony consists of a series of rites that are performed over a two-day period between the houses of the bride and the groom. Within each home the enclosed area in the courtyard (''jagya'') and the kitchen are used the most; the jagya and the kitchen are considered the most important parts of the domestic mandala structure because it is where rice (an important part of the Chhetri's culture) is prepared and consumed. At the end of the ceremony is the establishment of the role of the wife and husband in the husband's home.<ref name=\"Gray 45\u201360\">{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=J.|title=Marriage ritual in Nepal: Space, performance in tacit knowledge|journal=Journal of Ritual Studies|date=2009|volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=45&ndash;60 }}.</ref>\n\nThe first step in the marriage ceremony is called ''Purbanga''. In the kitchen of their homes, the bride and the groom worship the seven Mother Goddesses as so to pay respect to their ancestors and ask for peace. In the second, third, and fourth step, the groom is then blessed by his mother and is taken outside to his jagya where his father and procession (''janti'') carry him and bring gifts for the bride to her house in a ceremony called dul\u00e4h\u00e4 anm\u00e4une. In the fifth step as the groom waits before the house of the bride, gifts of clothes and food are placed around the jagya; the father of the bride then places red paste on the groom's forehead indicating that he is no longer an outsider to his family. The sixth step is the performance of the ''Barani'' or welcoming for the groom and his janti as they enter the jagya. The father purifies the body of the groom using panch\u00e4mrit (nectar from five pure liquids). A small feast is then held for the groom as the next steps in the marriage continue.<ref name=\"Gray 45\u201360\"/>\n\nAfter the small feast, the marriage process for the bride begins. The seventh step takes place in the kitchen of the bride where the process of ''kanya dan'' starts; the bride's parents give their daughter in marriage to her groom thereby allowing the bride to be a part of the groom's lineage and making the father's lineage secondary. After they wash their feet they dress in red and, in the eighth step, sit beside in each other in the jagya. They perform post-marriage rites as they make sacrificial offerings to the fire in the center of the jagya. During these rites the bride and groom perform tasks such as placing red powder in the hair of the bride and the bride eats leftover food of the groom and at the end the now husband gives his wife a personal name for which she is to be called by.<ref name=\"Gray 45\u201360\"/>\n\nAfter the post-marriage ceremony, the married couple being to leave the bride's home. In the ninth step, the husband and wife return to the kitchen of the wife and worship their ancestors and the seven Mother Goddesses. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth step, the couple leave the wife's house as she is given a garland from her parents; the wife and husband enter the jagya and are then escorted out riding on palanquins as they return to their permanent home of the husband. The thirteenth step beings once they enter the jagya of the groom and his virgin sisters welcome the wife in a ceremony called ''arti sy\u00e4l''. They unveil the bride and adorn her with flower garlands and sprinkle puffed rice on her (a sign of prosperity). The fourteenth step is completed once the bride promises gifts to the sisters; she then moves on the fifteenth step where she steps on piles of rice in a path toward the kitchen. The final step is a series of rites, the first of which is the bride worshiping the ancestors and deities of the husband; she then demonstrates her skills in handling rice to the husband's mother and sisters and then they entwine her hair. Finally, the mother unveils the bride again in front of the husband and in a ceremony called ''khutta dhog'', the bride places the foot of the mother on her forehead thereby ending the marriage ceremony.<ref name=\"Gray 45\u201360\"/>\n\n==Wedding and married life in Hinduism==\nWhile there are many rituals in Hinduism, such as those at birth and deaths of loved ones, the Hindu wedding is the most important and extensive personal ritual an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life.<ref name=rjb1969/> Typical Hindu families spend significant effort and financial resources to prepare and celebrate weddings.\n\n===Economics===\n[[File:A fancy Indian wedding taking place in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, India.jpg|thumb|A fancy Indian wedding taking place in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, India]]\nIn 2008, Indian weddings market was estimated to be $31 billion a year.<ref name=ft2008/> Various sources estimate India celebrates about 10 million weddings per year,<ref>CBS News.

According to the [[Hindu Marriage Act]] of 1955, passed by the [[Parliament of India]], for all legal purposes, all Hindus of any caste, creed or sect, Sikh, Buddhists and Jains are deemed Hindus and can [[Inter caste marriage|intermarry]]. By the [[Special Marriage Act, 1954]], a Hindu can marry a person who is not Hindu, employing any ceremony, provided specified legal conditions are fulfilled. By Section&nbsp;7 of Hindu Marriage Act, and tradition, no Hindu marriage is binding and complete before the seventh step of the ''Saptapadi'' ritual, in presence of fire, by the bride and the groom together.<ref name=menski2001>Menski, W.

Hence wife is considered to be the '''Ardhangani''' of husband as per Hindu tradition. Marriage is not for self-indulgence, but is considered a lifelong social and spiritual responsibility. Married life is considered an opportunity for two people to grow as life partners into soul-mates.<ref>Jyoti, A. (2003 Mar-Apr).
