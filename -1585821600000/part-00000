Due to their flexibility, \nthese models have diverse applications in the medical field, with the ability to capture disease progression with an intervening\ntreatment. As the figures indicate, the ''hyperbolastic functions'' can fit a sigmoidal curve indicating that the slowest rate occurs at \nthe early and late stages. In addition to the presenting sigmoidal shapes, it can also accommodate biphasic situations where medical  \ninterventions slow or reverse disease progression; but, when the effect of the treatment vanishes, the disease will begin the \nsecond phase of its progression until it reaches it's horizontal asymptote.\n\nOne of the main characteristics these functions have is that they cannot only fit sigmoidal shapes, but can also model biphasic growth patterns that other classical sigmoidal curves cannot adequately model. This distinguishing feature has advantageous applications in various fields including medicine, biology, economics, and engineering.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1099/mic.0.25880-0|title = Biphasic kinetics of growth and bacteriocin production with Lactobacillus amylovorus DCE 471 occur under stress conditions|year = 2003|last1 = Neysens|first1 = Patricia|last2 = Messens|first2 = Winy|last3 = Gevers|first3 = Dirk|last4 = Swings|first4 = Jean|last5 = De Vuyst|first5 = Luc|journal = Microbiology|volume = 149|issue = 4|pages = 1073\u20131082|pmid = 12686649}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Chu |first=Charlene |last2=Han |first2=Christina  |last3=Shimizu |first3=Hiromi  |last4=Wong |first4=Bonnie  |title=The Effect of Fructose, Galactose, and Glucose on the Induction of \u03b2-Galactosidase in ''Escherichia coli'' |url=https://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/roles/drupal_ungrad/JEMI/2/2-1.pdf |year=2002 |journal=Journal of Experimental Microbiology and Immunology |volume=2 |pages=1\u20135}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.3934/mbe.2013.10.925| title=T model of growth and its application in systems of tumor-immunedynamics| journal=Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering| year=2013| volume=10| issue=3| pages=925\u2013938| pmid=23906156| last1=Tabatabai| first1=M.

Likewise, Varhadi replaces the case endings ''la'' (\u0932\u093e) & ''na'' (\u0928\u093e) of standard Marathi with ''le'' (\u0932\u0947), a feature it shares with neighboring [[Khandeshi]] [[dialect]]. So, ''mala'' (\u092e\u0932\u093e) (to me) of standard Marathi becomes ''male'' (\u092e\u0932\u0947) while ''tyanna'' (\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0902\u0928\u093e) (to them) becomes ''tyahile'' (\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u0947) in Varhadi. Despite being a dialect of Marathi, the vocabulary as well as grammar of Varhadi is significantly influenced by [[Hindi]] due proximity of Vidarbha to [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The common examples of Hindi words in Varhadi which are different than standard Marathi are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Varhadi !! Hindi !! Standard Marathi !!

For instance, to give stress on a request or an order, suffix {{IAST|zo}} (\u091c\u094b) (singular)/ {{IAST|z\u0101}} (\u091c\u093e) (plural) is used like \"{{IAST|Mahya porichya lagnale ye za}} (\u092e\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092a\u094b\u0930\u0940\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0932\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u092f\u0947\u091c\u093e ) \"Please attend my daughter\u2019s wedding.\" Also, there are words & phrases maintained by Varhadi which were present in older Marathi (spoken 300 years ago or even prior to that) and have vanished from mainstream Marathi. E.g., in vocative case, {{IAST|aga}} (\u0905\u0917\u093e) is said in Varhadi instead of \u2018''are''\u2019 (\u0905\u0930\u0947) of standard Marathi. Another good example is the sentence construction of past continuous tense e.g. in Varhadi, it is said \u2018''Tho bahu abhyas kare''\" (\u0925\u094b \u092c\u0939\u0942 \u0905\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u0930\u0947) (He studied a lot) unlike \"''To khup abhyas karaycha''\" (\u0924\u094b \u0916\u0942\u092a \u0905\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u0930\u093e\u092f\u091a\u093e) of standard Marathi.\n\nIn most of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] (or even in [[Dravidian languages]], for that matter), Sanskritized words of standard language get simplified in spoken dialects. Exceptionally, Varhadi has a few [[Sanskrit]] ''[[tatsama]]'' words for whom the standard Marathi counterparts are modified words (''[[tadbhava]] shabda'') such as in eastern parts of Vidarbha, snake is called {{IAST|sarpa}} (\u0938\u0930\u094d\u092a) unlike {{IAST|s\u0101p}} (\u0938\u093e\u092a) of standard Marathi.\n\n\tThe forms of Varhadi vary in different parts of Vidarbha and also, as per castes. The influence of Hindi increases as one moves towards Madhya Pradesh. E.g. in the parts adjacent to Madhya Pradesh, \u2018''zana padte''\u2019 (\u091c\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u092a\u0921\u0924\u0947) (I have to go) is preferred over \u2018''zaa lagte''\u2019 (\u091c\u093e \u0932\u093e\u0917\u0924\u0947), which is similar to Hindi \u2018''jana padta hai''\u2019 (\u091c\u093e\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948). Also, consonant \u2018''cha''\u2019 (\u091a) (like in ''chook'')(\u091a\u0942\u0915), prevalent in Marathi but absent in Hindi, is often pronounced as \u2018''cha''\u2019 like in ''vachan'' (\u0935\u091a\u0928). So, ''paach'' (\u092a\u093e\u091a) (five) may be pronounced as ''paanch'' of Hindi.\n\t\nIn the areas closer to [[Marathwada]] region of Maharashtra and on the contrary, distant to Madhya Pradesh, Varhadi is influenced by dialects of adjacent parts of Marathwada. One can easily recognize a person from Pusad, Digras or Umarkhed taluka of [[Yavatmal]] district by his sentence of present continuous tense. Somebody from this area will say \u2018''me mandirat zaylo''\u2019 (\u092e\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924 \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0932\u094b) (I am going to visit a temple) instead of \u2018''mee mandirat zaun rahilo''\u2019 (\u092e\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924 \u091c\u093e\u090a\u0928 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u094b) of other parts of Vidarbha. Similarly, the tone of speech in Chikhli, Mehkar, Deulgaonraja talukas of [[Buldana]] district is similar to that of nearby parts of Marathwada. If someone from this area speaks to a person from Nagpur or Wardha, the latter may get confused whether the former is from Vidarbha or Marathwada. Likewise, Khandeshi dialect spoken in parts of [[Jalgaon]] district adjacent to Vidarbha is too similar to be differentiated from Varhadi of [[Malkapur, Buldhana|Malkapur]]- [[Shegaon]] belt of Buldana district.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nagpur]]\n*[[Vidarbha]] [[Regions and Divisions of Maharashtra|region]] of [[Maharashtra]].\n*[[Maharashtra#Languages|Languages in Maharashtra]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Incubator|code=vah}}\n* [http://www.language-archives.org/language/vah \"Resources in and about the Varhadi-Nagpuri language\"]\n* [http://www.india9.com/i9show/Varhadi-50721.htm Varhadi at India9]\n* [http://devplw.library.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/sdi/vbook/browse?type=lcsubc&key=Varhadi-Nagpuri%20dialect%20--%20Dictionaries Varhadi Language in Penn Libraries]\n\n{{Languages of India}}\n\n[[Category:Southern Indo-Aryan languages]]\n[[Category:Indo-Aryan languages]]\n[[Category:Vidarbha]]\n[[Category:Marathi language]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=April 2017}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2015}}\n{{Infobox language\n| name = Varhadi\n| altname = Varhadi\u2013Nagpuri\n| nativename = \u0935\u0931\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0921\u0940\n| states = [[India]]\n| region = [[Vidarbha]] region of [[States and Territories of India|Maharashtra]]; also southwestern [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] and northern [[Andhra Pradesh]]\n| speakers = 7.0 million\n| date = 1995\n| ref = e18\n| familycolor = Indo-European\n| fam2 = [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]\n| fam3 = [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]\n| fam4 = [[Southern Indo-Aryan languages|Southern Zone]]\n| fam5 = [[Marathi Language|Marathi]]\n| script = [[Devan\u0101gar\u012b|Devanagari]]<ref>Devanagari has been big bigger with LOVEpromulgated as the official script.</ref>\n| iso3 = vah\n| notice = Indic\n| glotto = varh1239\n| glottorefname = Varhadi-Nagpuri\n}}\n\n'''Varhadi''' is a dialect of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] spoken in [[Vidarbha]] region of [[Maharashtra]] and by [[Marathi people]] of adjoining parts of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Andhra Pradesh|Telangana]] in [[India]].\n\n== Vocabulary and Grammar ==\n\nAlthough all the dialects of Marathi are mutually intelligible to one another up to a great extent, each dialect can be distinctly identified by its unique characteristics.

Despite being a dialect of Marathi, the vocabulary as well as grammar of Varhadi is significantly influenced by [[Hindi]] due proximity of Vidarbha to [[Madhya Pradesh]]. The common examples of Hindi words in Varhadi which are different than standard Marathi are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Varhadi !! Hindi !! Standard Marathi !!

For instance, to give stress on a request or an order, suffix {{IAST|zo}} (\u091c\u094b) (singular)/ {{IAST|z\u0101}} (\u091c\u093e) (plural) is used like \"{{IAST|Mahya porichya lagnale ye za}} (\u092e\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092a\u094b\u0930\u0940\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0932\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u092f\u0947\u091c\u093e ) \"Please attend my daughter\u2019s wedding.\" Also, there are words & phrases maintained by Varhadi which were present in older Marathi (spoken 300 years ago or even prior to that) and have vanished from mainstream Marathi. E.g., in vocative case, {{IAST|aga}} (\u0905\u0917\u093e) is said in Varhadi instead of \u2018''are''\u2019 (\u0905\u0930\u0947) of standard Marathi. Another good example is the sentence construction of past continuous tense e.g. in Varhadi, it is said \u2018''Tho bahu abhyas kare''\" (\u0925\u094b \u092c\u0939\u0942 \u0905\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u0930\u0947) (He studied a lot) unlike \"''To khup abhyas karaycha''\" (\u0924\u094b \u0916\u0942\u092a \u0905\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u0930\u093e\u092f\u091a\u093e) of standard Marathi.\n\nIn most of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] (or even in [[Dravidian languages]], for that matter), Sanskritized words of standard language get simplified in spoken dialects. Exceptionally, Varhadi has a few [[Sanskrit]] ''[[tatsama]]'' words for whom the standard Marathi counterparts are modified words (''[[tadbhava]] shabda'') such as in eastern parts of Vidarbha, snake is called {{IAST|sarpa}} (\u0938\u0930\u094d\u092a) unlike {{IAST|s\u0101p}} (\u0938\u093e\u092a) of standard Marathi.\n\n\tThe forms of Varhadi vary in different parts of Vidarbha and also, as per castes. The influence of Hindi increases as one moves towards Madhya Pradesh. E.g. in the parts adjacent to Madhya Pradesh, \u2018''zana padte''\u2019 (\u091c\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u092a\u0921\u0924\u0947) (I have to go) is preferred over \u2018''zaa lagte''\u2019 (\u091c\u093e \u0932\u093e\u0917\u0924\u0947), which is similar to Hindi \u2018''jana padta hai''\u2019 (\u091c\u093e\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948). Also, consonant \u2018''cha''\u2019 (\u091a) (like in ''chook'')(\u091a\u0942\u0915), prevalent in Marathi but absent in Hindi, is often pronounced as \u2018''cha''\u2019 like in ''vachan'' (\u0935\u091a\u0928). So, ''paach'' (\u092a\u093e\u091a) (five) may be pronounced as ''paanch'' of Hindi.\n\t\nIn the areas closer to [[Marathwada]] region of Maharashtra and on the contrary, distant to Madhya Pradesh, Varhadi is influenced by dialects of adjacent parts of Marathwada. One can easily recognize a person from Pusad, Digras or Umarkhed taluka of [[Yavatmal]] district by his sentence of present continuous tense. Somebody from this area will say \u2018''me mandirat zaylo''\u2019 (\u092e\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924 \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0932\u094b) (I am going to visit a temple) instead of \u2018''mee mandirat zaun rahilo''\u2019 (\u092e\u0940 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924 \u091c\u093e\u090a\u0928 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u094b) of other parts of Vidarbha. Similarly, the tone of speech in Chikhli, Mehkar, Deulgaonraja talukas of [[Buldana]] district is similar to that of nearby parts of Marathwada. If someone from this area speaks to a person from Nagpur or Wardha, the latter may get confused whether the former is from Vidarbha or Marathwada. Likewise, Khandeshi dialect spoken in parts of [[Jalgaon]] district adjacent to Vidarbha is too similar to be differentiated from Varhadi of [[Malkapur, Buldhana|Malkapur]]- [[Shegaon]] belt of Buldana district.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nagpur]]\n*[[Vidarbha]] [[Regions and Divisions of Maharashtra|region]] of [[Maharashtra]].\n*[[Maharashtra#Languages|Languages in Maharashtra]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Incubator|code=vah}}\n* [http://www.language-archives.org/language/vah \"Resources in and about the Varhadi-Nagpuri language\"]\n* [http://www.india9.com/i9show/Varhadi-50721.htm Varhadi at India9]\n* [http://devplw.library.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/sdi/vbook/browse?type=lcsubc&key=Varhadi-Nagpuri%20dialect%20--%20Dictionaries Varhadi Language in Penn Libraries]\n\n{{Languages of India}}\n\n[[Category:Southern Indo-Aryan languages]]\n[[Category:Indo-Aryan languages]]\n[[Category:Vidarbha]]\n[[Category:Marathi language]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4042:208a:4389:a151:aeda:e45:6e0a", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varhadi_dialect"}

{"title_page": "Tropical rainforest climate", "text_new": "[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map Af present.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Worldwide zones of Tropical rainforest climate (Af).]]A '''tropical rainforest climate''' is a [[tropical climate]] usually found within 10 to 15 degrees latitude of the [[equator]], and has at least 60 mm of rainfall every month of the year. Regions with this climate are typically designated ''Af'' by the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. A tropical rainforest climate is typically hot, very weird and wet.\n\n==Description==\nTropical rain forests have a type of [[tropical climate]] in which there is no [[dry season]]&mdash;all months have an average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] value of at least {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}}. In rainforest climates the dry season is very short, and rainfall is normally heavy throughout the year. One day in a tropical rainforest climate can be very similar to the next, while the change in temperature between day and night may be larger than the average change in temperature during the year. <ref name=McKnight>{{Cite book \n| last1 = McKnight \n| first1 = Tom L \n| last2 = Hess \n| first2 = Darrel \n| year = 2000 \n| chapter = Climate Zones and Types \n| title = Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation \n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn/page/205 205&ndash;8] \n| location = Upper Saddle River, NJ \n| publisher = Prentice Hall \n| isbn = 978-0-13-020263-5 \n| url = https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn/page/205 \n}}</ref>\n\nWhen tropical rain forest climates are more dominated by the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) than the trade winds (and with no or rare cyclones), so usually located near the equator, they are also called equatorial climates. Otherwise, when they are more dominated by the trade winds than the ITCZ, they are called tropical trade-wind climates. In pure equatorial climates, the atmospheric pressure is low, almost constant so the (horizontal) pressure gradient is low. Consequently the winds are rare and usually weak (except sea and land breezes in coastal areas) while in tropical trade-wind climates, often located at higher latitudes than the equatorial climates, wind is almost permanent which incidentally explains why rainforest formations are impoverished compared to those of equatorial climates due to their necessary resistance to strong winds accompanying tropical disturbances.<ref>Climatologie Pierre Estienne Alain Godard, pages 309 and 316</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:Rainbow Jungle.jpg|thumb|upright=2.25|right|Upland rain forest in Borneo.

The climate is most commonly found in [[South America]], [[Central Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. These rain forests are uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year. Locations in [[Oceania]], areas along the  coast of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], from [[Ecuador]] to [[Belize]], parts of [[Central Africa]], and much of [[Indonesia]] have this

of Tropical rainforest climate (Af).]]A '''tropical rainforest climate''' is a [[tropical climate]] usually found within 10 to 15 degrees latitude of the [[equator]], and has at least 60 mm of rainfall every month of the year. Regions with this climate are typically designated ''Af'' by the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. A tropical rainforest climate is typically hot, very humid and wet.\n\n==Description==\nTropical rain forests have a type of [[tropical climate]] in which there is no [[dry season]]&mdash;all months have an average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] value of at least {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}}. In rainforest climates the dry season is very short, and rainfall is normally heavy throughout the year. One day in a tropical rainforest climate can be very similar to the next, while the change in temperature between day and night may be larger than the average change in temperature during the year. <ref name=McKnight>{{Cite book \n| last1 = McKnight \n| first1 = Tom L \n| last2 = Hess \n| first2 = Darrel \n| year = 2000 \n| chapter = Climate Zones and Types \n| title = Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation \n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn/page/205 205&ndash;8] \n| location = Upper Saddle River, NJ \n| publisher = Prentice Hall \n| isbn = 978-0-13-020263-5 \n| url = https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn/page/205 \n}}</ref>\n\nWhen tropical rain forest climates are more dominated by the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) than the trade winds (and with no or rare cyclones), so usually located near the equator, they are also called equatorial climates. Otherwise, when they are more dominated by the trade winds than the ITCZ, they are called tropical trade-wind climates. In pure equatorial climates, the atmospheric pressure is low, almost constant so the (horizontal) pressure gradient is low. Consequently the winds are rare and usually weak (except sea and land breezes in coastal areas) while in tropical trade-wind climates, often located at higher latitudes than the equatorial climates, wind is almost permanent which incidentally explains why rainforest formations are impoverished compared to those of equatorial climates due to their necessary resistance to strong winds accompanying tropical disturbances.<ref>Climatologie Pierre Estienne Alain Godard, pages 309 and 316</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:Rainbow Jungle.jpg|thumb|upright=2.25|right|Upland rain forest in Borneo.

The climate is most commonly found in [[South America]], [[Central Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]]. These rain forests are uniformly and monotonously wet throughout the year.

Describing itself as the friend of \"The Honest Financier, the Bona Fide Investor, the Respectable Broker, the Genuine Director, and the Legitimate Speculator\", it was a four-page journal. The readership was the financial community of the [[City of London]], its only rival being the slightly older and more daring ''Financial News''. On 2 January 1893 the ''FT'' began printing on light [[salmon-pink]] paper to distinguish it from the similarly named ''Financial News'': at the time it was also cheaper to print on unbleached paper (several other more general newspapers, such as ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', had the same policy), but nowadays it is more expensive as the paper has to be dyed specially.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the newspaper|url=http://help.ft.com/newspaper-delivery/about-the-newspaper/#axzz3ZDPTGgyZ|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108062240/http://help.ft.com/newspaper-delivery/about-the-newspaper/#axzz3ZDPTGgyZ|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 January 2012|website=ft.com|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter 57 years of rivalry the ''Financial Times'' and the ''Financial News'' were merged in 1945 by [[Brendan Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken|Brendan Bracken]] to form a single six-page newspaper.

It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting a renewed impetus in the [[world economy]] towards [[globalisation]]. As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the ''FT'' began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as the international language of business. On 1 January 1979 the first ''FT'' (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt.

This provided a summary of news from around the globe, which was supplemented in February 1996 with stock price coverage; the second-generation site was launched in spring 1996. The site was funded by advertising and contributed to the online advertising market in the UK in the late 1990s. Between 1997 and 2000 the site underwent several revamps and changes of strategy, as the FT Group and Pearson reacted to changes online.

FT Knowledge has offered the \"Introducing the City\" course (which is a series of Wednesday night lectures and seminars, as well as weekend events) during each autumn and spring since 2000.\n\nFT Predict is a [[prediction market]] contest hosted by the ''Financial Times'' that allows users to buy and sell contracts based on future financial, political, and news-driven events by spending fictional Financial Times Dollars (FT$). Based on the assumptions displayed in James Surowiecki's ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]'', this contest allows people to use prediction markets to observe future occurrences while competing for weekly and monthly prizes.\n\nThe ''Financial Times'' also ran a business-related game called \"In the Pink\" (a phrase meaning \"in good health\", also a reference to the colour of the newspaper and to the phrase \"in the red\" meaning to be making a loss). Each player was put in the virtual role of Chief Executive and the goal was to have the highest [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the game closes. The winner of the game (the player who makes the highest profit) was to receive a real monetary prize of \u00a310,000. The game ran from 1 May to 28 June 2006.\n\n==Indices==\nThe ''Financial Times'' collates and publishes a number of financial market indices, which reflect the changing value of their constituent parts. The longest-running of these was the former ''Financial News Index'', started on 1 July 1935 by the ''Financial News''. The ''FT'' published a similar index; this was replaced by the ''Financial News Index''\u2014which was then renamed the ''Financial Times (FT) Index''\u2014on 1 January 1947. The index started as an index of industrial shares, and companies with dominant overseas interests were excluded, such as the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (later [[BP]]), [[British-American Tobacco]], [[Lever Brothers]] (later [[Unilever]]) and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]. The oil and financial sectors were included decades later.<ref name=Littlewood>''The Stock Market'', John Littlewood.</ref>\n\nThe [[FTSE All-Share Index]], the first of the FTSE series of indices, was created in 1962, comprising the largest 594 UK companies by market capitalisation.<ref name=Littlewood /> The letters F-T-S-E represented that FTSE was a joint venture between the Financial Times ('''F-T''') and the [[London Stock Exchange]] ('''S-E''').

At the same time it announced plans to cut the editorial staff from 525 to 475. In August 2006 it announced that all the required job cuts had been achieved through voluntary layoffs.\n\nA number of former ''FT'' journalists have gone on to high-profile jobs in journalism, politics and business. [[Robert James Thomson|Robert Thomson]], previously the paper's US managing editor, was the editor of ''[[The Times]]'' and is now the publisher of the ''Wall Street Journal''. [[William Lewis (journalist)|Will Lewis]], a former New York correspondent and News Editor for the ''FT'', is the current editor of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''. [[Dominic Lawson]] went on to become editor of the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' until he was sacked in 2005. [[Andrew Adonis]], a former education correspondent, became an adviser on education to the then British Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]], and was given a job as an education minister and a seat in the [[House of Lords]] after the 2005 election. [[Ed Balls]] became chief economic adviser to the Treasury, working closely with [[Gordon Brown]], the [[chancellor of the exchequer]] (or finance minister), before being elected a Member of Parliament in 2005, and became [[Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]] in July 2007. [[Bernard Gray]], a former defence correspondent and Lex columnist, was chief executive of the publishing company CMP before becoming chief executive of TSL Education, publisher of the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]''. David Jones, at one time the FT Night Editor, then became Head of IT. He was a key figure in the newspaper's transformation from hot metal to electronic composition and then onto full-page pagination in the 1990s. He went on to become Head of Technology for the Trinity Mirror Group.\n\nSir Geoffrey Owen was the editor of the ''Financial Times'' from 1981 to 1990. He joined the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at the [[London School of Economics]] as Director of Business Policy in 1991 and was appointed Senior Fellow, Institute of Management, in 1997.

Describing itself as the friend of \"The Honest Financier, the Bona Fide Investor, the Respectable Broker, the Genuine Director, and the Legitimate Speculator\", it was a four-page journal. The readership was the financial community of the [[City of London]], its only rival being the slightly older and more daring ''Financial News''. On 2 January 1893 the ''FT'' began printing on light [[salmon-pink]] paper to distinguish it from the similarly named ''Financial News'': at the time it was also cheaper to print on unbleached paper (several other more general newspapers, such as ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', had the same policy), but nowadays it is more expensive as the paper has to be dyed specially.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the newspaper|url=http://help.ft.com/newspaper-delivery/about-the-newspaper/#axzz3ZDPTGgyZ|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108062240/http://help.ft.com/newspaper-delivery/about-the-newspaper/#axzz3ZDPTGgyZ|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 January 2012|website=ft.com|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter 57 years of rivalry the ''Financial Times'' and the ''Financial News'' were merged in 1945 by [[Brendan Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken|Brendan Bracken]] to form a single six-page newspaper.

It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting a renewed impetus in the [[world economy]] towards [[globalisation]]. As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the ''FT'' began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as the international language of business. On 1 January 1979 the first ''FT'' (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt. Since then, with increased international coverage, the ''FT'' has become a global newspaper, printed in 22 locations with five international editions to serve the UK, continental Europe, the U.S., Asia and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fttoolkit.co.uk/2011mediakit/history_video.html |title=FT's Media Kit: FT Heritage and Innovation |publisher=Fttoolkit.co.uk |date= |accessdate=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215215337/http://www.fttoolkit.co.uk/2011mediakit/history_video.html |archive-date=15 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe European edition is distributed in continental Europe and [[Africa]].

The site was funded by advertising and contributed to the online advertising market in the UK in the late 1990s.

The Public prosecutor's office in [[Munich]] subsequently launched an investigation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/finanzen/wirecard-ermittlungen-gegen-financial-times-journalisten-16047237.html |title=Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt gegen einen Financial-Times-Journalisten |publisher=faz.net |date=18 February 2019 |accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref> After the formal complaint of an investor, Wirecard and the German [[Federal Financial Supervisory Authority]] the responsible state's attorney is currently investigating several ''FT'' journalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/zahlungsdienstleister-wirecard-erhebt-schwere-anschuldigungen-gegen-die-financial-times/24681644.html |title=Wirecard erhebt schwere Anschuldigungen gegen die \u201eFinancial Times\u201c |publisher=Handelsblatt |date=21 July 2019 |accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Audience==\n[[File:Financial Times dispenser W.H.

The first section covers domestic and international news, editorial commentary on politics and economics from ''FT'' journalists such as [[Martin Wolf]], [[Gillian Tett]] and [[Edward Luce]], and opinion pieces from globally renowned leaders, policymakers, academics and commentators. The second section consists of financial data and news about companies and markets.

The name may originally have stood for ''Lex Mercatoria'', a Latin expression meaning literally \"merchant law\". It was conceived by [[Hargreaves Parkinson]] for the ''Financial News'' in the 1930s and moved to the ''Financial Times'' when the two merged.\n\n''Lex'' boasts some distinguished alumni who have gone on to make careers in business and government&nbsp;\u2013 including [[Nigel Lawson]] (former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer), [[Richard Lambert]] (CBI director and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee), Martin Taylor (former chief executive of Barclays), John Makinson (chairman and chief executive of Penguin), John Gardiner (former chairman of Tesco), [[David Freud]] (former UBS banker and Labour adviser, now a Conservative peer), John Kingman (former head of UKFI and a banker at Rothschild's), George Graham (RBS banker), [[Andrew Balls]] (head of European portfolio management at PIMCO) and [[Jo Johnson]] (former Conservative Member of Parliament for Orpington).<ref name=\"about_lex\">{{cite web|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070903221825/http://www.ft.com/lex/about | archive-date = 3 September 2007 |url = http://www.ft.com/lex/about|title = About Lex|accessdate =4 September 2007|work=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n==''FT Weekend''==\nThe ''FT'' publishes a Saturday edition of the newspaper called the ''Financial Times Weekend''.

Wu was the only [[queen regnant|empress regnant]] (or female [[Emperor of China|emperor]]) in the [[history of China]].\n\nWu was the concubine of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]. After his death, she married his successor\u2014his ninth son, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]], officially becoming Gaozong's ''[[Imperial consorts of Tang China|huanghou]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u540e}}, empress consort, title for the reigning emperor's main consort) in 655, although having considerable political power prior to this. After Gaozong's debilitating stroke in 660, Wu Zetian became administrator of the court, a position equal to the emperor's until 705, Empress Wu During her husband's reign, she had many honors, privileges and power that no Empress's consort, had in the past, and And for years behind her was a supreme power concealed and after Gaozong's death, she assumed full power and became the first and only female emperor of China.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p=96}}</ref>\n\nThe importance to history of Wu Zetian's period of political and military leadership includes the major expansion of the Chinese empire, extending it far beyond its previous territorial limits, deep into [[Central Asia]], and engaging in a series of wars on the [[Korean Peninsula]], first [[Goguryeo\u2013Tang War|allying with Silla against Goguryeo]], and then [[Silla\u2013Tang War|against Silla]] over the occupation of former [[Goguryeo]] territory. Within China, besides the more direct consequences of her struggle to gain and maintain supreme power, Wu's leadership resulted in important effects regarding social class in Chinese society and in relation to state support for [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], education, and literature. Wu Zetian also had a monumental impact upon the statuary of the [[Longmen Grottoes]] and the \"Wordless Stele\" at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], as well as the construction of some major buildings and bronze castings that no longer survive.\n\nBesides her career as a political leader, Wu Zetian also had an active family life. Although family relationships sometimes became problematic, Wu Zetian was the mother of four sons, three of whom also carried the title of emperor, although one held that title only as a posthumous honor. One of her grandsons became the renowned [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]].\n\n== Names and titles ==\n{{Further|Chinese name}}\n\nIn Chinese history and literature, Wu Zetian ({{IPA-cmn|\u00f9 ts\u0264\u030c t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n}}) was known by various names and titles. Mention of her in the English language has only increased their number. A difficulty in English translations from Chinese is that English translations tend to specify gender (as in the case of \"emperor\" versus \"empress\" or \"prince\" versus \"princess\"); whereas, in [[Classical Chinese]], words such as ''hou'' ({{lang|zh|\u540e}}, \"sovereign\", \"prince\", \"queen\") or ''huangdi'' {{lang|zh|(\u7687\u5e1d}}, \"imperial supreme ruler\", \"royal deity\") are of a [[Grammatical gender#Indeterminate gender|grammatically indeterminate gender]].\n\n=== Names ===\nThe exact birth name of Wu Zetian is no longer retrievable.

Wu was her patronymic surname, which she retained, according to traditional Chinese practice, after marriage to Gaozong, of the Li family. Emperor Taizong gave her the [[art name]] Wu Mei ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5a9a}}), meaning \"glamorous\".<ref name=\"NBT76\" /> (Thus, today Chinese people often refer to her as Wu Mei or Wu Meiniang ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5a9a\u5a18}}) when they write about her youth, whereas they refer to her as Wu Hou ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u540e}}) when referring to her as empress consort and empress dowager, and Wu Zetian ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5247\u5929}}) when referring to her reign as empress regnant.){{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n=== Titles  ===\nDuring her life, and posthumously, Wu Zetian was awarded various official titles.

Generally, the monarch was male and his chief spouse was given a title such as ''huanghou'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u540e}}), often translated as \"empress\" or more specific \"empress consort\". Upon the death of the emperor, the surviving empress consort could become [[empress dowager]], sometimes wielding considerable political power as [[Regency (government)|regent]] during the [[Minority reign|minority]] of the (male) heir to the position of emperor.\n\nSince the time of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (259\u2013210 BC) the [[Emperor of China]] used the title ''huangdi'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u5e1d}}, translated as \"emperor\" or \"empress (regnant)\" as appropriate).

In the same year, a [[List of solar eclipses in the 7th century|total eclipse of the sun]] was visible across China. Her father [[Wu Shihuo]] was engaged in the timber business and the family was relatively well off. Her mother was from the powerful Yang family. During the final years of [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], Li Yuan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6df5}}) (who would go on to become Emperor Gaozu of Tang) stayed in the Wu household many times and became close to the Wu family, whilst holding appointments in both Hedong and [[Taiyuan]]. After Li Yuan overthrew Emperor Yang, he was generous to the Wu family, providing them with money, grain, land, and clothing. Once the Tang dynasty became established, Wu Shihou held a succession of senior ministerial posts including governor of [[Yangzhou]], Lizhou, and Jingzhou ({{lang|zh|\u834a\u5dde}}) (modern day [[Jiangling County]], [[Hubei]]).\n\nWu Zetian was born into a rich family. She had servants at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would ever have to learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Wu did not seem to be the type of child who would want to sit quietly and do needlework or sip tea all day{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. So Wu read and learned about many different topics such as politics and other governmental affairs, writing, literature, and music. Wu grew and continued to learn as much as she could, with her father backing her every step of the way{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}.

Wu progressively gained Immeasurable influence over the governance of the empire throughout Emperor Gaozong's reign, and eventually she effectively was making the major decisions. She was regarded as ruthless in her endeavours to grab power and was believed by traditional historians even to have killed her own children but was actually false as these rumors came up 400 years after her death as ancient China could not accept that a women was in power\n\n[[File:Gaozong of Tang.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of Emperor Gaozong of Tang from ''An 18th century album of portraits of 86 emperors of China, with Chinese historical notes'']]\nGaozong became emperor at the age of 21.

Empress Wang, seeing that Emperor Gaozong was still impressed by Consort Wu's beauty, hoped that the arrival of a new concubine would divert the emperor from Consort Xiao, and therefore secretly told Consort Wu to stop shaving her hair and, at a later point, welcomed her to the palace. (Some modern historians dispute this traditional account, and some think that Consort Wu never had left the imperial palace and might have had an affair with Emperor Gaozong while Emperor Taizong was still alive.){{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nConsort Wu soon overtook Consort Xiao as Emperor Gaozong's favourite. In 652, she gave birth to her first child, a son named [[Li Hong]]. In 653, she gave birth to another son, [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]]. Neither of these sons were in contention to be Emperor Gaozong's heir because Emperor Gaozong had, at the request of officials influenced by Empress Wang and her uncle, the chancellor [[Liu Shi (Tang dynasty)|Liu Shi]], designated his oldest son [[Li Zhong]] as his heir. Li Zhong's mother, Consort Liu, was of lowly birth and Empress Wang expected her gratitude. By 654, both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao had lost favour with Emperor Gaozong, and these two former romantic rivals joined forces against Consort Wu, but to no avail. As a sign of his love for Consort Wu, in 654 Emperor Gaozong conferred posthumous honors on her father [[Wu Shihuo]].\n\nAs the year 654 continued, shortly after Consort Wu had given birth to her daughter, the baby died, with some evidence suggesting deliberate [[Strangling|strangulation]], including allegations by Wu, the child's mother. Consort Wu accused Wang of murder.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" /> Wu's rival Wang was accused of having been seen near the child's room, with corroborating testimony by alleged eyewitnesses. Emperor Gaozong was led to believe that Wang had the means to kill the child, and likely done so, motivated by jealousy. Wang lacked an alibi, and was unable to clear herself. Angry, Emperor Gaozong considered deposing Empress Wang and elevating Consort Wu to her position; but, first he wanted to make sure that the government chancellors would support this. So, Gaozong visited the house of his uncle [[Zhangsun Wuji]], the head chancellor, together with Consort Wu (later Emperor Gaozong would award Chancellor Zhangsun with much treasure). During the meeting, Gaozong several times brought up the topic of Empress Wang's childlessness, a topic easily leading to an excuse sufficient to depose her; however, Zhangsun repeatedly found ways to divert the conversation. Subsequent visits by Consort Wu's mother Lady Yang and the official [[Xu Jingzong]], who was allied with Consort Wu, to seek support from Zhangsun also were to no avail.<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377199|vol. 199]]}}</ref> Scientifically credible [[forensic pathology]] information about the death of the child does not exist, and scholars lack real, concrete evidence about her death. However, speculation seems to continue.\n\nAs traditional folklore tends to portray Wu as a power hungry woman with no care for who she hurt or what she did, the most popular theory is that Wu killed her own child in order to implicate Wang. Other schools of thought argue that Wang indeed killed the child out of jealousy and hatred toward Wu since Wang had no children of her own. The third argument is that the child died of [[asphyxiation]] or [[crib death]], considering that the ventilation systems of the time were non-existent or of poor quality. Lack of ventilation combined with using coal as a heating method could lead to a build-up of fumes that would lead to [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. No matter what caused the death of the child, Wu blamed Wang for it and Wang was removed from her position as Empress.\n\nIn summer 655, Consort Wu accused Empress Wang and her mother, Lady Liu, of using witchcraft. In response, Emperor Gaozong barred Lady Liu from the palace and demoted Empress Wang's uncle, Liu Shi.<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\" /> Meanwhile, a faction of officials began to form around Consort Wu, including [[Li Yifu]], Xu, Cui Yixuan ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u7fa9\u7384}}), and Yuan Gongyu ({{lang|zh|\u8881\u516c\u745c}}). On an occasion in the autumn of 655, Emperor Gaozong summoned the chancellors Zhangsun, [[Li Shiji|Li Ji]], [[Yu Zhining]], and [[Chu Suiliang]] to the palace\u2014which Chu deduced to be regarding the matter of changing who was the Empress. Li Ji claimed an illness and refused to attend. At the meeting, Chu vehemently opposed deposing Empress Wang, while Zhangsun and Yu showed their disapproval by silence. Meanwhile, other chancellors [[Han Yuan]] and [[Lai Ji]] also opposed the move, but when Emperor Gaozong asked Li Ji again, Li Ji's response was, \"This is your family matter, Your Imperial Majesty. Why ask anyone else?\" Emperor Gaozong, therefore, became resolved. He demoted Chu to be a commandant at [[Tanzhou (in modern Hunan)|Tan Prefecture]] (roughly modern [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]]),<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\" /> and then deposed both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, putting them under arrest and creating Consort Wu as empress to replace Empress Wang. (Later that year, Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were killed on orders by the new Empress Wu after Emperor Gaozong showed signs of considering their release. After their deaths, however, Empress Wu often was haunted by them in her dreams. For the rest of Emperor Gaozong's reign, Emperor Gaozong and she often took up residence at the eastern capital [[Luoyang]] and only infrequently spent time in [[Chang'an]].)<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377200|vol. 200]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reign as Empress consort==\n\n===Rivals Elimination Period===\nIn 655, Wu became Tang Gaozong's new empress consort ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u540e}}, ''h\u00faangh\u00f2u'').\n\nIn 656, on the advice of Xu Jingzong, Emperor Gaozong deposed Consort Liu's son Li Zhong from being his heir apparent, changing his status to being the Prince of Liang, while designating Wu's son Li Hong, then carrying the title of Prince of Dai, as crown prince (that is, Heir Apparent).<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\nIn 657, Empress Wu and her allies began reprisals against officials who had opposed her ascension. She first had Xu and Li Yifu, who were by now chancellors, falsely accuse Han Yuan and Lai Ji of being complicit with Chu Suiliang in planning treason. The three of them, along with Liu Shi, were demoted to being prefects of remote prefectures, with provisions that they would never be allowed to return to Chang'an. In 659, she further had Xu accuse Zhangsun Wuji of plotting treason with the low-level officials Wei Jifang ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u5b63\u65b9}}) and Li Chao ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5de2}}). Zhangsun was exiled and, later in the year, was forced to commit suicide in exile. Xu further implicated Chu, Liu, Han, and Yu Zhining in the plot as well. Chu, who had died in 658, was posthumously stripped of his titles, and his sons Chu Yanfu ({{lang|zh|\u891a\u5f65\u752b}}) and Chu Yanchong ({{lang|zh|\u891a\u5f65\u6c96}}) were executed. Orders also were issued to execute Liu and Han, although Han died before the execution order reached his location. It was said that after this time, no official dared to criticize the emperor.\n\nIn 660, Li Zhong, Gaozong's first-born son (to consort Liu) also was targeted. Li Zhong had feared that he would be next and had sought out advice of fortune tellers. Wu had him exiled and placed under house arrest.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\n===As the real and influential power behind the Emperor===\n\nIn 660, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu toured Bian Prefecture (modern-day Taiyuan), and Empress Wu had the opportunity to invite her old neighbors and relatives to a feast.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" /> Later that year, Emperor Gaozong began to suffer from an illness that carried the symptoms of painful headaches and loss of vision, generally thought to be hypertension-related,<ref>See, ''Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 40, p 683.</ref> and he began to have Empress Wu make rulings on petitions made by officials. It was said that Empress Wu had quick reactions and understood both literature and history, and therefore, she was making correct rulings. Thereafter, her authority rivaled Emperor Gaozong's, after this point on, Empress Wu became the undisputed power behind the throne for twenty-three years.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\nBy 664, Empress Wu was said to be interfering so much in the imperial governance that she was angering Emperor Gaozong. Further, she had engaged the [[Taoist]] sorcerer Guo Xingzhen ({{lang|zh|\u90ed\u884c\u771f}}) in using witchcraft\u2014an act that was prohibited by regulations and which had led to Empress Wang's downfall\u2014and the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Wang Fusheng ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u4f0f\u52dd}}) reported this to Emperor Gaozong, further angering him. He consulted the chancellor [[Shangguan Yi]], who suggested that he depose Empress Wu. He had Shangguan draft an edict, but as Shangguan was doing so Empress Wu received news of what was happening. She went to the emperor to plead her case, just as he was holding the edict that Shangguan had drafted. Emperor Gaozong could not bear to depose her, blaming the episode on Shangguan. As both Shangguan and Wang had served on Li Zhong's staff, Empress Wu had Xu falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of planning treason. Shangguan, Wang, and Shangguan's son Shangguan Tingzhi ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u5b98\u5ead\u829d}}) were executed, while Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377201|vol. 201]]}}</ref> (Shangguan Tingzhi's daughter [[Shangguan Wan'er]], then an infant, and her mother, Lady Zheng, became slaves in the inner palace. After Shangguan Wan'er grew up, she eventually became a trusted secretary for Empress Wu.) Thereafter, at imperial meetings for eighteen years, Empress Wu would sit behind a pearl screen behind Emperor  Gaozong, hear the reports as well, and imperial powers often fell into her hands, and she effectively was making the major decisions and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell And in the absence of her husband, she gained vast powers and Empress Wu had the ultimate power, and she became a Controversial and formidable figure with far-reaching influence. She and Emperor Gaozong were thereafter referred to as the \"Two Saints.\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u8056}}, ''Er Sheng'').<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" />\n\nMeanwhile, on Empress Wu's account, her mother Lady Yang had been created the Lady of Rong, and her older sister, now widowed, the Lady of Han. Her brothers Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang and cousins Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun, despite the poor relationships that they had with Lady Yang, were promoted. At a feast that Lady Yang held for them, however, Wu Weiliang offended Lady Yang by stating that they did not find it honorable for them to be promoted on account of Empress Wu. Empress Wu, therefore, requested to have them demoted to remote prefectures\u2014outwardly to show modesty, but in reality to avenge the offense to her mother. Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang died in effective exile. Meanwhile, in or before 666, Lady of Han died as well, and after her death, Emperor Gaozong created her daughter the Lady of Wei and considered keeping her in the palace\u2014possibly as a concubine\u2014but did not immediately do so, as he feared that Empress Wu would be displeased. It was said that Empress Wu heard of this and was nevertheless displeased, and she had the Lady of Wei poisoned, by placing poison in food offerings that Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun had made and then blaming Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun for the murder. Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun were executed.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" /><ref name=\"WuShihuo\">For Wu Shihuo's career and family, see generally ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537758|vol. 58]] and ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377206|vol. 206]]</ref>\n\nIn 670, Wu's mother, Lady Yang, died and by Emperor Gaozong's orders, all of the imperial officials and their wives attended her wake and mourned her. Later that year, with the realm suffering from a major drought, Empress Wu offered to be deposed, an offer Emperor Gaozong rejected. He further posthumously honored Wu Shihuo (who had previously been posthumously honored as the Duke of Zhou) and Lady Yang by giving them the titles of the Prince and Princess of Taiyuan.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the son of Wu's older sister, the Lady of Han, (Wu's nephew) Helan Minzhi ({{lang|zh|\u8cc0\u862d\u654f\u4e4b}}) had been given the surname of Wu and allowed to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou. As it was becoming clear, however, that he was suspecting Empress Wu of having murdered his sister, Empress Wu began to take precautions against him, he also was said to have had an incestuous relationship with his grandmother Lady Yang. In 671, Helan Minzhi was accused of having disobeyed mourning regulations during the period of mourning for Lady Yang, and also of raping the daughter of the official Yang Sijian ({{lang|zh|\u694a\u601d\u5109}}), whom Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu had previously selected to be the wife and crown princess for Li Hong. Helan Minzhi was exiled and either was executed in exile or committed suicide. In 674, Empress Wu had Wu Yuanshuang's son [[Wu Chengsi]] recalled from exile to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377202|vol. 202]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luoyang 2006 7-29.jpg|thumb|The Fengxian cave (c. 675) of the [[Longmen Grottoes]], commissioned by Wu Zetian; the large, central Buddha is representative of the ''[[Vairocana]]'']]\n\nIn 675, with Emperor Gaozong's illness getting worse, he considered having Empress Wu formally rule as [[regent]]. The chancellor [[Hao Chujun]] and the official [[Li Yiyan]] both opposed this, and he did not formally make her regent, Although Wu, as empress, had rather in the absence of her husband relatively of the emperor more political power and was often ahead of the Emperor Gaozong.\n\nAlso in 675, a number of people would fall victim to Empress Wu's ire. Empress Wu had been displeased at the favor that Emperor Gaozong had shown his aunt, Princess Changle, who had married the general Zhao Gui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u74cc}}) and whose daughter had become the wife and princess of Wu's third son Li Xi\u01cen, the Prince of Zhou. Princess Zhao was therefore accused of unspecified crimes and put under arrest, eventually being starved to death. Zhao Gui and Princess Changle were exiled. Meanwhile, later that month, Li Hong, the Crown Prince\u2014who had been urging Empress Wu not to exercise so much influence on Emperor Gaozong's governance and who had offended Empress Wu by requesting that his half-sisters, Consort Xiao's daughters, Princess Yiyang and Xuancheng, who had been under house arrest, be allowed to marry\u2014died suddenly. Traditional historians generally believed that Empress Wu poisoned Li Hong to death. Li Xi\u00e1n, then carrying the title of Prince of Yong, was created crown prince.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" /> Meanwhile, Consort Xiao's son Li Sujie and another son of Emperor Gaozong's, [[Li Shangjin]] ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4e0a\u91d1}}), were repeatedly accused of crimes by Empress Wu and were demoted.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nSoon Empress Wu's relationship with Li Xi\u00e1n also deteriorated, as Li Xi\u00e1n had become unsettled after hearing rumors that he was not born to Empress Wu\u2014but to her sister, the Lady of Han\u2014and when Empress Wu heard of his fearfulness, she became angry with him. Further, the sorcerer Ming Chongyan ({{lang|zh|\u660e\u5d07\u513c}}), whom both she and Emperor Gaozong respected and who had stated that Li Xi\u00e1n was unsuitable to inherit the throne, was assassinated in 679. The assassins were not caught\u2014causing Wu to suspect that Li Xi\u00e1n was behind the assassination. In 680, Li Xi\u00e1n was accused of crimes and during an investigation by the officials [[Xue Yuanchao]], [[Pei Yan]], and [[Gao Zhizhou]], a large number of arms were found in Li Xi\u00e1n's palace. Empress Wu formally accused Li Xi\u00e1n of treason and the assassination of Ming. Li Xi\u00e1n was deposed and exiled.\n\nAfter, the exile of Li Xi\u00e1n, his younger brother Li Xi\u01cen [similar-sounding name but different Chinese characters] (who had by now been renamed Li Zhe) was created crown prince.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nIn 681, Princess Taiping was married to Xue Shao ({{lang|zh|\u859b\u7d39}}), the son of Emperor Gaozong's sister Princess Chengyang, in a grand ceremony. Empress Wu, initially unimpressed with the lineages of Xue Shao's brothers' wives, wanted to order his brothers to divorce their wives\u2014stopping only after it was pointed out to her that Lady Xiao, the wife of Xue Shao's older brother Xue Yi ({{lang|zh|\u859b\u9857}}), was a grandniece of the deceased chancellor [[Xiao Yu]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nIn late 683, Emperor Gaozong died while at Luoyang.

Wu already had poisoned the crown prince Li Hong and had enough other princes exiled that her third son, [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Zhe]], had been made heir apparent. Furthermore, Gaozong's will included provisions that Li Zhe should ascend immediately to the imperial throne, and that he should look to Empress Wu in regard to any important matter, either military or civil.<ref name=\"Paludan, 97\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 97}}</ref> In the second month of 684, Li Zhe ascended to the imperial throne, taking the regnal name of Zhongzong, for the short six weeks of his reign.\n\nImmediately, Emperor Zhongzong showed signs of disobeying Empress Dowager Wu. Emperor Zhongzong was under the thumb of his wife, the empress Wei, even appointing his father-in-law prime minister. He also tried to make his father-in-law ''Shizhong'' ({{lang|zh|\u4f8d\u4e2d}}, the head of the examination bureau of government, {{lang|zh|\u9580\u4e0b\u7701}}, ''Menxia Sheng'', and a post considered one for a chancellor) and giving a mid-level office to his [[wet nurse]]'s son\u2014despite stern opposition by the chancellor Pei Yan, at one point remarking to Pei:<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\n{{quote|What would be wrong even if I gave the empire to Wei Xuanzhen?

Wu Zetian had Zhongzong's father in law, Wei Xuanzhen ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u7384\u8c9e}}), brought up on charges of treason, and he was sent into seclusion. Emperor Zhongzong was reduced to the title of Prince of Luling and exiled. Empress Dowager Wu also sent the general Qiu Shenji ({{lang|zh|\u4e18\u795e\u52e3}}) to Li Xi\u00e1n's place in exile and forced Li Xi\u00e1n to commit suicide.\n\n===As regent for Emperor Ruizong===\nWu had her youngest son [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Li Dan]] made emperor, as Emperor Ruizong. She was the ruler, however, both in substance and appearance. Wu did not even follow the customary pretense of hiding behind a screen or curtain and, in whispers, issued commands for the nominal ruler to formally announce. Ruizong never moved into the imperial quarters, appeared at no imperial function, and remained a virtual prisoner in the inner quarters.<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|pp= 97\u2013101}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Emperor Ruizong held the title of emperor, Empress Dowager Wu firmly controlled the imperial court, and the officials were not allowed to meet with Emperor Ruizong, nor was he allowed to rule on matters of state. Rather, the matters of state were ruled on by Empress Dowager Wu. At the suggestion of her nephew Wu Chengsi, she also expanded the ancestral shrine of the Wu ancestors and gave them greater posthumous honours.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nIn 686, Empress Dowager Wu offered to return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong, but Emperor Ruizong, knowing that she did not truly intend to do so, declined, and she continued to exercise imperial authority.\n\nSoon thereafter, Li Ji's grandson [[Li Jingye]], the Duke of Ying, who had been disaffected by his own exile, started a rebellion at Yang Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u63da\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]). The rebellion initially drew much popular support in the region, however, Li Jingye progressed slowly in his attack and did not take advantage of that popular support. Meanwhile, Pei suggested to Empress Dowager Wu that she return imperial authority to the Emperor and argued that doing so would cause the rebellion to collapse on its own. This offended her, and she accused him of being complicit with Li Jingye and had him executed; she also demoted, exiled, and killed a number of officials who, when Pei was arrested, tried to speak on his behalf. She sent a general, Li Xiaoyi ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5b5d\u9038}}), to attack Li Jingye, and while Li Xiaoyi was initially unsuccessful, he pushed on at the urging of his assistant [[Wei Yuanzhong]] and eventually was able to crush Li Jingye's forces.

Exploiting these beliefs of hers, secret police officials, including [[Suo Yuanli]], [[Zhou Xing (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Xing]], and [[Lai Junchen]], began to rise in power and to carry out systematic false accusations, tortures, and executions of individuals.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nIn 688, Empress Dowager Wu was set to make sacrifices to the deity of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] ({{lang|zh|\u6d1b\u6c34}}, flowing through the Henan province city of [[Luoyang]], then the \"Eastern Capital\"). Wu summoned senior members of Tang's Li imperial clan to Luoyang. The imperial princes worried that she planned to slaughter them and secure the throne for herself: thus, they plotted to resist her. Before a rebellion could be comprehensively planned out, however, Li Zhen and his son [[Li Chong (Tang dynasty)|Li Chong]], the Prince of Langye rose first, at their respective posts as prefects of Yu Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u8c6b\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Zhumadian]], [[Henan]]) and Bo Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u535a\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Liaocheng]], [[Shandong]]). The other princes were not yet ready, however, and did not rise, and forces sent by Empress Dowager Wu and the local forces crushed Li Chong and Li Zhen's forces quickly. Empress Dowager Wu took this opportunity to arrest Emperor Gaozong's granduncles Li Yuanjia ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5143\u5609}}) the Prince of Han, Li Lingkui ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u9748\u5914}}) the Prince of Lu, and Princess Changle, as well as many other members of the Li clan and she, forced them to commit suicide. Even Princess Taiping's husband Xue Shao was implicated and starved to death. In the subsequent years, there continued to be many politically motivated massacres of officials and Li clan members.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" />\n\nIn 690, Wu took the final step to become the [[empress regnant]] of the newly proclaimed [[Second Zhou dynasty|Zhou dynasty]], and the title ''Huangdi''. Traditional Chinese [[order of succession]] (akin to the [[Salic law]] in Europe) did not allow a woman to ascend the throne, but Wu Zetian was determined to quash the opposition and the use of the secret police did not subside, but continued, after her taking the throne. While her organization of the civil service system was criticized for its laxity of the promotion of officials, nonetheless, Wu Zetian was considered capable of evaluating the performance of the officials once they were in office. The [[Song dynasty]] historian [[Sima Guang]], in his ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', commented:<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n{{quote|Even though the Empress Dowager{{NoteTag|Throughout the ''Zizhi Tongjian'' descriptions of Wu Zetian's reign, Sima referred to her as \"the Empress Dowager\", implicitly refusing to recognize her as empress regnant, although he used her [[Chinese era name|era name]]s.}} excessively used official titles to cause people to submit to her, if she saw that someone was incompetent, she would immediately depose or even execute him. She grasped the powers of punishment and award, controlled the state, and made her own judgments as to policy decisions. She was observant and had good judgment, so the talented people of the time also were willing to be used by her.}}\n\n==Reign as Empress regnant ==\nIn 690, Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her and established the Zhou dynasty, with herself as the ruler (''Huangdi'').\n\nThe early part of her reign was characterized by secret police terror, which moderated as the years went by. She was, on the other hand, recognized as a capable and attentive ruler even by traditional historians who despised her, and her ability at selecting capable men to serve as officials was admired throughout the rest of the Tang dynasty as well as in subsequent dynasties.{{NoteTag|See, e.g., {{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377234|vol. 234]]}} &#91;submission of [[Lu Zhi (Tang dynasty)|Lu Zhi]] to [[Emperor Dezong of Tang]], citing Wu Zetian as the prime example of a capable selector of officials&#93;; [[Zhao Yi]]'s ''[[Notes of the Twenty-Two Histories]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u5341\u4e8c\u53f2\u5284\u8a18}}), ''Empress Wu Accepted Corrections and Knew People''. http://ctwang.myweb.hinet.net/22szj/300/0260.htm.}} (She would be overthrown in a coup in 705 and Emperor Zhongzong returned to the throne, but she would continue to carry the title of \"emperor\" until her death later in that year).\n\n=== Early reign (690-696) ===\n[[File:Epitaph for Yang Shun, general to Empress Wu Zetian, China, Luoyang, Tang dynasty, 693 AD, limestone - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC03576.JPG|thumb|[[Epitaph]] for [[Yang Shun]], general to Empress Wu Zetian, China, [[Luoyang]], 693, limestone, [[Royal Ontario Museum]]]]\n\nShortly after Wu Zetian took the throne, she elevated the status of Buddhism above that of [[Taoism]], officially sanctioning Buddhism by building temples named Dayun Temple ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u96f2\u5bfa}}) in each prefecture belonging to the capital regions of the two capitals Luoyang and Chang'an, and created nine senior monks as dukes. She also enshrined seven generations of Wu ancestors at the imperial ancestral temple, although she also continued to offer sacrifices to the Tang emperors Gaozu, Taizong, and Gaozong.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" />\n\nShe faced the issue of succession. At the time she took the throne, she created Li Dan, the former Emperor Ruizong, crown prince, and bestowed the name of Wu on him.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> The official [[Zhang Jiafu]], however, convinced the commoner Wang Qingzhi ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u6176\u4e4b}}) to start a petition drive to make her nephew Wu Chengsi crown prince, arguing that an emperor named Wu should pass the throne to a member of the Wu clan. Wu Zetian was tempted to do so, and when the chancellors [[Cen Changqian]] and [[Ge Fuyuan]] opposed sternly, they, along with fellow chancellor [[Ouyang Tong]], were executed. Nevertheless, she declined Wang's request to make Wu Chengsi crown prince, but for a time allowed Wang to freely enter the palace to see her. On one occasion, however, when Wang angered her by coming to the palace too much, she asked the official [[Li Zhaode]] to batter Wang as punishment\u2014but Li Zhaode exploited the opportunity to batter Wang to death, and his group of petitioners scattered. Li Zhaode then persuaded Wu Zetian to keep Li Dan as crown prince\u2014pointing out that a son was closer in relations than a nephew, and also that if Wu Chengsi became emperor, Emperor Gaozong would never again be worshiped. Wu Zetian agreed, and for some time did not reconsider the matter.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> Further, at Li Zhaode's warning that Wu Chengsi was becoming too powerful, Wu Zetian stripped Wu Chengsi of his chancellor authority and bestowed on him largely honorific titles without authority.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the power of the secret police officials continued to increase, until they appeared to be curbed starting in about 692, when Lai Junchen was foiled in his attempt to have the chancellors [[Ren Zhigu]], [[Di Renjie]], [[Pei Xingben]], and other officials Cui Xuanli ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u5ba3\u79ae}}), Lu Xian ({{lang|zh|\u76e7\u737b}}), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u55e3\u771e}}) executed, as Di, under arrest, had hidden a secret petition inside a change of clothes and had it submitted by his son Di Guangyuan ({{lang|zh|\u72c4\u5149\u9060}}). The seven still were exiled, but after this incident, particularly at the urging of Li Zhaode, [[Zhu Jingze]], and Zhou Ju ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u77e9}}), the waves of politically motivated massacres decreased, although they did not end entirely.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nAlso in 692, Wu Zetian commissioned the general [[Wang Xiaojie]] to attack the [[Tibetan Empire]], and Wang recaptured the four garrisons of the [[Western Regions]] that had fallen to the Tibetan Empire in 670 \u2013 [[Kucha]], [[Yutian County, Xinjiang|Yutian]], [[Kashgar]], and [[Suyab]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nIn 693, after Wu Zetian's trusted [[lady-in-waiting]] Wei Tuan'er ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u5718\u5152}}), who hated Li Dan (the reason why she did so is lost to history), falsely accused Li Dan's wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Crown Princess Liu]] and Consort Dou of using witchcraft, Wu Zetian had Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou killed. Li Dan, fearful that he was to be next, did not dare to speak of them. When Wei further planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, however, someone else informed on her, and she was executed. Wu Zetian nevertheless had Li Dan's sons demoted in their princely titles, and when the officials Pei Feigong ({{lang|zh|\u88f4\u532a\u8eac}}) and Fan Yunxian ({{lang|zh|\u8303\u96f2\u4ed9}}) were accused of secretly meeting Li Dan, she executed Pei and Fan and further, barred officials from meeting Li Dan. There were then accusations that Li Dan was plotting treason, and under Wu Zetian's direction, Lai launched an investigation. Lai arrested Li Dan's servants and tortured them\u2014and the torture was such that many of them were ready to falsely implicate themselves and Li Dan. One of Li Dan's servants, [[An Jincang]], however, proclaimed Li Dan's innocence and cut his own belly open to swear to that fact. When Wu Zetian heard of what An did, she had doctors attend to An and barely save his life, and then ordered Lai to end the investigation, thus saving Li Dan.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nIn 694, Li Zhaode, who had become powerful after Wu Chengsi's removal, was thought to be too powerful and Wu Zetian removed him.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Also around this time, she became highly impressed with a group of mystic individuals\u2014the hermit [[Wei Shifang]] (on whom she bestowed a chancellor title briefly), who claimed to be more than 350&nbsp;years old; an old [[bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]] who claimed to be a [[buddhahood|Buddha]] and capable of predicting the future; and a non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] man who claimed to be 500&nbsp;years old.

Subsequently, she also put Huaiyi to death. After this incident, she appeared to pay less attention to mysticism and became even more dedicated than before to the affairs of state.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\n=== Middle reign (696-701) ===\n[[File:Xian 2006 5-1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Giant Wild Goose Pagoda]], originally built in 652, it collapsed and was rebuilt in 701\u2013704 during the reign of Wu Zetian; the present structure is largely the same as it was in the 8th century, although it used to be three stories taller before the damage caused by the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake]]]]\n\nWu Zetian's administration was soon in for various troubles on the western and then northern borders, however. In spring 696, an army she sent, commanded by Wang Xiaojie and [[Lou Shide]] against the Tibetan Empire, was soundly defeated by Tibetan generals, the brothers [[Gar Trinring Tsendro]] ({{lang|zh|\u8ad6\u6b3d\u9675 }}) and [[Gar Tsenba]] ({{lang|zh| \u8ad6\u8d0a\u5a46 }}), and as a result, she demoted Wang to commoner rank and Lou to be a low level prefectural official, although she eventually restored both of them to general positions.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> In April of the same year, Wu Zetian recast the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons]], the symbol of ultimate power in ancient China, to reinforce her authority.<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\" />\n\nA much more serious threat arose in summer 696. The [[Khitan people|Khitan]] chieftains [[Li Jinzhong]] and [[Sun Wanrong]], brothers-in-law, angry over the mistreatment of the Khitan people by the Zhou official Zhao Wenhui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u6587\u7ffd}}), the prefect of Ying Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u71df\u5dde }}, roughly [[Zhaoyang County]], [[Liaoning]]), rebelled, with Li assuming the title of Wushang Khan (\u7121\u4e0a\u53ef\u6c57). Armies that Wu Zetian sent to suppress Li and Sun's rebellion were defeated by Khitan forces, which in turn attacked Zhou proper. Meanwhile, [[Qapaghan Qaghan]] of the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]] offered to submit, and yet was also launching attacks against Zhou and Khitan\u2014including an attack against Khitan base of operations during the winter of 696, shortly after Li's death, that captured Li's and Sun's families and temporarily halted Khitan operations against Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Sun, after taking over as khan and reorganizing Khitan forces, again attacked Zhou territory and had many victories over Zhou forces, including a battle during which Wang Shijie was killed.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377206|vol. 206]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Wu Zetian tried to allay the situation by making peace with Ashina Mochuo at fairly costly terms\u2014the return of Tujue people who had previously submitted to Zhou and providing Ashina Mochuo with seeds, silk, tools, and iron. In summer 697, Ashina Mochuo launched another attack on Khitan's base of operations, and this time, after his attack, Khitan forces collapsed and Sun was killed in flight, ending the Khitan threat.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nMeanwhile, also in 697, Lai Junchen, who had at one point lost power but then had returned to power, falsely accused Li Zhaode (who had been pardoned) of crimes, and then planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, Li Zhe, the Wu clan princes, and Princess Taiping, of treason. The Wu clan princes and Princess Taiping acted first against him, accusing him of crimes, and he and Li Zhaode were executed together. After Lai's death, the reign of the secret police largely ended. Gradually, many of the victims of Lai and the other secret police officials were exonerated posthumously.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" /> Meanwhile, around this time, Wu Zetian began relationships with two new lovers\u2014the brothers [[Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong]], who became honored within the palace and were eventually created dukes.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" /><ref name=\"ZZTJ207\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377207|vol. 207]]}}</ref>\n\nAround 698, Wu Chengsi and another nephew of Wu Zetian's, [[Wu Sansi]], the Prince of Liang, were repeatedly making attempts to have officials persuade Wu Zetian to create one of them crown prince\u2014again citing the reason that an emperor should pass the throne to someone of the same clan. Di Renjie, who by now had become a trusted chancellor, was firmly against the idea, however, and proposed that Li Zhe be recalled instead. He was supported in this by fellow chancellors [[Wang Fangqing]] and [[Wang Jishan]], as well as Wu Zetian's close advisor [[Ji Xu]], who further persuaded the Zhang brothers to support the idea as well. In spring 698, Wu Zetian agreed and recalled Li Zhe from exile. Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe, and Wu Zetian created Li Zhe crown prince. She soon changed his name back to Li Xi\u01cen and then Wu Xian.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nLater, Ashina Mochuo demanded a [[Tang dynasty]] prince for marriage to his daughter, part of a plot to join his family with the Tang, displace the Zhou, and restore Tang rule over China (under his influence). When Wu Zetian sent a member of her own family, grandnephew Wu Yanxiu ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5ef6\u79c0}}), to marry Mochuo's daughter instead, he rejected him.<ref>{{Cite book\n |title = A history of China\n |author = Jonathan Wolfram Eberhard\n |year = 1997\n |publisher = University of California Press\n |page = 186\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mUofeN6WW_IC&pg=PA186&dq=kao+tsung+demanded+chinese+prince+daughter&hl=en&ei=LWhMTOTUDoL58AaKzeU2&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=kao%20tsung%20demanded%20chinese%20prince%20daughter&f=false\n |access-date = 2010-06-28\n |ISBN = 978-0-520-03268-2\n}}</ref> Ashina Mochuo had no intention to cement the peace treaty with a marriage; instead, when Wu Yanxiu arrived, he detained Wu Yanxiu and then launched a major attack on Zhou, advancing as far south as Zhao Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u5dde}}, in modern [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]) before withdrawing.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nIn 699, however, at least the Tibetan threat would cease. Emperor [[Tridu Songtsen]], unhappy that Gar Trinring was monopolizing power, took an opportunity when Trinring was away from the capital [[Lhasa]] to slaughter Trinring's associates. He then defeated Trinring in battle, and Trinring committed suicide. Gar Tsenba and Trinring's son, [[Lun Gongren]] ({{lang|zh|\u8ad6\u5f13\u4ec1}}), surrendered to Zhou. After this, the Tibetan Empire was under internal turmoil for several years, and there was peace for Zhou on the border.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nAlso in 699, Wu Zetian, realizing that she was growing old, feared that after her death, Li Xian and the Wu clan princes would not be able to have peace with each other, and she made him, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's second husband [[Wu Youji]] (a nephew of hers), the Prince of Ding, and other Wu clan princes to swear an oath to each other.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\n=== Late reign (701-705) ===\n[[File:Tang Dynasty circa 700 CE.png|thumb|Estimated territorial extent of Wu Zetian's empire]]\n\nAs Wu Zetian grew older, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong became increasingly powerful, and even the princes of the Wu clan flattered them. She also increasingly relied on them to handle the affairs of state. This was secretly discussed and criticized by her grandson [[Li Chongrun]], the Prince of Shao, (Li Xian's son), granddaughter [[Li Xianhui]] ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4ed9\u8559}}) the Lady Yongtai (Li Chongrun's sister), and Li Xianhui's husband Wu Yanji ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5ef6\u57fa}}) the Prince of Wei (Wu Zetian's grandnephew and Wu Chengsi's son), but somehow the discussion was leaked, and Zhang Yizhi reported this to Wu Zetian. She ordered the three of them to commit suicide.{{NoteTag|The ''Zizhi Tongjian'' asserted that Li Chongrun was forced to commit suicide, but the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' asserted in his biographies that he was caned to death on Wu Zetian's orders.

Individuals she promoted in her old age included, among others, [[Cui Xuanwei]] and [[Zhang Jiazhen]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\nBy 703, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong had become resentful of Wei Yuanzhong, who by now was a senior chancellor, for dressing down their brother Zhang Changyi ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u660c\u5100}}) and rejecting the promotion of another brother Zhang Changqi ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u660c\u671f}}). They also were fearful that if Wu Zetian died, Wei would find a way to execute them, and therefore accused Wei and Gao Jian ({{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u6229}}), an official favoured by Princess Taiping, of speculating on Wu Zetian's old age and death. They initially got Wei's subordinate [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Shuo]] to agree to corroborate the charges, but once Zhang Shuo was before Wu Zetian, he instead accused Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong of forcing him to bear false witness. As a result, Wei, Gao, and Zhang Shuo were exiled, but escaped death.<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\n== Removal and death ==\n[[File:Qianling.jpg|thumb|upright|Located to the east of Phoenix Gate within the [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\u2013built near [[Chang'an]] in 706 to house the remains of [[Tang Gaozong]], Empress Wu, and other royal members of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]]\u2013is the large Blank Tablet or Wordless Stele.

Zhang Tongxiu and Zhang Changyi were demoted, but even though the officials Li Chengjia ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u627f\u5609}}) and [[Huan Yanfan]] advocated that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong be removed as well, Wu Zetian, taking the suggestion of the chancellor [[Yang Zaisi]], did not remove them. Subsequently, charges of corruption against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were renewed by the chancellor [[Wei Anshi]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n[[File:Qianling Mausoleum 38 2013-08.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Side view of the Blank Tablet.]]\n\nIn winter 704, Wu Zetian became seriously ill for a period, and only the Zhang brothers were allowed to see her; the chancellors were not. This led to speculation that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were plotting to take over the throne, and there were repeated accusations of treason. Once her condition improved, Cui Xuanwei advocated that only Li Xian and Li Dan be allowed to attend to her\u2014a suggestion that she did not accept. After further accusations against the Zhang brothers by Huan and [[Song Jing]], Wu Zetian allowed Song to investigate, but before the investigation was completed, she issued a pardon for Zhang Yizhi, derailing Song's investigation.<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\nBy spring 705, Wu Zetian was seriously ill again. [[Zhang Jianzhi]], [[Jing Hui]], and [[Yuan Shuji]], planned a coup to kill the Zhang brothers. They convinced the generals [[Li Duozuo]], Li Dan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6e5b}}, note different character than the [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|former emperor]]), and Yang Yuanyan ({{lang|zh|\u694a\u5143\u7430}}) and another chancellor, [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]], to be involved.

They then reported to her that the Zhang brothers had been executed for treason, and they then forced her to yield the throne to Li Xian. On 21 February, an edict was issued in her name that made Li Xian regent, and on 22 February, an edict was issued in her name passing the throne to Li Xian. On 23 February, Li Xian formally retook the throne, and the next day, Wu Zetian, under heavy guard, was moved to the subsidiary palace, Shangyang Palace ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u967d\u5bae}}), but was nevertheless honoured with the title of Empress Regnant Zetian Dasheng ({{lang|zh|\u5247\u5929\u5927\u8056\u7687\u5e1d}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" /> On 3 March,{{cn |date=September 2019}} Tang dynasty was restored, ending the Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377208|vol. 208]]}}.</ref>\n\nShe died on 16 December,{{cn |date=September 2019}} and, pursuant to a final edict issued in her name, was no longer referred to as empress regnant, but instead as Empress Consort Zetian Dasheng ({{lang|zh|\u5247\u5929\u5927\u8056\u7687\u540e}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\" /> In 706, Wu Zetian's son [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]] had Wu Zetian interred in a joint burial with his father [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], located near the capital [[Chang'an]] on Mount Liang.

The traditional historical view, however, is to discount Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\": dynasties by definition involve the succession of rulers from one family: Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\" was founded by her, and ended within her lifetime, with her abdication (705). This does not meet the traditional concept of a dynasty. The alternative, is to view Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\" as the revival of the generally historically-accepted historical Zhou dynasty, which had been ruled (at least nominally) by the [[Ji (surname)|Ji]] family, almost a thousand years before. Either way, Wu's Zhou dynasty is best viewed as a brief interruption of the Li family's Tang dynasty, rather than as a fully realized dynasty. Her claim of founding a new dynasty, however, was little opposed at the time (690).<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 101}}</ref> The fifteen-year period which Wu Zetian designated as her \"Zhou Dynasty\" considered in the context of nearly a half century of ''de facto'' rule (c. 654\u2013705) reveals a remarkable and still debated period of history.<ref>{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|pp= 81\u201382}}</ref> In this context, designating a new dynasty, with her as its emperor can be seen as part of her power politics, and as the culmination of her period of ruling. Though the fifteen years of Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty had its own notable characteristics, these are difficult to separate from Wu's reign of power, which lasted for about half of a century.\n\nWu Zetian's consolidation of power in part relied on a system of spies. She used informants to choose persons to eliminate, a process which peaked in 697, with the wholesale demotion, exile, or killing of various aristocratic families and scholars, furthermore prohibiting their sons from holding office.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 99}}</ref>\n\nOne apparatus of government which fell into Wu's power was the [[imperial examination]] system: the basic theory and practice of which was to recruit into government service those men who were the best educated, talented, and having the best potential to perform their duties, and to do so by testing a pool of candidates in order to determine this objectively. This pool was male only, and the qualified pool of candidates and resulting placements into official positions was on a relatively small scale at the time of Wu's assuming control of government. The official tests examined such things considered important for functionaries of the highly developed, bureaucratic government structure of the current imperial government. The qualities sought in a candidate for government service included determining the potential official's level of literacy in terms of reading and writing as well as his possession of the specific knowledge considered necessary and desirable for a governmental official, such as [[Confucianism|Confucian]] precepts on the nature of virtue and theory on the proper ordering of and relationships within society. Wu Zetian continued to use the imperial examination system to recruit civil servants, and she introduced major changes in regard to the system that she inherited, including increasing the pool of candidates permitted to take the test, by allowing commoners and gentry, who were previously disqualified by their background, to take them. Another thing she did was to expand the governmental examination system and to greatly increase the importance of this method of recruiting government officials, which she did in 693.<ref name=\"Paludan, 97\" /> Wu provided increased opportunity for the representation within government to people of the [[North China Plain]], versus people of the northwestern aristocratic families, (whom she decimated, anyway); and, the successful candidates who were recruited through the examination system became an elite group within her government.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\">{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|p= 82}}</ref> The historical details surrounding and the consequences of Wu Zetian's promoting a new group of people from previously disenfranchised backgrounds into prominence as powerful governmental officials as well as the role of the examination system in this regard, remains a matter of debate for scholars of this subject.\n\nWu Zetian eliminated many of her real, potential, or perceived rivals to power by means of death (including execution, suicide by command, and more-or-less directly killing people), demotion, and exile. Mostly this was carried out by her secret police, led by individuals like Wao Ganjun and [[Lai Junchen]]\u2014who were known to have written a document called the ''Manual of Accusation'', which detailed steps for interrogation and obtaining confessions by torture. One of these methods, the \"Dying Swine's Melancholy\" ({{lang|zh|\u6b7b\u732a\u6101}}),<ref>http://baike.baidu.com/view/159862.htm</ref>{{better source|date=August 2017}} which merely indicated a level of pain inflicted by a torture device, seems to have been conflated in the years following Wu's death with the story of the \"human swine\" torture conducted by [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]], in which the victim had limbs and tongue amputated, was force-fed, and left to wallow in his own excrement.\n\nWu targeted various individuals, including many in her own family and her extended family. In reaction to an attempt to remove her from power, in 684, she massacred twelve entire collateral branches of the imperial family.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" /> Besides this, she also altered the ancient balance of power in China, dating back to the [[Qin dynasty]]. The old area of the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] was later referred to as [[Guanzhong]], literally, the area \"within the fortified mountain passes\". It was from this area of northwest China that the Ying family of Qin arose to conquer, unifying China into its first historical empire. During the [[Han dynasty]], [[Sima Qian]] records in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shiji]]'' that Guanzhong had three-tenths of China's population, but six-tenths of its wealth.<ref>{{harvp|Cotterell|Cotterell|1975|p= 90}}</ref> Additionally, at the beginning of Wu Zetian's period of ascendency, Guanzhong was still the stronghold of the most nationally powerful aristocratic families, despite the fact that economic development in other parts of China had improved the lot of families in other regions. The Guangzhong aristocracy was not willing to relinquish their hold on the reins of government, however; while, at the same time, some of the more newly wealthy families in other areas, such as the [[North China Plain]] or [[Hubei]] were eager for a larger share of national power of their own. Most of the opposition to Wu was from the Guangzhong families of northwest China. Accordingly, she repressed them, instead favoring less privileged families, thus raising to the ranks of power many talented, but less aristocratic families, often recruited through the official examination system.<ref name=\"Cotterell and Cotterell, 144\">{{harvp|Cotterell|Cotterell|1975|p= 144}}</ref> Many of those so favored originated from the North China plain.<ref>{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|p= 81}}</ref> Through a process of eliminating or diminishing the power of the established aristocracy, whom she perceived as disloyal to her, and establishing a reformed upper class in China loyal to her, Wu Zetian made major social changes which are still being evaluated by historians.\n\n[[File:Maitreya-Tang Dynasty-side.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Maitreya]] statue from the reign of Wu Zetian]]\n\nWu Zetian used her power to increase or to attempt to increase her power by manipulating Buddhist, [[Daoist]], and Confucianist practice, sometimes in reference to the idea of the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. There are also allegations of witchcraft or sorcery. Wu began to manipulate the symbolic aspects of religious and imperial power long before she became ''huangdi'', one case being the Sacrifice on Mount Tai, in 666. When Emperor Gaozong offered sacrifices to the deities of heaven and earth at [[Mount Tai]], Empress Wu, in an unprecedented action, offered sacrifices after him, with Princess Dowager Yan, mother of Emperor Gaozong's brother [[Li Zhen (Tang dynasty)|Li Zhen]], Prince of Yue, offering sacrifices after her.<ref name=ZZTJ201 /> Wu Zetian's procession of ladies up Mount Tai conspicuously linked Wu with the most sacred traditional rites of the Chinese empire.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" />\n\nMany of Wu Zetian's measures were of a popular nature, and helped her to gain support for her rule. Wu Zetian came to power during a time in China in which the people were fairly contented, the administration was run well, and the economy was characterized by rising living standards.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" /> Wu Zetian, as far as the masses were for the most part concerned, continued in this manner. She was determined that free, self-sufficient farmers would continue to work on their own farm land, so she periodically used the [[Equal-field system|''juntian'', equal-field system]], together with updated census figures to ensure fair land allocations, re-allocating as necessary.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" /> Much of her success was due to her various edicts (including those known as her \"Acts of Grace\") which helped to satisfy the needs of the lower classes through various acts of relief, her widening recruitment to government service to include previously excluded gentry and commoners, and by her generous promotions and pay raises for the lower ranks.<ref name=\"Paludan, 100\" />\n\nWu Zetian used her military and diplomatic skills to enhance her position. The [[Fubing system|''fubing'' system]] of self-supportive soldier-farmer colonies, which provided local militia and labor services for her government, allowed her to maintain her armed forces at reduced expense.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" /> She also pursued a policy of military action to expand the empire to its furthest extent ever up to that point in Central Asia. Expansion efforts against [[Tibet]] and to the northwest were less successful. Allying with the Korean kingdom of Silla [[Goguryeo\u2013Tang War|against Goguryeo]] with the promise of ceding Goguryeo's territory to Silla, Chinese forces [[Silla-Tang War|occupied Goguryeo]] after its defeat, and even began to occupy Silla territory. Silla resisted the imposition of Chinese rule, and by allying with Goguryeo and Baekche, was able to expel its former ally from the peninsula. Hong argues that Silla's success was in part due to a shift in Empress Wu's focus to Tibet and inadequate support for the forces in the Korean peninsula.{{sfn|Hong|2007|244\u201345}} Despite victories against Tibetans and Turks:<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|pp=96\u201397}}</ref> however, in 694, Wu's forces decisively defeated the Tibetan\u2013Western Turk alliance, and retook the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi]], lost in 668.<ref>{{harvp|Beckwith|2009|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant event of Wu Zetian's reign was 651, shortly after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], when the first Arab ambassador arrived in China.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" />\n\n== Literature ==\n=== North Gate Scholars ===\nToward the end of Gaozong's life, Wu began engaging a number of mid-level officials who had literary talent, including Yuan Wanqing ({{lang|zh|\u5143\u842c\u9803}}), [[Liu Yizhi]], [[Fan L\u00fcbing]], Miao Chuke ({{lang|zh|\u82d7\u695a\u5ba2}}), Zhou Simao ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u601d\u8302}}), and Han Chubin ({{lang|zh|\u97d3\u695a\u8cd3}}), to write a number of works on her behalf, including the ''Biographies of Notable Women'' ({{lang|zh|\u5217\u5973\u50b3}}), ''Guidelines for Imperial Subjects'' ({{lang|zh|\u81e3\u8ecc}}), and ''New Teachings for Official Staff Members'' ({{lang|zh|\u767e\u50da\u65b0\u8aa1}}). Collectively, they became known as the \"North Gate Scholars\" ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u9580\u5b78\u58eb}}), because they served inside the palace, which was to the north of the imperial government buildings, and Empress Wu sought advice from them to divert the powers of the chancellors.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\n=== The \"Twelve Suggestions\" ===\nAround the new year 675, Empress Wu submitted twelve suggestions. One was that the work of [[Laozi]] (whose family name was Li and to whom the Tang imperial clan traced its ancestry), [[Tao Te Ching]], should be added to the required reading for imperial university students. Another was that a three-year mourning period should be observed for a mother's death in all cases, not only in those cases when the father was no longer alive. Emperor Gaozong praised her for her suggestions and adopted them.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\n=== Modified Chinese characters ===\n[[File:\u5219\u5929\u6587\u5b57\u4e4b\u7167\u4e00.SVG|thumb|right|50px|First version of modified character of \"Zhao\"]]\n[[File:\u5219\u5929\u6587\u5b57\u4e4b\u7167\u4e8c.SVG|thumb|right|50px|Second version of modified character of \"Zhao\"]]\n\n[[File:\u5347\u4ed9\u592a\u5b50\u7891\u62d3\u7247\u5c40\u90e8.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Text from Wu Zetian-era stele dedicated to Ji Jin ({{lang|zh|\u59ec\u6649}}), the [[crown prince]] of [[King Ling of Zhou]], recorded in legends as having risen to heaven to become a god; under the cosmology of Wu Zetian's reign, her lover [[Zhang Changzong]] was a reincarnation of Ji Jin; the text of the stele uses [[Chinese characters of Empress Wu|modified Chinese characters]] that she promulgated]]\n\nIn 690, Empress Dowager Wu's cousin's son [[Zong Qinke]] submitted a number of [[Chinese characters of Empress Wu|modified Chinese characters]] intended to showcase Empress Dowager Wu's greatness. She adopted them, and she took one of the modified characters, Zhao ({{lang|zh|\u66cc}}), to be her formal name (i.e., the name by which the people would exercise [[naming taboo]] on). {{lang|zh|\u66cc}} was made from two other characters: Ming ({{lang|zh|\u660e}}) on top, meaning \"light\" or \"clarity\", and Kong ({{lang|zh|\u7a7a}}) on the bottom, meaning \"sky.\" The implication appeared to be that she would be like the light shining from the sky. (Zhao ({{lang|zh|\u7167}}), meaning \"shine\", from which {{lang|zh|\u66cc}} was derived, might have been her original name, but evidence of that is inconclusive.){{NoteTag|Her cousin's son [[Zong Qinke]] created a number of new characters in December 689, and she chose {{lang|zh|\u66cc}} as her given name, which became her [[Naming taboo|taboo name]] when she ascended the throne the next year. Some sources assert that this character was actually written {{lang|zh|\u77be}}. Some sources (e.g., ''[[Bo Yang]] Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vols. 47\u201349) also assert that her original given name was Zhao and that in 689 she only changed the written character, but this is confirmed by neither the ''Old Book of Tang'' nor the ''New Book of Tang'', neither of which stated her original given name. Her grandson [[Li Chongrun|Li Chongzhao]], sometime after she became emperor, changed his name to Li Chongrun to observe naming taboo for her, and the character of \"Zhao\" in Li Chongzhao's name was {{lang|zh|\u7167}}.

On 18 August 690,{{cn |date=September 2019}} she approved of the requests. She changed the name of the state to Zhou, claiming ancestry from the [[Zhou dynasty]], and took the throne as Empress Regnant (with the title of Empress Regnant Shengshen ({{lang|zh|\u8056\u795e\u7687\u5e1d}}), literally \"Divine and Sacred Emperor or Empress Regnant\"). Emperor Ruizong was deposed and made crown prince with the atypical title of ''Huangsi'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u55e3}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> This thus interrupted the Tang dynasty, and she became the first (and only) woman to reign over China as Empress Regnant.{{NoteTag|During Emperor Taizong's reign, a female agrarian rebel leader named [[Chen Shuozhen]] ({{lang|zh|\u9673\u78a9\u771e}}) had declared herself \"emperor\" with the title Emperor Wenjia ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u4f73\u7687\u5e1d}}), but as Chen was quickly defeated and killed, she is typically not considered a true \"emperor\". See {{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377199|vol. 199]]}}. Earlier than that, during [[Northern Wei dynasty]], [[Empress Dowager Hu (Northern Wei)|Empress Dowager Hu]], after her son [[Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaoming]]'s death, falsely declared [[Daughter of Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei|Emperor Xiaoming's daughter]] to be a son and declared the daughter to be the new emperor, but almost immediately revealed that the child was in fact female, and thereafter declared [[Yuan Zhao]], the young son of Emperor Xiaoming's cousin Yuan Baohui ({{lang|zh|\u5143\u5bf6\u6689}}) emperor.

Emperor Xiaoming's daughter is also therefore not usually considered a true emperor.}}\n\n=== Poetry ===\nBeside her own literary work, Wu Zetian's court was a focus of literary creativity. Forty-six of Wu's poems are collected in the ''[[Quan Tangshi]]'' \"Collected Tang Poems\" and sixty-one essays under her name are recorded in the ''Quan Tangwen'' \"Collected Tang Essays\".<ref>{{Cite book |title = Women writers of traditional China: an anthology of poetry and criticism\n |authors = [[Kang-i Sun Chang]], [[Haun Saussy]], Charles Yim-tze Kwong\n |year = 1999\n |publisher = Stanford University Press\n |page = 31\n}}</ref> Although a lot of those writings serve political ends, there is one poem in which she laments her mother after she died and expresses her despair at not being able to see her again.\n\nDuring Wu Zetian's reign, the imperial court produced various works for which she was a sponsor, such as the anthology of the poetry of her court known as the ''[[Zhuying ji]]'' \"Collection of Precious Glories\", which contained poems by [[Cui Rong]], [[Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)|Li Jiao]], [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], and others, arranged according to the official rank at the court of the individuals included.<ref>{{harvp|Yu|2002|p= 56}}</ref> Among the literary developments that took place during the time of Wu Zetian (and partly at her court) was the final stylistic development of the \"new style\" poetry of the [[Regulated verse|regulated verse (''jintishi'')]], by the poetic pair [[Song Zhiwen]] and [[Shen Quanqi]].\n\nWu Zetian also engaged in patronage of scholars by founding an institute to produce the ''Collection of Biographies of Famous Women''.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" /> The development of what is considered to be characteristic [[Tang poetry]] is traditionally ascribed to [[Chen Zi'ang]],<ref>{{harvp|Watson|1971|p= 115}}</ref> one of Wu's ministers.\n\n=== Literary allusions ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nConsidering the events of her life, literary allusions to Wu Zetian may carry several connotations: a woman who has inappropriately overstepped her bounds, the [[hypocrisy]] of preaching [[compassion]] while simultaneously engaging in a pattern of [[political corruption]] and vicious behavior and ruling by pulling strings in the background. For many centuries, Wu was used by the establishment as an example of what can go wrong when a woman is placed in charge.\n\nSuch sexist opposition to her was only lifted during the late 1960s when [[Mao Zedong]]'s wife [[Jiang Qing]] rehabilitated Wu as part of a propaganda campaign to suggest she be considered as a successor to her ailing husband.\n\nIn his biography ''Wu'', British author [[Jonathan Clements]] has pointed out that these wildly differing uses of a historical figure often have led to schizophrenic and often hysterical characterizations. Many alleged poisonings and other incidents, such as the premature death of her daughter, may have rational explanations that have been twisted by later opponents.\n\n== Evaluation ==\n=== Quotes ===\nThe traditional Chinese historical view on Wu Zetian generally was mixed\u2014admiring her for her abilities in governing the state, but vilifying her for her actions in seizing imperial power. [[Luo Binwang]] even wrote along these lines in a declaration during her lifetime, in support of Li Jingye's rebellion. Typical was a commentary by the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin dynasty]] historian [[Liu Xu]], the lead editor of the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'':<ref>{{harvp|Old Book of Tang||loc= [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53776|vol. 6]]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The year that Lady Wu declared herself regent, heroic individuals were all mournful of the unfortunate turn of events, worried that the dynasty would fall, and concerned that they could not repay the grace of the deceased emperor [i.e., Emperor Gaozong] and protect his sons.

In order to take over as empress, Empress Wu strangled her own infant daughter; her willingness to crush her own flesh and blood showed how great her viciousness and vile nature was, although this is nothing more than what evil individuals and jealous women might do. However, she accepted the words of righteousness and honored the upright. Although she was like a hen that crowed, she eventually returned the rightful rule to her son. She quickly dispelled the accusation against Wei Yuanzhong, comforted Di Renjie with kind words, respected the will of the times and suppressed her favorites, and listened to honest words and ended the terror of the secret police officials. This was good, this was good.}}\n\nSome of the diversity in terms of points of agreement and even outright divergences in modern evaluations of Wu Zetian can be seen in the following quotes by modern non-Chinese authors:\n\n{{quote|\"Wu Zetian (690\u2013705) was an extraordinary woman, attractive, exceptionally gifted, politically astute and an excellent judge of men.

Commentary in subsequent periods, however, especially the book ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' compiled by Sima Guang, criticized Wu Zetian harshly. By the period of Southern [[Song dynasty]], when [[Neo-Confucianism]] was firmly established as the mainstream political ideology of China, their ideology determined the evaluation for Wu Zetian.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Era names ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705): ''Convention: use personal name''\n|-\n!

Wu was the only [[queen regnant|empress regnant]] (or female [[Emperor of China|emperor]]) in the [[history of China]].\n\nWu was the concubine of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]. After his death, she married his successor\u2014his ninth son, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]], officially becoming Gaozong's ''[[Imperial consorts of Tang China|huanghou]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u540e}}, empress consort, title for the reigning emperor's main consort) in 655, although having considerable political power prior to this. After Gaozong's debilitating stroke in 660, Wu Zetian became administrator of the court, a position equal to the emperor's until 705, Empress Wu During her husband's reign, she had many honors, privileges and power that no Empress's consort, had in the past, and after Gaozong's death, she assumed full power and became the first and only female emperor of China.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p=96}}</ref>\n\nThe importance to history of Wu Zetian's period of political and military leadership includes the major expansion of the Chinese empire, extending it far beyond its previous territorial limits, deep into [[Central Asia]], and engaging in a series of wars on the [[Korean Peninsula]], first [[Goguryeo\u2013Tang War|allying with Silla against Goguryeo]], and then [[Silla\u2013Tang War|against Silla]] over the occupation of former [[Goguryeo]] territory. Within China, besides the more direct consequences of her struggle to gain and maintain supreme power, Wu's leadership resulted in important effects regarding social class in Chinese society and in relation to state support for [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], education, and literature. Wu Zetian also had a monumental impact upon the statuary of the [[Longmen Grottoes]] and the \"Wordless Stele\" at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], as well as the construction of some major buildings and bronze castings that no longer survive.\n\nBesides her career as a political leader, Wu Zetian also had an active family life. Although family relationships sometimes became problematic, Wu Zetian was the mother of four sons, three of whom also carried the title of emperor, although one held that title only as a posthumous honor. One of her grandsons became the renowned [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]].\n\n== Names and titles ==\n{{Further|Chinese name}}\n\nIn Chinese history and literature, Wu Zetian ({{IPA-cmn|\u00f9 ts\u0264\u030c t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n}}) was known by various names and titles. Mention of her in the English language has only increased their number. A difficulty in English translations from Chinese is that English translations tend to specify gender (as in the case of \"emperor\" versus \"empress\" or \"prince\" versus \"princess\"); whereas, in [[Classical Chinese]], words such as ''hou'' ({{lang|zh|\u540e}}, \"sovereign\", \"prince\", \"queen\") or ''huangdi'' {{lang|zh|(\u7687\u5e1d}}, \"imperial supreme ruler\", \"royal deity\") are of a [[Grammatical gender#Indeterminate gender|grammatically indeterminate gender]].\n\n=== Names ===\nThe exact birth name of Wu Zetian is no longer retrievable.

In the same year, a [[List of solar eclipses in the 7th century|total eclipse of the sun]] was visible across China. Her father [[Wu Shihuo]] was engaged in the timber business and the family was relatively well off. Her mother was from the powerful Yang family. During the final years of [[Emperor Yang of Sui]], Li Yuan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6df5}}) (who would go on to become Emperor Gaozu of Tang) stayed in the Wu household many times and became close to the Wu family, whilst holding appointments in both Hedong and [[Taiyuan]]. After Li Yuan overthrew Emperor Yang, he was generous to the Wu family, providing them with money, grain, land, and clothing. Once the Tang dynasty became established, Wu Shihou held a succession of senior ministerial posts including governor of [[Yangzhou]], Lizhou, and Jingzhou ({{lang|zh|\u834a\u5dde}}) (modern day [[Jiangling County]], [[Hubei]]).\n\nWu Zetian was born into a rich family. She had servants at her disposal to perform routine tasks for her, so there were not many domestic jobs that Wu would ever have to learn. Because of this, Wu was encouraged by her father to read books and pursue her education. He made sure that his daughter was well-educated, a trait that was not common among women, much less encouraged by their fathers{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}.

At age fourteen, she was taken to be an imperial concubine (lesser wife) of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]. It was there that she became a type of secretary.

Wu progressively gained Immeasurable influence over the governance of the empire throughout Emperor Gaozong's reign, and eventually she effectively was making the major decisions. She was regarded as ruthless in her endeavours to grab power and was believed by traditional historians even to have killed her own children but was actually false as these rumors came up 400 years after her death as ancient China could not accept that a women was in power\n\n[[File:Gaozong of Tang.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of Emperor Gaozong of Tang from ''An 18th century album of portraits of 86 emperors of China, with Chinese historical notes'']]\nGaozong became emperor at the age of 21.

Empress Wang, seeing that Emperor Gaozong was still impressed by Consort Wu's beauty, hoped that the arrival of a new concubine would divert the emperor from Consort Xiao, and therefore secretly told Consort Wu to stop shaving her hair and, at a later point, welcomed her to the palace. (Some modern historians dispute this traditional account, and some think that Consort Wu never had left the imperial palace and might have had an affair with Emperor Gaozong while Emperor Taizong was still alive.){{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nConsort Wu soon overtook Consort Xiao as Emperor Gaozong's favourite. In 652, she gave birth to her first child, a son named [[Li Hong]]. In 653, she gave birth to another son, [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]]. Neither of these sons were in contention to be Emperor Gaozong's heir because Emperor Gaozong had, at the request of officials influenced by Empress Wang and her uncle, the chancellor [[Liu Shi (Tang dynasty)|Liu Shi]], designated his oldest son [[Li Zhong]] as his heir. Li Zhong's mother, Consort Liu, was of lowly birth and Empress Wang expected her gratitude. By 654, both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao had lost favour with Emperor Gaozong, and these two former romantic rivals joined forces against Consort Wu, but to no avail. As a sign of his love for Consort Wu, in 654 Emperor Gaozong conferred posthumous honors on her father [[Wu Shihuo]].\n\nAs the year 654 continued, shortly after Consort Wu had given birth to her daughter, the baby died, with some evidence suggesting deliberate [[Strangling|strangulation]], including allegations by Wu, the child's mother. Consort Wu accused Wang of murder.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" /> Wu's rival Wang was accused of having been seen near the child's room, with corroborating testimony by alleged eyewitnesses. Emperor Gaozong was led to believe that Wang had the means to kill the child, and likely done so, motivated by jealousy. Wang lacked an alibi, and was unable to clear herself. Angry, Emperor Gaozong considered deposing Empress Wang and elevating Consort Wu to her position; but, first he wanted to make sure that the government chancellors would support this. So, Gaozong visited the house of his uncle [[Zhangsun Wuji]], the head chancellor, together with Consort Wu (later Emperor Gaozong would award Chancellor Zhangsun with much treasure). During the meeting, Gaozong several times brought up the topic of Empress Wang's childlessness, a topic easily leading to an excuse sufficient to depose her; however, Zhangsun repeatedly found ways to divert the conversation. Subsequent visits by Consort Wu's mother Lady Yang and the official [[Xu Jingzong]], who was allied with Consort Wu, to seek support from Zhangsun also were to no avail.<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377199|vol. 199]]}}</ref> Scientifically credible [[forensic pathology]] information about the death of the child does not exist, and scholars lack real, concrete evidence about her death. However, speculation seems to continue.\n\nAs traditional folklore tends to portray Wu as a power hungry woman with no care for who she hurt or what she did, the most popular theory is that Wu killed her own child in order to implicate Wang. Other schools of thought argue that Wang indeed killed the child out of jealousy and hatred toward Wu since Wang had no children of her own. The third argument is that the child died of [[asphyxiation]] or [[crib death]], considering that the ventilation systems of the time were non-existent or of poor quality. Lack of ventilation combined with using coal as a heating method could lead to a build-up of fumes that would lead to [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. No matter what caused the death of the child, Wu blamed Wang for it and Wang was removed from her position as Empress.\n\nIn summer 655, Consort Wu accused Empress Wang and her mother, Lady Liu, of using witchcraft. In response, Emperor Gaozong barred Lady Liu from the palace and demoted Empress Wang's uncle, Liu Shi.<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\" /> Meanwhile, a faction of officials began to form around Consort Wu, including [[Li Yifu]], Xu, Cui Yixuan ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u7fa9\u7384}}), and Yuan Gongyu ({{lang|zh|\u8881\u516c\u745c}}). On an occasion in the autumn of 655, Emperor Gaozong summoned the chancellors Zhangsun, [[Li Shiji|Li Ji]], [[Yu Zhining]], and [[Chu Suiliang]] to the palace\u2014which Chu deduced to be regarding the matter of changing who was the Empress. Li Ji claimed an illness and refused to attend. At the meeting, Chu vehemently opposed deposing Empress Wang, while Zhangsun and Yu showed their disapproval by silence. Meanwhile, other chancellors [[Han Yuan]] and [[Lai Ji]] also opposed the move, but when Emperor Gaozong asked Li Ji again, Li Ji's response was, \"This is your family matter, Your Imperial Majesty. Why ask anyone else?\" Emperor Gaozong, therefore, became resolved. He demoted Chu to be a commandant at [[Tanzhou (in modern Hunan)|Tan Prefecture]] (roughly modern [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]]),<ref name=\"ZZTJ199\" /> and then deposed both Empress Wang and Consort Xiao, putting them under arrest and creating Consort Wu as empress to replace Empress Wang. (Later that year, Empress Wang and Consort Xiao were killed on orders by the new Empress Wu after Emperor Gaozong showed signs of considering their release. After their deaths, however, Empress Wu often was haunted by them in her dreams.

She first had Xu and Li Yifu, who were by now chancellors, falsely accuse Han Yuan and Lai Ji of being complicit with Chu Suiliang in planning treason. The three of them, along with Liu Shi, were demoted to being prefects of remote prefectures, with provisions that they would never be allowed to return to Chang'an. In 659, she further had Xu accuse Zhangsun Wuji of plotting treason with the low-level officials Wei Jifang ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u5b63\u65b9}}) and Li Chao ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5de2}}). Zhangsun was exiled and, later in the year, was forced to commit suicide in exile. Xu further implicated Chu, Liu, Han, and Yu Zhining in the plot as well. Chu, who had died in 658, was posthumously stripped of his titles, and his sons Chu Yanfu ({{lang|zh|\u891a\u5f65\u752b}}) and Chu Yanchong ({{lang|zh|\u891a\u5f65\u6c96}}) were executed. Orders also were issued to execute Liu and Han, although Han died before the execution order reached his location. It was said that after this time, no official dared to criticize the emperor.\n\nIn 660, Li Zhong, Gaozong's first-born son (to consort Liu) also was targeted. Li Zhong had feared that he would be next and had sought out advice of fortune tellers. Wu had him exiled and placed under house arrest.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\n===As the real and influential power behind the Emperor===\n\nIn 660, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu toured Bian Prefecture (modern-day Taiyuan), and Empress Wu had the opportunity to invite her old neighbors and relatives to a feast.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" /> Later that year, Emperor Gaozong began to suffer from an illness that carried the symptoms of painful headaches and loss of vision, generally thought to be hypertension-related,<ref>See, ''Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 40, p 683.</ref> and he began to have Empress Wu make rulings on petitions made by officials. It was said that Empress Wu had quick reactions and understood both literature and history, and therefore, she was making correct rulings. Thereafter, her authority rivaled Emperor Gaozong's, after this point on, Empress Wu became the undisputed power behind the throne for twenty-three years.<ref name=\"ZZTJ200\" />\n\nBy 664, Empress Wu was said to be interfering so much in the imperial governance that she was angering Emperor Gaozong. Further, she had engaged the [[Taoist]] sorcerer Guo Xingzhen ({{lang|zh|\u90ed\u884c\u771f}}) in using witchcraft\u2014an act that was prohibited by regulations and which had led to Empress Wang's downfall\u2014and the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Wang Fusheng ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u4f0f\u52dd}}) reported this to Emperor Gaozong, further angering him. He consulted the chancellor [[Shangguan Yi]], who suggested that he depose Empress Wu. He had Shangguan draft an edict, but as Shangguan was doing so Empress Wu received news of what was happening. She went to the emperor to plead her case, just as he was holding the edict that Shangguan had drafted. Emperor Gaozong could not bear to depose her, blaming the episode on Shangguan. As both Shangguan and Wang had served on Li Zhong's staff, Empress Wu had Xu falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of planning treason. Shangguan, Wang, and Shangguan's son Shangguan Tingzhi ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u5b98\u5ead\u829d}}) were executed, while Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377201|vol. 201]]}}</ref> (Shangguan Tingzhi's daughter [[Shangguan Wan'er]], then an infant, and her mother, Lady Zheng, became slaves in the inner palace. After Shangguan Wan'er grew up, she eventually became a trusted secretary for Empress Wu.) Thereafter, at imperial meetings for eighteen years, Empress Wu would sit behind a pearl screen behind Emperor  Gaozong, hear the reports as well, and imperial powers often fell into her hands, and she effectively was making the major decisions and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell And in the absence of her husband, she gained vast powers and Empress Wu had the ultimate power, and she became a Controversial and formidable figure with far-reaching influence. She and Emperor Gaozong were thereafter referred to as the \"Two Saints.\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u8056}}, ''Er Sheng'').<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" />\n\nMeanwhile, on Empress Wu's account, her mother Lady Yang had been created the Lady of Rong, and her older sister, now widowed, the Lady of Han. Her brothers Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang and cousins Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun, despite the poor relationships that they had with Lady Yang, were promoted. At a feast that Lady Yang held for them, however, Wu Weiliang offended Lady Yang by stating that they did not find it honorable for them to be promoted on account of Empress Wu. Empress Wu, therefore, requested to have them demoted to remote prefectures\u2014outwardly to show modesty, but in reality to avenge the offense to her mother. Wu Yuanqing and Wu Yuanshuang died in effective exile. Meanwhile, in or before 666, Lady of Han died as well, and after her death, Emperor Gaozong created her daughter the Lady of Wei and considered keeping her in the palace\u2014possibly as a concubine\u2014but did not immediately do so, as he feared that Empress Wu would be displeased. It was said that Empress Wu heard of this and was nevertheless displeased, and she had the Lady of Wei poisoned, by placing poison in food offerings that Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun had made and then blaming Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun for the murder. Wu Weiliang and Wu Huaiyun were executed.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" /><ref name=\"WuShihuo\">For Wu Shihuo's career and family, see generally ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u537758|vol. 58]] and ''New Book of Tang'', [[:zh:s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377206|vol. 206]]</ref>\n\nIn 670, Wu's mother, Lady Yang, died and by Emperor Gaozong's orders, all of the imperial officials and their wives attended her wake and mourned her. Later that year, with the realm suffering from a major drought, Empress Wu offered to be deposed, an offer Emperor Gaozong rejected. He further posthumously honored Wu Shihuo (who had previously been posthumously honored as the Duke of Zhou) and Lady Yang by giving them the titles of the Prince and Princess of Taiyuan.<ref name=\"ZZTJ201\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the son of Wu's older sister, the Lady of Han, (Wu's nephew) Helan Minzhi ({{lang|zh|\u8cc0\u862d\u654f\u4e4b}}) had been given the surname of Wu and allowed to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou. As it was becoming clear, however, that he was suspecting Empress Wu of having murdered his sister, Empress Wu began to take precautions against him, he also was said to have had an incestuous relationship with his grandmother Lady Yang. In 671, Helan Minzhi was accused of having disobeyed mourning regulations during the period of mourning for Lady Yang, and also of raping the daughter of the official Yang Sijian ({{lang|zh|\u694a\u601d\u5109}}), whom Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu had previously selected to be the wife and crown princess for Li Hong. Helan Minzhi was exiled and either was executed in exile or committed suicide. In 674, Empress Wu had Wu Yuanshuang's son [[Wu Chengsi]] recalled from exile to inherit the title of Duke of Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377202|vol. 202]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luoyang 2006 7-29.jpg|thumb|The Fengxian cave (c. 675) of the [[Longmen Grottoes]], commissioned by Wu Zetian; the large, central Buddha is representative of the ''[[Vairocana]]'']]\n\nIn 675, with Emperor Gaozong's illness getting worse, he considered having Empress Wu formally rule as [[regent]]. The chancellor [[Hao Chujun]] and the official [[Li Yiyan]] both opposed this, and he did not formally make her regent, Although Wu, as empress, had rather in the absence of her husband relatively of the emperor more political power and was often ahead of the Emperor Gaozong.\n\nAlso in 675, a number of people would fall victim to Empress Wu's ire. Empress Wu had been displeased at the favor that Emperor Gaozong had shown his aunt, Princess Changle, who had married the general Zhao Gui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u74cc}}) and whose daughter had become the wife and princess of Wu's third son Li Xi\u01cen, the Prince of Zhou. Princess Zhao was therefore accused of unspecified crimes and put under arrest, eventually being starved to death. Zhao Gui and Princess Changle were exiled. Meanwhile, later that month, Li Hong, the Crown Prince\u2014who had been urging Empress Wu not to exercise so much influence on Emperor Gaozong's governance and who had offended Empress Wu by requesting that his half-sisters, Consort Xiao's daughters, Princess Yiyang and Xuancheng, who had been under house arrest, be allowed to marry\u2014died suddenly. Traditional historians generally believed that Empress Wu poisoned Li Hong to death. Li Xi\u00e1n, then carrying the title of Prince of Yong, was created crown prince.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" /> Meanwhile, Consort Xiao's son Li Sujie and another son of Emperor Gaozong's, [[Li Shangjin]] ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4e0a\u91d1}}), were repeatedly accused of crimes by Empress Wu and were demoted.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nSoon Empress Wu's relationship with Li Xi\u00e1n also deteriorated, as Li Xi\u00e1n had become unsettled after hearing rumors that he was not born to Empress Wu\u2014but to her sister, the Lady of Han\u2014and when Empress Wu heard of his fearfulness, she became angry with him. Further, the sorcerer Ming Chongyan ({{lang|zh|\u660e\u5d07\u513c}}), whom both she and Emperor Gaozong respected and who had stated that Li Xi\u00e1n was unsuitable to inherit the throne, was assassinated in 679. The assassins were not caught\u2014causing Wu to suspect that Li Xi\u00e1n was behind the assassination. In 680, Li Xi\u00e1n was accused of crimes and during an investigation by the officials [[Xue Yuanchao]], [[Pei Yan]], and [[Gao Zhizhou]], a large number of arms were found in Li Xi\u00e1n's palace. Empress Wu formally accused Li Xi\u00e1n of treason and the assassination of Ming. Li Xi\u00e1n was deposed and exiled.\n\nAfter, the exile of Li Xi\u00e1n, his younger brother Li Xi\u01cen [similar-sounding name but different Chinese characters] (who had by now been renamed Li Zhe) was created crown prince.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nIn 681, Princess Taiping was married to Xue Shao ({{lang|zh|\u859b\u7d39}}), the son of Emperor Gaozong's sister Princess Chengyang, in a grand ceremony. Empress Wu, initially unimpressed with the lineages of Xue Shao's brothers' wives, wanted to order his brothers to divorce their wives\u2014stopping only after it was pointed out to her that Lady Xiao, the wife of Xue Shao's older brother Xue Yi ({{lang|zh|\u859b\u9857}}), was a grandniece of the deceased chancellor [[Xiao Yu]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\nIn late 683, Emperor Gaozong died while at Luoyang.

Wu already had poisoned the crown prince Li Hong and had enough other princes exiled that her third son, [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Zhe]], had been made heir apparent. Furthermore, Gaozong's will included provisions that Li Zhe should ascend immediately to the imperial throne, and that he should look to Empress Wu in regard to any important matter, either military or civil.<ref name=\"Paludan, 97\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 97}}</ref> In the second month of 684, Li Zhe ascended to the imperial throne, taking the regnal name of Zhongzong, for the short six weeks of his reign.\n\nImmediately, Emperor Zhongzong showed signs of disobeying Empress Dowager Wu. Emperor Zhongzong was under the thumb of his wife, the empress Wei, even appointing his father-in-law prime minister. He also tried to make his father-in-law ''Shizhong'' ({{lang|zh|\u4f8d\u4e2d}}, the head of the examination bureau of government, {{lang|zh|\u9580\u4e0b\u7701}}, ''Menxia Sheng'', and a post considered one for a chancellor) and giving a mid-level office to his [[wet nurse]]'s son\u2014despite stern opposition by the chancellor Pei Yan, at one point remarking to Pei:<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\n{{quote|What would be wrong even if I gave the empire to Wei Xuanzhen? Why do you care about ''Shizhong'' so much?}}\n\nPei reported this to Empress Dowager Wu, and she, after planning with Pei, Liu Yizhi, and the generals Cheng Wuting ({{lang|zh|\u7a0b\u52d9\u633a}}) and Zhang Qianxu ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u8654\u52d6}}), deposed him and replaced him with her youngest son Li Dan, the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong). Wu Zetian had Zhongzong's father in law, Wei Xuanzhen ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u7384\u8c9e}}), brought up on charges of treason, and he was sent into seclusion. Emperor Zhongzong was reduced to the title of Prince of Luling and exiled. Empress Dowager Wu also sent the general Qiu Shenji ({{lang|zh|\u4e18\u795e\u52e3}}) to Li Xi\u00e1n's place in exile and forced Li Xi\u00e1n to commit suicide.\n\n===As regent for Emperor Ruizong===\nWu had her youngest son [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|Li Dan]] made emperor, as Emperor Ruizong. She was the ruler, however, both in substance and appearance. Wu did not even follow the customary pretense of hiding behind a screen or curtain and, in whispers, issued commands for the nominal ruler to formally announce. Ruizong never moved into the imperial quarters, appeared at no imperial function, and remained a virtual prisoner in the inner quarters.<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|pp= 97\u2013101}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Emperor Ruizong held the title of emperor, Empress Dowager Wu firmly controlled the imperial court, and the officials were not allowed to meet with Emperor Ruizong, nor was he allowed to rule on matters of state. Rather, the matters of state were ruled on by Empress Dowager Wu. At the suggestion of her nephew Wu Chengsi, she also expanded the ancestral shrine of the Wu ancestors and gave them greater posthumous honours.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nIn 686, Empress Dowager Wu offered to return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong, but Emperor Ruizong, knowing that she did not truly intend to do so, declined, and she continued to exercise imperial authority.\n\nSoon thereafter, Li Ji's grandson [[Li Jingye]], the Duke of Ying, who had been disaffected by his own exile, started a rebellion at Yang Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u63da\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]). The rebellion initially drew much popular support in the region, however, Li Jingye progressed slowly in his attack and did not take advantage of that popular support. Meanwhile, Pei suggested to Empress Dowager Wu that she return imperial authority to the Emperor and argued that doing so would cause the rebellion to collapse on its own. This offended her, and she accused him of being complicit with Li Jingye and had him executed; she also demoted, exiled, and killed a number of officials who, when Pei was arrested, tried to speak on his behalf. She sent a general, Li Xiaoyi ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5b5d\u9038}}), to attack Li Jingye, and while Li Xiaoyi was initially unsuccessful, he pushed on at the urging of his assistant [[Wei Yuanzhong]] and eventually was able to crush Li Jingye's forces. Li Jingye fled and was killed in flight.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nBy 685, Empress Dowager Wu began to carry on an affair with the [[Buddhist monk]] [[Xue Huaiyi|Huaiyi]] and during the next few years, Huaiyi would be bestowed with progressively greater honours.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" /><ref name=\"ZZTJ204\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377204|vol. 204]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ZZTJ205\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377205|vol. 205]]}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, she installed copper mailboxes outside the imperial government buildings to encourage the people of the realm to report secretly on others, as she suspected many officials of opposing her. Exploiting these beliefs of hers, secret police officials, including [[Suo Yuanli]], [[Zhou Xing (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Xing]], and [[Lai Junchen]], began to rise in power and to carry out systematic false accusations, tortures, and executions of individuals.<ref name=\"ZZTJ203\" />\n\nIn 688, Empress Dowager Wu was set to make sacrifices to the deity of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] ({{lang|zh|\u6d1b\u6c34}}, flowing through the Henan province city of [[Luoyang]], then the \"Eastern Capital\"). Wu summoned senior members of Tang's Li imperial clan to Luoyang. The imperial princes worried that she planned to slaughter them and secure the throne for herself: thus, they plotted to resist her. Before a rebellion could be comprehensively planned out, however, Li Zhen and his son [[Li Chong (Tang dynasty)|Li Chong]], the Prince of Langye rose first, at their respective posts as prefects of Yu Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u8c6b\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Zhumadian]], [[Henan]]) and Bo Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u535a\u5dde}}, roughly modern [[Liaocheng]], [[Shandong]]). The other princes were not yet ready, however, and did not rise, and forces sent by Empress Dowager Wu and the local forces crushed Li Chong and Li Zhen's forces quickly. Empress Dowager Wu took this opportunity to arrest Emperor Gaozong's granduncles Li Yuanjia ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u5143\u5609}}) the Prince of Han, Li Lingkui ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u9748\u5914}}) the Prince of Lu, and Princess Changle, as well as many other members of the Li clan and she, forced them to commit suicide. Even Princess Taiping's husband Xue Shao was implicated and starved to death. In the subsequent years, there continued to be many politically motivated massacres of officials and Li clan members.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" />\n\nIn 690, Wu took the final step to become the [[empress regnant]] of the newly proclaimed [[Second Zhou dynasty|Zhou dynasty]], and the title ''Huangdi''. Traditional Chinese [[order of succession]] (akin to the [[Salic law]] in Europe) did not allow a woman to ascend the throne, but Wu Zetian was determined to quash the opposition and the use of the secret police did not subside, but continued, after her taking the throne. While her organization of the civil service system was criticized for its laxity of the promotion of officials, nonetheless, Wu Zetian was considered capable of evaluating the performance of the officials once they were in office. The [[Song dynasty]] historian [[Sima Guang]], in his ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', commented:<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n{{quote|Even though the Empress Dowager{{NoteTag|Throughout the ''Zizhi Tongjian'' descriptions of Wu Zetian's reign, Sima referred to her as \"the Empress Dowager\", implicitly refusing to recognize her as empress regnant, although he used her [[Chinese era name|era name]]s.}} excessively used official titles to cause people to submit to her, if she saw that someone was incompetent, she would immediately depose or even execute him. She grasped the powers of punishment and award, controlled the state, and made her own judgments as to policy decisions. She was observant and had good judgment, so the talented people of the time also were willing to be used by her.}}\n\n==Reign as Empress regnant ==\nIn 690, Wu had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her and established the Zhou dynasty, with herself as the ruler (''Huangdi'').\n\nThe early part of her reign was characterized by secret police terror, which moderated as the years went by. She was, on the other hand, recognized as a capable and attentive ruler even by traditional historians who despised her, and her ability at selecting capable men to serve as officials was admired throughout the rest of the Tang dynasty as well as in subsequent dynasties.{{NoteTag|See, e.g., {{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377234|vol. 234]]}} &#91;submission of [[Lu Zhi (Tang dynasty)|Lu Zhi]] to [[Emperor Dezong of Tang]], citing Wu Zetian as the prime example of a capable selector of officials&#93;; [[Zhao Yi]]'s ''[[Notes of the Twenty-Two Histories]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e8c\u5341\u4e8c\u53f2\u5284\u8a18}}), ''Empress Wu Accepted Corrections and Knew People''. http://ctwang.myweb.hinet.net/22szj/300/0260.htm.}} (She would be overthrown in a coup in 705 and Emperor Zhongzong returned to the throne, but she would continue to carry the title of \"emperor\" until her death later in that year).\n\n=== Early reign (690-696) ===\n[[File:Epitaph for Yang Shun, general to Empress Wu Zetian, China, Luoyang, Tang dynasty, 693 AD, limestone - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC03576.JPG|thumb|[[Epitaph]] for [[Yang Shun]], general to Empress Wu Zetian, China, [[Luoyang]], 693, limestone, [[Royal Ontario Museum]]]]\n\nShortly after Wu Zetian took the throne, she elevated the status of Buddhism above that of [[Taoism]], officially sanctioning Buddhism by building temples named Dayun Temple ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u96f2\u5bfa}}) in each prefecture belonging to the capital regions of the two capitals Luoyang and Chang'an, and created nine senior monks as dukes. She also enshrined seven generations of Wu ancestors at the imperial ancestral temple, although she also continued to offer sacrifices to the Tang emperors Gaozu, Taizong, and Gaozong.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" />\n\nShe faced the issue of succession. At the time she took the throne, she created Li Dan, the former Emperor Ruizong, crown prince, and bestowed the name of Wu on him.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> The official [[Zhang Jiafu]], however, convinced the commoner Wang Qingzhi ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u6176\u4e4b}}) to start a petition drive to make her nephew Wu Chengsi crown prince, arguing that an emperor named Wu should pass the throne to a member of the Wu clan. Wu Zetian was tempted to do so, and when the chancellors [[Cen Changqian]] and [[Ge Fuyuan]] opposed sternly, they, along with fellow chancellor [[Ouyang Tong]], were executed. Nevertheless, she declined Wang's request to make Wu Chengsi crown prince, but for a time allowed Wang to freely enter the palace to see her. On one occasion, however, when Wang angered her by coming to the palace too much, she asked the official [[Li Zhaode]] to batter Wang as punishment\u2014but Li Zhaode exploited the opportunity to batter Wang to death, and his group of petitioners scattered. Li Zhaode then persuaded Wu Zetian to keep Li Dan as crown prince\u2014pointing out that a son was closer in relations than a nephew, and also that if Wu Chengsi became emperor, Emperor Gaozong would never again be worshiped. Wu Zetian agreed, and for some time did not reconsider the matter.<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> Further, at Li Zhaode's warning that Wu Chengsi was becoming too powerful, Wu Zetian stripped Wu Chengsi of his chancellor authority and bestowed on him largely honorific titles without authority.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the power of the secret police officials continued to increase, until they appeared to be curbed starting in about 692, when Lai Junchen was foiled in his attempt to have the chancellors [[Ren Zhigu]], [[Di Renjie]], [[Pei Xingben]], and other officials Cui Xuanli ({{lang|zh|\u5d14\u5ba3\u79ae}}), Lu Xian ({{lang|zh|\u76e7\u737b}}), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u55e3\u771e}}) executed, as Di, under arrest, had hidden a secret petition inside a change of clothes and had it submitted by his son Di Guangyuan ({{lang|zh|\u72c4\u5149\u9060}}). The seven still were exiled, but after this incident, particularly at the urging of Li Zhaode, [[Zhu Jingze]], and Zhou Ju ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u77e9}}), the waves of politically motivated massacres decreased, although they did not end entirely.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nAlso in 692, Wu Zetian commissioned the general [[Wang Xiaojie]] to attack the [[Tibetan Empire]], and Wang recaptured the four garrisons of the [[Western Regions]] that had fallen to the Tibetan Empire in 670 \u2013 [[Kucha]], [[Yutian County, Xinjiang|Yutian]], [[Kashgar]], and [[Suyab]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nIn 693, after Wu Zetian's trusted [[lady-in-waiting]] Wei Tuan'er ({{lang|zh|\u97cb\u5718\u5152}}), who hated Li Dan (the reason why she did so is lost to history), falsely accused Li Dan's wife [[Empress Liu (Tang dynasty)|Crown Princess Liu]] and Consort Dou of using witchcraft, Wu Zetian had Crown Princess Liu and Consort Dou killed. Li Dan, fearful that he was to be next, did not dare to speak of them. When Wei further planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, however, someone else informed on her, and she was executed. Wu Zetian nevertheless had Li Dan's sons demoted in their princely titles, and when the officials Pei Feigong ({{lang|zh|\u88f4\u532a\u8eac}}) and Fan Yunxian ({{lang|zh|\u8303\u96f2\u4ed9}}) were accused of secretly meeting Li Dan, she executed Pei and Fan and further, barred officials from meeting Li Dan. There were then accusations that Li Dan was plotting treason, and under Wu Zetian's direction, Lai launched an investigation. Lai arrested Li Dan's servants and tortured them\u2014and the torture was such that many of them were ready to falsely implicate themselves and Li Dan. One of Li Dan's servants, [[An Jincang]], however, proclaimed Li Dan's innocence and cut his own belly open to swear to that fact. When Wu Zetian heard of what An did, she had doctors attend to An and barely save his life, and then ordered Lai to end the investigation, thus saving Li Dan.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" />\n\nIn 694, Li Zhaode, who had become powerful after Wu Chengsi's removal, was thought to be too powerful and Wu Zetian removed him.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Also around this time, she became highly impressed with a group of mystic individuals\u2014the hermit [[Wei Shifang]] (on whom she bestowed a chancellor title briefly), who claimed to be more than 350&nbsp;years old; an old [[bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]] who claimed to be a [[buddhahood|Buddha]] and capable of predicting the future; and a non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] man who claimed to be 500&nbsp;years old.

In spring 696, an army she sent, commanded by Wang Xiaojie and [[Lou Shide]] against the Tibetan Empire, was soundly defeated by Tibetan generals, the brothers [[Gar Trinring Tsendro]] ({{lang|zh|\u8ad6\u6b3d\u9675 }}) and [[Gar Tsenba]] ({{lang|zh| \u8ad6\u8d0a\u5a46 }}), and as a result, she demoted Wang to commoner rank and Lou to be a low level prefectural official, although she eventually restored both of them to general positions.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> In April of the same year, Wu Zetian recast the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons]], the symbol of ultimate power in ancient China, to reinforce her authority.<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\" />\n\nA much more serious threat arose in summer 696. The [[Khitan people|Khitan]] chieftains [[Li Jinzhong]] and [[Sun Wanrong]], brothers-in-law, angry over the mistreatment of the Khitan people by the Zhou official Zhao Wenhui ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u6587\u7ffd}}), the prefect of Ying Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u71df\u5dde }}, roughly [[Zhaoyang County]], [[Liaoning]]), rebelled, with Li assuming the title of Wushang Khan (\u7121\u4e0a\u53ef\u6c57). Armies that Wu Zetian sent to suppress Li and Sun's rebellion were defeated by Khitan forces, which in turn attacked Zhou proper. Meanwhile, [[Qapaghan Qaghan]] of the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]] offered to submit, and yet was also launching attacks against Zhou and Khitan\u2014including an attack against Khitan base of operations during the winter of 696, shortly after Li's death, that captured Li's and Sun's families and temporarily halted Khitan operations against Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Sun, after taking over as khan and reorganizing Khitan forces, again attacked Zhou territory and had many victories over Zhou forces, including a battle during which Wang Shijie was killed.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377206|vol. 206]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ZZTJ205\" /> Wu Zetian tried to allay the situation by making peace with Ashina Mochuo at fairly costly terms\u2014the return of Tujue people who had previously submitted to Zhou and providing Ashina Mochuo with seeds, silk, tools, and iron. In summer 697, Ashina Mochuo launched another attack on Khitan's base of operations, and this time, after his attack, Khitan forces collapsed and Sun was killed in flight, ending the Khitan threat.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nMeanwhile, also in 697, Lai Junchen, who had at one point lost power but then had returned to power, falsely accused Li Zhaode (who had been pardoned) of crimes, and then planned to falsely accuse Li Dan, Li Zhe, the Wu clan princes, and Princess Taiping, of treason. The Wu clan princes and Princess Taiping acted first against him, accusing him of crimes, and he and Li Zhaode were executed together. After Lai's death, the reign of the secret police largely ended. Gradually, many of the victims of Lai and the other secret police officials were exonerated posthumously.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" /> Meanwhile, around this time, Wu Zetian began relationships with two new lovers\u2014the brothers [[Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong]], who became honored within the palace and were eventually created dukes.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" /><ref name=\"ZZTJ207\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377207|vol. 207]]}}</ref>\n\nAround 698, Wu Chengsi and another nephew of Wu Zetian's, [[Wu Sansi]], the Prince of Liang, were repeatedly making attempts to have officials persuade Wu Zetian to create one of them crown prince\u2014again citing the reason that an emperor should pass the throne to someone of the same clan. Di Renjie, who by now had become a trusted chancellor, was firmly against the idea, however, and proposed that Li Zhe be recalled instead. He was supported in this by fellow chancellors [[Wang Fangqing]] and [[Wang Jishan]], as well as Wu Zetian's close advisor [[Ji Xu]], who further persuaded the Zhang brothers to support the idea as well. In spring 698, Wu Zetian agreed and recalled Li Zhe from exile. Soon, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to Li Zhe, and Wu Zetian created Li Zhe crown prince. She soon changed his name back to Li Xi\u01cen and then Wu Xian.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nLater, Ashina Mochuo demanded a [[Tang dynasty]] prince for marriage to his daughter, part of a plot to join his family with the Tang, displace the Zhou, and restore Tang rule over China (under his influence). When Wu Zetian sent a member of her own family, grandnephew Wu Yanxiu ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5ef6\u79c0}}), to marry Mochuo's daughter instead, he rejected him.<ref>{{Cite book\n |title = A history of China\n |author = Jonathan Wolfram Eberhard\n |year = 1997\n |publisher = University of California Press\n |page = 186\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mUofeN6WW_IC&pg=PA186&dq=kao+tsung+demanded+chinese+prince+daughter&hl=en&ei=LWhMTOTUDoL58AaKzeU2&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=kao%20tsung%20demanded%20chinese%20prince%20daughter&f=false\n |access-date = 2010-06-28\n |ISBN = 978-0-520-03268-2\n}}</ref> Ashina Mochuo had no intention to cement the peace treaty with a marriage; instead, when Wu Yanxiu arrived, he detained Wu Yanxiu and then launched a major attack on Zhou, advancing as far south as Zhao Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u8d99\u5dde}}, in modern [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]) before withdrawing.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nIn 699, however, at least the Tibetan threat would cease. Emperor [[Tridu Songtsen]], unhappy that Gar Trinring was monopolizing power, took an opportunity when Trinring was away from the capital [[Lhasa]] to slaughter Trinring's associates. He then defeated Trinring in battle, and Trinring committed suicide. Gar Tsenba and Trinring's son, [[Lun Gongren]] ({{lang|zh|\u8ad6\u5f13\u4ec1}}), surrendered to Zhou. After this, the Tibetan Empire was under internal turmoil for several years, and there was peace for Zhou on the border.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\nAlso in 699, Wu Zetian, realizing that she was growing old, feared that after her death, Li Xian and the Wu clan princes would not be able to have peace with each other, and she made him, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's second husband [[Wu Youji]] (a nephew of hers), the Prince of Ding, and other Wu clan princes to swear an oath to each other.<ref name=\"ZZTJ206\" />\n\n=== Late reign (701-705) ===\n[[File:Tang Dynasty circa 700 CE.png|thumb|Estimated territorial extent of Wu Zetian's empire]]\n\nAs Wu Zetian grew older, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong became increasingly powerful, and even the princes of the Wu clan flattered them. She also increasingly relied on them to handle the affairs of state. This was secretly discussed and criticized by her grandson [[Li Chongrun]], the Prince of Shao, (Li Xian's son), granddaughter [[Li Xianhui]] ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4ed9\u8559}}) the Lady Yongtai (Li Chongrun's sister), and Li Xianhui's husband Wu Yanji ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u5ef6\u57fa}}) the Prince of Wei (Wu Zetian's grandnephew and Wu Chengsi's son), but somehow the discussion was leaked, and Zhang Yizhi reported this to Wu Zetian. She ordered the three of them to commit suicide.{{NoteTag|The ''Zizhi Tongjian'' asserted that Li Chongrun was forced to commit suicide, but the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' asserted in his biographies that he was caned to death on Wu Zetian's orders.

Individuals she promoted in her old age included, among others, [[Cui Xuanwei]] and [[Zhang Jiazhen]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\nBy 703, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong had become resentful of Wei Yuanzhong, who by now was a senior chancellor, for dressing down their brother Zhang Changyi ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u660c\u5100}}) and rejecting the promotion of another brother Zhang Changqi ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u660c\u671f}}). They also were fearful that if Wu Zetian died, Wei would find a way to execute them, and therefore accused Wei and Gao Jian ({{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u6229}}), an official favoured by Princess Taiping, of speculating on Wu Zetian's old age and death. They initially got Wei's subordinate [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Shuo]] to agree to corroborate the charges, but once Zhang Shuo was before Wu Zetian, he instead accused Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong of forcing him to bear false witness. As a result, Wei, Gao, and Zhang Shuo were exiled, but escaped death.<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\n== Removal and death ==\n[[File:Qianling.jpg|thumb|upright|Located to the east of Phoenix Gate within the [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\u2013built near [[Chang'an]] in 706 to house the remains of [[Tang Gaozong]], Empress Wu, and other royal members of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]]\u2013is the large Blank Tablet or Wordless Stele. This tablet is 6.3 meters tall and weighs 98 tonnes. Although no written inscriptions adorn this edifice (hence its name), the sides of the tablet feature carved dragons while the top features carved oysters.]]\n\nIn autumn of 704, there began to be accusations of corruption levied against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, as well as their brothers Zhang Changqi, Zhang Changyi, and Zhang Tongxiu ({{lang|zh|\u5f35\u540c\u4f11}}). Zhang Tongxiu and Zhang Changyi were demoted, but even though the officials Li Chengjia ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u627f\u5609}}) and [[Huan Yanfan]] advocated that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong be removed as well, Wu Zetian, taking the suggestion of the chancellor [[Yang Zaisi]], did not remove them. Subsequently, charges of corruption against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were renewed by the chancellor [[Wei Anshi]].<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n[[File:Qianling Mausoleum 38 2013-08.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Side view of the Blank Tablet.]]\n\nIn winter 704, Wu Zetian became seriously ill for a period, and only the Zhang brothers were allowed to see her; the chancellors were not. This led to speculation that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were plotting to take over the throne, and there were repeated accusations of treason. Once her condition improved, Cui Xuanwei advocated that only Li Xian and Li Dan be allowed to attend to her\u2014a suggestion that she did not accept. After further accusations against the Zhang brothers by Huan and [[Song Jing]], Wu Zetian allowed Song to investigate, but before the investigation was completed, she issued a pardon for Zhang Yizhi, derailing Song's investigation.<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" />\n\nBy spring 705, Wu Zetian was seriously ill again. [[Zhang Jianzhi]], [[Jing Hui]], and [[Yuan Shuji]], planned a coup to kill the Zhang brothers. They convinced the generals [[Li Duozuo]], Li Dan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6e5b}}, note different character than the [[Emperor Ruizong of Tang|former emperor]]), and Yang Yuanyan ({{lang|zh|\u694a\u5143\u7430}}) and another chancellor, [[Yao Chong|Yao Yuanzhi]], to be involved. With agreement from Li Xian as well, they acted on 20 February,{{cn |date=September 2019}} killing [[Zhang Yizhi]] and [[Zhang Changzong]], and then they had Changsheng Hall ({{lang|zh|\u9577\u751f\u6bbf}}), where Wu Zetian was residing, surrounded. They then reported to her that the Zhang brothers had been executed for treason, and they then forced her to yield the throne to Li Xian. On 21 February, an edict was issued in her name that made Li Xian regent, and on 22 February, an edict was issued in her name passing the throne to Li Xian. On 23 February, Li Xian formally retook the throne, and the next day, Wu Zetian, under heavy guard, was moved to the subsidiary palace, Shangyang Palace ({{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u967d\u5bae}}), but was nevertheless honoured with the title of Empress Regnant Zetian Dasheng ({{lang|zh|\u5247\u5929\u5927\u8056\u7687\u5e1d}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ207\" /> On 3 March,{{cn |date=September 2019}} Tang dynasty was restored, ending the Zhou.<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\">{{harvp|Zizhi Tongjian|1084|loc= [[:zh:s:\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451/\u5377208|vol. 208]]}}.</ref>\n\nShe died on 16 December,{{cn |date=September 2019}} and, pursuant to a final edict issued in her name, was no longer referred to as empress regnant, but instead as Empress Consort Zetian Dasheng ({{lang|zh|\u5247\u5929\u5927\u8056\u7687\u540e}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ208\" /> In 706, Wu Zetian's son [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Emperor Zhongzong]] had Wu Zetian interred in a joint burial with his father [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] at the [[Qianling Mausoleum]], located near the capital [[Chang'an]] on Mount Liang. Emperor Zhongzong also buried at Qianling his brother [[Li Xian (prince)|Li Xi\u00e1n]], son [[Li Chongrun]], and daughter Li Xianhui ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u4ed9\u8559}}) the Lady Yongtai (posthumously honoured as the Princess Yongtai)\u2014victims of Wu Zetian's wrath.\n\n== Zhou dynasty ==\n{{main|Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)}}\n\nWu Zetian proclaimed herself as the ruler of the \"[[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Zhou dynasty]]\", named after the historical [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046\u2013256 BC); and, thus, from 690 to 705 the Chinese Empire was known as the Zhou dynasty. The traditional historical view, however, is to discount Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\": dynasties by definition involve the succession of rulers from one family: Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\" was founded by her, and ended within her lifetime, with her abdication (705). This does not meet the traditional concept of a dynasty. The alternative, is to view Wu's \"Zhou dynasty\" as the revival of the generally historically-accepted historical Zhou dynasty, which had been ruled (at least nominally) by the [[Ji (surname)|Ji]] family, almost a thousand years before. Either way, Wu's Zhou dynasty is best viewed as a brief interruption of the Li family's Tang dynasty, rather than as a fully realized dynasty. Her claim of founding a new dynasty, however, was little opposed at the time (690).<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 101}}</ref> The fifteen-year period which Wu Zetian designated as her \"Zhou Dynasty\" considered in the context of nearly a half century of ''de facto'' rule (c. 654\u2013705) reveals a remarkable and still debated period of history.<ref>{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|pp= 81\u201382}}</ref> In this context, designating a new dynasty, with her as its emperor can be seen as part of her power politics, and as the culmination of her period of ruling. Though the fifteen years of Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty had its own notable characteristics, these are difficult to separate from Wu's reign of power, which lasted for about half of a century.\n\nWu Zetian's consolidation of power in part relied on a system of spies. She used informants to choose persons to eliminate, a process which peaked in 697, with the wholesale demotion, exile, or killing of various aristocratic families and scholars, furthermore prohibiting their sons from holding office.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\">{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 99}}</ref>\n\nOne apparatus of government which fell into Wu's power was the [[imperial examination]] system: the basic theory and practice of which was to recruit into government service those men who were the best educated, talented, and having the best potential to perform their duties, and to do so by testing a pool of candidates in order to determine this objectively. This pool was male only, and the qualified pool of candidates and resulting placements into official positions was on a relatively small scale at the time of Wu's assuming control of government. The official tests examined such things considered important for functionaries of the highly developed, bureaucratic government structure of the current imperial government. The qualities sought in a candidate for government service included determining the potential official's level of literacy in terms of reading and writing as well as his possession of the specific knowledge considered necessary and desirable for a governmental official, such as [[Confucianism|Confucian]] precepts on the nature of virtue and theory on the proper ordering of and relationships within society. Wu Zetian continued to use the imperial examination system to recruit civil servants, and she introduced major changes in regard to the system that she inherited, including increasing the pool of candidates permitted to take the test, by allowing commoners and gentry, who were previously disqualified by their background, to take them. Another thing she did was to expand the governmental examination system and to greatly increase the importance of this method of recruiting government officials, which she did in 693.<ref name=\"Paludan, 97\" /> Wu provided increased opportunity for the representation within government to people of the [[North China Plain]], versus people of the northwestern aristocratic families, (whom she decimated, anyway); and, the successful candidates who were recruited through the examination system became an elite group within her government.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\">{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|p= 82}}</ref> The historical details surrounding and the consequences of Wu Zetian's promoting a new group of people from previously disenfranchised backgrounds into prominence as powerful governmental officials as well as the role of the examination system in this regard, remains a matter of debate for scholars of this subject.\n\nWu Zetian eliminated many of her real, potential, or perceived rivals to power by means of death (including execution, suicide by command, and more-or-less directly killing people), demotion, and exile. Mostly this was carried out by her secret police, led by individuals like Wao Ganjun and [[Lai Junchen]]\u2014who were known to have written a document called the ''Manual of Accusation'', which detailed steps for interrogation and obtaining confessions by torture. One of these methods, the \"Dying Swine's Melancholy\" ({{lang|zh|\u6b7b\u732a\u6101}}),<ref>http://baike.baidu.com/view/159862.htm</ref>{{better source|date=August 2017}} which merely indicated a level of pain inflicted by a torture device, seems to have been conflated in the years following Wu's death with the story of the \"human swine\" torture conducted by [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]], in which the victim had limbs and tongue amputated, was force-fed, and left to wallow in his own excrement.\n\nWu targeted various individuals, including many in her own family and her extended family. In reaction to an attempt to remove her from power, in 684, she massacred twelve entire collateral branches of the imperial family.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" /> Besides this, she also altered the ancient balance of power in China, dating back to the [[Qin dynasty]]. The old area of the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] was later referred to as [[Guanzhong]], literally, the area \"within the fortified mountain passes\". It was from this area of northwest China that the Ying family of Qin arose to conquer, unifying China into its first historical empire. During the [[Han dynasty]], [[Sima Qian]] records in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shiji]]'' that Guanzhong had three-tenths of China's population, but six-tenths of its wealth.<ref>{{harvp|Cotterell|Cotterell|1975|p= 90}}</ref> Additionally, at the beginning of Wu Zetian's period of ascendency, Guanzhong was still the stronghold of the most nationally powerful aristocratic families, despite the fact that economic development in other parts of China had improved the lot of families in other regions. The Guangzhong aristocracy was not willing to relinquish their hold on the reins of government, however; while, at the same time, some of the more newly wealthy families in other areas, such as the [[North China Plain]] or [[Hubei]] were eager for a larger share of national power of their own. Most of the opposition to Wu was from the Guangzhong families of northwest China. Accordingly, she repressed them, instead favoring less privileged families, thus raising to the ranks of power many talented, but less aristocratic families, often recruited through the official examination system.<ref name=\"Cotterell and Cotterell, 144\">{{harvp|Cotterell|Cotterell|1975|p= 144}}</ref> Many of those so favored originated from the North China plain.<ref>{{harvp|Fairbank|1992|p= 81}}</ref> Through a process of eliminating or diminishing the power of the established aristocracy, whom she perceived as disloyal to her, and establishing a reformed upper class in China loyal to her, Wu Zetian made major social changes which are still being evaluated by historians.\n\n[[File:Maitreya-Tang Dynasty-side.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Maitreya]] statue from the reign of Wu Zetian]]\n\nWu Zetian used her power to increase or to attempt to increase her power by manipulating Buddhist, [[Daoist]], and Confucianist practice, sometimes in reference to the idea of the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. There are also allegations of witchcraft or sorcery. Wu began to manipulate the symbolic aspects of religious and imperial power long before she became ''huangdi'', one case being the Sacrifice on Mount Tai, in 666. When Emperor Gaozong offered sacrifices to the deities of heaven and earth at [[Mount Tai]], Empress Wu, in an unprecedented action, offered sacrifices after him, with Princess Dowager Yan, mother of Emperor Gaozong's brother [[Li Zhen (Tang dynasty)|Li Zhen]], Prince of Yue, offering sacrifices after her.<ref name=ZZTJ201 /> Wu Zetian's procession of ladies up Mount Tai conspicuously linked Wu with the most sacred traditional rites of the Chinese empire.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" />\n\nMany of Wu Zetian's measures were of a popular nature, and helped her to gain support for her rule. Wu Zetian came to power during a time in China in which the people were fairly contented, the administration was run well, and the economy was characterized by rising living standards.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" /> Wu Zetian, as far as the masses were for the most part concerned, continued in this manner. She was determined that free, self-sufficient farmers would continue to work on their own farm land, so she periodically used the [[Equal-field system|''juntian'', equal-field system]], together with updated census figures to ensure fair land allocations, re-allocating as necessary.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" /> Much of her success was due to her various edicts (including those known as her \"Acts of Grace\") which helped to satisfy the needs of the lower classes through various acts of relief, her widening recruitment to government service to include previously excluded gentry and commoners, and by her generous promotions and pay raises for the lower ranks.<ref name=\"Paludan, 100\" />\n\nWu Zetian used her military and diplomatic skills to enhance her position. The [[Fubing system|''fubing'' system]] of self-supportive soldier-farmer colonies, which provided local militia and labor services for her government, allowed her to maintain her armed forces at reduced expense.<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" /> She also pursued a policy of military action to expand the empire to its furthest extent ever up to that point in Central Asia. Expansion efforts against [[Tibet]] and to the northwest were less successful. Allying with the Korean kingdom of Silla [[Goguryeo\u2013Tang War|against Goguryeo]] with the promise of ceding Goguryeo's territory to Silla, Chinese forces [[Silla-Tang War|occupied Goguryeo]] after its defeat, and even began to occupy Silla territory. Silla resisted the imposition of Chinese rule, and by allying with Goguryeo and Baekche, was able to expel its former ally from the peninsula. Hong argues that Silla's success was in part due to a shift in Empress Wu's focus to Tibet and inadequate support for the forces in the Korean peninsula.{{sfn|Hong|2007|244\u201345}} Despite victories against Tibetans and Turks:<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|pp=96\u201397}}</ref> however, in 694, Wu's forces decisively defeated the Tibetan\u2013Western Turk alliance, and retook the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi]], lost in 668.<ref>{{harvp|Beckwith|2009|pp=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant event of Wu Zetian's reign was 651, shortly after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], when the first Arab ambassador arrived in China.<ref name=\"Paludan, 96\" />\n\n== Literature ==\n=== North Gate Scholars ===\nToward the end of Gaozong's life, Wu began engaging a number of mid-level officials who had literary talent, including Yuan Wanqing ({{lang|zh|\u5143\u842c\u9803}}), [[Liu Yizhi]], [[Fan L\u00fcbing]], Miao Chuke ({{lang|zh|\u82d7\u695a\u5ba2}}), Zhou Simao ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u601d\u8302}}), and Han Chubin ({{lang|zh|\u97d3\u695a\u8cd3}}), to write a number of works on her behalf, including the ''Biographies of Notable Women'' ({{lang|zh|\u5217\u5973\u50b3}}), ''Guidelines for Imperial Subjects'' ({{lang|zh|\u81e3\u8ecc}}), and ''New Teachings for Official Staff Members'' ({{lang|zh|\u767e\u50da\u65b0\u8aa1}}). Collectively, they became known as the \"North Gate Scholars\" ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u9580\u5b78\u58eb}}), because they served inside the palace, which was to the north of the imperial government buildings, and Empress Wu sought advice from them to divert the powers of the chancellors.<ref name=\"ZZTJ202\" />\n\n=== The \"Twelve Suggestions\" ===\nAround the new year 675, Empress Wu submitted twelve suggestions. One was that the work of [[Laozi]] (whose family name was Li and to whom the Tang imperial clan traced its ancestry), [[Tao Te Ching]], should be added to the required reading for imperial university students. Another was that a three-year mourning period should be observed for a mother's death in all cases, not only in those cases when the father was no longer alive.

She changed the name of the state to Zhou, claiming ancestry from the [[Zhou dynasty]], and took the throne as Empress Regnant (with the title of Empress Regnant Shengshen ({{lang|zh|\u8056\u795e\u7687\u5e1d}}), literally \"Divine and Sacred Emperor or Empress Regnant\"). Emperor Ruizong was deposed and made crown prince with the atypical title of ''Huangsi'' ({{lang|zh|\u7687\u55e3}}).<ref name=\"ZZTJ204\" /> This thus interrupted the Tang dynasty, and she became the first (and only) woman to reign over China as Empress Regnant.{{NoteTag|During Emperor Taizong's reign, a female agrarian rebel leader named [[Chen Shuozhen]] ({{lang|zh|\u9673\u78a9\u771e}}) had declared herself \"emperor\" with the title Emperor Wenjia ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u4f73\u7687\u5e1d}}), but as Chen was quickly defeated and killed, she is typically not considered a true \"emperor\".

Forty-six of Wu's poems are collected in the ''[[Quan Tangshi]]'' \"Collected Tang Poems\" and sixty-one essays under her name are recorded in the ''Quan Tangwen'' \"Collected Tang Essays\".<ref>{{Cite book |title = Women writers of traditional China: an anthology of poetry and criticism\n |authors = [[Kang-i Sun Chang]], [[Haun Saussy]], Charles Yim-tze Kwong\n |year = 1999\n |publisher = Stanford University Press\n |page = 31\n}}</ref> Although a lot of those writings serve political ends, there is one poem in which she laments her mother after she died and expresses her despair at not being able to see her again.\n\nDuring Wu Zetian's reign, the imperial court produced various works for which she was a sponsor, such as the anthology of the poetry of her court known as the ''[[Zhuying ji]]'' \"Collection of Precious Glories\", which contained poems by [[Cui Rong]], [[Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)|Li Jiao]], [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], and others, arranged according to the official rank at the court of the individuals included.<ref>{{harvp|Yu|2002|p= 56}}</ref> Among the literary developments that took place during the time of Wu Zetian (and partly at her court) was the final stylistic development of the \"new style\" poetry of the [[Regulated verse|regulated verse (''jintishi'')]], by the poetic pair [[Song Zhiwen]] and [[Shen Quanqi]].\n\nWu Zetian also engaged in patronage of scholars by founding an institute to produce the ''Collection of Biographies of Famous Women''.<ref name=\"Paludan, 99\" /> The development of what is considered to be characteristic [[Tang poetry]] is traditionally ascribed to [[Chen Zi'ang]],<ref>{{harvp|Watson|1971|p= 115}}</ref> one of Wu's ministers.\n\n=== Literary allusions ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n\nConsidering the events of her life, literary allusions to Wu Zetian may carry several connotations: a woman who has inappropriately overstepped her bounds, the [[hypocrisy]] of preaching [[compassion]] while simultaneously engaging in a pattern of [[political corruption]] and vicious behavior and ruling by pulling strings in the background. For many centuries, Wu was used by the establishment as an example of what can go wrong when a woman is placed in charge.\n\nSuch sexist opposition to her was only lifted during the late 1960s when [[Mao Zedong]]'s wife [[Jiang Qing]] rehabilitated Wu as part of a propaganda campaign to suggest she be considered as a successor to her ailing husband.\n\nIn his biography ''Wu'', British author [[Jonathan Clements]] has pointed out that these wildly differing uses of a historical figure often have led to schizophrenic and often hysterical characterizations. Many alleged poisonings and other incidents, such as the premature death of her daughter, may have rational explanations that have been twisted by later opponents.\n\n== Evaluation ==\n=== Quotes ===\nThe traditional Chinese historical view on Wu Zetian generally was mixed\u2014admiring her for her abilities in governing the state, but vilifying her for her actions in seizing imperial power. [[Luo Binwang]] even wrote along these lines in a declaration during her lifetime, in support of Li Jingye's rebellion. Typical was a commentary by the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin dynasty]] historian [[Liu Xu]], the lead editor of the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'':<ref>{{harvp|Old Book of Tang||loc= [[:zh:s:\u820a\u5510\u66f8/\u53776|vol. 6]]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The year that Lady Wu declared herself regent, heroic individuals were all mournful of the unfortunate turn of events, worried that the dynasty would fall, and concerned that they could not repay the grace of the deceased emperor [i.e., Emperor Gaozong] and protect his sons. Soon thereafter, great accusations arose, and many innocent people were falsely accused and stuck their necks out in waiting for execution. Heaven and earth became like a huge cage, and even if one could escape it, where could he go? That was lamentable. In the past, the trick of covering the nose{{NoteTag|This was a reference to a story relayed in the ''[[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]]''. In the story, it was mentioned that the king of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] gave a beautiful woman to [[King Huai of Chu]] as a gift, to be his concubine. King Huai's jealous wife Queen Zheng Xiu ({{lang|zh|\u912d\u8896}}) told her, \"The King loves you greatly, but dislikes your nose. If you cover your nose whenever you see him, you can ensure that he will continue to be loved by him. She accepted Queen Zheng's suggestion. When King Huai asked Queen Zheng, \"Why does she cover her nose when she sees me?\" Queen Zheng responded, \"She often said that Your Majesty had a stench to you.\" King Huai, in anger, yelled, \"Cut off her nose!\"}} surprised the realm in its poisonousness, and the disaster of the human pig{{NoteTag|This is a reference to the torture that [[Emperor Gao of Han]]'s wife [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] carried out against Emperor Gao's favorite concubine [[Consort Qi]] after Emperor Gao's death, once Empress L\u00fc became empress dowager\u2014by cutting her limbs off, blinding her, deafening her, and referring to her as the human pig ({{lang|zh|\u4eba\u5f58}}).}} caused the entire state to mourn. In order to take over as empress, Empress Wu strangled her own infant daughter; her willingness to crush her own flesh and blood showed how great her viciousness and vile nature was, although this is nothing more than what evil individuals and jealous women might do. However, she accepted the words of righteousness and honored the upright. Although she was like a hen that crowed, she eventually returned the rightful rule to her son. She quickly dispelled the accusation against Wei Yuanzhong, comforted Di Renjie with kind words, respected the will of the times and suppressed her favorites, and listened to honest words and ended the terror of the secret police officials. This was good, this was good.}}\n\nSome of the diversity in terms of points of agreement and even outright divergences in modern evaluations of Wu Zetian can be seen in the following quotes by modern non-Chinese authors:\n\n{{quote|\"Wu Zetian (690\u2013705) was an extraordinary woman, attractive, exceptionally gifted, politically astute and an excellent judge of men. With single minded determination, she overcame the opposition of the Confucian establishment through her own efforts, unique among palace women by not using her own family.\n\"Her rise to power was steeped in blood....\" [[Ann Paludan]]<ref>{{harvp|Paludan|1998|p= 98}}</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|\"To the horror of traditional Chinese historians, all members of the ''shih'' class, the continued success of the T'ang was in large measure due to an ex-concubine who finally usurped the throne itself....Though she was ruthless towards her enemies, the period of her ascendency was a good one for China. Government was sound, no rebellions occurred, abuses in the army and administration were stamped out and Korea was annexed, an achievement no previous Chinese had ever managed.\" Yong Yap Cotterell and Arthur Cotterell.<ref name=\"Cotterell and Cotterell, 144\" />}}\n\n{{quote|\"China's only woman ruler, Empress Wu was a remarkably skilled and able politician, but her murderous and illicit methods of maintaining power gave her a bad reputation among male bureaucrats. It also fostered overstaffing and many kinds of corruption.\" John King Fairbank<ref name=\"Fairbank, 82\" />}}\n\n=== Confucian viewpoints ===\nWu Zetian's rise and reign has been criticized harshly by [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucian]] historians, but has been viewed in a different and positive light after the 1950s.\n\nIn the early period of the Tang dynasty, because all the emperors were her direct descendants, the evaluation for Wu Zetian were relatively positive. Commentary in subsequent periods, however, especially the book ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' compiled by Sima Guang, criticized Wu Zetian harshly. By the period of Southern [[Song dynasty]], when [[Neo-Confucianism]] was firmly established as the mainstream political ideology of China, their ideology determined the evaluation for Wu Zetian.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Era names ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705): ''Convention: use personal name''\n|-\n!

It established the band's trademark sound with the [[single (music)|singles]] \"[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]\", which was influenced by [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and \"[[Faith (Limp Bizkit song)|Faith]]\", a cover of the song of the same name by [[George Michael]]. Limp Bizkit's rearrangement of the song incorporated heavier guitar playing by [[Wes Borland]] and [[turntablism|scratching]] by [[DJ Lethal]].\n\n''Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$'' was produced by [[Ross Robinson]], who was introduced to the band through [[Korn]] bassist [[Reginald Arvizu]], who persuaded Robinson to listen to Limp Bizkit's [[demo (music)|demo]]. Robinson was impressed by the band's motivation and sound, and agreed to work with them. The album showcased an intentionally abrasive, angry sound which the band felt would attract a fanbase.\n\n==Production==\n[[Wes Borland]] left Limp Bizkit preceding a successful performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood due to a disagreement with Fred Durst, Limp Bizkit signed with [[Mojo Records|Mojo]], a subsidiary of [[MCA Records]]. While heading to California to record their first album, the band wrecked their van, leading Durst to rehire Borland.<ref name=Devenish36/> After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with [[Flip Records (1994)|Flip]], a subsidiary of [[Interscope Records]].<ref name=Devenish36/>\n\n[[Reginald Arvizu]] of the band [[Korn]] persuaded [[Ross Robinson]] to listen to the band's demo, which consisted of the songs \"Pollution\", \"[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]\" and \"Stuck\". Robinson finally listened to the tape after it was praised by Robinson's girlfriend. Robinson was impressed by the band's motivation and sound, and produced their debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch.<ref name=Devenish36/> During the recording sessions, the band recorded an early version of their song \"I'm Broke\", but it was decided that the song didn't fit on this album. It was subsequently reworked and recorded for their followup, ''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=0-312-26349-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/89 89] |url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/89 }}</ref>\n\nContinuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, the band named the album by using part of the phrase \"queer as a three dollar bill\" and adding the word \"Y'all\" for Florida flavor, naming the album ''Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$''.<ref name=Devenish36>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/36 36\u201349] |url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/36 }}</ref>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Counterfeit.ogg\n|title=\"Counterfeit\"\n|description=\"[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]\", which appears on ''Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$', is noted for its \"kinetic, frenzied energy\" and a mix of music styles.\n|filename2=Nobody Loves Me.ogg\n|title2=\"Nobody Loves Me\"\n|description2=This breakdown from the song \"Nobody Loves Me\" was inspired by the  band [[Tool (band)|Tool]].

According to Borland, \"They saw this little thing we built [...] and they were like, 'Oh, let's get baggy pants and dress like kind of [[hip hop|hip-hoppy]] and, you know, play [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[rapping|rap]].'

However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming, as well as DJ scratching, impressed Robinson.<ref name=Devenish36/> Robinson also bonded with Borland, who Robinson perceived as not taking the band seriously.<ref name=Devenish36/> The [[alternative metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song \"Nobody Loves Me\", which contains a breakdown in which Durst copied the singing of [[Maynard James Keenan]] and the intro which has elements of ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' hidden track \"Disgustipated\".<ref name=Devenish36/>\n\nThe completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Borland later stated was part of Limp Bizkit's plan to get noticed. \"The best way to get our message across is through shock value.

It established the band's trademark sound with the [[single (music)|singles]] \"[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]\", which was influenced by [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and \"[[Faith (Limp Bizkit song)|Faith]]\", a cover of the song of the same name by [[George Michael]]. Limp Bizkit's rearrangement of the song incorporated heavier guitar playing by [[Wes Borland]] and [[turntablism|scratching]] by [[DJ Lethal]].\n\n''Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$'' was produced by [[Ross Robinson]], who was introduced to the band through [[Korn]] bassist [[Reginald Arvizu]], who persuaded Robinson to listen to Limp Bizkit's [[demo (music)|demo]]. Robinson was impressed by the band's motivation and sound, and agreed to work with them. The album showcased an intentionally abrasive, angry sound which the band felt would attract a fanbase.\n\n==Production==\n[[Wes Borland]] left Limp Bizkit preceding a successful performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood due to a disagreement with Fred Durst, Limp Bizkit signed with [[Mojo Records|Mojo]], a subsidiary of [[MCA Records]]. While heading to California to record their first album, the band wrecked their van, leading Durst to rehire Borland.<ref name=Devenish36/> After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with [[Flip Records (1994)|Flip]], a subsidiary of [[Interscope Records]].<ref name=Devenish36/>\n\n[[Reginald Arvizu]] of the band [[Korn]] persuaded [[Ross Robinson]] to listen to the band's demo, which consisted of the songs \"Pollution\", \"[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]\" and \"Stuck\". Robinson finally listened to the tape after it was praised by Robinson's girlfriend. Robinson was impressed by the band's motivation and sound, and produced their debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch.<ref name=Devenish36/> During the recording sessions, the band recorded an early version of their song \"I'm Broke\", but it was decided that the song didn't fit on this album. It was subsequently reworked and recorded for their followup, ''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=0-312-26349-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/89 89] |url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/89 }}</ref>\n\nContinuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, the band named the album by using part of the phrase \"queer as a three dollar bill\" and adding the word \"Y'all\" for Florida flavor, naming the album ''Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$''.<ref name=Devenish36>{{cite book |last1=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/36 36\u201349] |url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/36 }}</ref>\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Counterfeit.ogg\n|title=\"Counterfeit\"\n|description=\"[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]\", which appears on ''Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$', is noted for its \"kinetic, frenzied energy\" and a mix of music styles.\n|filename2=Nobody Loves Me.ogg\n|title2=\"Nobody Loves Me\"\n|description2=This breakdown from the song \"Nobody Loves Me\" was inspired by the  band [[Tool (band)|Tool]].

According to Borland, \"They saw this little thing we built [...] and they were like, 'Oh, let's get baggy pants and dress like kind of [[hip hop|hip-hoppy]] and, you know, play [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[rapping|rap]].' [...] five or six bands just popped up out of nowhere that became these, you know, groups that were trying to sound like us. It was ridiculous. That's where the song 'Counterfeit' came from.\"<ref name=Devenish36/>\n\n[[Fred Durst]]'s problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song \"Sour\".<ref name=Devenish36/> The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, \"Everything\".<ref name=Devenish36/> The recording of the album also allowed the band to showcase the addition of [[DJ Lethal]], and experimental guitar playing by Borland, who played without a [[guitar pick]], performing with right hand fingers.\nOn the song \"Stuck\", Borland used a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar.<ref name=HurwitzRiley/> Borland's playing on this album features octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound.<ref name=HurwitzRiley>{{cite book |last1=Hurwitz |first1=Tobias |authorlink1= |last2=Riley |first2=Glenn |title=7-String Guitar |date=June 1, 2002 |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |isbn=0-7390-2807-3 |pages=30\u20132 |chapter=Rhythm guitar riffs in the style of Wes Borland }}</ref> Borland also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes and hypnotic, droning [[Lick (music)|licks]] to create a disorienting effect.<ref name=HurwitzRiley/> \n\nDespite the success of live performances of the band's cover of [[George Michael]]'s song \"[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]\", Robinson was opposed to recording the cover, and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming, as well as DJ scratching, impressed Robinson.<ref name=Devenish36/> Robinson also bonded with Borland, who Robinson perceived as not taking the band seriously.<ref name=Devenish36/> The [[alternative metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song \"Nobody Loves Me\", which contains a breakdown in which Durst copied the singing of [[Maynard James Keenan]] and the intro which has elements of ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' hidden track \"Disgustipated\".<ref name=Devenish36/>\n\nThe completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Borland later stated was part of Limp Bizkit's plan to get noticed. \"The best way to get our message across is through shock value. That's what grabs people [...] getting people to react by showing something negative, hoping something positive will come out of it.
