Unlike the traditional NTO/MMH [[bipropellant]], the two propellant chemicals in MXP-351 are safer to handle because they are nontoxic. The bipropellant can also be stored at room temperatures, unlike liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The [[hypergolic propellant |hypergolic]] combination has an [[Specific impulse|ISP]] of 322 seconds. The storage life of MXP-351 before use is undergoing long term studies but is expected to be a few years.

Masten Space Systems will land these payloads on the Moon with its XL-1 lander.

The Machete rocket engines burn the nontoxic storable hypergolic propellant combination MXP-351. The first Machete had an experimental injector design that was used to test MXP-351 in 2016, producing a thrust of 225 lbf. {{asof|2017|3}}, Masten is modifying the design to make the engines additively-manufactured with regeneratively-cooled thrust chambers. Machete engines are being scaled up to produce 1000 lb thrust for a terrestrial test-bed version dubbed (XL-1T).<ref name=\"MXP-351_Blog_March_2017\"/>\n\n===MXP-351===\nMXP-351 is Masten Space's internal name for a self-igniting bipropellant combination invented to fuel its small lunar landers. Unlike the traditional NTO/MMH [[bipropellant]], the two propellant chemicals in MXP-351 are safer to handle because they are nontoxic. The bipropellant can also be stored at room temperatures, unlike liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The [[hypergolic propellant |hypergolic]] combination has an [[Specific impulse|ISP]] of 322 seconds. The storage life of MXP-351 before use is undergoing long term studies but is expected to be a few years. The reduced operation constraints may permit a reduction in recurring operating costs.<ref name=\"MXP-351_combo\"/><ref name=\"MXP-351_Blog_March_2017\"/><ref name=\"MXP-351_Blog_March_2017\"/><ref name=\"MXP-351_Isp\">{{cite web|title=Theoretical Isp:322s vs 336 for NTO Both propellants nontoxic.

them of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and addressing Orthodox Russia as the heir of the Soviet Communists, stating they were \"supporting the [[Nusayri]] regime\" and invading \"Muslim Syria\", stating the leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church were declaring a \"Crusade\" and telling them they will meet the fate of the Soviet Union and suffer \"a shameful defeat in the [[Levant]]\". The statement also addressed \"Our people in the Levant\", telling the able-bodied and those who are able to contribute to join the \"Jihad\" instead of emigrating. The statement also called for all factions against the government in Syria to unite. Further, addressing \"Arab and Muslim countries\", telling them that there is a \"real war against Sunnis and their countries and identity\" at the hands of the \"Western-Russian and [[Safavid]] and Nusayri alliance\", calling for the termination of all relations with Iran and Russia with Muslim countries and to \"protect the land and people of the Levant from the influence of the Persians and Russians\", especially calling upon Qatar, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia to support the Levant.<ref>{{cite

them of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and addressing Orthodox Russia as the heir of the Soviet Communists, stating they were \"supporting the [[Nusayri]] regime\" and invading \"Muslim Syria\", stating the leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church were declaring a \"Crusade\" and telling them they will meet the fate of the Soviet Union and suffer \"a shameful defeat in the [[Levant]]\". The statement also addressed \"Our people in the Levant\", telling the able-bodied and those who are able to contribute to join the \"Jihad\" instead of emigrating. The statement also called for all factions against the government in Syria to unite. Further, addressing \"Arab and Muslim countries\", telling them that there is a \"real war against Sunnis and their countries and identity\" at the hands of the \"Western-Russian and [[Safavid]] and Nusayri alliance\", calling for the termination of all relations with Iran and Russia with Muslim countries and to \"protect the land and people of the Levant from the influence of the Persians and Russians\", especially calling upon Qatar, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia to support the Levant.<ref>{{cite
