The islands are part of the [[island arc]] that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Cross section of mariana trench.svg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|The Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Mariana Plate, creating the Mariana trench, and (further on) the arc of the Mariana Islands, as water trapped in the plate is released and explodes upward to form island volcanoes and earthquakes .]]\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc|Izu-Bonin-Mariana]] [[subduction]] system that forms the [[convergent boundary|boundary]] between two [[tectonic plate]]s. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the [[Pacific Plate]], is [[subduction|subducted]] (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller [[Mariana Plate]] that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is, therefore, cooler and denser; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.\n\nThe movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the [[Mariana Islands]]. These volcanic islands are caused by [[flux melting]] of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] due to the release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.\n\n==Research history==\n[[File:Map00148 (28286522445).jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Ocean trenches in the western Pacific]]\n{{See also|Challenger Deep}}\nThe trench was first [[Depth sounding|sounded]] during the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of {{convert|4475|fathom|m ft|abbr=off|lk=in}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/ |title=About the Mariana Trench \u2013 DEEPSEA CHALLENGE Expedition |publisher=Deepseachallenge.com |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628083954/http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/ |archivedate=28 June 2013  }}</ref> In 1877, a map was published called ''Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans'' (\"Depth map of the Great Ocean\") by Petermann, which showed a ''Challenger Tief'' (\"Challenger deep\") at the location of that sounding.

The islands are part of the [[island arc]] that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Cross section of mariana trench.svg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|The Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Mariana Plate, creating the Mariana trench, and (further on) the arc of the Mariana Islands, as water trapped in the plate is released and explodes upward to form island volcanoes and earthquakes .]]\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc|Izu-Bonin-Mariana]] [[subduction]] system that forms the [[convergent boundary|boundary]] between two [[tectonic plate]]s. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the [[Pacific Plate]], is [[subduction|subducted]] (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller [[Mariana Plate]] that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is, therefore, cooler and denser; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.\n\nThe movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the [[Mariana Islands]]. These volcanic islands are caused by [[flux melting]] of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] due to the release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.\n\n==Research history==\n[[File:Map00148 (28286522445).jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Ocean trenches in the western Pacific]]\n{{See also|Challenger Deep}}\nThe trench was first [[Depth sounding|sounded]] during the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of {{convert|4475|fathom|m ft|abbr=off|lk=in}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/ |title=About the Mariana Trench \u2013 DEEPSEA CHALLENGE Expedition |publisher=Deepseachallenge.com |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628083954/http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/ |archivedate=28 June 2013  }}</ref> In 1877, a map was published called ''Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans'' (\"Depth map of the Great Ocean\") by Petermann, which showed a ''Challenger Tief'' (\"Challenger deep\") at the location of that sounding.

He had a role opposing president general [[Manuel Lisandro Barillas Berci\u00e1n]] (1885-1896), who eventually expelled Casanova y Estrada from Guatemala. After a generous amnesty granted by president general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] on 13 March 1897, the archbishop returned to Guatemala and was received by large crowds and joy.<ref name=macias241/>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n[[File:Cartacasanova1897.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Letter sent by archbishop Casanova to the Guatemalan faithful upon his return to his country on 19 March 1897.{{sfn|Mac\u00edas del Real|1897|p=243}}]]\n\nCasanova y Estrada was well educated, receiving private lessons with well-known Guatemalan writer and politician [[Jos\u00e9 Milla y Vidaurre]] during the 1860s; [[Ram\u00f3n Rosa]] - a Honduran liberal politician and ideologist&nbsp;\u2014 was his classmate in those lectures with Milla and described Casanova y Estrada as one of the most distinguished young men of both Guatemala and its neighboring republics, as well as the most educated priest in Central America.{{sfn|Rosa|15 de septiembre de 1896|p=83-84}} Casanova y Estrada later studied in the [[University of San Carlos of Guatemala|Pontifica Universidad de San Carlos Borromeo]] where he studied again with Milla y Vidaurre and also with former Columbian president Mariano Espina, who was exiled in [[Guatemala]].

In a pastoral message sent from [[San Jos\u00e9 (Costa Rica)|San Jos\u00e9]], on 29 June 1896 Casanova y Estrada pointed out that the Expo would allow the government to reach to great goals: that Central American get to know among themselves much better and that the area products would be showcased to the rest of the world.<ref name=boletin>{{harvnb|Gobierno de Guatemala|1 August 1896|pp=1\u20133}}</ref>  After almost 10 years in exile, and coinciding with the 75th Central America Independence anniversary, Casanova y Estrada.{{sfn|Ram\u00edrez Colom|1907|p=4}} Upon learnings about this, president Reina Barrios -who happened to be a high ranked Mason&nbsp;\u2014 realized the bishop's patriotism and presented an initiative to the National Assembly on its inaugural session of 1 March 1897 to allow his return to Guatemalan soil. On 13 March, Decree 351, allowing archbishop Casanova y Estrada to return to Guatemala, was approved.{{sfn|Ram\u00edrez Colom|1907|p=4}}\n\nThe archbishop returned to Guatemala on 19 March 1897, along with Juan Paz.

Even the agnostic writers of ''[[La Ilustraci\u00f3n Guatemalteca]]'', such as [[Antonio Mac\u00edas del Real|A. Mac\u00edas del Real]], congratulated the archbishop and could not deny the large support that the [[Catholic Church]] had in Guatemala at the time.<ref name=macias241/>\n\n=== Pneumonia attack in 1899 ===\n\nTrying to get up to date with his diocese affairs after returning from exile, Casanova y Estrada on 8 March 1899 decided to visit [[San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez]], [[Quich\u00e9 Department|Quich\u00e9]] and [[Solol\u00e1 Department|Solol\u00e1]].{{sfn|Ram\u00edrez Colom|1907|p=12}} After [[Holy Week]] celebrations on 3 April 1899, he suffered a sudden pneumonia attack; he fell severely ill and by 27 April his life was endangered.

There, he received medical attention, but around 11:00 pm on 13 April doctors realized there was no hope for him and he was given last rites.  He died at 2:00 am on 14 April 1913.{{sfn|Prado|1913|p=1}}\n\nAfter a few days while Casanova y Estrada's remains were transported back to Guatemala City and there were several ceremonies in his honor, he was buried in the Metropolitan Cathedral crypt, exactly below the [[Immaculate Conception]] altar, as he had wished.

It was founded in 1922, as the continuation of the [[Socialist Workers' Party (Chile)|Socialist Workers Party]], and in 1932 it established its youth wing, the [[Communist Youth of Chile]] (''Juventudes Comunistas de Chile'' [abbr:JJ.CC]).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:L.E.Recabarren.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], Communist Party of Chile leader and founder (1922 - 1924)]]\n[[Image:Luis Corvalan cropped portrait.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Luis Corval\u00e1n]], Secretary-General of the PCCh (1958-1990)]]\nIt achieved congressional representation shortly thereafter and played a leading role in the development of the Chilean labor movement. Closely tied to the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Third International]], the PCCh participated in the [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]] (''Frente Popular'') government of 1938, growing rapidly among the unionized working class in the 1940s. It then participated to the Popular Front's successor, the [[Democratic Alliance (Chile)|Democratic Alliance]].\n\nConcern over the PCCh's success at building a strong electoral base, combined with the onset of the [[Cold War]], led to its being outlawed in 1948 by a [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical government]], a status it had to endure for almost a decade until 1958 when it was again legalized. By the 1960s, the party had become a veritable political subculture, with its own symbols and organizations and the support of prominent artists and intellectuals such as [[Pablo Neruda]], the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning poet, and [[Violeta Parra]], the songwriter and folk artist.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/chile/102.htm Chile - The Parties of the Left<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\nAt the time, the [[U.S. State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 27,500.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Benjamin |first=Roger W. |last2=Kautsky |first2=John H. |title=Communism and Economic Development |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |volume=62 |issue=1 |year=1968 |pages=122 |jstor=1953329 }}</ref>\n\nIt later came to power along with the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] in the ''[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Unidad Popular]]'' (\"Popular Unity\") coalition in 1970. Within the broad Unidad Popular alliance, the communists sided with Allende, a relative moderate from the Socialist Party, and other more moderate forces of that coalition, supporting more gradual reforms and urging to find a compromise with the Christian Democrats. This line was opposed by more radically leftist factions of the Socialist Party and smaller far-left groups. The party was outlawed after the 1973 [[Chilean coup of 1973|coup d'\u00e9tat]] that deposed [[List of Presidents of Chile|President]] [[Salvador Allende]]. Much of the Communist leadership went underground, and for a while the party's moderation continued even after the coup had taken place. Also, it has been argued by [[Mark Ensalaco]] that crushing the Communist Party was not a top priority for the military junta.<ref name=\"Chile Under Pinochet, pg. 7\">{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Ensalaco |title=Chile Under Pinochet: Recovering the Truth |location= |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-8122-3520-7 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzrwMb3UppYC&pg=PA7 }}</ref> In its first statement after the coup, the party leadership still argued that the coup could succeed because the Unidad Popular was too isolated, due to actions of the 'far-left'. Around 1977, the party changed direction.<ref name=\"Chile Under Pinochet, pg. 7\" /> Communist Party members set up a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] organization, the [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Patriotic Front]]. With the restoration of democracy and the election of a new president in 1990, the Communist Party of Chile was legalized again.\n\nAs part of the Popular Unity coalition the PCCh advocated a broad alliance; however, it swung sharply to the left after the 1973 coup, regretting the failure to issue arms to the working class and pursuing an armed struggle against Pinochet's regime. Since the restoration of democracy it has acted independently of its previous partners. Between 1983 and 1987 it was a member of the [[People's Democratic Movement (Chile)|People's Democratic Movement]].\n\nIn the 1999/2000 presidential elections the party supported [[Gladys Mar\u00edn Millie]] for the national presidential elections. She won 3.2% of the vote in the first round.\nAt the [[2005 Chilean parliamentary election|2005 legislative election]], 11 December 2005, the party won 5.1% of the popular vote, but as a result of Chile's [[Proportional representation|binomial electoral]] rules, no seats. The small but significant support of the PCCh is believed to have aided in the electoral victories of former socialist president [[Ricardo Lagos]] in the 2000 elections, and in the more recent victory of Chile's first female president, the socialist [[Michelle Bachelet]] in January 2006, both of whom won in competitive second round runoffs.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, the PCCh was a member of \u201c[[New Majority (Chile)|New Majority]]\u201d ({{lang-es|Nueva Mayor\u00eda}}), a leftist coalition led by [[Michelle Bachelet]].\n\n==Leaders==\n{{Communist Parties}}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was founded in 1922, as the continuation of the [[Socialist Workers' Party (Chile)|Socialist Workers Party]], and in 1932 it established its youth wing, the [[Communist Youth of Chile]] (''Juventudes Comunistas de Chile'' [abbr:JJ.CC]).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:L.E.Recabarren.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], Communist Party of Chile leader and founder (1922 - 1924)]]\n[[Image:Luis Corvalan cropped portrait.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Luis Corval\u00e1n]], Secretary-General of the PCCh (1958-1990)]]\nIt achieved congressional representation shortly thereafter and played a leading role in the development of the Chilean labor movement. Closely tied to the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Third International]], the PCCh participated in the [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]] (''Frente Popular'') government of 1938, growing rapidly among the unionized working class in the 1940s. It then participated to the Popular Front's successor, the [[Democratic Alliance (Chile)|Democratic Alliance]].\n\nConcern over the PCCh's success at building a strong electoral base, combined with the onset of the [[Cold War]], led to its being outlawed in 1948 by a [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical government]], a status it had to endure for almost a decade until 1958 when it was again legalized. By the 1960s, the party had become a veritable political subculture, with its own symbols and organizations and the support of prominent artists and intellectuals such as [[Pablo Neruda]], the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning poet, and [[Violeta Parra]], the songwriter and folk artist.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/chile/102.htm Chile - The Parties of the Left<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\nAt the time, the [[U.S. State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 27,500.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Benjamin |first=Roger W. |last2=Kautsky |first2=John H. |title=Communism and Economic Development |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |volume=62 |issue=1 |year=1968 |pages=122 |jstor=1953329 }}</ref>\n\nIt later came to power along with the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] in the ''[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Unidad Popular]]'' (\"Popular Unity\") coalition in 1970. Within the broad Unidad Popular alliance, the communists sided with Allende, a relative moderate from the Socialist Party, and other more moderate forces of that coalition, supporting more gradual reforms and urging to find a compromise with the Christian Democrats. This line was opposed by more radically leftist factions of the Socialist Party and smaller far-left groups. The party was outlawed after the 1973 [[Chilean coup of 1973|coup d'\u00e9tat]] that deposed [[List of Presidents of Chile|President]] [[Salvador Allende]]. Much of the Communist leadership went underground, and for a while the party's moderation continued even after the coup had taken place. Also, it has been argued by [[Mark Ensalaco]] that crushing the Communist Party was not a top priority for the military junta.<ref name=\"Chile Under Pinochet, pg. 7\">{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Ensalaco |title=Chile Under Pinochet: Recovering the Truth |location= |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-8122-3520-7 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzrwMb3UppYC&pg=PA7 }}</ref> In its first statement after the coup, the party leadership still argued that the coup could succeed because the Unidad Popular was too isolated, due to actions of the 'far-left'. Around 1977, the party changed direction.<ref name=\"Chile Under Pinochet, pg. 7\" /> Communist Party members set up a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] organization, the [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Patriotic Front]]. With the restoration of democracy and the election of a new president in 1990, the Communist Party of Chile was legalized again.\n\nAs part of the Popular Unity coalition the PCCh advocated a broad alliance; however, it swung sharply to the left after the 1973 coup, regretting the failure to issue arms to the working class and pursuing an armed struggle against Pinochet's regime. Since the restoration of democracy it has acted independently of its previous partners. Between 1983 and 1987 it was a member of the [[People's Democratic Movement (Chile)|People's Democratic Movement]].\n\nIn the 1999/2000 presidential elections the party supported [[Gladys Mar\u00edn Millie]] for the national presidential elections. She won 3.2% of the vote in the first round.\nAt the [[2005 Chilean parliamentary election|2005 legislative election]], 11 December 2005, the party won 5.1% of the popular vote, but as a result of Chile's [[Proportional representation|binomial electoral]] rules, no seats. The small but significant support of the PCCh is believed to have aided in the electoral victories of former socialist president [[Ricardo Lagos]] in the 2000 elections, and in the more recent victory of Chile's first female president, the socialist [[Michelle Bachelet]] in January 2006, both of whom won in competitive second round runoffs.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, the PCCh was a member of \u201c[[New Majority (Chile)|New Majority]]\u201d ({{lang-es|Nueva Mayor\u00eda}}), a leftist coalition led by [[Michelle Bachelet]].\n\n==Leaders==\n{{Communist Parties}}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Unlike their modern scientific namesake in [[atomic theory]], philosophical atoms come in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes, each indestructible, immutable and surrounded by a void where they collide with the others or hook together forming a cluster.

Although the connection to historical atomism is at best tenuous, [[elementary particle]]s have become a modern analogue of philosophical atoms.\n\n==Reductionism==\nPhilosophical atomism is a [[reductionism|reductive]] argument, proposing not only that everything is composed of atoms and void, but that nothing they compose really exists: the only things that really exist are atoms ricocheting off each other [[mechanism (philosophy)| mechanistically]] in an otherwise empty [[Void (philosophy) |void]]. Atomism stands in contrast to a [[substance theory]] wherein a prime material continuum remains qualitatively invariant under division (for example, the ratio of the four [[classical elements]] would be the same in any portion of a homogeneous material).\n\n[[India]]n [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dharmakirti]]  ({{floruit}} {{circa}} 6th or 7th century) and others, developed distinctive theories of atomism, for example, involving momentary (instantaneous) atoms ([[Kalapa (atomism) |''kalapa'']]s) that flash in and out of existence.\n\n==Antiquity==\n\n===Greek atomism===\n\nIn the 5th century BCE, [[Leucippus]] and his pupil [[Democritus]] proposed that all matter was composed of small indivisible particles called atoms.<ref>''The atomists, Leucippus and Democritus: fragments, a text and translation with a commentary'' by C.C.W.

He believed all existence to be a single, all-encompassing and unchanging mass (a concept known as [[monism]]), and that change and motion were mere illusions. This conclusion, as well as the reasoning that led to it, may indeed seem baffling to the modern empirical mind, but Parmenides explicitly rejected sensory experience as the path to an understanding of the universe, and instead used purely abstract reasoning. Firstly, he believed there is no such thing as void, equating it with non-being (i.e. \"if the void '''''is''''', then it is not nothing; therefore it is not the void\"). This in turn meant that motion is impossible, because there is no void to move into.<ref name=\"From AtomosToAtom\">{{cite book|author=Andrew G. van Melsen|year=1952|title=From Atomos to Atom|isbn= 978-0486495842|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"History of Western Philosophy\">{{cite book|author=Bertrand Russel|year=1946|title=History of Western Philosophy|page=75|isbn=978-0415325059|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}</ref> He also wrote all that {{em|is}} must be an indivisible unity, for if it were manifold, then there would have to be a void that could divide it (and he did not believe the void exists).

He believed change was real, and if it was not then at least the illusion had to be explained. He thus supported the concept of void, and stated that the universe is made up of many Parmenidean entities that move around in the void.<ref name=\"From AtomosToAtom\"/> The void is infinite and provides the space in which the atoms can pack or scatter differently. The different possible packings and scatterings within the void make up the shifting outlines and bulk of the objects that organisms feel, see, eat, hear, smell, and taste. While organisms may feel hot or cold, hot and cold actually have no real existence. They are simply sensations produced in organisms by the different packings and scatterings of the atoms in the void that compose the object that organisms sense as being \"hot\" or \"cold\".\n\nThe work of Democritus only survives in secondhand reports, some of which are unreliable or conflicting. Much of the best evidence of Democritus' theory of atomism is reported by Aristotle in his discussions of Democritus' and Plato's contrasting views on the types of indivisibles composing the natural world.<ref>Berryman, Sylvia, \"Democritus\", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N.

He argued that atoms just crashing into other atoms could never produce the beauty and form of the world. In Plato's ''[[Timaeus (Plato)|Timaeus]]'' <small>(28b\u201329a)</small> the character of Timeaus insisted that the [[cosmos]] was not eternal but was created, although its creator framed it after an eternal, unchanging model.\n\nOne part of that creation were the four simple bodies of fire, air, water, and earth. But Plato did not consider these [[corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] to be the most basic level of reality, for in his view they were made up of an unchanging level of reality, which was mathematical. These simple bodies were [[Platonic solid|geometric solids]], the faces of which were, in turn, made up of triangles. The square faces of the cube were each made up of four [[Triangle#Types of triangle|isosceles right-angled triangles]] and the triangular faces of the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron were each made up of six right-angled triangles.\n\nHe postulated the geometric structure of the simple bodies of the four elements as summarized in the adjacent table. The cube, with its flat base and stability, was assigned to earth; the tetrahedron was assigned to fire because its penetrating points and sharp edges made it mobile. The points and edges of the octahedron and icosahedron were blunter and so these less mobile bodies were assigned to air and water. Since the simple bodies could be decomposed into triangles, and the triangles reassembled into atoms of different elements, Plato's model offered a plausible account of changes among the primary substances.<ref name=\"lloyd:early:74\">{{cite book\n| title = Early Greek Science: Thales to Aristotle\n| last = Lloyd\n| first = Geoffrey\n| authorlink = G.

Aristotle considered the existence of a void, which was required by atomic theories, to violate physical principles. Change took place not by the rearrangement of atoms to make new structures, but by [[hylomorphism|transformation of matter from what it was in potential to a new actuality]]. A piece of wet clay, when acted upon by a potter, takes on its potential to be an actual drinking mug. Aristotle has often been criticized for rejecting atomism, but in ancient Greece the atomic theories of Democritus remained \"pure speculations, incapable of being put to any experimental test. Granted that atomism was, in the long run, to prove far more fruitful than any qualitative theory of matter, in the short run the theory that Aristotle proposed must have seemed in some respects more promising\".<ref name=\"lloyd:aristotle\">{{cite book\n| title = Aristotle: The Growth and Structure of his Thought\n| url = https://archive.org/details/aristotlegrowths0000lloy\n| url-access = registration\n| last = Lloyd\n| first = Geoffrey\n| authorlink = G.

Unlike the atomism of Democritus, the Aristotelian \"natural minimum\" was not conceptualized as physically indivisible. \nInstead, the concept was rooted in Aristotle's [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] worldview, which held that every physical thing is a compound of matter (Greek ''hyle'') and an immaterial [[substantial form]] (Greek ''morphe'') that imparts its essential nature and structure. For instance, a rubber ball for a hylomorphist like Aristotle would be rubber (matter) structured by spherical shape (form).\nAristotle's intuition was that there is some smallest size beyond which matter could no longer be structured as flesh, or bone, or wood, or some other such organic substance that for Aristotle, living before the microscope, could be considered homogeneous. For instance, if flesh were divided beyond its natural minimum, what would be left might be a large amount of the element water, and smaller amounts of the other elements. But whatever water or other elements were left, they would no longer have the \"nature\" of flesh: in hylomorphic terms, they would no longer be matter structured by the form of flesh; instead the remaining water, e.g., would be matter structured by the form of water, not the form of flesh.\n\n====Later ancient atomism====\n\n[[Epicurus]] (341&ndash;270 BCE) studied atomism with [[Nausiphanes]] who had been a student of Democritus. Although Epicurus was certain of the existence of atoms and the void, he was less sure we could adequately explain specific natural phenomena such as earthquakes, lightning, comets, or the phases of the Moon (Lloyd 1973, 25&ndash;6). Few of Epicurus' writings survive and those that do reflect his interest in applying Democritus' theories to assist people in taking responsibility for themselves and for their own happiness\u2014since he held there are no gods around that can help them. He understood gods' role as moral ideals.\n\nHis ideas are also represented in the works of his follower [[Lucretius]], who wrote ''[[On the Nature of Things]]''. This scientific work in poetic form illustrates several segments of Epicurean theory on how the universe came into its current stage and it shows that the phenomena we perceive are actually composite forms. The atoms and the void are eternal and in constant motion. Atomic collisions create objects, which are still composed of the same eternal atoms whose motion for a while is incorporated into the created entity. Human sensations and meteorological phenomena are also explained by Lucretius in terms of atomic motion.\n\n====Atomism and ethics====\nSome later philosophers attributed the idea that man created gods and that gods did not create man to Democritus. For example, [[Sextus Empiricus]] noted:\n\n:Some people think that we arrived at the idea of gods from the remarkable things that happen in the world. Democritus ... says that the people of ancient times were frightened by happenings in the heavens such as thunder, lightning, ..., and thought that they were caused by gods.<ref name=\"taylor:\">{{cite book\n| title = The Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus: a text and translation with commentary by C.

However, Epicurus expressed a non-aggressive attitude characterized by his statement: \"The man who best knows how to meet external threats makes into one family all the creatures he can; and those he can not, he at any rate does not treat as aliens; and where he finds even this impossible, he avoids all dealings, and, so far as is advantageous, excludes them from his life.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20070407084128/http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html]\n\n===Indian atomism{{anchor|India}}=== \nIn [[ancient Indian philosophy]], preliminary instances of atomism are found in the works of [[Vedic]] sage [[Aruni]], who lived in the 8th century BCE, especially his proposition that \"particles too small to be seen mass together into the substances and objects of experience\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The shape of ancient thought : comparative studies in Greek and Indian philosophies|first=McEvilley|last=Thomas|date=2002|publisher=Allworth Press|isbn=1581152035|location=New York|oclc=48013687}}</ref> Later, the [[Charvaka]],<ref>{{cite book\n|last= Gangopadhyaya|first=Mrinalkanti\n|title= Indian Atomism: History and Sources\n|publisher= Humanities Press|year=1981\n|location= Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey\n|isbn= 978-0-391-02177-8\n|oclc= 10916778}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|last= Iannone |first= A.

According to ancient Buddhist atomism, which probably began developing before the 4th century BCE, there are four kinds of atoms, corresponding to the standard elements. Each of these elements has a specific property, such as solidity or motion, and performs a specific function in mixtures, such as providing support or causing growth. Like the Hindus, the Buddhists were able to integrate a theory of atomism with their theological presuppositions. Later Indian Buddhist philosophers, such as [[Dharmakirti]] and [[Dign\u0101ga]], considered atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy.\n\nSome of the canonical texts make reference to matter and atoms (called ''param\u0101\u1e47u'', a term already used in [[Yajnavalkya]], [[Lalita Sahasranama|Lalitha Sahasranama]] and [[Yoga Sutra]]), including ''[[Pancastikayasara]]'', ''[[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]]'' and ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]''.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The Jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms, except for souls.

Medieval Buddhist philosophers [[Dharmakirti]] and [[Dign\u0101ga]] considered atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. In discussing the two systems, [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] (1930) stresses their commonality, the postulate of \"absolute qualities\" (''guna-dharma'') underlying all empirical phenomena.<ref>\"The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... \"Everything is evanescent,\" ... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff ... Both systems [S\u0101nkhya and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of Existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called \"qualities\" (guna-dharma) in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality, ... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in S\u0101nkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called guna \"quality\", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive ... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called dharmas (\"qualities\").\"\nStcherbatsky (1962 [1930]). Vol. 1. p. 19.</ref>\n\nStill later, the [[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]], a text dated to the 11th or 12th century, postulates the existence of ''[[rupa-kalapa]]'', imagined as the smallest units of the physical world, of varying  [[Mah\u0101bh\u016bta#Buddhism|elementary]] composition.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1245/Abhidhammattha-sangaha Abhidhammattha-sangaha], Britannica Online (1998, 2005).</ref> Invisible under normal circumstances, the ''rupa-kalapa'' are said to become visible as a result of meditative [[samadhi]].<ref>Shankman, Richard (2008), The Experience of Samadhi: An In-depth Exploration of Buddhist Meditation, Shambhala, p. 178</ref>\n\n===Medieval Islam===\n{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy#Atomism|l1=Early Islamic philosophy: Atomism|Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam}}\n\nAtomistic philosophies are found very early in [[Islamic philosophy]] and was influenced by earlier Greek and to some extent Indian philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saeed|first=Abdullah|title=Islamic Thought: An Introduction|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415364096|page=95}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Islamic Civilization|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontois00savo_0/page/49 49]|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontois00savo_0|chapter-url-access=registration|quote=Islamic atomism indian greek.|author=Michael Marmura|editor=R. M. Savory|chapter=God and his creation:Two medieval Islamic views}}</ref> Like both the Greek and Indian versions, Islamic atomism was a charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious orthodoxy,{{citation needed|reason=Abu Bakr Baqallani was an early Atomist and a religious scholar|date=September 2014}} but it was instead more often favoured by orthodox [[Islamic theology|Islamic theologians]]. It was such a fertile and flexible idea that, as in Greece and India, it flourished in some leading schools of Islamic thought.\n\nThe most successful form of Islamic atomism was in the [[Asharite]] school of [[Islamic theology]], most notably in the work of the theologian [[al-Ghazali]] (1058&ndash;1111). In Asharite atomism, atoms are the only perpetual, material things in existence, and all else in the world is \"accidental\" meaning something that lasts for only an instant. Nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else, except perception, as it exists for a moment. Contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes, but are the direct result of God's constant intervention, without which nothing could happen. Thus nature is completely dependent on God, which meshes with other Asharite Islamic ideas on causation, or the lack thereof (Gardet 2001). Al-Ghazali also used the theory to support his theory of [[occasionalism]]. In a sense, the Asharite theory of atomism has far more in common with Indian atomism than it does with Greek atomism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Studies in Arabic versions of Greek texts and in mediaeval science|volume=2|author=Shlomo Pines|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1986|isbn=978-965-223-626-5|pages=355\u20136|author-link=Shlomo Pines}}</ref>\n\nOther traditions in Islam rejected the atomism of the Asharites and expounded on many Greek texts, especially those of Aristotle. An active school of philosophers in Al-Andalus, including the noted commentator [[Averroes]] (1126&ndash;1198 CE) explicitly rejected the thought of al-Ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of Aristotle. Averroes commented in detail on most of the works of Aristotle and his commentaries became [[Averroism|very influential]] in Jewish and Christian scholastic thought.\n\n===Medieval Christendom===\nWhile Aristotelian philosophy eclipsed the importance of the atomists in late Roman and medieval Europe, their work was still preserved and exposited through commentaries on the works of Aristotle. In the 2nd century, [[Galen]] (AD 129&ndash;216) presented extensive discussions of the Greek atomists, especially Epicurus, in his Aristotle commentaries. According to historian of atomism Joshua Gregory, there was no serious work done with atomism from the time of Galen until [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Descartes]] resurrected it in the 17th century; \"the gap between these two 'modern naturalists' and the ancient Atomists marked \"the exile of the atom\" and \"it is universally admitted that the Middle Ages had abandoned Atomism, and virtually lost it.\"\n\nHowever, although the ancient atomists' works were unavailable, Scholastic thinkers still had Aristotle's critiques of atomism. In [[medieval universities]] there were expressions of atomism. For example, in the 14th century [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] considered that matter, space, and time were all made up of indivisible atoms, points, and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms. The similarities of his ideas with those of [[al-Ghazali]] suggest that Nicholas may have been familiar with Ghazali's work, perhaps through [[Averroes]]' refutation of it (Marmara, 1973&ndash;74).\n\nAlthough the atomism of Epicurus had fallen out of favor in the centuries of [[Scholasticism]], the ''[[minima naturalia]]'' of [[Aristotelianism]] received extensive consideration. Speculation on ''minima naturalia'' provided philosophical background for the mechanistic philosophy of early modern thinkers such as Descartes, and for the alchemical works of [[Pseudo-Geber|Geber]] and [[Daniel Sennert]], who in turn influenced the [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscularian]] alchemist [[Robert Boyle]], one of the founders of modern chemistry.<ref name=\"Murdoch2001\">{{cite book|author=John Emery Murdoch|author2=Christoph Herbert L\u00fcthy |author3=William Royall Newman |title=Late Medieval and Early Modern Corpuscular Matter Theories|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wc97ODIpuH8C&pg=PA101|date=1 January 2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11516-3|pages=91\u2013133|chapter=The Medieval and Renaissance Tradition of Minima Naturalia}}</ref><ref name=\"Chalmers2009\">{{cite book|author=Alan Chalmers|title=The Scientist's Atom and the Philosopher's Stone: How Science Succeeded and Philosophy Failed to Gain Knowledge of Atoms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMsQyBVlkl4C&pg=PA76|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-2362-9|pages=75\u201396}}</ref>\n\nA chief theme in late Roman and Scholastic commentary on this concept is reconciling ''minima naturalia'' with the general Aristotelian principle of infinite divisibility. Commentators like [[John Philoponus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] reconciled these aspects of Aristotle's thought by distinguishing between mathematical and \"natural\" divisibility. With few exceptions, much of the curriculum in the universities of Europe was based on such Aristotelianism for most of the Middle Ages.<ref>Kargon 1966{{page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Atomist renaissance==\nIn the 17th century, a renewed interest arose in [[Epicurean]] atomism and [[corpuscularianism]] as a hybrid or an alternative to [[Aristotelian physics]]. The main figures in the rebirth of atomism were [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], and [[Robert Boyle]], as well as other notable figures.\n\nOne of the first groups of atomists in England was a cadre of amateur scientists known as the Northumberland circle, led by [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]] (1564&ndash;1632). Although they published little of account, they helped to disseminate atomistic ideas among the burgeoning scientific culture of England, and may have been particularly influential to [[Francis Bacon]], who became an atomist around 1605, though he later rejected some of the claims of atomism. Though they revived the classical form of atomism, this group was among the scientific avant-garde: the Northumberland circle contained nearly half of the confirmed Copernicans prior to 1610 (the year of Galileo's [[Sidereus Nuncius|''The Starry Messenger'']]). Other influential atomists of late 16th and early 17th centuries include [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] (who also changed his stance on atomism late in his career), and [[Thomas Hariot]]. A number of different atomistic theories were blossoming in France at this time, as well (Clericuzio 2000).\n\n[[Galileo Galilei]] (1564&ndash;1642) was an advocate of atomism in his 1612, ''Discourse on Floating Bodies'' (Redondi 1969). In ''[[The Assayer]]'', Galileo offered a more complete physical system based on a [[#Corpuscularianism|corpuscular]] theory of matter, in which all phenomena\u2014with the exception of sound\u2014are produced by \"matter in motion\". Galileo identified some basic problems with Aristotelian physics through his experiments. He utilized a theory of atomism as a partial replacement, but he was never unequivocally committed to it. For example, his experiments with falling bodies and inclined planes led him to the concepts of circular inertial motion and accelerating free-fall. The current Aristotelian theories of impetus and terrestrial motion were inadequate to explain these.  While atomism did not explain the [[law of fall]] either, it was a more promising framework in which to develop an explanation because motion was conserved in ancient atomism (unlike Aristotelian physics).\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' (1596&ndash;1650) [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation#Vortex|\"mechanical\" philosophy]] <!-- Descartes \u2260 [[mechanical philosophy]] per se --> of corpuscularism had much in common with atomism, and is considered, in some senses, to be a different version of it. Descartes thought everything physical in the universe to be made of tiny ''vortices'' of matter. Like the ancient atomists, Descartes claimed that sensations, such as taste or temperature, are caused by the shape and size of tiny pieces of matter. The main difference between atomism and Descartes' concept was the existence of the void. For him, there could be no vacuum, and all matter was constantly swirling to prevent a void as corpuscles moved through other matter. Another key distinction between Descartes' view and classical atomism is the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind/body duality]] of Descartes, which allowed for an independent realm of existence for thought, soul, and most importantly, God. Gassendi's concept was closer to classical atomism, but with no atheistic overtone.\n\n[[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592&ndash;1655) was a Catholic priest from France who was also an avid natural philosopher. He was particularly intrigued by the Greek atomists, so he set out to \"purify\" atomism from its heretical and atheistic philosophical conclusions (Dijksterhius 1969). Gassendi formulated his atomistic conception of [[mechanical philosophy]] partly in response to Descartes; he particularly opposed Descartes' reductionist view that only purely mechanical explanations of physics are valid, as well as the application of geometry to the whole of physics (Clericuzio 2000).\n\n[[Johann Chrysostom Magnenus]] ({{circa|1590|lk=no}} \u2013 {{circa|1679|lk=no}}) published his ''Democritus reviviscens'' in 1646. Magnenus was the first to arrive at a scientific estimate of the size of an \"atom\" (i.e. of what would today be called a [[molecule]]).\nMeasuring how much [[incense]] had to be burned before it could be smelled everywhere in a large church, he calculated the number of molecules in a grain of incense to be of the order 10<sup>18</sup>, only about one order of magnitude below the actual figure.<ref>Three Klaus Ruedenberg, W.

In this manner, for example, it was theorized that mercury could penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure, a step on the way towards transmutative production of gold. Corpuscularianism was associated by its leading proponents with the idea that some of the properties that objects appear to have are artifacts of the perceiving mind: 'secondary' qualities as distinguished from 'primary' qualities.<ref>[http://www.vernonpratt.com/conceptualisations/d06bl2_1mechanical.htm The Mechanical Philosophy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611053822/http://www.vernonpratt.com/conceptualisations/d06bl2_1mechanical.htm |date=June 11, 2008 }} - Early modern 'atomism' (\"corpuscularianism\" as it was known)</ref> Not all corpuscularianism made use of the primary-secondary quality distinction, however.

In [[The Sceptical Chymist]] (1661), Boyle demonstrates problems that arise from chemistry, and offers up atomism as a possible explanation.

This in turn led to further meetings at which the positivists again attacked the supposition that there were atoms. The matter was finally resolved in Dalton's favour in the early 20th century with the rise of [[atomic physics]].\n\n[[Atomic theory|Atoms and molecules]] had long been theorized as the constituents of matter, and [[Albert Einstein]] published [[\u00dcber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W\u00e4rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl\u00fcssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|a paper in 1905]] that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first big contributions to science. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist, and was further verified experimentally by [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean Perrin]] in 1908. Perrin was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1926 \"for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter\". The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Moral nihilism#Error theory]]\n* [[Eliminative materialism]]\n* [[Mereological nihilism]]\n* [[Becoming (philosophy)]]\n* [[History of chemistry]]\n* [[Infinite divisibility]]\n* [[Ontological pluralism]]\n* [[Physical ontology]]\n* [[Montonen\u2013Olive duality#Philosophical implications]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Clericuzio, Antonio.

He believed all existence to be a single, all-encompassing and unchanging mass (a concept known as [[monism]]), and that change and motion were mere illusions. This conclusion, as well as the reasoning that led to it, may indeed seem baffling to the modern empirical mind, but Parmenides explicitly rejected sensory experience as the path to an understanding of the universe, and instead used purely abstract reasoning. Firstly, he believed there is no such thing as void, equating it with non-being (i.e. \"if the void '''''is''''', then it is not nothing; therefore it is not the void\"). This in turn meant that motion is impossible, because there is no void to move into.<ref name=\"From AtomosToAtom\">{{cite book|author=Andrew G. van Melsen|year=1952|title=From Atomos to Atom|isbn= 978-0486495842|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"History of Western Philosophy\">{{cite book|author=Bertrand Russel|year=1946|title=History of Western Philosophy|page=75|isbn=978-0415325059|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}</ref> He also wrote all that ''is'' must be an indivisible unity, for if it were manifold, then there would have to be a void that could divide it (and he did not believe the void exists).

He believed change was real, and if it was not then at least the illusion had to be explained. He thus supported the concept of void, and stated that the universe is made up of many Parmenidean entities that move around in the void.<ref name=\"From AtomosToAtom\"/> The void is infinite and provides the space in which the atoms can pack or scatter differently. The different possible packings and scatterings within the void make up the shifting outlines and bulk of the objects that organisms feel, see, eat, hear, smell, and taste. While organisms may feel hot or cold, hot and cold actually have no real existence. They are simply sensations produced in organisms by the different packings and scatterings of the atoms in the void that compose the object that organisms sense as being \"hot\" or \"cold\".\n\nThe work of Democritus only survives in secondhand reports, some of which are unreliable or conflicting. Much of the best evidence of Democritus' theory of atomism is reported by Aristotle in his discussions of Democritus' and Plato's contrasting views on the types of indivisibles composing the natural world.<ref>Berryman, Sylvia, \"Democritus\", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N.

He argued that atoms just crashing into other atoms could never produce the beauty and form of the world. In Plato's ''[[Timaeus (Plato)|Timaeus]]'' <small>(28b\u201329a)</small> the character of Timeaus insisted that the [[cosmos]] was not eternal but was created, although its creator framed it after an eternal, unchanging model.\n\nOne part of that creation were the four simple bodies of fire, air, water, and earth. But Plato did not consider these [[corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] to be the most basic level of reality, for in his view they were made up of an unchanging level of reality, which was mathematical. These simple bodies were [[Platonic solid|geometric solids]], the faces of which were, in turn, made up of triangles. The square faces of the cube were each made up of four [[Triangle#Types of triangle|isosceles right-angled triangles]] and the triangular faces of the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron were each made up of six right-angled triangles.\n\nHe postulated the geometric structure of the simple bodies of the four elements as summarized in the adjacent table. The cube, with its flat base and stability, was assigned to earth; the tetrahedron was assigned to fire because its penetrating points and sharp edges made it mobile. The points and edges of the octahedron and icosahedron were blunter and so these less mobile bodies were assigned to air and water. Since the simple bodies could be decomposed into triangles, and the triangles reassembled into atoms of different elements, Plato's model offered a plausible account of changes among the primary substances.<ref name=\"lloyd:early:74\">{{cite book\n| title = Early Greek Science: Thales to Aristotle\n| last = Lloyd\n| first = Geoffrey\n| authorlink = G.

Aristotle considered the existence of a void, which was required by atomic theories, to violate physical principles. Change took place not by the rearrangement of atoms to make new structures, but by [[hylomorphism|transformation of matter from what it was in potential to a new actuality]]. A piece of wet clay, when acted upon by a potter, takes on its potential to be an actual drinking mug. Aristotle has often been criticized for rejecting atomism, but in ancient Greece the atomic theories of Democritus remained \"pure speculations, incapable of being put to any experimental test. Granted that atomism was, in the long run, to prove far more fruitful than any qualitative theory of matter, in the short run the theory that Aristotle proposed must have seemed in some respects more promising\".<ref name=\"lloyd:aristotle\">{{cite book\n| title = Aristotle: The Growth and Structure of his Thought\n| url = https://archive.org/details/aristotlegrowths0000lloy\n| url-access = registration\n| last = Lloyd\n| first = Geoffrey\n| authorlink = G.

Unlike the atomism of Democritus, the Aristotelian \"natural minimum\" was not conceptualized as physically indivisible. \nInstead, the concept was rooted in Aristotle's [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] worldview, which held that every physical thing is a compound of matter (Greek ''hyle'') and an immaterial [[substantial form]] (Greek ''morphe'') that imparts its essential nature and structure. For instance, a rubber ball for a hylomorphist like Aristotle would be rubber (matter) structured by spherical shape (form).\nAristotle's intuition was that there is some smallest size beyond which matter could no longer be structured as flesh, or bone, or wood, or some other such organic substance that for Aristotle, living before the microscope, could be considered homogeneous. For instance, if flesh were divided beyond its natural minimum, what would be left might be a large amount of the element water, and smaller amounts of the other elements. But whatever water or other elements were left, they would no longer have the \"nature\" of flesh: in hylomorphic terms, they would no longer be matter structured by the form of flesh; instead the remaining water, e.g., would be matter structured by the form of water, not the form of flesh.\n\n====Later ancient atomism====\n\n[[Epicurus]] (341&ndash;270 BCE) studied atomism with [[Nausiphanes]] who had been a student of Democritus. Although Epicurus was certain of the existence of atoms and the void, he was less sure we could adequately explain specific natural phenomena such as earthquakes, lightning, comets, or the phases of the Moon (Lloyd 1973, 25&ndash;6). Few of Epicurus' writings survive and those that do reflect his interest in applying Democritus' theories to assist people in taking responsibility for themselves and for their own happiness\u2014since he held there are no gods around that can help them. He understood gods' role as moral ideals.\n\nHis ideas are also represented in the works of his follower [[Lucretius]], who wrote ''[[On the Nature of Things]]''. This scientific work in poetic form illustrates several segments of Epicurean theory on how the universe came into its current stage and it shows that the phenomena we perceive are actually composite forms. The atoms and the void are eternal and in constant motion. Atomic collisions create objects, which are still composed of the same eternal atoms whose motion for a while is incorporated into the created entity. Human sensations and meteorological phenomena are also explained by Lucretius in terms of atomic motion.\n\n====Atomism and ethics====\nSome later philosophers attributed the idea that man created gods and that gods did not create man to Democritus. For example, [[Sextus Empiricus]] noted:\n\n:Some people think that we arrived at the idea of gods from the remarkable things that happen in the world. Democritus ... says that the people of ancient times were frightened by happenings in the heavens such as thunder, lightning, ..., and thought that they were caused by gods.<ref name=\"taylor:\">{{cite book\n| title = The Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus: a text and translation with commentary by C.

However, Epicurus expressed a non-aggressive attitude characterized by his statement: \"The man who best knows how to meet external threats makes into one family all the creatures he can; and those he can not, he at any rate does not treat as aliens; and where he finds even this impossible, he avoids all dealings, and, so far as is advantageous, excludes them from his life.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20070407084128/http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html]\n\n===Indian atomism{{anchor|India}}=== \nIn [[ancient Indian philosophy]], preliminary instances of atomism are found in the works of [[Vedic]] sage [[Aruni]], who lived in the 8th century BCE, especially his proposition that \"particles too small to be seen mass together into the substances and objects of experience\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The shape of ancient thought : comparative studies in Greek and Indian philosophies|first=McEvilley|last=Thomas|date=2002|publisher=Allworth Press|isbn=1581152035|location=New York|oclc=48013687}}</ref> Later, the [[Charvaka]],<ref>{{cite book\n|last= Gangopadhyaya|first=Mrinalkanti\n|title= Indian Atomism: History and Sources\n|publisher= Humanities Press|year=1981\n|location= Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey\n|isbn= 978-0-391-02177-8\n|oclc= 10916778}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|last= Iannone |first= A.

The Nyaya&ndash;Vaisesika atomists had elaborate theories of how atoms combine. In Vaisesika atomism, atoms first combine in pairs (dyads), and then group into trios of pairs (triads), which are the smallest visible units of matter.<ref>{{cite book | title = Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science | author = Teresi, Dick | publisher = Simon & Schuster |year=2003 | isbn = 978-0-7432-4379-7 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pheL_ubbXD0C&dq | pages = 213\u2013214}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] atomists had very qualitative, Aristotelian-style atomic theory. According to ancient Buddhist atomism, which probably began developing before the 4th century BCE, there are four kinds of atoms, corresponding to the standard elements. Each of these elements has a specific property, such as solidity or motion, and performs a specific function in mixtures, such as providing support or causing growth. Like the Hindus, the Buddhists were able to integrate a theory of atomism with their theological presuppositions.

Medieval Buddhist philosophers [[Dharmakirti]] and [[Dign\u0101ga]] considered atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. In discussing the two systems, [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] (1930) stresses their commonality, the postulate of \"absolute qualities\" (''guna-dharma'') underlying all empirical phenomena.<ref>\"The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... \"Everything is evanescent,\" ... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff ... Both systems [S\u0101nkhya and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of Existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called \"qualities\" (guna-dharma) in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality, ... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in S\u0101nkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called guna \"quality\", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive ... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called dharmas (\"qualities\").\"\nStcherbatsky (1962 [1930]). Vol. 1. p. 19.</ref>\n\nStill later, the [[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]], a text dated to the 11th or 12th century, postulates the existence of ''[[rupa-kalapa]]'', imagined as the smallest units of the physical world, of varying  [[Mah\u0101bh\u016bta#Buddhism|elementary]] composition.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1245/Abhidhammattha-sangaha Abhidhammattha-sangaha], Britannica Online (1998, 2005).</ref> Invisible under normal circumstances, the ''rupa-kalapa'' are said to become visible as a result of meditative [[samadhi]].<ref>Shankman, Richard (2008), The Experience of Samadhi: An In-depth Exploration of Buddhist Meditation, Shambhala, p. 178</ref>\n\n===Medieval Islam===\n{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy#Atomism|l1=Early Islamic philosophy: Atomism|Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam}}\n\nAtomistic philosophies are found very early in [[Islamic philosophy]] and was influenced by earlier Greek and to some extent Indian philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saeed|first=Abdullah|title=Islamic Thought: An Introduction|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415364096|page=95}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Islamic Civilization|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontois00savo_0/page/49 49]|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontois00savo_0|chapter-url-access=registration|quote=Islamic atomism indian greek.|author=Michael Marmura|editor=R. M. Savory|chapter=God and his creation:Two medieval Islamic views}}</ref> Like both the Greek and Indian versions, Islamic atomism was a charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious orthodoxy,{{citation needed|reason=Abu Bakr Baqallani was an early Atomist and a religious scholar|date=September 2014}} but it was instead more often favoured by orthodox [[Islamic theology|Islamic theologians]]. It was such a fertile and flexible idea that, as in Greece and India, it flourished in some leading schools of Islamic thought.\n\nThe most successful form of Islamic atomism was in the [[Asharite]] school of [[Islamic theology]], most notably in the work of the theologian [[al-Ghazali]] (1058&ndash;1111). In Asharite atomism, atoms are the only perpetual, material things in existence, and all else in the world is \"accidental\" meaning something that lasts for only an instant. Nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else, except perception, as it exists for a moment. Contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes, but are the direct result of God's constant intervention, without which nothing could happen. Thus nature is completely dependent on God, which meshes with other Asharite Islamic ideas on causation, or the lack thereof (Gardet 2001). Al-Ghazali also used the theory to support his theory of [[occasionalism]]. In a sense, the Asharite theory of atomism has far more in common with Indian atomism than it does with Greek atomism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Studies in Arabic versions of Greek texts and in mediaeval science|volume=2|author=Shlomo Pines|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1986|isbn=978-965-223-626-5|pages=355\u20136|author-link=Shlomo Pines}}</ref>\n\nOther traditions in Islam rejected the atomism of the Asharites and expounded on many Greek texts, especially those of Aristotle. An active school of philosophers in Al-Andalus, including the noted commentator [[Averroes]] (1126&ndash;1198 CE) explicitly rejected the thought of al-Ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of Aristotle. Averroes commented in detail on most of the works of Aristotle and his commentaries became [[Averroism|very influential]] in Jewish and Christian scholastic thought.\n\n===Medieval Christendom===\nWhile Aristotelian philosophy eclipsed the importance of the atomists in late Roman and medieval Europe, their work was still preserved and exposited through commentaries on the works of Aristotle. In the 2nd century, [[Galen]] (AD 129&ndash;216) presented extensive discussions of the Greek atomists, especially Epicurus, in his Aristotle commentaries. According to historian of atomism Joshua Gregory, there was no serious work done with atomism from the time of Galen until [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Descartes]] resurrected it in the 17th century; \"the gap between these two 'modern naturalists' and the ancient Atomists marked \"the exile of the atom\" and \"it is universally admitted that the Middle Ages had abandoned Atomism, and virtually lost it.\"\n\nHowever, although the ancient atomists' works were unavailable, Scholastic thinkers still had Aristotle's critiques of atomism. In [[medieval universities]] there were expressions of atomism. For example, in the 14th century [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] considered that matter, space, and time were all made up of indivisible atoms, points, and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms. The similarities of his ideas with those of [[al-Ghazali]] suggest that Nicholas may have been familiar with Ghazali's work, perhaps through [[Averroes]]' refutation of it (Marmara, 1973&ndash;74).\n\nAlthough the atomism of Epicurus had fallen out of favor in the centuries of [[Scholasticism]], the ''[[minima naturalia]]'' of [[Aristotelianism]] received extensive consideration. Speculation on ''minima naturalia'' provided philosophical background for the mechanistic philosophy of early modern thinkers such as Descartes, and for the alchemical works of [[Pseudo-Geber|Geber]] and [[Daniel Sennert]], who in turn influenced the [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscularian]] alchemist [[Robert Boyle]], one of the founders of modern chemistry.<ref name=\"Murdoch2001\">{{cite book|author=John Emery Murdoch|author2=Christoph Herbert L\u00fcthy |author3=William Royall Newman |title=Late Medieval and Early Modern Corpuscular Matter Theories|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wc97ODIpuH8C&pg=PA101|date=1 January 2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11516-3|pages=91\u2013133|chapter=The Medieval and Renaissance Tradition of Minima Naturalia}}</ref><ref name=\"Chalmers2009\">{{cite book|author=Alan Chalmers|title=The Scientist's Atom and the Philosopher's Stone: How Science Succeeded and Philosophy Failed to Gain Knowledge of Atoms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMsQyBVlkl4C&pg=PA76|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-2362-9|pages=75\u201396}}</ref>\n\nA chief theme in late Roman and Scholastic commentary on this concept is reconciling ''minima naturalia'' with the general Aristotelian principle of infinite divisibility. Commentators like [[John Philoponus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] reconciled these aspects of Aristotle's thought by distinguishing between mathematical and \"natural\" divisibility. With few exceptions, much of the curriculum in the universities of Europe was based on such Aristotelianism for most of the Middle Ages.<ref>Kargon 1966{{page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Atomist renaissance==\nIn the 17th century, a renewed interest arose in [[Epicurean]] atomism and [[corpuscularianism]] as a hybrid or an alternative to [[Aristotelian physics]]. The main figures in the rebirth of atomism were [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], and [[Robert Boyle]], as well as other notable figures.\n\nOne of the first groups of atomists in England was a cadre of amateur scientists known as the Northumberland circle, led by [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]] (1564&ndash;1632). Although they published little of account, they helped to disseminate atomistic ideas among the burgeoning scientific culture of England, and may have been particularly influential to [[Francis Bacon]], who became an atomist around 1605, though he later rejected some of the claims of atomism. Though they revived the classical form of atomism, this group was among the scientific avant-garde: the Northumberland circle contained nearly half of the confirmed Copernicans prior to 1610 (the year of Galileo's [[Sidereus Nuncius|''The Starry Messenger'']]). Other influential atomists of late 16th and early 17th centuries include [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] (who also changed his stance on atomism late in his career), and [[Thomas Hariot]]. A number of different atomistic theories were blossoming in France at this time, as well (Clericuzio 2000).\n\n[[Galileo Galilei]] (1564&ndash;1642) was an advocate of atomism in his 1612, ''Discourse on Floating Bodies'' (Redondi 1969). In ''[[The Assayer]]'', Galileo offered a more complete physical system based on a [[#Corpuscularianism|corpuscular]] theory of matter, in which all phenomena\u2014with the exception of sound\u2014are produced by \"matter in motion\". Galileo identified some basic problems with Aristotelian physics through his experiments. He utilized a theory of atomism as a partial replacement, but he was never unequivocally committed to it. For example, his experiments with falling bodies and inclined planes led him to the concepts of circular inertial motion and accelerating free-fall. The current Aristotelian theories of impetus and terrestrial motion were inadequate to explain these.  While atomism did not explain the [[law of fall]] either, it was a more promising framework in which to develop an explanation because motion was conserved in ancient atomism (unlike Aristotelian physics).\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' (1596&ndash;1650) [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation#Vortex|\"mechanical\" philosophy]] <!-- Descartes \u2260 [[mechanical philosophy]] per se --> of corpuscularism had much in common with atomism, and is considered, in some senses, to be a different version of it. Descartes thought everything physical in the universe to be made of tiny ''vortices'' of matter. Like the ancient atomists, Descartes claimed that sensations, such as taste or temperature, are caused by the shape and size of tiny pieces of matter. The main difference between atomism and Descartes' concept was the existence of the void. For him, there could be no vacuum, and all matter was constantly swirling to prevent a void as corpuscles moved through other matter. Another key distinction between Descartes' view and classical atomism is the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind/body duality]] of Descartes, which allowed for an independent realm of existence for thought, soul, and most importantly, God. Gassendi's concept was closer to classical atomism, but with no atheistic overtone.\n\n[[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592&ndash;1655) was a Catholic priest from France who was also an avid natural philosopher. He was particularly intrigued by the Greek atomists, so he set out to \"purify\" atomism from its heretical and atheistic philosophical conclusions (Dijksterhius 1969). Gassendi formulated his atomistic conception of [[mechanical philosophy]] partly in response to Descartes; he particularly opposed Descartes' reductionist view that only purely mechanical explanations of physics are valid, as well as the application of geometry to the whole of physics (Clericuzio 2000).\n\n[[Johann Chrysostom Magnenus]] (c. 1590 &ndash; c. 1679) published his ''Democritus reviviscens'' in 1646. Magnenus was the first to arrive at a scientific estimate of the size of an \"atom\" (i.e. of what would today be called a [[molecule]]).\nMeasuring how much [[incense]] had to be burned before it could be smelled everywhere in a large church, he calculated the number of molecules in a grain of incense to be of the order 10<sup>18</sup>, only about one order of magnitude below the actual figure.<ref>Three Klaus Ruedenberg, W.

In this manner, for example, it was theorized that mercury could penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure, a step on the way towards transmutative production of gold. Corpuscularianism was associated by its leading proponents with the idea that some of the properties that objects appear to have are artifacts of the perceiving mind: 'secondary' qualities as distinguished from 'primary' qualities.<ref>[http://www.vernonpratt.com/conceptualisations/d06bl2_1mechanical.htm The Mechanical Philosophy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611053822/http://www.vernonpratt.com/conceptualisations/d06bl2_1mechanical.htm |date=June 11, 2008 }} - Early modern 'atomism' (\"corpuscularianism\" as it was known)</ref> Not all corpuscularianism made use of the primary-secondary quality distinction, however. An influential tradition in medieval and early modern alchemy argued that chemical analysis revealed the existence of robust corpuscles that retained their identity in chemical compounds (to use the modern term). [[William R.

In [[The Sceptical Chymist]] (1661), Boyle demonstrates problems that arise from chemistry, and offers up atomism as a possible explanation. The unifying principle that would eventually lead to the acceptance of a hybrid corpuscular\u2013atomism was [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]], which became widely accepted by [[physical sciences]]. <!-- ~~ With Boyle? for sure by the end of the 18th... cite?

This in turn led to further meetings at which the positivists again attacked the supposition that there were atoms. The matter was finally resolved in Dalton's favour in the early 20th century with the rise of [[atomic physics]].\n\n[[Atomic theory|Atoms and molecules]] had long been theorized as the constituents of matter, and [[Albert Einstein]] published [[\u00dcber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W\u00e4rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl\u00fcssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|a paper in 1905]] that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first big contributions to science. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist, and was further verified experimentally by [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean Perrin]] in 1908. Perrin was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1926 \"for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter\". The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Moral nihilism#Error theory]]\n* [[Eliminative materialism]]\n* [[Mereological nihilism]]\n* [[Becoming (philosophy)]]\n* [[History of chemistry]]\n* [[Infinite divisibility]]\n* [[Ontological pluralism]]\n* [[Physical ontology]]\n* [[Montonen\u2013Olive duality#Philosophical implications]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Clericuzio, Antonio.
