It was so-named because it was near Westlake Park, now known as [[MacArthur Park]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> At the time, the school was a for-profit alternative to the already-established [[Marlborough School (Los Angeles)|Marlborough School]], which had been established as a non-profit before the turn of the century.\n\nIt moved to its present-day campus located on North Faring Road in [[Holmby Hills]], California, in 1927.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The school was purchased by Sydney Temple, whose daughter, Helen Temple Dickinson, was headmistress until 1966, when Westlake became a non-profit institution.  The Temple family owned the school until 1977, with Dickinson serving in an [[ex officio]] capacity.

{"title_page": "Ceiling fan", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=May 2015}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}\n}} \n{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:The Black Beauty.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A modern ceiling fan]]\nA '''ceiling fan''' is a [[mechanical fan]] mounted on the ceiling of a room or space, usually [[electric power|electrically powered]], suspended from the [[ceiling]] of a room, that uses hub-mounted [[rotation|rotating]] blades to [[wikt:circulation|circulate]] air. They cool people effectively by introducing slow movement into the otherwise still, hot air of a room. Fans do not reduce air temperature, unlike air-conditioning equipment but create a [[wind chill]] effect by evaporating sweat in the summer. In fact they heat up the air slightly due to the waste heat from the motor and friction between the moving air. Fans use significantly less power than air conditioning as cooling air is [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] expensive. Conversely, a ceiling fan can also be used to reduce the [[:wikt:stratification|stratification]] of warm air in a room by forcing it down to affect both occupants' sensations and thermostat readings, thereby improving [[climate control]] [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].\n\n==History==\nPunkah-type ceiling fans date back to 500 BC, and are native to [[India]]. Unlike modern rotary fans, these punkah fans move air by moving to and from, and were operated manually by cord.<ref> {{cite web |url= http://navrangindia.blogspot.hk/2015/10/punkah-hand-operated-hanging-fan.html?m=1 |title= Punkah. hand-operated hanging fan. a colonial legacy |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}} </ref>\n\nThe first rotary ceiling fans appeared in the early 1860s and 1870s in the [[United States]]. At that time, they were not powered by any form of [[electric motor]]. Instead, a stream of running [[water]] was used, in conjunction with a [[turbine]], to drive a system of belts which would turn the blades of two-blade fan units. These systems could accommodate several fan units, and so became popular in stores, [[restaurant]]s, and offices. Some of these systems survive today, and can be seen in parts of the [[southern United States]] where they originally proved useful.\n\nThe electrically powered ceiling fan was invented in 1882 by [[Philip Diehl (inventor)|Philip Diehl]]. He had engineered the electric motor used in the first electrically powered Singer [[sewing machine]]s, and in 1882 he adapted that motor for use in a ceiling-mounted fan. Each fan had its own self-contained motor unit, with no need for [[belt drive]].<ref name=\"fanbook\">{{cite book |last= Scharff |first= Robert |author2= Casablanca Fan Co. |title= The Fan Book |year= 1983 |publisher= Reston Publishing |location= Reston, VA |isbn= 0-8359-1855-6 |page= [https://archive.org/details/fanbook0000robe/page/128 128] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/fanbook0000robe/page/128 }}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately he faced fierce competition due to the commercial success of the ceiling fan. He continued to make improvements to his invention and created a light kit fitted to the ceiling fan to combine both functions in one unit. By [[World War I]] most ceiling fans were made with four blades instead of the original two, which made fans quieter and allowed them to circulate more air. The early turn-of-the-century companies who successfully commercialized the sale of ceiling fans in the United States were what is today known as the Hunter Fan Company, Robbins & Myers, Century Electric, Westinghouse Corporation and Emerson Electric.\n\nBy the 1920s, ceiling fans were commonplace in the United States, and had started to take hold internationally. From the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, until the introduction of electric air conditioning in the 1950s, ceiling fans slowly faded out of vogue in the U.S.,<ref name=\"fanbook\"/> almost falling into total disuse in the U.S. by the 1960s; those that remained were considered items of nostalgia.\n\n[[File:Late 80s Usha Prima.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Late '80s Usha Prima, one of the most common ceiling fans in India]]\nMeanwhile, electric ceiling fans became very popular in other countries, particularly those with hot climates, such as [[India]] and the [[Middle East]], where a lack of infrastructure and/or financial resources made energy-hungry and complex freon-based [[air conditioning]] equipment impractical. In 1973, Texas entrepreneur H. W. (Hub) Markwardt began importing ceiling fans into the [[United States]] that were manufactured in [[India]] by [[Crompton Greaves]], Ltd. Crompton Greaves had been manufacturing ceiling fans since 1937 through a joint venture formed by [[Greaves Cotton]] of India and [[Crompton Parkinson]] of [[England]]. These Indian manufactured ceiling fans caught on slowly at first, but Markwardt's Encon Industries branded ceiling fans (which stood for ENergy CONservation) eventually found great success during the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, since they consumed less energy than the antiquated shaded pole motors used in most other American made fans. The fans became energy saving appliances for residential and commercial use by supplementing expensive air conditioning with a cooling wind-chill effect. Fans used for comfort create a wind chill by increasing the [[heat transfer coefficient]], but do not lower temperatures directly.\n\n[[File:Casablanca Delta ceiling fan.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Casablanca Fan Co.]] \"Delta\" ceiling fan from the early 1980s.]]\nDue to this renewed commercial success using ceiling fans effectively as an energy conservation application, many American manufacturers also started to produce, or significantly increase production of, ceiling fans. In addition to the imported Encon ceiling fans, the [[Casablanca Fan Company]] was founded in 1974. Other American manufacturers of the time included the Hunter Fan Co. (which was then a division of Robbins & Myers, Inc), FASCO (F. A. Smith Co.), and [[Emerson Electric]]; which was often branded as [[Sears-Roebuck]].\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, ceiling fans remained popular in the United States. Many small American importers, most of them rather short-lived, started importing ceiling fans. Throughout the 1980s, the balance of sales between American-made ceiling fans and those imported from manufacturers in [[India]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and eventually [[China]] changed dramatically with imported fans taking the lion's share of the market by the late 1980s. Even the most basic U.S-made fans sold for $200 to $500, while the most expensive imported fans rarely exceeded $150.\n\nSince 2000, important inroads have been made by companies such as Monte Carlo, Minka Aire, Quorum, Craftmade, Litex and Fanimation - offering higher price ceiling fans with more decorative value. In 2001, Washington Post writer Patricia Dane Rogers<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite news |last= Dane Roger |first= Patricia |title= Eye on Design |work= The Washington Post |date= June 14, 2001 |page=H5}}</ref> wrote, \u201cLike so many other mundane household objects, these old standbys are going high-style and high-tech.\u201d\n\n==Uses==\nUnlike air conditioners, fans only move air\u2014they do not directly change its temperature. Therefore, ceiling fans that have a mechanism for reversing the direction in which the blades push air (most commonly an electrical switch on the unit's switch housing, motor housing, or lower canopy) can help in both heating and cooling.\n\nWhile ceiling fan manufacturers (mainly Emerson) have had electrically reversible motors in production since the 1930s, most fans made before the mid-1970s are either not reversible at all or mechanically reversible (have adjustable blade pitch) instead of an electrically reversible motor. In this case, the blades should be pitched to the right (or left if the motor spins clockwise) for downdraft, and to the opposite side for updraft. Hunter's \"Adaptair\" mechanism is perhaps the most well-known example of mechanical reversibility. In very rare cases, fans are both mechanically and electrically reversible, allowing for the fan to push air in either direction, while rotating either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nFor cooling, the fan's direction of rotation should be set so that air is blown downward (Usually counter-clockwise from beneath). The blades should lead with the upturned edge as they spin. The breeze created by a ceiling fan creates a [[wind chill effect]], speeding the evaporation of perspiration on human skin, which makes the body's natural cooling mechanism much more efficient. Since the fan works directly on the body, rather than by changing the temperature of the air, it is a waste of electricity to leave a ceiling fan on when no one is in a room unless air conditioning is in operation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nFor heating, ceiling fans should usually be set to turn the opposite direction (usually clockwise; the blades should spin with the downward turned edge leading). Air naturally stratifies\u2014that is, warmer air rises to the ceiling while cooler air sinks, meaning that colder air settles near the floor where people spend most of their time. A ceiling fan, with its direction of rotation set so that air is drawn upward, pulls the colder air off the floor, forcing the warmer air nearer the ceiling to move down to take its place, without blowing a stream of air directly at the occupants of the room. This action works to even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler nearer the ceiling, but warmer nearer the floor. Thus the thermostat in the area can be set a few degrees lower to save energy, while maintaining the same level of comfort.\n\nThe most commonplace use of ceiling fans today is in conjunction with an air conditioning unit. Without an operating ceiling fan, air conditioning units typically have both the tasks of cooling the air inside the room and circulating it. Provided the ceiling fan is properly sized for the room in which it is operating, its efficiency of moving air far exceeds that of an air conditioning unit, therefore, for peak efficiency, the air conditioner should be set to a low fan setting and the ceiling fan should be used to circulate the air.\n\n==Parts of a ceiling fan==\nThe key components of a ceiling fan are the following:\n* An [[electric motor]]\n* Blades (also known as paddles or wings) usually made from solid wood, plywood, steel, aluminium, MDF or plastic\n* Blade irons (also known as blade brackets, blade arms, blade holders, or flanges), which hold the blades and connect them to the motor.\n* Flywheel, a metal, plastic or tough rubber double-torus which is attached to the motor shaft, and to which the blade irons may be attached. The flywheel inner ring is locked to the shaft by a lock-screw, and the blade irons to the outer ring by screws or bolts that feed into tapped metal inserts. Rubber or plastic flywheels may become brittle and break, a common cause of fan failure. Replacing the flywheel may require disconnecting wiring and requires removing the switch housing that's on the way for the flywheel to be removed and replaced.\n* Rotor, alternative to blade irons. First patented by industrial designer [[Ron Rezek]] in 1991, the one-piece die cast rotor receives and secures the blades and bolts right to the motor, eliminating most balance problems and minimizing exposed fasteners.\n* A mechanism for mounting the fan to the ceiling such as:\n** Ball-and-socket system. With this system, there is a metal or plastic hemisphere mounted on the end of the downrod; this hemisphere rests in a ceiling-mounted metal bracket, or self-supporting canopy, and allows the fan to move freely (which is very useful on vaulted ceilings).\n** J-hook. A type of mounting system where the ceiling fan hangs on a hardened metal hook, screwed into the ceiling or bolted through a steel I-beam. A porcelain or rubber grommet is used to keep the fan in place. This type of mounting is most common on antique ceiling fans and ceiling fans made for industrial use. A variation of this system using a U-bracket secured to the ceiling by means of lag bolts is often used on heavy-duty ceiling fans with electrically reversible motors in order to reduce the risk of the fan unscrewing itself from the ceiling while running in updraft.\n** Some fans can be mounted using a low-ceiling adapter, a special kit which must be purchased from the fan's manufacturer. This eliminates the need for a downrod, and is therefore useful in rooms with low ceiling clearance.\n** In recent years, it has become increasingly common for a ball-and-socket fan to be designed such that the canopy (ceiling cover piece) can optionally be screwed directly into the top of the motor housing; then the whole fan can be secured directly onto the ceiling mounting bracket. This is often referred to as a dual-mount or tri-mount.\n\nOther components, which vary by model and style, can include:\n* A downrod, a metal pipe used to suspend the fan from the ceiling. Downrods come in many lengths and widths, depending on the fan type.\n* A decorative encasement for the motor (known as the \"motor housing\").\n* A switch housing (also known as a \"switch cup\" or \"nose column\"), a metal or plastic cylinder mounted below and in the center of the fan's motor. The switch housing is used to conceal and protect various components, which can include wires, capacitors, and switches; on fans that require oiling, it often conceals the oil reservoir which lubricates the bearings. The switch housing also makes for a convenient place to mount a light kit.]\n* Blade badges, decorative adornments attached to the visible underside of the blades for the purpose of concealing the screws used to attach the blades to the blade irons.\n* Assorted switches used for turning the fan on and off, adjusting the speed at which the blades rotate, changing the direction in which the blades rotate, and operating any lamps that may be present.\n* Lamps\n** Uplights, which are installed on top of the fan's motor housing and project light up onto the ceiling, for aesthetic reasons (to \"create ambiance\")\n** Downlights, often referred to as a \"light kit\", which add ambient light to a room and can be used to replace any ceiling-mounted lamps that were displaced by the installation of a ceiling fan\n** Decorative lights mounted inside the motor housing\u2014 in this type of setup, the motor housing side-band often has glass or acrylic panel sections which allow light to shine though.\n\n==Configurations==\n* Commercial or industrial ceiling fans are typically used in stores, schools, churches, offices, factories, and warehouses. Commercial ceiling fans are designed to be more cost effective and more energy efficient than other cooling alternatives. Industrial or commercial ceiling fans typically use three or four blades, typically made of either steel or aluminum, and operate with a high-speed motor. These energy efficient ceiling fans are designed to push massive amounts of air across large, wide open spaces. From the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, metal-bladed industrial ceiling fans were popular in lower-income American households, likely due to them being priced lower than wood-bladed models. Industrial ceiling fans are still popular in household applications in the Middle East.\n* A hugger or low profile ceiling fan is designed to be installed on a ceilings as low as 7'6\".\n* UL Damp and UL Wet-rated ceiling fans, otherwise known as indoor/outdoor ceiling fans, are designed for use in partially enclosed or open outdoor spaces. They are made of materials and finishes that are not as drastically affected by direct exposure to rainwater, temperature swings, or humidity as traditional materials and finishes.\n* \"Mini\" ceiling fans are mostly found in less developed places, such as the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], and today are constructed similarly to most oscillating pedestal and table fans, predominantly out of plastic. These fans, hence the name \"mini\" ceiling fan are relatively small in size, usually ranging from 16 inches to 36 inches, however some still span to sizes as large as 42 inches in diameter. Additionally, unlike traditional ceiling fans, these fans typically use synchronous motors.\n\n==Operating a ceiling fan==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Ceiling fan.png|thumb|right|A Hunter-branded \"Eclipse\", which is a basic modern ceiling fan with standard pull-chain controls for the fan motor and light kit]]\nThe way in which a fan is operated depends on its manufacturer, style, and the era in which it was made. Operating methods include:\n* [[Pull switch|Pull-chain]]/pull-cord control. This style of fan is equipped with a metal-bead chain or cloth cord which, when pulled, cycles the fan through the operational speed(s) and then back to off. These fans typically have between two and four speeds.\n* Variable-speed control. During the 1970s and into the mid-1980s, fans were often produced with a [[Solid-state electronics|solid-state]] [[Potentiometer|variable-speed control]]. This was a dial mounted either on the body of the fan or in a gang box at the wall, and when turned in either direction, continuously varied the speed at which the blades rotated\u2014similar to a dimmer switch for a light fixture. A few fans substituted a rotary click-type switch for the infinite-speed dial, providing a set number of set speeds (usually ranging from four to ten).\n** Different fan manufacturers used variable-speed controls in different ways:\n*** The variable-speed dial controlling the fan entirely; to turn the fan on, the user turns the knob until it clicks out of the \"off\" position, and can then choose the fan's speed.\n***Variable speed pull-chain. This setup is similar to the variable-speed dial discussed above, except that a \"dual chain\" setup is used to turn the potentiometer shaft.\n*** A pull-chain present along with the variable-speed control; the dial can be set in one place and left there, with the pull-chain serving only to turn the fan on and off. Many of these fans have an option to wire an optional light kit to this pull-chain in order to control both the fan and the light with one chain. Using this method, the user can have either the fan or light on individually, both on, or both off.\n*** ''Vari-Lo.'' A pull-chain and variable-speed control are present. Such a fan has two speeds controlled by a pull-chain: high (full power, independent of the position of the variable-speed control), and \"Vari-Lo\" (speed determined by the position of the variable-speed control).\n* Wall-mounted control. Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall instead of on the fans themselves; these are very common with industral and [[high-volume low-speed fan|HVLS]] fans. Such controls are usually proprietary and/or specialized switches.\n[[File:Ceiling_fan_wall_control_types.jpg|thumb|left|Old-style choke and new-style capacitor based wall control]]\n** ''Mechanical wall control.'' This style of switch takes varying physical forms. The wall control, which contains a motor speed regulator of some sort, determines how much power is delivered to the fan and therefore how fast it spins. Older such controls employed a [[choke (electronics)|choke]]\u2014a large iron-cored coil\u2014as their regulator; these controls were typically large, boxy, and surface-mounted on the wall. They had anywhere from four to eight speeds. Newer versions of this type of control do not use a choke as such, but much smaller capacitors and/or solid-state circuitry; the switch is typically mounted in a standard in-wall [[gang box]].\n** ''Digital wall control.'' With this style of control, all of the fan's functions\u2014on/off status, speed, direction of rotation, and any attached light fixtures\u2014are controlled by a computerized wall control, which typically does not require any special wiring. Instead, it uses the normal house wiring to send coded electrical pulses to the fan, which decodes and acts on them using a built-in set of electronics. This style of control typically has anywhere from three to six speeds.\n* Wireless [[remote control]]. In recent years, remote controls have dropped in price to become cost-effective for controlling ceiling fans. They may be supplied with fans, or fitted to an existing fan. The hand-held remote transmits radio frequency or [[infrared]] control signals to a receiver unit installed in the fan. However, these may not be ideal for commercial installations as the controllers require batteries. They can also get misplaced, especially in installs with many fans.\n* Directional Switch. Most ceiling fans typically feature a small slide switch on the motor body of the fan itself, which controls the direction in which the fan rotates. In one position, the fan is caused to rotate clockwise, in the other position the fan is caused to rotate counter-clockwise. Given that the fan blades are typically slanted, this results in air either being drawn upwards or brought downwards. While the user can select which they prefer, typically air is blown downwards in summer and lifted upwards in winter. The downwards blowing is experienced as \"cooling\" in summer, while the upwards convection brings ceiling-hugging warm air back down throughout the room in winter.<ref name=direction>{{cite web|title=Ceiling fan direction|url=https://www.lampsusa.com/blogs/how-to-and-tips/13739073-ceiling-fan-rotation-guide|publisher=LampsUSA|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Types of ceiling fans==\nMany styles of ceiling fans have been developed over the years in response to several different factors such as growing energy-consumption consciousness and changes in decorating styles. The advent and evolution of electronic technology has also played a major role in ceiling fan development. Following is a list of major ceiling fan styles and their defining characteristics:\n* [[Punkah]] style ceiling fans. These fans are based on the earliest form of a fan, which was first inventeded in [[India]] and was originally cut from an Indian palmyra leaf. A punkah moves slowly in a pendular manner with a rather large blade and is nowadays electrically powered using a belt-driven system. In comparison to a rotating fan it creates a gentle breeze rather than an airflow.\n* Cast-iron ceiling fans. Cast-iron ceiling fans account for almost all ceiling fans made since their invention in 1882 through the mid-1960s. A cast-iron housing encases a very heavy-duty motor, usually of the [[Shaded-pole motor|shaded-pole]] variety. These motors are lubricated by means of a thrust bearing submerged in an oil-bath, and must be oiled periodically, usually once or twice per year. Because these fans are so sturdily built, and due to their utter lack of electronic components, it is not uncommon to see cast-iron fans aged eighty years or more running strong and still in use today.\n[[File:Hunter Original.jpg|thumb|left|A cast-iron ceiling fan made by Hunter, dating from the early 1980s. This model is called the \"Original\".]]\n** The Hunter 'Original' (manufactured by the Hunter Fan Co.) is by far the most recognizable example of a cast-iron ceiling fan today. It has enjoyed the longest production run of any fan in history, dating from 1906 to present day. The Hunter Original employed a [[shaded-pole motor]] from its inception until 1984, at which point it was changed to a much more efficient [[Electric motors#Permanent split-capacitor motor|permanent split-capacitor]] motor. Though the fan's physical appearance remains virtually unchanged, the motor was downgraded in 2002 when production was shipped to [[Taiwan]]; the motor, though still oil-lubricated, was switched to a \"skeletal\" design, as discussed below, with a shortened main shaft that inadvertently caused reliability issues.  In 2015, this motor design was revised, and once again employs a full-length main shaft; the key element to the longevity of the pre-2002 motors.\n* 20 pole Induction \"Pancake\" motor ceiling fans. These fans with highly efficient cast aluminum housings, were invented in 1957 by Crompton-Greaves, Ltd of [[India]] and were first imported into the [[United States]] in 1973 by Encon Industries. This Crompton-Greaves motor was developed through a joint venture with Crompton-Parkinson of England and took 20 years to perfect. It is considered the most energy efficient motor ever manufactured for ceiling fans (apart from the DC motor) since it consumes less energy than a household incandescent light bulb.\n[[File:Emerson Universal.jpg|thumb|left|The Emerson \"Heat Fan\", one of the first fans to use a stack motor]]\n[[File:Fasco charleston flywheel.jpg|thumb|right|A close-up of the dropped flywheel on a FASCO \"Charleston\" ceiling fan]]\n* Stack-motor ceiling fans. In the late 1970s, due to rising energy costs prompted by the [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]], [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson]] adapted their \"K63\" motor, commonly used in household appliances and industrial machinery, to be used in ceiling fans. This new \"stack\" motor, Along with Encon's cast aluminum 20 pole motor, proved to be powerful, yet energy-efficient, and aided in the comeback of ceiling fans in America, since it was far less expensive to operate than air conditioning. With this design (which consists of a basic [[stator]] and [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]]), the fan's blades mount to a central hub, known as a [[flywheel]]. The flywheel can be made of either metal or reinforced rubber, and can be mounted either flush with the fan's motor housing (concealed) or prominently below the fan's motor housing (known as a \"dropped flywheel\"). Many manufacturers used and/or developed their own stack motors, including (but not limited to) Casablanca, Emerson, FASCO, Hunter, and [[NuTone]]. Some manufacturers trademarked their personal incarnation of this motor: for example, Emerson's \"K63\" and later \"K55\" motors, Fanimation's \"FDK-2100\", and Casablanca's \"XLP-2000\" and \"XLP-2100\". The earliest stack-motor fan was the Emerson \"Heat-Fan\", aka the \"Universal Series\", a utilitarian fan with a dropped metal flywheel and blades made of [[fiberglass]] and later molded [[plastic]] depending on the model. This fan was produced in various different forms from 1976 through 2005 and, while targeted at commercial settings, also found great success in residential settings. Casablanca Fan Co. also made stack-motor fans with concealed flywheels rather than dropped flywheels. While this motor is not nearly as widely used as in the 1970s and 1980s, it can still be found in certain high-end Emerson, and Fanimation fans.  One disadvantage of this type of fan is that the flywheel, if it is made from rubber, will dry out and crack over time and eventually break; this is usually not dangerous, but it renders the fan inoperable until the flywheel is replaced.\n[[File:Spinner fan.jpg|thumb|right|A spinner-motor fan]]\n[[File:A Dual blade Ceiling fan in India.JPG|thumb|right|A dual-blade spinner fan from India]]\n* Direct-drive ceiling fans employ a motor with a stationary inner core with a shell, made of cast iron, cast aluminum, or stamped steel, that revolves around it (commonly called a \"spinner\" motor). The blades are attached directly to this shell. Direct-drive motors are the least expensive motors to produce, and on the whole are the most prone to failure and noise generation.<ref name=\"fanbook\"/> While the very first motors of this type (first used in the 1960s) were relatively heavy-duty, the quality of these motors has dropped significantly in recent years. This type of motor has become the standard for today's fans; it is used in most [[Home Depot|Hampton Bay]] and [[Lowe's|Harbor Breeze]] ceiling fans, and has become commonly used by all other brands.\n** Spinner-motor fans, sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"spinners\", employ a direct-drive (spinner) motor and ''do'' have a stationary decorative cover (motor housing). \"Spinner-motor\" fans account for nearly all fans manufactured in the [[United States]] from the late 1980s to the present.\n** Spinner fans employ a direct-drive motor and do not have a stationary decorative cover (motor housing). This accounts for most [[Industrial Style|industrial-style]] fans (though such fans sometimes have more moderate-quality motors), and inexpensive residential fans commonly found in [[Brazil]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and many [[Middle East]]ern countries.\n* Skeletal motors, which are a high-quality subset of direct-drive motors, can be found on some higher-quality fans. Examples of skeletal motors include Hunter's \"AirMax\" motor, Casablanca's \"XTR200\" motor, and the motors made by Sanyo for use in ceiling fans sold under the Lasko name, and post-2002 Hunter \"Original\" ceiling fans. Skeletal motors differ from regular direct-drive motors in that:\n** They have an open (\"skeletal\") design, which allows for far better ventilation and therefore a longer lifespan. This is in comparison to a regular direct-drive motor's design, in which the motor's inner workings are completely enclosed within a tight metal shell which may or may not have openings for ventilation; even when openings are present, they are almost always small to the point of being inadequate.\n** These are typically larger than regular direct-drive motors and, as a result, are more powerful and less prone to burning out.\n* DC ceiling fans. This type of fans use [[brushless DC motor|BLDC]] technology which offers a much higher efficiency than normal fans driven with traditional AC motors. These are quieter than AC motor fans due to the fact they are commutated electronically and use permanent magnet rotors. Among the other advantages these fans offer are high efficiency, lower noise level, less rotor heat, integration of remote control and other convenience technologies etc. The only drawbacks are the high cost and the presence of complex electronics which may be more prone to failure and difficult to service. However, with the advent of new technologies and better quality control techniques, the latter is becoming less of a concern.<ref>{{cite web|title=DC vs AC Ceiling Fans|url=http://www.hunterfan.co.uk/blog/dc-vs-ac-ceiling-fans/|publisher=www.hunterfan.co.uk|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> \n* Friction-drive ceiling fans. This short-lived type of ceiling fan was attempted by companies such as Emerson and NuTone in the late 1970s with little success. Its advantage was its tremendously low power consumption, but the fans were unreliable and very noisy, in addition to being grievously underpowered. Friction-drive ceiling fans employ a low-[[torque]] motor that is mounted transversely in relation to the flywheel. A rubber wheel mounted on the end of the motor's shaft drove a hub (via contact friction, hence the name) which, in turn, drove the flywheel. It was a system based on the fact that a low-torque motor spinning quickly can drive a large, heavy device at a slow speed without great energy consumption ''(see [[Gear ratio]])''.\n* Gear-drive ceiling fans. These were similar to (and even less common than) the friction drive models; however, instead of a rubber wheel on the motor shaft using friction to turn the flywheel, a toothed gear on the end of the motor shaft meshed with gear teeth formed into the flywheel, thus rotating it. The company \"Panama\" made gear driven ceiling fans and sold them exclusively through the \"[[Family Handyman]]\" magazine in the 1980s.\n* Internal belt-drive ceiling fans. These were also similar in design to gear-drive and friction-drive fans; however, instead of a rubber friction wheel or toothed gear, a small rubber belt linked the motor to the flywheel. The most notable internal belt-drive ceiling fans were the earliest models produced by the Casablanca Fan Co. and a model sold by [[Toastmaster (appliances)|Toastmaster]].\n[[File:Registrator output.png|thumb|right|Three fans driven by a single motor and belts]]\n* Belt-driven ceiling fans. As stated earlier in this article, the first ceiling fans used a water-powered system of [[Belt (mechanical)|belts]] to turn the blades of fan units (which consisted of nothing more than blades mounted on a flywheel). For period-themed decor, a few companies (notably Fanimation and Woolen Mill) have created reproduction belt-drive fan systems. The reproduction systems feature an electric motor as the driving force, in place of the water-powered motor.\n[[File:Ventilateurs de train-Sri Lanka (2).jpg|thumb|left|Orbit fans inside a train in [[Sri Lanka]].]]\n* Orbit fans use a mechanism to oscillate 360 degrees. They are also typically flushed to the ceiling like hugger type fans. They are also very small in size, usually about 16\" and have a similar construction to that of many pedestal fans and desk fans, and usually have finger guards. These are once again, popular mostly in many developing countries as they are a cheap alternative to traditional paddle type ceiling fans. Many American manufacturers, such as \"Fanimation\" have started producing high quality designer versions of such fans.\n* Hugger ceiling fans (also known as \"flush mount\" or \"low profile\" ceiling fans) have no downrod or canopy like a traditional mount fan, and the motor housing is mounted directly to the mount. Hugger style fans generally have spinner motors, and use a special mounting bracket that holds the motor assembly and the motor housing. They are typically used in rooms with ceilings between 7'6\" and 8'6\" high. A disadvantage to this design is that since the blades are mounted so close to the ceiling, air movement is greatly reduced.\n* Bladeless ceiling fans.  This type was introduced in 2012 by Exhale fans and uses a [[Boundary layer#Boundary layer turbine|bladeless turbine]] to push air outwards from the fan, which is also the case of regular ceiling fans on updraft mode. These fans feature a [[brushless DC motor]] instead of a normal direct drive motor. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:HVLS wood ceiling.jpg|thumb|220px|A High-volume low-speed fan]]\n* [[High-volume low-speed fan]]s (HVLS fans) are large-diameter ceiling fans intended for large spaces such as large warehouses, railway platforms and [[gym|gymnasiums]].  These fans generally spin at a low speed but provide a large area with gentle breeze. Modern HVLS fans use airfoil-style blades for optimized air movement at a reduced energy cost.  One of the most notable manufactures of HVLS fans is [[Big Ass Fans]].\n* \"Mini\" ceiling fans are mostly found in less developed places, such as the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], and today are constructed predominantly out of plastic. These fans, hence the name \"mini\" ceiling fan are relatively small in size, usually ranging from 16 inches to 36 inches, however some still span to sizes as large as 42 inches in diameter. Additionally, unlike traditional ceiling fans, these fans typically use synchronous motors.\n*Smart ceiling fans. These fans can be controlled by [[Google Assistant]], [[Amazon Alexa|Amazon Alexa Assistant]], [[HomeKit|Apple Homekit]] and Wifi. The speed, brightness and timing of the fans can be adjuisted with the smartphone app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smartlivingadvice.com/smart-ceiling-fans/|title=Best 7 Smart Ceiling Fans 2019: Google, Alexa and Wifi \u2013 smartlivingadvice.com|last=Staff|first=S. L. A.|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref>\n\n==Safety concerns with installation==\nA typical ceiling fan weighs between 8 and 50 pounds when fully assembled. While many junction boxes can support that weight while the fan is hanging still, a fan ''in operation'' exerts many additional stresses\u2014notably [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]]\u2014on the object from which it is hung; this can cause an improper junction box to fail. For this reason, in the United States the [[National Electric Code]] (document [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] 70, Article 314) states that ceiling fans must be supported by an electrical junction box listed for that use. It is a common mistake for homeowners to replace a light fixture with a ceiling fan without upgrading to a proper junction box.\n\n===Low-hanging fans/danger to limbs===\nAnother concern with installing a ceiling fan relates to the height of the blades relative to the floor. Building codes throughout the United States prohibit residential ceiling fans from being mounted with the blades closer than seven feet from the floor;{{cn|date=April 2016}} this sometimes proves, however, to not be high enough. If a ceiling fan is turned on and a person fully extends his or her arms into the air, as sometimes happens during normal tasks such as stretching or changing bedsheets, it is possible for the blades to strike their hands, potentially causing injury. Also, if one is carrying a long and awkward object, one end may inadvertently enter the path of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades, which can cause damage to the fan. Building codes throughout the United States also prohibit industrial ceiling fans from being mounted with the blades closer than 10 feet from the floor for these reasons.\n\n====''MythBusters'': \"Killer Ceiling Fan\"====\nIn 2004, ''[[MythBusters]]'' tested the idea that a ceiling fan is capable of [[decapitation]] if an individual was to stick his or her neck into a running fan. Two versions of the myth were tested, with the first being the \"jumping kid\", involving a kid jumping up and down on a bed, jumping too high and entering the fan from below and the second being the \"lover's leap\", involving a husband dressed in a costume, leaping towards his wife in bed and entering the fan side-on. [[Kari Byron]], [[Tory Belleci]] and [[Scottie Chapman]] took the lead on the investigation, though original MythBusters [[Jamie Hyneman]] and [[Adam Savage]] also assisted.\n\nFirst, Kari and Scottie purchased a regular household fan and also an industrial fan, which has metal blades as opposed to wood and a more powerful motor. They and Tory then fashioned their human analogs - ballistic gel busts of Adam with actual human craniums, pig spines to approximate human spines, and latex arteries filled with fake blood - and then constructed rigs for both scenarios.\n\nThey busted the myth in both scenarios with both household and industrial fans, as tests proved that residential ceiling fans are, apparently by design, largely incapable of causing more than minor injury, having low-torque motors that stop quickly when blocked and blades composed of light materials that tend to break easily if impacted at speed (the household fan test of the \"lover's leap\" scenario actually broke the fan blades.) They did find that industrial fans, with their steel blades and higher speeds, proved capable of causing injury and laceration - building codes require industrial fans to be mounted with blades 10 feet above the floor, and the industrial fan test of the \"lover's leap\" scenario produced a lethal injury where the fan sliced through the jugular and into the vertebrae - but still lost energy rapidly once blocked and were unable to decapitate the test dummy. As a finale, Scottie, Tory and Kari created an even more dangerous fan with a lawn mower engine as the fan motor and razor sharp blades made from sheet metal in an attempt to duplicate the result, and even it was unable to achieve decapitation, but it caused lethal and horrifying injuries that compelled Adam to put it into the \"''MythBusters'' Hall of Fame.\"<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Ming Dynasty Astronaut |episodelink= |url= |accessdate= |series= MythBusters |serieslink= |first1=Adam (co-host) |last1=Savage |first2=Jamie (co-host) |last2=Hyneman |first3=Scottie (Build Team) |last3=Chapman |first4=Tory (Build Team) |last4=Belleci |first5=Kari (Build Team) |last5=Byron |network=Discovery |station= |city= |airdate=December 5, 2004 |began= |ended= |season=2 |seriesno= |number= 24 |minutes= |time=25:45 |timecaption=Begins at |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n===Wobble===\nWobbling is usually caused by the weight of fan blades being out of balance with each other. This can happen due to a variety of factors, including blades being warped, blade irons being bent, blades or blade irons not being screwed on straight, or weight variation between blades. Also, if all the blades do not exert an equal force on the air (because they have different angles, for instance), the vertical reaction forces can cause wobbling. Wobble can also be caused by a motor flaw, but that very rarely occurs. Wobbling is not affected by the way in which the fan is mounted or the mounting surface.\n\nContrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall.<ref name=InterNACHI>{{cite web |title= Ceiling Fan Inspection |url= http://www.nachi.org/ceiling-fan-inspection.htm |publisher= International Association of Certified Home Inspectors |accessdate= May 31, 2013 |first= Nick |last= Gromicko}}</ref> Ceiling fans are secured by [[Clevis fastener|clevis pins]] locked with either [[split pin]]s or [[R-clip]]s, so wobbling won't have an effect on the fan's security, unless of course, the pins/clips were not secured. To date, there are no reports of a fan wobbling itself off the ceiling and falling. However, a severe wobble can cause light fixture shades or covers to gradually loosen over time and potentially fall, posing a risk of injury to anyone under the fan, and also from any resulting broken glass. When the MythBusters were designing a fan with the goal of chopping off someone's head, Scottie used an edge finder to find the exact center of their blades with the aim of eliminating potentially very dangerous wobbling of their steel blades.\n\nWobbling may be reduced by measuring the tip of each blade from a fixed point on the ceiling (or floor) and ensuring each is equal. If the fan has a metal plate between the motor and blade, this may be gently adjusted by bending.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscat-inline}}\n{{Home appliances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ceiling Fan}}\n[[Category:Home appliances]]\n[[Category:Cooling technology]]\n[[Category:Fans]]\n[[Category:19th-century inventions]]\n[[Category:German inventions]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=May 2015}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}\n}} \n{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:The Black Beauty.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A modern ceiling fan]]\nA '''ceiling fan''' is a [[mechanical fan]] mounted on the ceiling of a room or space, usually [[electric power|electrically powered]], suspended from the [[ceiling]] of a room, that uses hub-mounted [[rotation|rotating]] blades to [[wikt:circulation|circulate]] air.They cool people effectively by introducing slow movement into the otherwise still, hot air of a room. Fans do not reduce air temperature, unlike air-conditioning equipment but create a [[wind chill]] effect by evaporating sweat in the summer. In fact they heat up the air slightly due to the waste heat from the motor and friction between the moving air. Fans use significantly less power than air conditioning as cooling air is [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] expensive. Conversely, a ceiling fan can also be used to reduce the [[:wikt:stratification|stratification]] of warm air in a room by forcing it down to affect both occupants' sensations and thermostat readings, thereby improving [[climate control]] [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].\n\n==History==\nPunkah-type ceiling fans date back to 500 BC, and are native to [[India]]. Unlike modern rotary fans, these punkah fans move air by moving to and from, and were operated manually by cord.<ref> {{cite web |url= http://navrangindia.blogspot.hk/2015/10/punkah-hand-operated-hanging-fan.html?m=1 |title= Punkah. hand-operated hanging fan. a colonial legacy |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}} </ref>\n\nThe first rotary ceiling fans appeared in the early 1860s and 1870s in the [[United States]]. At that time, they were not powered by any form of [[electric motor]]. Instead, a stream of running [[water]] was used, in conjunction with a [[turbine]], to drive a system of belts which would turn the blades of two-blade fan units. These systems could accommodate several fan units, and so became popular in stores, [[restaurant]]s, and offices. Some of these systems survive today, and can be seen in parts of the [[southern United States]] where they originally proved useful.\n\nThe electrically powered ceiling fan was invented in 1882 by [[Philip Diehl (inventor)|Philip Diehl]]. He had engineered the electric motor used in the first electrically powered Singer [[sewing machine]]s, and in 1882 he adapted that motor for use in a ceiling-mounted fan. Each fan had its own self-contained motor unit, with no need for [[belt drive]].<ref name=\"fanbook\">{{cite book |last= Scharff |first= Robert |author2= Casablanca Fan Co. |title= The Fan Book |year= 1983 |publisher= Reston Publishing |location= Reston, VA |isbn= 0-8359-1855-6 |page= [https://archive.org/details/fanbook0000robe/page/128 128] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/fanbook0000robe/page/128 }}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately he faced fierce competition due to the commercial success of the ceiling fan. He continued to make improvements to his invention and created a light kit fitted to the ceiling fan to combine both functions in one unit. By [[World War I]] most ceiling fans were made with four blades instead of the original two, which made fans quieter and allowed them to circulate more air. The early turn-of-the-century companies who successfully commercialized the sale of ceiling fans in the United States were what is today known as the Hunter Fan Company, Robbins & Myers, Century Electric, Westinghouse Corporation and Emerson Electric.\n\nBy the 1920s, ceiling fans were commonplace in the United States, and had started to take hold internationally. From the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, until the introduction of electric air conditioning in the 1950s, ceiling fans slowly faded out of vogue in the U.S.,<ref name=\"fanbook\"/> almost falling into total disuse in the U.S. by the 1960s; those that remained were considered items of nostalgia.\n\n[[File:Late 80s Usha Prima.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Late '80s Usha Prima, one of the most common ceiling fans in India]]\nMeanwhile, electric ceiling fans became very popular in other countries, particularly those with hot climates, such as [[India]] and the [[Middle East]], where a lack of infrastructure and/or financial resources made energy-hungry and complex freon-based [[air conditioning]] equipment impractical. In 1973, Texas entrepreneur H. W. (Hub) Markwardt began importing ceiling fans into the [[United States]] that were manufactured in [[India]] by [[Crompton Greaves]], Ltd. Crompton Greaves had been manufacturing ceiling fans since 1937 through a joint venture formed by [[Greaves Cotton]] of India and [[Crompton Parkinson]] of [[England]]. These Indian manufactured ceiling fans caught on slowly at first, but Markwardt's Encon Industries branded ceiling fans (which stood for ENergy CONservation) eventually found great success during the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, since they consumed less energy than the antiquated shaded pole motors used in most other American made fans. The fans became energy saving appliances for residential and commercial use by supplementing expensive air conditioning with a cooling wind-chill effect. Fans used for comfort create a wind chill by increasing the [[heat transfer coefficient]], but do not lower temperatures directly.\n\n[[File:Casablanca Delta ceiling fan.JPG|thumb|300px|right|[[Casablanca Fan Co.]] \"Delta\" ceiling fan from the early 1980s.]]\nDue to this renewed commercial success using ceiling fans effectively as an energy conservation application, many American manufacturers also started to produce, or significantly increase production of, ceiling fans. In addition to the imported Encon ceiling fans, the [[Casablanca Fan Company]] was founded in 1974. Other American manufacturers of the time included the Hunter Fan Co. (which was then a division of Robbins & Myers, Inc), FASCO (F. A. Smith Co.), and [[Emerson Electric]]; which was often branded as [[Sears-Roebuck]].\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s, ceiling fans remained popular in the United States. Many small American importers, most of them rather short-lived, started importing ceiling fans. Throughout the 1980s, the balance of sales between American-made ceiling fans and those imported from manufacturers in [[India]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and eventually [[China]] changed dramatically with imported fans taking the lion's share of the market by the late 1980s. Even the most basic U.S-made fans sold for $200 to $500, while the most expensive imported fans rarely exceeded $150.\n\nSince 2000, important inroads have been made by companies such as Monte Carlo, Minka Aire, Quorum, Craftmade, Litex and Fanimation - offering higher price ceiling fans with more decorative value. In 2001, Washington Post writer Patricia Dane Rogers<ref name=\"Washington Post\">{{cite news |last= Dane Roger |first= Patricia |title= Eye on Design |work= The Washington Post |date= June 14, 2001 |page=H5}}</ref> wrote, \u201cLike so many other mundane household objects, these old standbys are going high-style and high-tech.\u201d\n\n==Uses==\nUnlike air conditioners, fans only move air\u2014they do not directly change its temperature. Therefore, ceiling fans that have a mechanism for reversing the direction in which the blades push air (most commonly an electrical switch on the unit's switch housing, motor housing, or lower canopy) can help in both heating and cooling.\n\nWhile ceiling fan manufacturers (mainly Emerson) have had electrically reversible motors in production since the 1930s, most fans made before the mid-1970s are either not reversible at all or mechanically reversible (have adjustable blade pitch) instead of an electrically reversible motor. In this case, the blades should be pitched to the right (or left if the motor spins clockwise) for downdraft, and to the opposite side for updraft. Hunter's \"Adaptair\" mechanism is perhaps the most well-known example of mechanical reversibility. In very rare cases, fans are both mechanically and electrically reversible, allowing for the fan to push air in either direction, while rotating either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nFor cooling, the fan's direction of rotation should be set so that air is blown downward (Usually counter-clockwise from beneath). The blades should lead with the upturned edge as they spin. The breeze created by a ceiling fan creates a [[wind chill effect]], speeding the evaporation of perspiration on human skin, which makes the body's natural cooling mechanism much more efficient. Since the fan works directly on the body, rather than by changing the temperature of the air, it is a waste of electricity to leave a ceiling fan on when no one is in a room unless air conditioning is in operation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nFor heating, ceiling fans should usually be set to turn the opposite direction (usually clockwise; the blades should spin with the downward turned edge leading). Air naturally stratifies\u2014that is, warmer air rises to the ceiling while cooler air sinks, meaning that colder air settles near the floor where people spend most of their time. A ceiling fan, with its direction of rotation set so that air is drawn upward, pulls the colder air off the floor, forcing the warmer air nearer the ceiling to move down to take its place, without blowing a stream of air directly at the occupants of the room. This action works to even out the temperature in the room, making it cooler nearer the ceiling, but warmer nearer the floor. Thus the thermostat in the area can be set a few degrees lower to save energy, while maintaining the same level of comfort.\n\nThe most commonplace use of ceiling fans today is in conjunction with an air conditioning unit. Without an operating ceiling fan, air conditioning units typically have both the tasks of cooling the air inside the room and circulating it. Provided the ceiling fan is properly sized for the room in which it is operating, its efficiency of moving air far exceeds that of an air conditioning unit, therefore, for peak efficiency, the air conditioner should be set to a low fan setting and the ceiling fan should be used to circulate the air.\n\n==Parts of a ceiling fan==\nThe key components of a ceiling fan are the following:\n* An [[electric motor]]\n* Blades (also known as paddles or wings) usually made from solid wood, plywood, steel, aluminium, MDF or plastic\n* Blade irons (also known as blade brackets, blade arms, blade holders, or flanges), which hold the blades and connect them to the motor.\n* Flywheel, a metal, plastic or tough rubber double-torus which is attached to the motor shaft, and to which the blade irons may be attached. The flywheel inner ring is locked to the shaft by a lock-screw, and the blade irons to the outer ring by screws or bolts that feed into tapped metal inserts. Rubber or plastic flywheels may become brittle and break, a common cause of fan failure. Replacing the flywheel may require disconnecting wiring and requires removing the switch housing that's on the way for the flywheel to be removed and replaced.\n* Rotor, alternative to blade irons. First patented by industrial designer [[Ron Rezek]] in 1991, the one-piece die cast rotor receives and secures the blades and bolts right to the motor, eliminating most balance problems and minimizing exposed fasteners.\n* A mechanism for mounting the fan to the ceiling such as:\n** Ball-and-socket system. With this system, there is a metal or plastic hemisphere mounted on the end of the downrod; this hemisphere rests in a ceiling-mounted metal bracket, or self-supporting canopy, and allows the fan to move freely (which is very useful on vaulted ceilings).\n** J-hook. A type of mounting system where the ceiling fan hangs on a hardened metal hook, screwed into the ceiling or bolted through a steel I-beam. A porcelain or rubber grommet is used to keep the fan in place. This type of mounting is most common on antique ceiling fans and ceiling fans made for industrial use. A variation of this system using a U-bracket secured to the ceiling by means of lag bolts is often used on heavy-duty ceiling fans with electrically reversible motors in order to reduce the risk of the fan unscrewing itself from the ceiling while running in updraft.\n** Some fans can be mounted using a low-ceiling adapter, a special kit which must be purchased from the fan's manufacturer. This eliminates the need for a downrod, and is therefore useful in rooms with low ceiling clearance.\n** In recent years, it has become increasingly common for a ball-and-socket fan to be designed such that the canopy (ceiling cover piece) can optionally be screwed directly into the top of the motor housing; then the whole fan can be secured directly onto the ceiling mounting bracket. This is often referred to as a dual-mount or tri-mount.\n\nOther components, which vary by model and style, can include:\n* A downrod, a metal pipe used to suspend the fan from the ceiling. Downrods come in many lengths and widths, depending on the fan type.\n* A decorative encasement for the motor (known as the \"motor housing\").\n* A switch housing (also known as a \"switch cup\" or \"nose column\"), a metal or plastic cylinder mounted below and in the center of the fan's motor. The switch housing is used to conceal and protect various components, which can include wires, capacitors, and switches; on fans that require oiling, it often conceals the oil reservoir which lubricates the bearings. The switch housing also makes for a convenient place to mount a light kit.]\n* Blade badges, decorative adornments attached to the visible underside of the blades for the purpose of concealing the screws used to attach the blades to the blade irons.\n* Assorted switches used for turning the fan on and off, adjusting the speed at which the blades rotate, changing the direction in which the blades rotate, and operating any lamps that may be present.\n* Lamps\n** Uplights, which are installed on top of the fan's motor housing and project light up onto the ceiling, for aesthetic reasons (to \"create ambiance\")\n** Downlights, often referred to as a \"light kit\", which add ambient light to a room and can be used to replace any ceiling-mounted lamps that were displaced by the installation of a ceiling fan\n** Decorative lights mounted inside the motor housing\u2014 in this type of setup, the motor housing side-band often has glass or acrylic panel sections which allow light to shine though.\n\n==Configurations==\n* Commercial or industrial ceiling fans are typically used in stores, schools, churches, offices, factories, and warehouses. Commercial ceiling fans are designed to be more cost effective and more energy efficient than other cooling alternatives. Industrial or commercial ceiling fans typically use three or four blades, typically made of either steel or aluminum, and operate with a high-speed motor. These energy efficient ceiling fans are designed to push massive amounts of air across large, wide open spaces. From the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, metal-bladed industrial ceiling fans were popular in lower-income American households, likely due to them being priced lower than wood-bladed models. Industrial ceiling fans are still popular in household applications in the Middle East.\n* A hugger or low profile ceiling fan is designed to be installed on a ceilings as low as 7'6\".\n* UL Damp and UL Wet-rated ceiling fans, otherwise known as indoor/outdoor ceiling fans, are designed for use in partially enclosed or open outdoor spaces. They are made of materials and finishes that are not as drastically affected by direct exposure to rainwater, temperature swings, or humidity as traditional materials and finishes.\n* \"Mini\" ceiling fans are mostly found in less developed places, such as the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], and today are constructed similarly to most oscillating pedestal and table fans, predominantly out of plastic. These fans, hence the name \"mini\" ceiling fan are relatively small in size, usually ranging from 16 inches to 36 inches, however some still span to sizes as large as 42 inches in diameter. Additionally, unlike traditional ceiling fans, these fans typically use synchronous motors.\n\n==Operating a ceiling fan==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Ceiling fan.png|thumb|right|A Hunter-branded \"Eclipse\", which is a basic modern ceiling fan with standard pull-chain controls for the fan motor and light kit]]\nThe way in which a fan is operated depends on its manufacturer, style, and the era in which it was made. Operating methods include:\n* [[Pull switch|Pull-chain]]/pull-cord control. This style of fan is equipped with a metal-bead chain or cloth cord which, when pulled, cycles the fan through the operational speed(s) and then back to off. These fans typically have between two and four speeds.\n* Variable-speed control. During the 1970s and into the mid-1980s, fans were often produced with a [[Solid-state electronics|solid-state]] [[Potentiometer|variable-speed control]]. This was a dial mounted either on the body of the fan or in a gang box at the wall, and when turned in either direction, continuously varied the speed at which the blades rotated\u2014similar to a dimmer switch for a light fixture. A few fans substituted a rotary click-type switch for the infinite-speed dial, providing a set number of set speeds (usually ranging from four to ten).\n** Different fan manufacturers used variable-speed controls in different ways:\n*** The variable-speed dial controlling the fan entirely; to turn the fan on, the user turns the knob until it clicks out of the \"off\" position, and can then choose the fan's speed.\n***Variable speed pull-chain. This setup is similar to the variable-speed dial discussed above, except that a \"dual chain\" setup is used to turn the potentiometer shaft.\n*** A pull-chain present along with the variable-speed control; the dial can be set in one place and left there, with the pull-chain serving only to turn the fan on and off. Many of these fans have an option to wire an optional light kit to this pull-chain in order to control both the fan and the light with one chain. Using this method, the user can have either the fan or light on individually, both on, or both off.\n*** ''Vari-Lo.'' A pull-chain and variable-speed control are present. Such a fan has two speeds controlled by a pull-chain: high (full power, independent of the position of the variable-speed control), and \"Vari-Lo\" (speed determined by the position of the variable-speed control).\n* Wall-mounted control. Some fans have their control(s) mounted on the wall instead of on the fans themselves; these are very common with industral and [[high-volume low-speed fan|HVLS]] fans. Such controls are usually proprietary and/or specialized switches.\n[[File:Ceiling_fan_wall_control_types.jpg|thumb|left|Old-style choke and new-style capacitor based wall control]]\n** ''Mechanical wall control.'' This style of switch takes varying physical forms. The wall control, which contains a motor speed regulator of some sort, determines how much power is delivered to the fan and therefore how fast it spins. Older such controls employed a [[choke (electronics)|choke]]\u2014a large iron-cored coil\u2014as their regulator; these controls were typically large, boxy, and surface-mounted on the wall. They had anywhere from four to eight speeds. Newer versions of this type of control do not use a choke as such, but much smaller capacitors and/or solid-state circuitry; the switch is typically mounted in a standard in-wall [[gang box]].\n** ''Digital wall control.'' With this style of control, all of the fan's functions\u2014on/off status, speed, direction of rotation, and any attached light fixtures\u2014are controlled by a computerized wall control, which typically does not require any special wiring. Instead, it uses the normal house wiring to send coded electrical pulses to the fan, which decodes and acts on them using a built-in set of electronics. This style of control typically has anywhere from three to six speeds.\n* Wireless [[remote control]]. In recent years, remote controls have dropped in price to become cost-effective for controlling ceiling fans. They may be supplied with fans, or fitted to an existing fan. The hand-held remote transmits radio frequency or [[infrared]] control signals to a receiver unit installed in the fan. However, these may not be ideal for commercial installations as the controllers require batteries. They can also get misplaced, especially in installs with many fans.\n* Directional Switch. Most ceiling fans typically feature a small slide switch on the motor body of the fan itself, which controls the direction in which the fan rotates. In one position, the fan is caused to rotate clockwise, in the other position the fan is caused to rotate counter-clockwise. Given that the fan blades are typically slanted, this results in air either being drawn upwards or brought downwards. While the user can select which they prefer, typically air is blown downwards in summer and lifted upwards in winter. The downwards blowing is experienced as \"cooling\" in summer, while the upwards convection brings ceiling-hugging warm air back down throughout the room in winter.<ref name=direction>{{cite web|title=Ceiling fan direction|url=https://www.lampsusa.com/blogs/how-to-and-tips/13739073-ceiling-fan-rotation-guide|publisher=LampsUSA|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Types of ceiling fans==\nMany styles of ceiling fans have been developed over the years in response to several different factors such as growing energy-consumption consciousness and changes in decorating styles. The advent and evolution of electronic technology has also played a major role in ceiling fan development. Following is a list of major ceiling fan styles and their defining characteristics:\n* [[Punkah]] style ceiling fans. These fans are based on the earliest form of a fan, which was first inventeded in [[India]] and was originally cut from an Indian palmyra leaf. A punkah moves slowly in a pendular manner with a rather large blade and is nowadays electrically powered using a belt-driven system. In comparison to a rotating fan it creates a gentle breeze rather than an airflow.\n* Cast-iron ceiling fans. Cast-iron ceiling fans account for almost all ceiling fans made since their invention in 1882 through the mid-1960s. A cast-iron housing encases a very heavy-duty motor, usually of the [[Shaded-pole motor|shaded-pole]] variety. These motors are lubricated by means of a thrust bearing submerged in an oil-bath, and must be oiled periodically, usually once or twice per year. Because these fans are so sturdily built, and due to their utter lack of electronic components, it is not uncommon to see cast-iron fans aged eighty years or more running strong and still in use today.\n[[File:Hunter Original.jpg|thumb|left|A cast-iron ceiling fan made by Hunter, dating from the early 1980s. This model is called the \"Original\".]]\n** The Hunter 'Original' (manufactured by the Hunter Fan Co.) is by far the most recognizable example of a cast-iron ceiling fan today. It has enjoyed the longest production run of any fan in history, dating from 1906 to present day. The Hunter Original employed a [[shaded-pole motor]] from its inception until 1984, at which point it was changed to a much more efficient [[Electric motors#Permanent split-capacitor motor|permanent split-capacitor]] motor. Though the fan's physical appearance remains virtually unchanged, the motor was downgraded in 2002 when production was shipped to [[Taiwan]]; the motor, though still oil-lubricated, was switched to a \"skeletal\" design, as discussed below, with a shortened main shaft that inadvertently caused reliability issues.  In 2015, this motor design was revised, and once again employs a full-length main shaft; the key element to the longevity of the pre-2002 motors.\n* 20 pole Induction \"Pancake\" motor ceiling fans. These fans with highly efficient cast aluminum housings, were invented in 1957 by Crompton-Greaves, Ltd of [[India]] and were first imported into the [[United States]] in 1973 by Encon Industries. This Crompton-Greaves motor was developed through a joint venture with Crompton-Parkinson of England and took 20 years to perfect. It is considered the most energy efficient motor ever manufactured for ceiling fans (apart from the DC motor) since it consumes less energy than a household incandescent light bulb.\n[[File:Emerson Universal.jpg|thumb|left|The Emerson \"Heat Fan\", one of the first fans to use a stack motor]]\n[[File:Fasco charleston flywheel.jpg|thumb|right|A close-up of the dropped flywheel on a FASCO \"Charleston\" ceiling fan]]\n* Stack-motor ceiling fans. In the late 1970s, due to rising energy costs prompted by the [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis]], [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson]] adapted their \"K63\" motor, commonly used in household appliances and industrial machinery, to be used in ceiling fans. This new \"stack\" motor, Along with Encon's cast aluminum 20 pole motor, proved to be powerful, yet energy-efficient, and aided in the comeback of ceiling fans in America, since it was far less expensive to operate than air conditioning. With this design (which consists of a basic [[stator]] and [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]]), the fan's blades mount to a central hub, known as a [[flywheel]]. The flywheel can be made of either metal or reinforced rubber, and can be mounted either flush with the fan's motor housing (concealed) or prominently below the fan's motor housing (known as a \"dropped flywheel\"). Many manufacturers used and/or developed their own stack motors, including (but not limited to) Casablanca, Emerson, FASCO, Hunter, and [[NuTone]]. Some manufacturers trademarked their personal incarnation of this motor: for example, Emerson's \"K63\" and later \"K55\" motors, Fanimation's \"FDK-2100\", and Casablanca's \"XLP-2000\" and \"XLP-2100\". The earliest stack-motor fan was the Emerson \"Heat-Fan\", aka the \"Universal Series\", a utilitarian fan with a dropped metal flywheel and blades made of [[fiberglass]] and later molded [[plastic]] depending on the model. This fan was produced in various different forms from 1976 through 2005 and, while targeted at commercial settings, also found great success in residential settings. Casablanca Fan Co. also made stack-motor fans with concealed flywheels rather than dropped flywheels. While this motor is not nearly as widely used as in the 1970s and 1980s, it can still be found in certain high-end Emerson, and Fanimation fans.  One disadvantage of this type of fan is that the flywheel, if it is made from rubber, will dry out and crack over time and eventually break; this is usually not dangerous, but it renders the fan inoperable until the flywheel is replaced.\n[[File:Spinner fan.jpg|thumb|right|A spinner-motor fan]]\n[[File:A Dual blade Ceiling fan in India.JPG|thumb|right|A dual-blade spinner fan from India]]\n* Direct-drive ceiling fans employ a motor with a stationary inner core with a shell, made of cast iron, cast aluminum, or stamped steel, that revolves around it (commonly called a \"spinner\" motor). The blades are attached directly to this shell. Direct-drive motors are the least expensive motors to produce, and on the whole are the most prone to failure and noise generation.<ref name=\"fanbook\"/> While the very first motors of this type (first used in the 1960s) were relatively heavy-duty, the quality of these motors has dropped significantly in recent years. This type of motor has become the standard for today's fans; it is used in most [[Home Depot|Hampton Bay]] and [[Lowe's|Harbor Breeze]] ceiling fans, and has become commonly used by all other brands.\n** Spinner-motor fans, sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"spinners\", employ a direct-drive (spinner) motor and ''do'' have a stationary decorative cover (motor housing). \"Spinner-motor\" fans account for nearly all fans manufactured in the [[United States]] from the late 1980s to the present.\n** Spinner fans employ a direct-drive motor and do not have a stationary decorative cover (motor housing). This accounts for most [[Industrial Style|industrial-style]] fans (though such fans sometimes have more moderate-quality motors), and inexpensive residential fans commonly found in [[Brazil]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and many [[Middle East]]ern countries.\n* Skeletal motors, which are a high-quality subset of direct-drive motors, can be found on some higher-quality fans. Examples of skeletal motors include Hunter's \"AirMax\" motor, Casablanca's \"XTR200\" motor, and the motors made by Sanyo for use in ceiling fans sold under the Lasko name, and post-2002 Hunter \"Original\" ceiling fans. Skeletal motors differ from regular direct-drive motors in that:\n** They have an open (\"skeletal\") design, which allows for far better ventilation and therefore a longer lifespan. This is in comparison to a regular direct-drive motor's design, in which the motor's inner workings are completely enclosed within a tight metal shell which may or may not have openings for ventilation; even when openings are present, they are almost always small to the point of being inadequate.\n** These are typically larger than regular direct-drive motors and, as a result, are more powerful and less prone to burning out.\n* DC ceiling fans. This type of fans use [[brushless DC motor|BLDC]] technology which offers a much higher efficiency than normal fans driven with traditional AC motors. These are quieter than AC motor fans due to the fact they are commutated electronically and use permanent magnet rotors. Among the other advantages these fans offer are high efficiency, lower noise level, less rotor heat, integration of remote control and other convenience technologies etc. The only drawbacks are the high cost and the presence of complex electronics which may be more prone to failure and difficult to service. However, with the advent of new technologies and better quality control techniques, the latter is becoming less of a concern.<ref>{{cite web|title=DC vs AC Ceiling Fans|url=http://www.hunterfan.co.uk/blog/dc-vs-ac-ceiling-fans/|publisher=www.hunterfan.co.uk|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> \n* Friction-drive ceiling fans. This short-lived type of ceiling fan was attempted by companies such as Emerson and NuTone in the late 1970s with little success. Its advantage was its tremendously low power consumption, but the fans were unreliable and very noisy, in addition to being grievously underpowered. Friction-drive ceiling fans employ a low-[[torque]] motor that is mounted transversely in relation to the flywheel. A rubber wheel mounted on the end of the motor's shaft drove a hub (via contact friction, hence the name) which, in turn, drove the flywheel. It was a system based on the fact that a low-torque motor spinning quickly can drive a large, heavy device at a slow speed without great energy consumption ''(see [[Gear ratio]])''.\n* Gear-drive ceiling fans. These were similar to (and even less common than) the friction drive models; however, instead of a rubber wheel on the motor shaft using friction to turn the flywheel, a toothed gear on the end of the motor shaft meshed with gear teeth formed into the flywheel, thus rotating it. The company \"Panama\" made gear driven ceiling fans and sold them exclusively through the \"[[Family Handyman]]\" magazine in the 1980s.\n* Internal belt-drive ceiling fans. These were also similar in design to gear-drive and friction-drive fans; however, instead of a rubber friction wheel or toothed gear, a small rubber belt linked the motor to the flywheel. The most notable internal belt-drive ceiling fans were the earliest models produced by the Casablanca Fan Co. and a model sold by [[Toastmaster (appliances)|Toastmaster]].\n[[File:Registrator output.png|thumb|right|Three fans driven by a single motor and belts]]\n* Belt-driven ceiling fans. As stated earlier in this article, the first ceiling fans used a water-powered system of [[Belt (mechanical)|belts]] to turn the blades of fan units (which consisted of nothing more than blades mounted on a flywheel). For period-themed decor, a few companies (notably Fanimation and Woolen Mill) have created reproduction belt-drive fan systems. The reproduction systems feature an electric motor as the driving force, in place of the water-powered motor.\n[[File:Ventilateurs de train-Sri Lanka (2).jpg|thumb|left|Orbit fans inside a train in [[Sri Lanka]].]]\n* Orbit fans use a mechanism to oscillate 360 degrees. They are also typically flushed to the ceiling like hugger type fans. They are also very small in size, usually about 16\" and have a similar construction to that of many pedestal fans and desk fans, and usually have finger guards. These are once again, popular mostly in many developing countries as they are a cheap alternative to traditional paddle type ceiling fans. Many American manufacturers, such as \"Fanimation\" have started producing high quality designer versions of such fans.\n* Hugger ceiling fans (also known as \"flush mount\" or \"low profile\" ceiling fans) have no downrod or canopy like a traditional mount fan, and the motor housing is mounted directly to the mount. Hugger style fans generally have spinner motors, and use a special mounting bracket that holds the motor assembly and the motor housing. They are typically used in rooms with ceilings between 7'6\" and 8'6\" high. A disadvantage to this design is that since the blades are mounted so close to the ceiling, air movement is greatly reduced.\n* Bladeless ceiling fans.  This type was introduced in 2012 by Exhale fans and uses a [[Boundary layer#Boundary layer turbine|bladeless turbine]] to push air outwards from the fan, which is also the case of regular ceiling fans on updraft mode. These fans feature a [[brushless DC motor]] instead of a normal direct drive motor. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:HVLS wood ceiling.jpg|thumb|220px|A High-volume low-speed fan]]\n* [[High-volume low-speed fan]]s (HVLS fans) are large-diameter ceiling fans intended for large spaces such as large warehouses, railway platforms and [[gym|gymnasiums]].  These fans generally spin at a low speed but provide a large area with gentle breeze. Modern HVLS fans use airfoil-style blades for optimized air movement at a reduced energy cost.  One of the most notable manufactures of HVLS fans is [[Big Ass Fans]].\n* \"Mini\" ceiling fans are mostly found in less developed places, such as the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], and today are constructed predominantly out of plastic. These fans, hence the name \"mini\" ceiling fan are relatively small in size, usually ranging from 16 inches to 36 inches, however some still span to sizes as large as 42 inches in diameter. Additionally, unlike traditional ceiling fans, these fans typically use synchronous motors.\n*Smart ceiling fans. These fans can be controlled by [[Google Assistant]], [[Amazon Alexa|Amazon Alexa Assistant]], [[HomeKit|Apple Homekit]] and Wifi. The speed, brightness and timing of the fans can be adjuisted with the smartphone app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smartlivingadvice.com/smart-ceiling-fans/|title=Best 7 Smart Ceiling Fans 2019: Google, Alexa and Wifi \u2013 smartlivingadvice.com|last=Staff|first=S. L. A.|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref>\n\n==Safety concerns with installation==\nA typical ceiling fan weighs between 8 and 50 pounds when fully assembled. While many junction boxes can support that weight while the fan is hanging still, a fan ''in operation'' exerts many additional stresses\u2014notably [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]]\u2014on the object from which it is hung; this can cause an improper junction box to fail. For this reason, in the United States the [[National Electric Code]] (document [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] 70, Article 314) states that ceiling fans must be supported by an electrical junction box listed for that use. It is a common mistake for homeowners to replace a light fixture with a ceiling fan without upgrading to a proper junction box.\n\n===Low-hanging fans/danger to limbs===\nAnother concern with installing a ceiling fan relates to the height of the blades relative to the floor. Building codes throughout the United States prohibit residential ceiling fans from being mounted with the blades closer than seven feet from the floor;{{cn|date=April 2016}} this sometimes proves, however, to not be high enough. If a ceiling fan is turned on and a person fully extends his or her arms into the air, as sometimes happens during normal tasks such as stretching or changing bedsheets, it is possible for the blades to strike their hands, potentially causing injury. Also, if one is carrying a long and awkward object, one end may inadvertently enter the path of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades, which can cause damage to the fan. Building codes throughout the United States also prohibit industrial ceiling fans from being mounted with the blades closer than 10 feet from the floor for these reasons.\n\n====''MythBusters'': \"Killer Ceiling Fan\"====\nIn 2004, ''[[MythBusters]]'' tested the idea that a ceiling fan is capable of [[decapitation]] if an individual was to stick his or her neck into a running fan. Two versions of the myth were tested, with the first being the \"jumping kid\", involving a kid jumping up and down on a bed, jumping too high and entering the fan from below and the second being the \"lover's leap\", involving a husband dressed in a costume, leaping towards his wife in bed and entering the fan side-on. [[Kari Byron]], [[Tory Belleci]] and [[Scottie Chapman]] took the lead on the investigation, though original MythBusters [[Jamie Hyneman]] and [[Adam Savage]] also assisted.\n\nFirst, Kari and Scottie purchased a regular household fan and also an industrial fan, which has metal blades as opposed to wood and a more powerful motor. They and Tory then fashioned their human analogs - ballistic gel busts of Adam with actual human craniums, pig spines to approximate human spines, and latex arteries filled with fake blood - and then constructed rigs for both scenarios.\n\nThey busted the myth in both scenarios with both household and industrial fans, as tests proved that residential ceiling fans are, apparently by design, largely incapable of causing more than minor injury, having low-torque motors that stop quickly when blocked and blades composed of light materials that tend to break easily if impacted at speed (the household fan test of the \"lover's leap\" scenario actually broke the fan blades.) They did find that industrial fans, with their steel blades and higher speeds, proved capable of causing injury and laceration - building codes require industrial fans to be mounted with blades 10 feet above the floor, and the industrial fan test of the \"lover's leap\" scenario produced a lethal injury where the fan sliced through the jugular and into the vertebrae - but still lost energy rapidly once blocked and were unable to decapitate the test dummy. As a finale, Scottie, Tory and Kari created an even more dangerous fan with a lawn mower engine as the fan motor and razor sharp blades made from sheet metal in an attempt to duplicate the result, and even it was unable to achieve decapitation, but it caused lethal and horrifying injuries that compelled Adam to put it into the \"''MythBusters'' Hall of Fame.\"<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Ming Dynasty Astronaut |episodelink= |url= |accessdate= |series= MythBusters |serieslink= |first1=Adam (co-host) |last1=Savage |first2=Jamie (co-host) |last2=Hyneman |first3=Scottie (Build Team) |last3=Chapman |first4=Tory (Build Team) |last4=Belleci |first5=Kari (Build Team) |last5=Byron |network=Discovery |station= |city= |airdate=December 5, 2004 |began= |ended= |season=2 |seriesno= |number= 24 |minutes= |time=25:45 |timecaption=Begins at |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n===Wobble===\nWobbling is usually caused by the weight of fan blades being out of balance with each other. This can happen due to a variety of factors, including blades being warped, blade irons being bent, blades or blade irons not being screwed on straight, or weight variation between blades. Also, if all the blades do not exert an equal force on the air (because they have different angles, for instance), the vertical reaction forces can cause wobbling. Wobble can also be caused by a motor flaw, but that very rarely occurs. Wobbling is not affected by the way in which the fan is mounted or the mounting surface.\n\nContrary to popular misconception, wobbling alone will not cause a ceiling fan to fall.<ref name=InterNACHI>{{cite web |title= Ceiling Fan Inspection |url= http://www.nachi.org/ceiling-fan-inspection.htm |publisher= International Association of Certified Home Inspectors |accessdate= May 31, 2013 |first= Nick |last= Gromicko}}</ref> Ceiling fans are secured by [[Clevis fastener|clevis pins]] locked with either [[split pin]]s or [[R-clip]]s, so wobbling won't have an effect on the fan's security, unless of course, the pins/clips were not secured. To date, there are no reports of a fan wobbling itself off the ceiling and falling. However, a severe wobble can cause light fixture shades or covers to gradually loosen over time and potentially fall, posing a risk of injury to anyone under the fan, and also from any resulting broken glass. When the MythBusters were designing a fan with the goal of chopping off someone's head, Scottie used an edge finder to find the exact center of their blades with the aim of eliminating potentially very dangerous wobbling of their steel blades.\n\nWobbling may be reduced by measuring the tip of each blade from a fixed point on the ceiling (or floor) and ensuring each is equal. If the fan has a metal plate between the motor and blade, this may be gently adjusted by bending.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscat-inline}}\n{{Home appliances}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ceiling Fan}}\n[[Category:Home appliances]]\n[[Category:Cooling technology]]\n[[Category:Fans]]\n[[Category:19th-century inventions]]\n[[Category:German inventions]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n", "name_user": "R2d1000", "label": "safe", "comment": "adding space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiling_fan"}

At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music.  Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to \"go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell\", although in a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|accessdate=February 9, 2010|publisher=NPR}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, \"[[Hey Porter]]\" and \"[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.\n\nCash's next record, \"Folsom Prison Blues\", made the country top five. His \"[[I Walk the Line]]\" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. \"[[Home of the Blues]]\" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel, and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.\n\nIn 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single \"[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]\" became one of his biggest hits, and he recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind a sufficient backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums from them, featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]]\", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.\n\n(When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.)\n[[File:Johnny Cash and The Tennessee Three 1963.JPG|thumb|right|[[The Tennessee Three]] with Cash in 1963]]\nEarly in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname \"the Undertaker\" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes. He said he chose them because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|title=10 Things you didn't know about Johnny Cash|magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=August 29, 2014|date=2013-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle]]'s daughters, [[Anita Carter|Anita]], June, and [[Helen Carter|Helen]]. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]'', later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.\n\nCash's career was handled by Saul Holiff, a London, Ontario, promoter. Their relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic ''[[My Father and the Man in Black]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnny-and-saul.com|title=My Father and The Man in Black|website=Johnny-and-saul.com|accessdate=April 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517093414/http://johnny-and-saul.com/|archive-date=May 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Outlaw image ===\nAs his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to [[amphetamine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash used the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].\n\nAlthough he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\" was a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching number one on the country charts and entering the top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by June's sister, but the signature [[mariachi]]-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash.<ref name=pc10>{{Pop Chronicles|10|3}}</ref> He said that it had come to him in a dream. Vivian Liberto claimed a different version of the origins of \"Ring of Fire\". In her book, ''I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny'', Liberto says that Cash gave Carter half the songwriting credit for monetary reasons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Vivian |last2=Sharpsteen |first2=Ann |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-1416532927 |page=294 |edition=Hardcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmkBUE0f3HAC&pg=PA294#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=February 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1965, Cash's camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew Damon Fielder in [[Los Padres National Forest]] in California, triggering a forest fire that burned several hundred acres and nearly caused his death.<ref>\"Major brush fire.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', June 28, 1965, p. 1.</ref><ref>\"Control of Brush Fire Near; 700 Acres Burned.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', June 29, 1965, p. 27.</ref> Cash claimed that the fire was caused by sparks from a defective exhaust system on his camper, but Fielder thinks that Cash started a fire to stay warm and in his drugged condition failed to notice the fire getting out of control.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hilburn|first1=Robert|title=Johnny Cash: The Life|year=2013|publisher=Little, Brown and Company| edition=ebook|isbn=978-0-316-19475-4}}</ref> When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said, \"I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it.\"<ref>Hilburn, 2013 (ebook)</ref>\n\nThe fire destroyed {{convert |508|acre|ha}}, burned the foliage off three mountains and drove off 49 of the refuge's 53 endangered [[California condor]]s.<ref>Johnson, Brett (November 18, 2007), [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2007/nov/18/they-walked-the-line \"Cash's first wife tells of romance, heartbreak\"], ''Ventura County Star.''

Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he stayed only one night on each stay. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (He used this to write the song \"Starkville City Jail\", which he discussed on his live ''At San Quentin'' album.)<ref>Johnny Cash, ''[[At San Quentin]]'', [[Columbia Records]] CS 9827, 1969</ref> While on tour that year, he was arrested October 4 in [[El Paso, Texas]], by a [[narcotic]]s squad. The officers suspected he was [[smuggling]] heroin from Mexico, but found instead 688 [[Dexedrine]] capsules (amphetamines) and 475 [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] (sedatives or tranquilizers) tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a [[suspended sentence]]. Cash posted a $1,500 bond and then was released until his arraignment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|title=Johnny Cash's dark California days|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=2013-10-12|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nIn this period of the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of [[concept album]]s. His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of Native Americans and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. In 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.\n\nReaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash was divorced from his first wife and had performances cancelled, but he continued to find success. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, \"[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]],\" won a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22johnny+cash%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All/|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|date=2017-04-30}}</ref>\n\nCash was last arrested in 1967 in [[Walker County, Georgia]], after police found he was carrying a bag of prescription pills and was in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. The singer was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sjEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: \"I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\"<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref>\n\nThere is an unconfirmed story that in early 1967, Cash had a spiritual [[wikt:epiphany|epiphany]] in the [[Nickajack Cave]]. The story says that Cash had attempted to commit suicide while under the heavy influence of drugs. He descended deep into the cave, trying to lose himself and \"just die\", but passed out on the floor. Utterly discouraged, he felt God's presence in his heart and struggled out of the cave (despite exhaustion) by following a faint light and slight breeze.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/30/showbiz/music/johnny-cash-biography/index.html|title=The stories of Johnny Cash |last=Leopold|first= Todd |work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref> To him, the incident represented his rebirth. June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the [[London Gardens]] in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in Franklin, Kentucky. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had \"cleaned up.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Zwonitzer|first=Mark|title=Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone: The Carter Family and Their Legacy in American Music|url=https://archive.org/details/willyoumissmewhe0000zwon|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon & Schuster |year= 2002|isbn= 978-0-684-85763-3}}</ref>\n\nCash's journey included rediscovery of his Christian faith. He took an \"[[altar call]]\" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, pastored by Reverend Jimmie Rodgers Snow, son of country music legend [[Hank Snow]]. According to Marshall Grant, though, Cash did not completely stop using amphetamines in 1968.  Cash did not end all drug use until 1970, staying drug-free for a period of seven years.

By 1983, he was deeply addicted again and became a patient at the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]] for treatment. He stayed off drugs for several years, but relapsed. By 1989, he was dependent and entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center.

Both live albums reached number one on ''Billboard'' country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the ''Billboard'' pop album chart.  In 1969, Cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even [[The Beatles]] by selling 6.5&nbsp;million albums.<ref>Edwards, Leigh H. \"Cash, Johnny.\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> In comparison, the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as ''Strawberry Cake'' recorded in London and ''Live at Madison Square Garden'', which peaked at numbers 33 and 39 on the album charts, respectively.\n\nThe [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom Prison]] record was introduced by a rendition of his \"Folsom Prison Blues\" while the [[San Quentin]] record included the crossover hit single \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\", a [[Shel Silverstein]]-penned novelty song that reached number one on the country charts and number two on the U.S. [[Top 40|top-10]] pop charts. The AM versions of the latter contained profanities which were edited out of the aired version. The modern CD versions are unedited, thus making them longer than on the original vinyl albums, though they retain the audience-reaction overdubs of the originals.\n\nCash performed at the [[\u00d6ster\u00e5ker Prison]] in Sweden in 1972. The live album ''[[P\u00e5 \u00d6ster\u00e5ker]]'' (''At \u00d6ster\u00e5ker'') was released in 1973. \"San Quentin\" was recorded with Cash replacing \"San Quentin\" with \"\u00d6ster\u00e5ker\". In 1976, a concert at [[Tennessee State Prison]] was videotaped for TV broadcast, and received a belated CD release after Cash's death as ''[[A Concert Behind Prison Walls]]''.\n\n=== Activism for Native Americans ===\nIn 1965, Cash and June Carter appeared on Pete Seeger's TV show, ''Rainbow Quest'', on which Cash explained his start as an activist for Native Americans: \n:In '57, I wrote a song called 'Old Apache Squaw' and then forgot the so-called Indian protest for a while, but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice.<ref>{{cite episode |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny| title=Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash |series=[[Rainbow Quest]] |season=1 |number=39 |year=1966}}</ref>\n\nColumbia, the label for which Cash was recording then, was opposed to putting the song on his next album, considering it \"too radical for the public\".<ref>Cash, J., & Carr, P.

In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;\u2013 The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.\n\nDuring that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In the same year, Cash appeared as a \"very special guest star\" in an episode of the ''[[Muppet Show]]''. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life Georgia murder case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis and featured June Carter in a small but important role. Cash had tried for years to make the film, for which he won acclaim.\n\nCash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an unusual incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an ostrich he kept on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archivedate=April 26, 2005|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a \"[[near-death experience]]\".\n\nCash's recording career and his general relationship with the Nashville establishment were at an all-time low in the 1980s. He realized that his record label of nearly 30 years, Columbia, was growing indifferent to him and was not properly marketing him (he was \"invisible\" during that time, as he said in his autobiography).\n\n{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}\nIn 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled \"Chicken in Black\" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash \u2013 who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as \"A Boy Named Sue\" and \"One Piece at a Time\" \u2013 accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked \"like a buffoon\" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores\u2014interrupting its bona fide chart success\u2014and termed the venture \"a fiasco.\"<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.\n\nThough Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death (one of many older country acts to be derailed by changes in the industry that year), his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a \"morale booster\"; Roseanne Cash later said \"he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it\". The album attracted press attention on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/28/johnny-cash-indie-1980s-resurrection |title=The Resurrection of Johnny Cash |last=Thomson |first=Graeme |date=28 April 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref> In 1991, he sang a version of \"Man in Black\" for the [[Christian punk]] band [[One Bad Pig]]'s album ''I Scream Sunday''.

The album was produced by Rick Rubin with [[Sylvia Massy]] engineering and mixing. A majority of ''Unchained'' was recorded at [[Sound City Studios]] and featured guest appearances by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Mick Fleetwood]], and [[Marty Stuart]].

He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. Johnny's drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement.

At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music.  Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to \"go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell\", although in a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|accessdate=February 9, 2010|publisher=NPR}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, \"[[Hey Porter]]\" and \"[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.\n\nCash's next record, \"Folsom Prison Blues\", made the country top five. His \"[[I Walk the Line]]\" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. \"[[Home of the Blues]]\" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel, and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.\n\nIn 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single \"[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]\" became one of his biggest hits, and he recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind a sufficient backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums from them, featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]]\", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.\n\n(When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.)\n[[File:Johnny Cash and The Tennessee Three 1963.JPG|thumb|right|[[The Tennessee Three]] with Cash in 1963]]\nEarly in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname \"the Undertaker\" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes. He said he chose them because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-johnny-cash-20131031|title=10 Things you didn't know about Johnny Cash|magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=August 29, 2014|date=2013-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle]]'s daughters, [[Anita Carter|Anita]], June, and [[Helen Carter|Helen]]. June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]'', later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.\n\nCash's career was handled by Saul Holiff, a London, Ontario, promoter. Their relationship was the subject of Saul's son's biopic ''[[My Father and the Man in Black]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnny-and-saul.com|title=My Father and The Man in Black|website=Johnny-and-saul.com|accessdate=April 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517093414/http://johnny-and-saul.com/|archive-date=May 17, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Outlaw image ===\nAs his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to [[amphetamine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash used the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].\n\nAlthough he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity. His rendition of \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\" was a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit, reaching number one on the country charts and entering the top 20 on the pop charts. It was originally performed by June's sister, but the signature [[mariachi]]-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash.<ref name=pc10>{{Pop Chronicles|10|3}}</ref> He said that it had come to him in a dream. Vivian Liberto claimed a different version of the origins of \"Ring of Fire\". In her book, ''I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny'', Liberto says that Cash gave Carter half the songwriting credit for monetary reasons.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash |first1=Vivian |last2=Sharpsteen |first2=Ann |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-1416532927 |page=294 |edition=Hardcover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmkBUE0f3HAC&pg=PA294#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=February 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1965, Cash's camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew Damon Fielder in [[Los Padres National Forest]] in California, triggering a forest fire that burned several hundred acres and nearly caused his death.<ref>\"Major brush fire.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', June 28, 1965, p. 1.</ref><ref>\"Control of Brush Fire Near; 700 Acres Burned.\" ''Los Angeles Times'', June 29, 1965, p. 27.</ref> Cash claimed that the fire was caused by sparks from a defective exhaust system on his camper, but Fielder thinks that Cash started a fire to stay warm and in his drugged condition failed to notice the fire getting out of control.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hilburn|first1=Robert|title=Johnny Cash: The Life|year=2013|publisher=Little, Brown and Company| edition=ebook|isbn=978-0-316-19475-4}}</ref> When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said, \"I didn't do it, my truck did, and it's dead, so you can't question it.\"<ref>Hilburn, 2013 (ebook)</ref>\n\nThe fire destroyed {{convert |508|acre|ha}}, burned the foliage off three mountains and drove off 49 of the refuge's 53 endangered [[California condor]]s.<ref>Johnson, Brett (November 18, 2007), [http://www.vcstar.com/news/2007/nov/18/they-walked-the-line \"Cash's first wife tells of romance, heartbreak\"], ''Ventura County Star.''

Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he stayed only one night on each stay. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (He used this to write the song \"Starkville City Jail\", which he discussed on his live ''At San Quentin'' album.)<ref>Johnny Cash, ''[[At San Quentin]]'', [[Columbia Records]] CS 9827, 1969</ref> While on tour that year, he was arrested October 4 in [[El Paso, Texas]], by a [[narcotic]]s squad. The officers suspected he was [[smuggling]] heroin from Mexico, but found instead 688 [[Dexedrine]] capsules (amphetamines) and 475 [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] (sedatives or tranquilizers) tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a [[suspended sentence]]. Cash posted a $1,500 bond and then was released until his arraignment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/12/entertainment/la-et-ms-johnny-cash-calif/3|title=Johnny Cash's dark California days|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=2013-10-12|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nIn this period of the mid-1960s, Cash released a number of [[concept album]]s. His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of Native Americans and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. In 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.\n\nReaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash was divorced from his first wife and had performances cancelled, but he continued to find success. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, \"[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]],\" won a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22johnny+cash%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All/|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|date=2017-04-30}}</ref>\n\nCash was last arrested in 1967 in [[Walker County, Georgia]], after police found he was carrying a bag of prescription pills and was in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. The singer was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sjEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: \"I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\"<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref>\n\nThere is an unconfirmed story that in early 1967, Cash had a spiritual [[wikt:epiphany|epiphany]] in the [[Nickajack Cave]]. The story says that Cash had attempted to commit suicide while under the heavy influence of drugs. He descended deep into the cave, trying to lose himself and \"just die\", but passed out on the floor. Utterly discouraged, he felt God's presence in his heart and struggled out of the cave (despite exhaustion) by following a faint light and slight breeze.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/30/showbiz/music/johnny-cash-biography/index.html|title=The stories of Johnny Cash |last=Leopold|first= Todd |work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref> To him, the incident represented his rebirth. June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the [[London Gardens]] in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in Franklin, Kentucky. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had \"cleaned up.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Zwonitzer|first=Mark|title=Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone: The Carter Family and Their Legacy in American Music|url=https://archive.org/details/willyoumissmewhe0000zwon|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon & Schuster |year= 2002|isbn= 978-0-684-85763-3}}</ref>\n\nCash's journey included rediscovery of his Christian faith. He took an \"[[altar call]]\" in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, pastored by Reverend Jimmie Rodgers Snow, son of country music legend [[Hank Snow]]. According to Marshall Grant, though, Cash did not completely stop using amphetamines in 1968.  Cash did not end all drug use until 1970, staying drug-free for a period of seven years. Grant claims that the birth of Cash's son, John Carter Cash, inspired Cash to end his dependence.<ref name=\"Grant page 92\">{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Marshall|title=I Was There When It Happened&nbsp;\u2013 My Life With Johnny Cash|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92 92, 177]|publisher=Cumberland House|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58182-510-7|url=https://archive.org/details/iwastherewhenith00mars/page/92}}</ref>\n\nCash began using amphetamines again in 1977. By 1983, he was deeply addicted again and became a patient at the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]] for treatment. He stayed off drugs for several years, but relapsed. By 1989, he was dependent and entered Nashville's Cumberland Heights Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center.

He played his first famous prison concert on January 1, 1958, at San Quentin State Prison.<ref name=\"cash1958\">[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/inmate-merle-haggard-hears-johnny-cash-play-san-quentin-state-prison \"Inmate Merle Haggard hears Johnny Cash play San Quentin State Prison\"], history.com; accessed June 24, 2014.</ref> These performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums, ''[[At Folsom Prison|Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison]]'' (1968) and ''[[At San Quentin|Johnny Cash at San Quentin]]'' (1969).  Both live albums reached number one on ''Billboard'' country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the ''Billboard'' pop album chart.  In 1969, Cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even [[The Beatles]] by selling 6.5&nbsp;million albums.<ref>Edwards, Leigh H. \"Cash, Johnny.\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> In comparison, the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as ''Strawberry Cake'' recorded in London and ''Live at Madison Square Garden'', which peaked at numbers 33 and 39 on the album charts, respectively.\n\nThe [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom Prison]] record was introduced by a rendition of his \"Folsom Prison Blues\" while the [[San Quentin]] record included the crossover hit single \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\", a [[Shel Silverstein]]-penned novelty song that reached number one on the country charts and number two on the U.S. [[Top 40|top-10]] pop charts. The AM versions of the latter contained profanities which were edited out of the aired version. The modern CD versions are unedited, thus making them longer than on the original vinyl albums, though they retain the audience-reaction overdubs of the originals.\n\nCash performed at the [[\u00d6ster\u00e5ker Prison]] in Sweden in 1972. The live album ''[[P\u00e5 \u00d6ster\u00e5ker]]'' (''At \u00d6ster\u00e5ker'') was released in 1973. \"San Quentin\" was recorded with Cash replacing \"San Quentin\" with \"\u00d6ster\u00e5ker\". In 1976, a concert at [[Tennessee State Prison]] was videotaped for TV broadcast, and received a belated CD release after Cash's death as ''[[A Concert Behind Prison Walls]]''.\n\n=== Activism for Native Americans ===\nIn 1965, Cash and June Carter appeared on Pete Seeger's TV show, ''Rainbow Quest'', on which Cash explained his start as an activist for Native Americans: \n:In '57, I wrote a song called 'Old Apache Squaw' and then forgot the so-called Indian protest for a while, but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice.<ref>{{cite episode |last1=Cash |first1=Johnny| title=Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash |series=[[Rainbow Quest]] |season=1 |number=39 |year=1966}}</ref>\n\nColumbia, the label for which Cash was recording then, was opposed to putting the song on his next album, considering it \"too radical for the public\".<ref>Cash, J., & Carr, P.

In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;\u2013 The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.\n\nDuring that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In the same year, Cash appeared as a \"very special guest star\" in an episode of the ''[[Muppet Show]]''. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life Georgia murder case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis and featured June Carter in a small but important role. Cash had tried for years to make the film, for which he won acclaim.\n\nCash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an unusual incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an ostrich he kept on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archivedate=April 26, 2005|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a \"[[near-death experience]]\".\n\nCash's recording career and his general relationship with the Nashville establishment were at an all-time low in the 1980s. He realized that his record label of nearly 30 years, Columbia, was growing indifferent to him and was not properly marketing him (he was \"invisible\" during that time, as he said in his autobiography).\n\n{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}\nIn 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled \"Chicken in Black\" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash \u2013 who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as \"A Boy Named Sue\" and \"One Piece at a Time\" \u2013 accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked \"like a buffoon\" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores\u2014interrupting its bona fide chart success\u2014and termed the venture \"a fiasco.\"<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.\n\nThough Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death (one of many older country acts to be derailed by changes in the industry that year), his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a \"morale booster\"; Roseanne Cash later said \"he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it\". The album attracted press attention on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/28/johnny-cash-indie-1980s-resurrection |title=The Resurrection of Johnny Cash |last=Thomson |first=Graeme |date=28 April 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref> In 1991, he sang a version of \"Man in Black\" for the [[Christian punk]] band [[One Bad Pig]]'s album ''I Scream Sunday''.

The album was produced by Rick Rubin with [[Sylvia Massy]] engineering and mixing. A majority of ''Unchained'' was recorded at [[Sound City Studios]] and featured guest appearances by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], [[Mick Fleetwood]], and [[Marty Stuart]].

He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. Johnny's drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement.
