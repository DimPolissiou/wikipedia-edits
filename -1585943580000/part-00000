The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season.

offensive ways of describing [[COVID-19]].

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

The first Odessa pogrom, in 1821, was linked to the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek War for Independence]], during which the Jews were accused of sympathizing with the Ottoman authorities and of aiding the Turks in killing the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople, [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]], dragging his dead body through the streets and finally throwing it into the [[Bosphorus]].<ref>Ariel Parkansky \"[http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/odessa/LIF_violence.asp Anti-Semitism and Pogroms]\" KehilaLinks</ref></blockquote>\n\n==1859 pogrom==\nAccording to the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1906 ed.),\n\n<blockquote>The community did not escape the horrors of the pogrom. Indeed, the very first pogrom in Russia occurred in Odessa in the year 1859. This was in reality not a Russian but a Greek pogrom; for the leaders and almost all of the participants were Greek sailors from ships in the harbor, and local Greeks who joined them. The pogrom occurred on a Christian Easter; and the local press, in no wise unfriendly to the Jews, attempted to transform it into an accidental fight, the Greek colony at that time being dominant in the administration as well as in the commerce of Odessa. Further pogroms occurred in 1871, 1881, and 1886.\"<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=23&letter=O&search=odessa%20pogrom \"Odessa\"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', 1906 ed.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorians note economic antagonism between the two urban minorities, in addition to religious frictions.<ref>''The Revolution of 1905 in Odessa: Blood on the Steps'', Robert Weinberg, p. 16</ref>\n\n==1871 pogrom==\nHowever, after 1871, the pogroms in Odessa took a form more typical of the rest of the Russian empire: \"Although the pogrom of 1871 was occasioned in part by a rumor that Jews had vandalized the Greek community's church, many non-Greeks participated to it. Russian resentment and hostility toward Jews came to the fore in the pogrom of 1871 as Russians joined Greeks in attacks on Jews. Thereafter, Russians filled the ranks of pogromist mobs in 1881, 1900, and 1905.\"<ref>Ariel Parkansky \"[http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/odessa/LIF_violence.asp Anti-Semitism and Pogroms]\" KehilaLinks</ref>  In the 1881 and 1905 pogroms, many Greek houses were also destroyed.<ref>''Port Jews: Jewish Communities in Cosmopolitan Maritime Trading Centres'', 1550, David Cesarani, p. 168</ref>\n\nThe 1871 pogrom is seen as something of a turning point in Russian Jewish history: \"The Odessa pogrom led some Jewish publicists, exemplified by the writer [[Peretz Smolenskin]], to question belief in the possibility of Jewish integration into Christian society, and to call for a greater awareness of Jewish national identity.\"<ref>[[John Klier]] \"[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Pogroms Pogroms]\" ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''</ref>\n\n==1881\u20131906 period==\n{{main|Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire}}\nIn the post-1871 period, pogroms were often perpetrated with tacit approval of the Tsarist authorities.<ref>''Nicholas II. Life and Death'' by [[Edward Radzinsky]] (Russian ed., 1997) p.89. According to [[Edward Radzinsky]], [[Sergei Witte]], who was appointed Chairman of the [[Russian Council of Ministers]] in 1905, remarked in his ''Memoirs'' that he found that some proclamations inciting pogroms were printed and distributed by Police.</ref> Evidence exists that during the 1905 pogrom, the army supported the mob:\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik [[Osip Pyatnitsky|Piatnitsky]] who was in Odessa at the time recalls what happened: \"There I saw the following scene: a gang of young men, between 25 and 20 years old, among whom there were plain-clothes policemen and members of the Okhrana, were rounding up anyone who looked like a Jew\u2014men, women and children\u2014stripping them naked and beating them mercilessly... We immediately organised a group of revolutionaries armed with revolvers... we ran up to them and fired at them. They ran away. But suddenly between us and the pogromists there appeared a solid wall of soldiers, armed to the teeth and facing us. We retreated. The soldiers went away, and the pogromists came out again. This happened a few times. It became clear to us that the pogromists were acting together with the military.\"<ref>Alan Woods.

Part Two: The First Russian Revolution</ref></blockquote>\n\n==1905 Pogrom==\n\nThe 1905 Pogrom of Odessa was the worst anti-Jewish pogrom in Odessa's history. Between October 18 and 22, 1905, ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Greeks killed over 400 [[Jews]] and damaged or destroyed over 1600 Jewish properties.<ref>Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 2, L\u2013Z\n, ed. Richard S. Levy (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2005), s.v. \"Odessa Pogroms.\"</ref>\n\n===Background of Jews in Odessa===\n\nThe city of Odessa, founded in the late 18th century, encouraged foreign immigration, especially for the purpose of promoting economic growth. For this reason, Jews were far more welcome in Odessa than in many other parts of the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Nonetheless, Jews of Odessa were not viewed as equal to non-Jewish residents and were familiar with [[anti-Semitism]]. A number of serious anti-Jewish pogroms occurred during the 19th century in Odessa, and rumors of a pogrom appeared each year around Eastertime. Jewish and Russian youths also often got into violent fights with each other.<ref>Robert Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" in Pogroms: Anti-Jewish Violence in Modern Russian History, ed. John D. Klier and Shlomo Lambroza. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 250-251.</ref>\n\n===Causes===\n\nThe combination of economic downturn, Jewish backing of Japan in the war against Russia, Jewish opposition to the [[October Manifesto]], and the June 1905 massacre all contributed to great tension between Gentiles and the Jewish community in Odessa in 1905.\n\n====Long-term causes====\n\nAnti-Semitism among Greeks:\n\nGrowing anti-Semitism as a result of the changing place of Jews in Odessa's economy created an environment conducive to a pogrom. When the [[Crimean War]] disrupted trade routes, many Greek commercial firms shifted their business out of Odessa due to bankruptcy or a willingness to seek more profitable trading locations. To fill the resulting vacuum in grain trade, Jewish merchants expanded business and began to acquire greater profits. Many factors contributed to the spread of anti-Semitism among Greeks in Odessa including: the success of many Jewish traders, their preferential hiring of Jewish workers, and rumors of hostile actions by Jews toward Greeks.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 251.</ref>\n\nAnti-Semitism among Russians:\n\nMany Russians blamed the Jews for their troubles, such as limited employment opportunities and lower wages. They cited dramatic Jewish population growth in Odessa, from 14% (14,000 of 100,000) in 1858 to 35% (140,000 of 400,000) in 1897. These numbers contributed to suspicion that Jews possessed great wealth, power, and influence in Odessa. Although by the end of the 19th century Jews held high positions in manufacturing, the majority of wealth in Odessa belonged to non-Jews. Jews certainly did not dominate the economy of Odessa, nor did they control Odessa politically.<ref>Robert Weinberg, \"Anti-Jewish Violence and Revolution in Late Imperial Russia,\" in Riots and Pogroms, ed. Paul Brass. (New York: New York University Press, 1996), 58\u201359.</ref> Unlike other ethnic and religious groups, wealthy Jews could not transform wealth into political power. Out of 3449 total staff, only 71 Jews worked for the imperial government. After an 1892 civic reform, Jews could no longer elect representatives to city councils; instead, a special office for municipal affairs appointed six Jews to the sixty-person Odessa city council.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 254.</ref> Given that 35% of Odessa's population in 1897 consisted of Jews, the 10% Jewish city council was hardly representative.\n\n====Immediate causes====\n\nA significant economic downturn in Odessa at the turn of the 20th century played a major part in the October Pogrom. Restricted trading, reduced industrial production, and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] led to high unemployment in Odessa. Many despised Jews for lay-offs during the economic recession. Hatred for Jews heightened when a number of Jews did not support the war with Japan. Patriotic Russians called Jews unpatriotic and disloyal.<ref>Herlihy, Patricia. \"A Decade of Disturbance, 1904-1914\", in ''Odessa: A History 1794-1914''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press (1986) pg. 304.</ref>\n\nFear of a pogrom in April 1905 prompted the National Committee of Jewish Self-Defense to urge Jews to arm themselves and protect their property. Non-Jews were threatened with armed retaliation if a pogrom occurred. Although a pogrom did not take place until October, fear of one re-emerged in June when Jews were declared culpable for instigating shootings as well as fires at the port. On June 13, 1905, [[Cossack]]s shot several striking workers. The next day, large groups of workers stopped working and attacked police with rocks and guns.  The [[Russian battleship Potemkin|battleship ''Potemkin'']], whose crew had mutinied on June 14, arrived in Odessa that evening. Thousands of Odessans went to the port to see the battleship and support the mutinous sailors. During the afternoon of 15 June, the unruly crowd began to raid warehouses and set fire to wooden buildings in the harbor. Chaos ensued when, in order to prevent further unrest, the military blocked off the harbor and fired into the crowd. Strikes, disorder, and the arrival of ''Potemkin'' caused the death of over 1,000 people at the [[Port of Odessa]]. A few days after the atrocious incident at the harbor, an anti-Semitic pamphlet called ''Odesskie dni'' (\"Odessan Days\") appeared, blaming the Jews for the tragedy. ''Odesskie dni'' demanded compensation by Jews to the non-Jews, disarmament of Jews in Odessa, and a search of all Jewish apartments in the city.<ref>Weinberg, ''The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa'', pg. 256.</ref> Although the events of June did not immediately cause a pogrom, an anti-Semitic environment had been formed, sufficient for the October Pogrom.\n\nOn October 17, Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] issued the [[October Manifesto]], which established civil liberties for the people and promised to create an elected assembly. It was reported in Odessa on October 18, causing celebration in the streets. Jews hoped that the Manifesto would lead to greater freedom and less anti-Semitism in the Russian Empire.<ref>Weinberg, Robert. \"Breathing Spell and Renewed Confrontation\", in ''The Revolution of 1905 In Odessa: Blood On The Steps''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1993. pg. 161.</ref> While many Jews and liberals in Odessa celebrated the October Manifesto, conservatives saw the document as a threat to the autocracy and the might of the Russian Empire.\n\n===The October Pogrom===\n\n====Buildup to pogrom: October 14th\u201317th====\n\nOn October 14, a number of high school students skipped classes and attempted, but failed, to join rallies taking place at the university due to police intervention. In the process of intercepting them, armed policeman injured several children.<ref>Herlihy, \"A Decade of Disturbance, 1904-1914,\" 305.</ref> The next day, radical students and revolutionaries armed themselves and encouraged other workers to lend them support.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 260.</ref> On October 16, students and workers took to the streets and erected barricades. To try to preserve order, the police fought them and killed several students. Although a public funeral had been planned for the students, the Odessa city governor, D. M. Neidhart, had the bodies buried secretly to limit rallying around the deaths.<ref>Herlihy, \"A Decade of Disturbance, 1904-1914,\" 306-307.</ref> On October 17, the police and military continued to monitor the streets, though no major confrontations occurred. About 4000 workers, including many Jews, went on strike.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 260.</ref>\n\n====Crisis: October 18th====\n\nOn October 18, Jews and liberals cheered over the news of the October Manifesto. Although demonstrations began peacefully, they quickly turned violent. Those chanting anti-regime propaganda caused trouble when they took out red flags and anti-imperial propaganda. As violence increased between supporters and opponents of the October Manifesto, members of the latter group began to take out their anger on Odessa's Jews, identifying them as the root of Russia's troubles. When a group of Jews asked a few Russian workers to show respect to a red flag, a fight broke out on the streets and soon turned into an anti-Jewish riot.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 260\u2013262.</ref>\n\n====Pogrom: October 19th\u201321st====\n\nThe bulk of the October Pogrom took place on October 19-21 and was worst on October 20. Violence spread all over Odessa, from the city center, to the suburbs, and to nearby villages. The rioters demonstrated excellent organization throughout sections of Odessa, coordinating their numbers based on the size of the neighborhood under attack. Rather than working to protect Jews and end the pogrom, many policemen and soldiers wearing civilian clothes watched or participated in the massacre.

M. Neidhart, and the commander of the Odessa military garrison, [[Alexander von Kaulbars|A. V. Kaul'bars]], appeared in the streets, and told the rioters to get off the streets and go home.

The first Odessa pogrom, in 1821, was linked to the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek War for Independence]], during which the Jews were accused of sympathizing with the Ottoman authorities and of aiding the Turks in killing the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople, [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]], dragging his dead body through the streets and finally throwing it into the [[Bosphorus]].<ref>Ariel Parkansky \"[http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/odessa/LIF_violence.asp Anti-Semitism and Pogroms]\" KehilaLinks</ref></blockquote>\n\n==1859 pogrom==\nAccording to the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1906 ed.),\n\n<blockquote>The community did not escape the horrors of the pogrom. Indeed, the very first pogrom in Russia occurred in Odessa in the year 1859. This was in reality not a Russian but a Greek pogrom; for the leaders and almost all of the participants were Greek sailors from ships in the harbor, and local Greeks who joined them. The pogrom occurred on a Christian Easter; and the local press, in no wise unfriendly to the Jews, attempted to transform it into an accidental fight, the Greek colony at that time being dominant in the administration as well as in the commerce of Odessa. Further pogroms occurred in 1871, 1881, and 1886.\"<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=23&letter=O&search=odessa%20pogrom \"Odessa\"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', 1906 ed.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorians note economic antagonism between the two urban minorities, in addition to religious frictions.<ref>''The Revolution of 1905 in Odessa: Blood on the Steps'', Robert Weinberg, p. 16</ref>\n\n==1871 pogrom==\nHowever, after 1871, the pogroms in Odessa took a form more typical of the rest of the Russian empire: \"Although the pogrom of 1871 was occasioned in part by a rumor that Jews had vandalized the Greek community's church, many non-Greeks participated to it. Russian resentment and hostility toward Jews came to the fore in the pogrom of 1871 as Russians joined Greeks in attacks on Jews. Thereafter, Russians filled the ranks of pogromist mobs in 1881, 1900, and 1905.\"<ref>Ariel Parkansky \"[http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/odessa/LIF_violence.asp Anti-Semitism and Pogroms]\" KehilaLinks</ref>  In the 1881 and 1905 pogroms, many Greek houses were also destroyed.<ref>''Port Jews: Jewish Communities in Cosmopolitan Maritime Trading Centres'', 1550, David Cesarani, p. 168</ref>\n\nThe 1871 pogrom is seen as something of a turning point in Russian Jewish history: \"The Odessa pogrom led some Jewish publicists, exemplified by the writer [[Peretz Smolenskin]], to question belief in the possibility of Jewish integration into Christian society, and to call for a greater awareness of Jewish national identity.\"<ref>[[John Klier]] \"[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Pogroms Pogroms]\" ''YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe''</ref>\n\n==1881\u20131906 period==\n{{main|Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire}}\nIn the post-1871 period, pogroms were often perpetrated with tacit approval of the Tsarist authorities.<ref>''Nicholas II.

According to [[Edward Radzinsky]], [[Sergei Witte]], who was appointed Chairman of the [[Russian Council of Ministers]] in 1905, remarked in his ''Memoirs'' that he found that some proclamations inciting pogroms were printed and distributed by Police.</ref> Evidence exists that during the 1905 pogrom, the army supported the mob:\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik [[Osip Pyatnitsky|Piatnitsky]] who was in Odessa at the time recalls what happened: \"There I saw the following scene: a gang of young men, between 25 and 20 years old, among whom there were plain-clothes policemen and members of the Okhrana, were rounding up anyone who looked like a Jew\u2014men, women and children\u2014stripping them naked and beating them mercilessly... We immediately organised a group of revolutionaries armed with revolvers... we ran up to them and fired at them. They ran away. But suddenly between us and the pogromists there appeared a solid wall of soldiers, armed to the teeth and facing us. We retreated. The soldiers went away, and the pogromists came out again. This happened a few times. It became clear to us that the pogromists were acting together with the military.\"<ref>Alan Woods.

Part Two: The First Russian Revolution</ref></blockquote>\n\n==1905 Pogrom==\n\nThe 1905 Pogrom of Odessa was the worst anti-Jewish pogrom in Odessa's history. Between October 18 and 22, 1905, ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Greeks killed over 400 [[Jews]] and damaged or destroyed over 1600 Jewish properties.<ref>Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persection, Volume 2, L\u2013Z\n, ed. Richard S. Levy (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2005), s.v. \"Odessa Pogroms.\"</ref>\n\n===Background of Jews in Odessa===\n\nThe city of Odessa, founded in the late 18th century, encouraged foreign immigration, especially for the purpose of promoting economic growth. For this reason, Jews were far more welcome in Odessa than in many other parts of the [[Pale of Settlement]]. Nonetheless, Jews of Odessa were not viewed as equal to non-Jewish residents and were familiar with [[anti-Semitism]]. A number of serious anti-Jewish pogroms occurred during the 19th century in Odessa, and rumors of a pogrom appeared each year around Eastertime. Jewish and Russian youths also often got into violent fights with each other.<ref>Robert Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" in Pogroms: Anti-Jewish Violence in Modern Russian History, ed. John D. Klier and Shlomo Lambroza. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 250-251.</ref>\n\n===Causes===\n\nThe combination of economic downturn, Jewish backing of Japan in the war against Russia, Jewish opposition to the [[October Manifesto]], and the June 1905 massacre all contributed to great tension between Gentiles and the Jewish community in Odessa in 1905.\n\n====Long-term causes====\n\nAnti-Semitism among Greeks:\n\nGrowing anti-Semitism as a result of the changing place of Jews in Odessa's economy created an environment conducive to a pogrom. When the [[Crimean War]] disrupted trade routes, many Greek commercial firms shifted their business out of Odessa due to bankruptcy or a willingness to seek more profitable trading locations. To fill the resulting vacuum in grain trade, Jewish merchants expanded business and began to acquire greater profits. Many factors contributed to the spread of anti-Semitism among Greeks in Odessa including: the success of many Jewish traders, their preferential hiring of Jewish workers, and rumors of hostile actions by Jews toward Greeks.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 251.</ref>\n\nAnti-Semitism among Russians:\n\nMany Russians blamed the Jews for their troubles, such as limited employment opportunities and lower wages. They cited dramatic Jewish population growth in Odessa, from 14% (14,000 of 100,000) in 1858 to 35% (140,000 of 400,000) in 1897. These numbers contributed to suspicion that Jews possessed great wealth, power, and influence in Odessa. Although by the end of the 19th century Jews held high positions in manufacturing, the majority of wealth in Odessa belonged to non-Jews. Jews certainly did not dominate the economy of Odessa, nor did they control Odessa politically.<ref>Robert Weinberg, \"Anti-Jewish Violence and Revolution in Late Imperial Russia,\" in Riots and Pogroms, ed. Paul Brass. (New York: New York University Press, 1996), 58\u201359.</ref> Unlike other ethnic and religious groups, wealthy Jews could not transform wealth into political power. Out of 3449 total staff, only 71 Jews worked for the imperial government. After an 1892 civic reform, Jews could no longer elect representatives to city councils; instead, a special office for municipal affairs appointed six Jews to the sixty-person Odessa city council.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 254.</ref> Given that 35% of Odessa's population in 1897 consisted of Jews, the 10% Jewish city council was hardly representative.\n\n====Immediate causes====\n\nA significant economic downturn in Odessa at the turn of the 20th century played a major part in the October Pogrom. Restricted trading, reduced industrial production, and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] led to high unemployment in Odessa. Many despised Jews for lay-offs during the economic recession. Hatred for Jews heightened when a number of Jews did not support the war with Japan. Patriotic Russians called Jews unpatriotic and disloyal.<ref>Herlihy, Patricia. \"A Decade of Disturbance, 1904-1914\", in ''Odessa: A History 1794-1914''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press (1986) pg. 304.</ref>\n\nFear of a pogrom in April 1905 prompted the National Committee of Jewish Self-Defense to urge Jews to arm themselves and protect their property. Non-Jews were threatened with armed retaliation if a pogrom occurred. Although a pogrom did not take place until October, fear of one re-emerged in June when Jews were declared culpable for instigating shootings as well as fires at the port. On June 13, 1905, [[Cossack]]s shot several striking workers. The next day, large groups of workers stopped working and attacked police with rocks and guns.  The [[Russian battleship Potemkin|battleship ''Potemkin'']], whose crew had mutinied on June 14, arrived in Odessa that evening. Thousands of Odessans went to the port to see the battleship and support the mutinous sailors. During the afternoon of 15 June, the unruly crowd began to raid warehouses and set fire to wooden buildings in the harbor. Chaos ensued when, in order to prevent further unrest, the military blocked off the harbor and fired into the crowd. Strikes, disorder, and the arrival of ''Potemkin'' caused the death of over 1,000 people at the [[Port of Odessa]]. A few days after the atrocious incident at the harbor, an anti-Semitic pamphlet called ''Odesskie dni'' (\"Odessan Days\") appeared, blaming the Jews for the tragedy. ''Odesskie dni'' demanded compensation by Jews to the non-Jews, disarmament of Jews in Odessa, and a search of all Jewish apartments in the city.<ref>Weinberg, ''The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa'', pg. 256.</ref> Although the events of June did not immediately cause a pogrom, an anti-Semitic environment had been formed, sufficient for the October Pogrom.\n\nOn October 17, Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] issued the [[October Manifesto]], which established civil liberties for the people and promised to create an elected assembly. It was reported in Odessa on October 18, causing celebration in the streets. Jews hoped that the Manifesto would lead to greater freedom and less anti-Semitism in the Russian Empire.<ref>Weinberg, Robert. \"Breathing Spell and Renewed Confrontation\", in ''The Revolution of 1905 In Odessa: Blood On The Steps''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1993. pg. 161.</ref> While many Jews and liberals in Odessa celebrated the October Manifesto, conservatives saw the document as a threat to the autocracy and the might of the Russian Empire.\n\n===The October Pogrom===\n\n====Buildup to pogrom: October 14th\u201317th====\n\nOn October 14, a number of high school students skipped classes and attempted, but failed, to join rallies taking place at the university due to police intervention. In the process of intercepting them, armed policeman injured several children.<ref>Herlihy, \"A Decade of Disturbance, 1904-1914,\" 305.</ref> The next day, radical students and revolutionaries armed themselves and encouraged other workers to lend them support.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 260.</ref> On October 16, students and workers took to the streets and erected barricades. To try to preserve order, the police fought them and killed several students. Although a public funeral had been planned for the students, the Odessa city governor, D. M. Neidhart, had the bodies buried secretly to limit rallying around the deaths.<ref>Herlihy, \"A Decade of Disturbance, 1904-1914,\" 306-307.</ref> On October 17, the police and military continued to monitor the streets, though no major confrontations occurred. About 4000 workers, including many Jews, went on strike.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 260.</ref>\n\n====Crisis: October 18th====\n\nOn October 18, Jews and liberals cheered over the news of the October Manifesto. Although demonstrations began peacefully, they quickly turned violent. Those chanting anti-regime propaganda caused trouble when they took out red flags and anti-imperial propaganda. As violence increased between supporters and opponents of the October Manifesto, members of the latter group began to take out their anger on Odessa's Jews, identifying them as the root of Russia's troubles. When a group of Jews asked a few Russian workers to show respect to a red flag, a fight broke out on the streets and soon turned into an anti-Jewish riot.<ref>Weinberg, \"The Pogrom of 1905 in Odessa,\" 260\u2013262.</ref>\n\n====Pogrom: October 19th\u201321st====\n\nThe bulk of the October Pogrom took place on October 19-21 and was worst on October 20. Violence spread all over Odessa, from the city center, to the suburbs, and to nearby villages. The rioters demonstrated excellent organization throughout sections of Odessa, coordinating their numbers based on the size of the neighborhood under attack. Rather than working to protect Jews and end the pogrom, many policemen and soldiers wearing civilian clothes watched or participated in the massacre. Though they suffered many casualties and were eventually vanquished, Jewish self-defense forces successfully defended some houses as well as streets and even neighborhoods.<ref>Herlihy, pg. 306.</ref>\n\nOn October 21, after much of the pogrom was over, the city governor of Odessa, D. M. Neidhart, and the commander of the Odessa military garrison, [[Alexander von Kaulbars|A. V. Kaul'bars]], appeared in the streets, and told the rioters to get off the streets and go home. Neidhart and Kaul'bars' inaction up to this point became the subject of debate and led to Neidhart's subsequent resignation from office.<ref>Herlihy, pg. 306\u2013307.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath and Jewish response===\n\nVarious reports estimate the number of Jews killed in the October Pogrom from 302 to 1,000. Other relevant statistics from the pogrom include approximately 5,000 injured Jews, 3.75 million rubles in property damage, 1,400 ruined business, and 3,000 families forced into poverty. The Odessa Jewish Central Committee to Aid the Victims of the Pogroms of 1905 collected 672,833 rubles from Jews in Odessa and abroad to aid those hurt by the pogrom. In total, the committee assisted 2,499 families affected by the October Pogrom.<ref>Herlihy, pg. 307.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[1941 Odessa massacre]]\n* [[Odessa Museum of the Regional History]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book\n| first =Robert\n| last =Weinberg\n| authorlink =\n| editor1 =John D.

Kimba was born in 1926 in [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]]. Following the completion of his studies he worked as a journalist and became editor-in-chief of the ''Essor du Congo''. In 1958 he and a group of Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring [[Kasa\u00ef region]] founded the [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In 1960 the Congo became independent and shortly thereafter [[Moise Tshombe]] declared the secession of the [[State of Katanga]]. Kimba played an active role in the separatist state's government as its Minister of Foreign Affairs and participated in numerous talks with the central government aimed at political reconciliation. Following the collapse of the secession in early 1963, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe and took up several ministerial posts in the new province of South Katanga.\n\nTshombe was later made Prime Minister of the Congo while Kimba joined the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) party. On 13 October 1965 [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Tshombe and appointed Kimba Prime Minister. Kimba formed a [[government of national unity]] and spent the following weeks attempting to achieve [[rapprochement]] between the Congo and other African states. However, his government failed to obtain a [[vote of confidence]] from [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]], though Kasa-Vubu reappointed Kimba to the premiership in the face of determined opposition from Tshombe's supporters. On 25 November Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. In May 1966 Mobutu's government accused Kimba of plotting with three other former government ministers to launch a coup. He was executed on 2 June for treason.\n\n==Early life==\n\u00c9variste Kimba was born on 16 July 1926 in the village of Nsaka, [[Bukama Territory]], [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]].<ref name= nyt/>{{sfn|Gerard-Libois|Verhaegen|2015|p=353}} Ethnically, he was a member of [[Luba people|Luba]] tribe.<ref name= link>{{cite news| title = Congo: Kasavubu Acts| newspaper = Link| volume = 8| page = 28| date = 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CDZWAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His father was a railway worker.

and [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] of the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 13 October to 25 November 1965. Kimba was born in 1926 in [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]]. Following the completion of his studies he worked as a journalist and became editor-in-chief of the ''Essor du Congo''. In 1958 he and a group of Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring [[Kasa\u00ef region]] founded the [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In 1960 the Congo became independent and shortly thereafter [[Moise Tshombe]] declared the secession of the [[State of Katanga]]. Kimba played an active role in the separatist state's government as its Minister of Foreign Affairs and participated in numerous talks with the central government aimed at political reconciliation. Following the collapse of the secession in early 1963, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe and took up several ministerial posts in the new province of South Katanga.\n\nTshombe was later made Prime Minister of the Congo while Kimba joined the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) party. On 13 October 1965 [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Tshombe and appointed Kimba Prime Minister. Kimba formed a [[government of national unity]] and spent the following weeks attempting to achieve [[rapprochement]] between the Congo and other African states. However, his government failed to obtain a [[vote of confidence]] from [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]], though Kasa-Vubu reappointed Kimba to the premiership in the face of determined opposition from Tshombe's supporters. On 25 November Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. In May 1966 Mobutu's government accused Kimba of plotting with three other former government ministers to launch a coup. He was executed on 2 June for treason.\n\n==Early life==\n\u00c9variste Kimba was born on 16 July 1926 in the village of Nsaka, [[Bukama Territory]], [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]].<ref name= nyt/>{{sfn|Gerard-Libois|Verhaegen|2015|p=353}} Ethnically, he was a member of [[Luba people|Luba]] tribe.<ref name= link>{{cite news| title = Congo: Kasavubu Acts| newspaper = Link| volume = 8| page = 28| date = 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CDZWAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His father was a railway worker.

At the first session of the new Parliament on 13 October 1965, Kasa-Vubu unexpectedly announced that Tshombe's transitional government had fulfilled its purpose. He named Kimba the new Prime Minister and tasked him with forming a [[government of national unity]].{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|pp=49\u201350}}<ref name= fdc/> Kimba had little personal following or national reputation and thus was considered inoffensive to members of Parliament and of little threat to Kasa-Vubu's ambitions. Kasa-Vubu also hoped that by appointing another Katangese to the post, he would avoid aggravating persisting secessionist sentiment in Katanga.<ref name= link/> Kimba's government was installed on 18 October,<ref>{{cite news| title = Kasavubu Installs New Congo Regime| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 12| date = 19 October 1965}}</ref> representing 16 of the 39 political parties with members in Parliament.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=51}}\n\nKimba's government was markedly less amicable towards Belgian interests than Tshombe's administration and more nationalistic,{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=162}} and aimed to curb Western influence in Congolese affairs.<ref name =AfricanWorld/> The new cabinet sought to improve the Congo's relations with active countries in the [[Organisation of African Unity]] including Ethiopia and Ghana, and to distance itself from the members of the [[African and Malagasy Union|African and Malagasy Common Organisation]].<ref name =AfricanWorld>{{cite news| title = Congo's \"National Unity\" Government: Mr. Tshombe a Likely Candidate for the Presidency| newspaper = African World| page = 15| date = December 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H4kXAQAAMAAJ}}</ref> The government opened negotiations with [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]], and on 5 November Kimba announced that in its first step towards rehabilitating the Congo's ties with African states his government was renewing cross-river ferry traffic between Brazzaville and L\u00e9opoldville, which had been suspended for two years.<ref>{{cite news| title = Leopoldville Reopening Ferry to Brazzaville| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 2| date = 6 November 1965}}</ref> The following day he formally reestablished diplomatic relations with Congo-Brazzaville.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=90}}<ref>{{cite news| title = 2 Congos Resumes Ties After 2 Years| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 55| agency = United Press International| date = 7 November 1965}}</ref> He also reopened the Congo-Uganda border, which had been closed since February.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=90}} Kimba revised the composition of his government on 8 November.{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2018|p=541}}\n\nTshombe's removal from power angered his supporters, and in the following weeks they competed with anti-Tshombe partisans for dominance in Parliament. On 14 November the Kimba Government was presented to the legislature for a formal [[vote of confidence]]. It was defeated, 72 to 76 in the Chamber of Deputies and 49 to 58 in the Senate.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|pp=50\u201351}} The next day Kasa-Vubu renominated Kimba as Prime Minister, resulting in a political deadlock.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=51}} On 25 November, Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], who had previously supported Kimba, launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=52}} Colonel [[L\u00e9onard Mulamba]] was appointed to replace Kimba.{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2018|p=542}}\n\n==Arrest and death==\nIn May 1966 Kimba and former government ministers [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Anany]], [[Emmanuel Bamba]], and [[Alexandre Mahamba]] were arrested by Mobutu's security forces while attending a meeting with military officials. They were taken to a military camp and tortured. Mobutu's regime accused them of plotting to assassinate Mobutu and Prime Minister Mulamba and overthrow the government. On 30 May the four men were tried before a [[military tribunal]]. The trial lasted an hour and a half and the accused were allowed no legal counsel.{{sfn|Ikambana|2006|p=56}} They pleaded innocence, claiming that they had been working at the behest of officers in the army.
