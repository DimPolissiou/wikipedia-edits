Historically, the operating system was a proprietary product, but it became [[Open-source software|open source]] in 2015, released under a 3-clause [[BSD License]].\n\n==Development==\nCoherent was not Unix; the Mark Williams Company had no rights to either the Unix [[trademark]] or the [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]/[[Bell Labs]] source code. In the early years of its existence, MWC received a visit from an AT&T delegation looking to determine whether MWC was infringing on AT&T Unix property. The delegation included [[Dennis Ritchie]], who concluded that \"it was very hard to believe that Coherent and its basic applications were not created without considerable study of the OS code and details of its applications.\" However, he also stated that:<ref>{{Cite newsgroup\n|title=Re: Coherent\n|author=Dennis Ritchie\n|date=April 10, 1998\n|newsgroup=alt.folklore.computers\n|message-id=352DC4B7.3030@bell-labs.com\n|url=https://groups.google.com/group/alt.folklore.computers/msg/8477ba2953351ee4\n}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|[...] looking at various corners [for peculiarities, bugs, etc. that I knew about in the Unix distributions of the time] I couldn't find anything that was copied. It might have been that some parts were written with [AT&T] source nearby, but at least the effort had been made to rewrite. If it came to it, I could never honestly testify [...] that what they generated was irreproducible from the manual.}}\n\nMuch of the operating system was written by alumni from the [[University of Waterloo]]: [[Tom Duff]], Dave Conroy, Randall Howard, Johann George, and Trevor John Thompson. Significant contributions were also made by people such as Nigel Bree (from Auckland, New Zealand), the later author of [[Ghost (disk utility)|Ghost]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nesssoftware.com/home/mwc/manual.php|title = Preface|date = 1994|accessdate = |website = COHERENT manual|publisher = Mark Williams Company|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n==Versions==\nCoherent was originally written for the [[PDP-11]] range of minicomputers in 1980, then ported to various early 1980s [[microcomputer]] systems including [[IBM PC compatible]]s and machines based on the [[Zilog Z8000]] and [[Motorola 68000]].

Historically, the operating system was a proprietary product, but it became [[Open-source software|open source]] in 2015, released under a 3-clause [[BSD License]].\n\n==Development==\nCoherent was not Unix; the Mark Williams Company had no rights to either the Unix [[trademark]] or the [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]/[[Bell Labs]] source code. In the early years of its existence, MWC received a visit from an AT&T delegation looking to determine whether MWC was infringing on AT&T Unix property. The delegation included [[Dennis Ritchie]], who concluded that \"it was very hard to believe that Coherent and its basic applications were not created without considerable study of the OS code and details of its applications.\" However, he also stated that:<ref>{{Cite newsgroup\n|title=Re: Coherent\n|author=Dennis Ritchie\n|date=April 10, 1998\n|newsgroup=alt.folklore.computers\n|message-id=352DC4B7.3030@bell-labs.com\n|url=https://groups.google.com/group/alt.folklore.computers/msg/8477ba2953351ee4\n}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|[...] looking at various corners [for peculiarities, bugs, etc. that I knew about in the Unix distributions of the time] I couldn't find anything that was copied.

The last episode was written as a [[cliffhanger]], but MTV did not pick the series up for a second season. With the decline of the format, as of 2019, ''Spyder Games'' is the last new American soap opera to debut on a traditional, non-streaming broadcast or cable TV network.\n\n==Origins==\nIn December 1998, MTV Series Development approached novelist and television writer [[Christian McLaughlin]] and his writing partner [[Valerie Ahern]] about developing a soap opera targeting the network's 12- to 24-year-old [[demographics|demographic]].<ref name=\"McLaughlin\"/> According to McLaughlin, \"We wanted to do for soaps what ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' had done for horror films.  That movie acknowledged and even spoofed the conventions and staples of [[slasher film]]s while never forgetting it was one ... We wanted to distill everything people loved about soaps &mdash; the impossibly hot young characters and deliciously suspenseful [[melodrama]] &mdash; and eliminate all the things people hate: the glacial pace, the endless recaps and all that praying and crying.\" <ref name=\"McLaughlin\"/> [[James Stanley (writer)|James Stanley]] and [[Diane Messina Stanley]] helped the show's creators by serving as [[Creative Consultant|Story Consultants]] before it debuted.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe show centers on a wealthy [[video game]]-producing family and the unexpected murder of the patriarch, Boris Carlisle, who is in control of the company. A widower with four children (Natalia, Dmitri, Ivan and Sasha), Carlisle exhibits an irrational and unconcealed hatred (for apparently [[misogyny|misogynistic]] reasons) for daughter Natalia, the sole Carlisle child interested in the success of the family's video game business, the titular Spyder Games. Carlsle instead places all of his interest and value in Dmitri, the oldest son, while second son Ivan's sensitivity is rewarded with Carlisle's barely concealed contempt. Youngest son Sasha, a teen much younger than his siblings, is superficially indulged.\n\nDmitri becomes romantically involved with Daphne, a fashion designer, but through mistaken identity is deceived into having sex with Daphne's conniving employee Taylor. Concealing a [[trailer trash]] past while working secretly as a [[call girl]], Taylor then supposedly becomes pregnant with Dmitri's child. Ivan marries Julie Whitmore, the daughter of another wealthy local businessman, but then reveals he is gay as he is undeniably attracted to Francisco, a male houseguest in the Carlisles' home and one-time flame of Natalia's. Sasha pursues a career as a serious musician but is frustrated at being typecast as a teen idol in the style of [[Aaron Carter]]; indifferent and easily distracted, he breaks the heart of Cherish, a high school classmate with a hard [[limerence|crush]] on him who is also his most loyal fan. Meanwhile, Natalia struggles to conduct business at Spyder Games, constantly opposed and undermined by her father, who demonstrates many unscrupulous behaviors, both personal and professional. A host of additional characters move in and out of the Carlisles' dealings, including private investigator Jeff Northcutt, Taylor's ex-convict brother Lyle and Natalia's creepily devoted lackey Todd. Eventually Sasha is revealed to be Natalia's son instead of brother, fathered by Ivan's wife Julie's father when Natalia was about thirteen years old.

The last episode was written as [[cliffhanger]], but MTV did not pick the series up for a second season. With the decline of the format, as of 2019, ''Spyder Games'' is the last new American soap opera to debut on a traditional, non-streaming broadcast or cable TV network.\n\n==Origins==\nIn December 1998, MTV Series Development approached novelist and television writer [[Christian McLaughlin]] and his writing partner [[Valerie Ahern]] about developing a soap opera targeting the network's 12- to 24-year-old [[demographics|demographic]].<ref name=\"McLaughlin\"/> According to McLaughlin, \"We wanted to do for soaps what ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' had done for horror films.  That movie acknowledged and even spoofed the conventions and staples of [[slasher film]]s while never forgetting it was one ... We wanted to distill everything people loved about soaps &mdash; the impossibly hot young characters and deliciously suspenseful [[melodrama]] &mdash; and eliminate all the things people hate: the glacial pace, the endless recaps and all that praying and crying.\" <ref name=\"McLaughlin\"/> [[James Stanley (writer)|James Stanley]] and [[Diane Messina Stanley]] helped the show's creators by serving as [[Creative Consultant|Story Consultants]] before it debuted.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe show centers on a wealthy [[video game]]-producing family and the unexpected murder of the patriarch, Boris Carlisle, who is in control of the company. A widower with four children (Natalia, Dmitri, Ivan and Sasha), Carlisle exhibits an irrational and unconcealed hatred (for apparently [[misogyny|misogynistic]] reasons) for daughter Natalia, the sole Carlisle child interested in the success of the family's video game business, the titular Spyder Games. Carlsle instead places all of his interest and value in Dmitri, the oldest son, while second son Ivan's sensitivity is rewarded with Carlisle's barely concealed contempt. Youngest son Sasha, a teen much younger than his siblings, is superficially indulged.\n\nDmitri becomes romantically involved with Daphne, a fashion designer, but through mistaken identity is deceived into having sex with Daphne's conniving employee Taylor. Concealing a [[trailer trash]] past while working secretly as a [[call girl]], Taylor then supposedly becomes pregnant with Dmitri's child. Ivan marries Julie Whitmore, the daughter of another wealthy local businessman, but then reveals he is gay as he is undeniably attracted to Francisco, a male houseguest in the Carlisles' home and one-time flame of Natalia's. Sasha pursues a career as a serious musician but is frustrated at being typecast as a teen idol in the style of [[Aaron Carter]]; indifferent and easily distracted, he breaks the heart of Cherish, a high school classmate with a hard [[limerence|crush]] on him who is also his most loyal fan. Meanwhile, Natalia struggles to conduct business at Spyder Games, constantly opposed and undermined by her father, who demonstrates many unscrupulous behaviors, both personal and professional. A host of additional characters move in and out of the Carlisles' dealings, including private investigator Jeff Northcutt, Taylor's ex-convict brother Lyle and Natalia's creepily devoted lackey Todd. Eventually Sasha is revealed to be Natalia's son instead of brother, fathered by Ivan's wife Julie's father when Natalia was about thirteen years old. As the episodes progress, a mysterious series of events lead to Boris' murder and the discovery of his severed head in a freezer.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Shawn Batten]] as Natalia Carlisle\n* J.R.

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

The project's budget was $257 million, with completion anticipated in 1972. Extreme construction problems caused years of delays and costs soared. The [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979 resulted in a massive change in nuclear regulatory requirements and system redesign. When it was revealed that the containment buildings were settling and foundation cracks were discovered, Dow canceled their contract with Consumers Power, and the project was abandoned in 1984. The $4.1 billion investment nearly bankrupted Consumers Power. However, in 1985, Consumers Power formed a partnership with eight other companies to convert Midland's abandoned nuclear plant into a gas-fired power plant. Transformation of the plant began in 1986 and was completed at a cost of $500 million. The [[Midland Cogeneration Venture]] began producing power in 1991 and that success restored faith in Consumers Power.<ref>Hylton, Richard D.: [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/25/business/market-place-nuclear-write-off-to-success-story.html \"Market Place; Nuclear Write-Off To Success Story\"] New York Times, September 25, 1989</ref><ref name=MDN>Lascari, Tony: [http://www.ourmidland.com/news/article_db29740c-20aa-11e0-81b0-001cc4c002e0.html \"Former Midlander, \u2018Pioneer for the Environment\u2019, dies at 92\"] Midland Daily News, January 15, 2011</ref> The facility now produces 10% of the power consumption for the lower peninsula of Michigan.<ref name=EQT>[http://www.eqt.se/en/Portfolio/Companies/MCV/ \"Midland Cogeneration Venture\"] EQT Private Equity Funds, Investments</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bobby Anderson (American football)|Bobby Anderson]], NFL player, member of [[College Football Hall of Fame]]\n* [[Dick Anderson]], safety for undefeated [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]]\n* [[Jeff Backus]], former offensive tackle for [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Detroit Lions]]\n* [[Mary Brown (Michigan politician)|Mary Brown]], Michigan state legislator and educator\n* [[David Lee Camp]], former member of [[United States House of Representatives]]<ref>{{cite dictionary|url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=c000071|title=CAMP, David Lee, (1953\u2013)|dictionary= Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate= October 14, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Cohrs]], member of Court and Financial Policy Committee [[Bank of England]]\n* [[Terry Collins]], manager of [[New York Mets]]\n* [[Mikey \"Bug\" Cox]], ex-drummer of [[Coal Chamber]]\n* [[Alden B.

Here agents purchased furs from [[Ojibwe people|Ojibwe]] trappers.  The [[Campau family]] of Detroit operated an independent trading post at this location in the late 1820s.<ref>''History of Saginaw County, Michigan'' (Chicago: Charles C.

The project's budget was $257 million, with completion anticipated in 1972. Extreme construction problems caused years of delays and costs soared. The [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979 resulted in a massive change in nuclear regulatory requirements and system redesign. When it was revealed that the containment buildings were settling and foundation cracks were discovered, Dow canceled their contract with Consumers Power, and the project was abandoned in 1984. The $4.1 billion investment nearly bankrupted Consumers Power. However, in 1985, Consumers Power formed a partnership with eight other companies to convert Midland's abandoned nuclear plant into a gas-fired power plant. Transformation of the plant began in 1986 and was completed at a cost of $500 million. The [[Midland Cogeneration Venture]] began producing power in 1991 and that success restored faith in Consumers Power.<ref>Hylton, Richard D.: [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/25/business/market-place-nuclear-write-off-to-success-story.html \"Market Place; Nuclear Write-Off To Success Story\"] New York Times, September 25, 1989</ref><ref name=MDN>Lascari, Tony: [http://www.ourmidland.com/news/article_db29740c-20aa-11e0-81b0-001cc4c002e0.html \"Former Midlander, \u2018Pioneer for the Environment\u2019, dies at 92\"] Midland Daily News, January 15, 2011</ref> The facility now produces 10% of the power consumption for the lower peninsula of Michigan.<ref name=EQT>[http://www.eqt.se/en/Portfolio/Companies/MCV/ \"Midland Cogeneration Venture\"] EQT Private Equity Funds, Investments</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bobby Anderson (American football)|Bobby Anderson]], NFL player, member of [[College Football Hall of Fame]]\n* [[Dick Anderson]], safety for undefeated [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]]\n* [[Jeff Backus]], former offensive tackle for [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Detroit Lions]]\n* [[Mary Brown (Michigan politician)|Mary Brown]], Michigan state legislator and educator\n* [[David Lee Camp]], former member of [[United States House of Representatives]]<ref>{{cite dictionary|url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=c000071|title=CAMP, David Lee, (1953\u2013)|dictionary= Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate= October 14, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Cohrs]], member of Court and Financial Policy Committee [[Bank of England]]\n* [[Terry Collins]], manager of [[New York Mets]]\n* [[Mikey \"Bug\" Cox]], ex-drummer of [[Coal Chamber]]\n* [[Alden B.
