Based on information obtained during the investigation, Salichov was lacking sufficient piloting skills and was granted piloting on a basis of falsified documents...\n\nOn 19 November 2013, the Investigation Board of the IAC reported the following preliminary details after recovering some information from the flight data recorder:<ref>[https://mak-iac.org/rassledovaniya/17-noyabrya-boing-737-500-vq-bbn/ Interstate Aviation Committee.

Having realized the aircraft was not lined-up properly relative to the runway, the crew reported to the [[Air traffic controller|ATC]] and started to [[go-around]] using the [[Takeoff/Go-around switches|TOGA]] (Take Off / Go Around) mode. One of the two [[autopilot]]s, which was active during the final approach, has been switched off and the flight was being controlled manually.\n\nThe engines reached thrust level close to full. The crew retracted the [[flaps (aircraft)|flaps]] from 30 degrees to 15 degrees position.\n\nAffected by the upturn moment generated by the engine thrust, the aircraft started to [[climb (aeronautics)|climb]], reaching the [[Flight dynamics|pitch angle]] of about 25 degrees. [[Indicated airspeed]] has started to decrease. The crew retracted the [[landing gear]]. Since initiating the go-around maneuver up to this moment the crew did not perform control actions through the [[Yoke (aircraft)|yoke]].\n\nAfter the airspeed decreased from 150 to 125 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], the crew started control actions through the yoke, pitching nose down, which has led to stopping climb then starting descent and increase of the airspeed. Maximum [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] have not exceeded operational limits during the flight.\n\nAfter reaching the [[Altitude#Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight|altitude]] of 700 meters, the aircraft started a steep nosedive, with the pitch angle reaching \u221275\u00b0 by the end of the flight (end of the recording).\n\nThe aircraft collided with terrain at high speed (exceeding 450&nbsp;km/h) and with highly negative pitch angle.\n\nAbout 45 seconds have passed between the moment of starting go-around maneuver and the moment the recording stopped, the descent took about 20 seconds.\n\nThe propulsion systems were operating up to the collision with terrain. No single commands have been detected by the preliminary analysis, which would indicate failures of systems or units of the aircraft or [[Turbine engine failure|engines]].\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 24 December 2015, the IAC released their final report stating that the crash was caused by an under-qualified crew who lacked the skills to recover from an excessive nose up attitude during a go-around procedure.  The go-around was necessitated by a positional error in the navigation system, a map drift. The pilots\u2019 deficiencies were caused by lack of airline safety management and lack of regulators\u2019 oversight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/30a/report_vq-bbn.pdf|title=Archived copy|publisher=Interstate Aviation Comittee|language=Russian|trans-title=Final report|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g80WVPVQ?url=http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/dc4/report_vq-bbn.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=2016-01-17|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/459/report_vq-bbn_eng.pdf|title=Final report|publisher=Interstate Aviation Comittee|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://avherald.com/h?article=46b9ecbc/0022&opt=7680|title=Crash: Tatarstan B735 at Kazan on Nov 17th 2013, crashed on go-around|website=avherald.com|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the final report, during the final approach the crew initiated a [[go-around]], but being under high [[workload]], which possibly caused a \"[[tunnel vision]] effect\", they did not perceive warning messages related to auto-pilot disconnection. When the plane climbed to 700 m, its pitch angle reached 25 degrees and the airspeed dropped to 230&nbsp;km/h. At that moment the captain, who had not performed a go-around outside of training, moved the yoke, pitching nose down, which led to stopping climb and started a descent and increase of the aircraft's airspeed. After reaching the altitude of 700 m, the aircraft started a steep nosedive, with the pitch angle reaching \u221275\u00b0 when the aircraft impacted the ground. The plane crashed on the airport's runway with a speed exceeding 450&nbsp;km/h. The time from the start of the go-around maneuver until the impact was about 45 seconds, including 20 seconds of aircraft descent.\n\n=== Alternative opinion report ===\n\nNikolay Studenikin, the official representative of the [[Federal Air Transport Agency|Rosaviatsiya]] in the air accident investigation commission, filed an alternative opinion report, in which he expressed his disagreement with the conclusions of the commission.<ref name=alternative>{{cite web |first=Nikolay |last=Studenikin |url=http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/6e0/\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435%20\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.PDF |script-title=ru:\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 |trans-title=Alternative opinion of the Rosaviatsiya representative  |accessdate=27 March 2016 |publisher=[[Interstate Aviation Committee]] |language=ru }}</ref>\n\nIn it he stated that the IAC commission concentrated the investigation on the search of the shortcomings in the flight crew training in Russia, and that no direct connection between such shortcomings and the Flight 363 crash was actually established. He also criticized, that the investigation into the possible malfunction of the aircraft's [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]]' controls was entrusted to their manufacturer, the US-based [[Parker Hannifin|Parker Aerospace]], which ruled that their controls operated normally during the accident. According to Studenikin, a flight simulation of the crashed flight, which was conducted on the [[Boeing]] facilities, was aimed only on proving the crew's fault and didn't simulate a possible mechanical failure in the Boeing aircraft.<ref name=alternative/>\n\n=== Aircraft certificate suspension ===\n\n[[Federal Air Transport Agency|Rosaviatsiya]] refused to accept the results of the IAC's Flight 363 accident investigation, citing their concern over the Boeing 737's [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]]' controls.<ref name=\"BBC Russian 6 Nov\"/> IAC accused Rosaviatsiya, that their position is actually caused by the reluctance to accept the shortcomings of Rosaviatsiya's regulatory oversight of pilots training in Russia, which was revealed in the report.

Based on information obtained during the investigation, Salichov was lacking sufficient piloting skills and was granted piloting on a basis of falsified documents...\n\n\nOn 19 November 2013, the Investigation Board of the IAC reported the following preliminary details after recovering some information from the flight data recorder:<ref>[https://mak-iac.org/rassledovaniya/17-noyabrya-boing-737-500-vq-bbn/ Interstate Aviation Committee.

Having realized the aircraft was not lined-up properly relative to the runway, the crew reported to the [[Air traffic controller|ATC]] and started to [[go-around]] using the [[Takeoff/Go-around switches|TOGA]] (Take Off / Go Around) mode. One of the two [[autopilot]]s, which was active during the final approach, has been switched off and the flight was being controlled manually.\n\nThe engines reached thrust level close to full. The crew retracted the [[flaps (aircraft)|flaps]] from 30 degrees to 15 degrees position.\n\nAffected by the upturn moment generated by the engine thrust, the aircraft started to [[climb (aeronautics)|climb]], reaching the [[Flight dynamics|pitch angle]] of about 25 degrees. [[Indicated airspeed]] has started to decrease. The crew retracted the [[landing gear]]. Since initiating the go-around maneuver up to this moment the crew did not perform control actions through the [[Yoke (aircraft)|yoke]].\n\nAfter the airspeed decreased from 150 to 125 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], the crew started control actions through the yoke, pitching nose down, which has led to stopping climb then starting descent and increase of the airspeed. Maximum [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] have not exceeded operational limits during the flight.\n\nAfter reaching the [[Altitude#Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight|altitude]] of 700 meters, the aircraft started a steep nosedive, with the pitch angle reaching \u221275\u00b0 by the end of the flight (end of the recording).\n\nThe aircraft collided with terrain at high speed (exceeding 450&nbsp;km/h) and with highly negative pitch angle.\n\nAbout 45 seconds have passed between the moment of starting go-around maneuver and the moment the recording stopped, the descent took about 20 seconds.\n\nThe propulsion systems were operating up to the collision with terrain. No single commands have been detected by the preliminary analysis, which would indicate failures of systems or units of the aircraft or [[Turbine engine failure|engines]].\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 24 December 2015, the IAC released their final report stating that the crash was caused by an under-qualified crew who lacked the skills to recover from an excessive nose up attitude during a go-around procedure.  The go-around was necessitated by a positional error in the navigation system, a map drift. The pilots\u2019 deficiencies were caused by lack of airline safety management and lack of regulators\u2019 oversight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/30a/report_vq-bbn.pdf|title=Archived copy|publisher=Interstate Aviation Comittee|language=Russian|trans-title=Final report|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g80WVPVQ?url=http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/dc4/report_vq-bbn.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=2016-01-17|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/459/report_vq-bbn_eng.pdf|title=Final report|publisher=Interstate Aviation Comittee|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://avherald.com/h?article=46b9ecbc/0022&opt=7680|title=Crash: Tatarstan B735 at Kazan on Nov 17th 2013, crashed on go-around|website=avherald.com|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the final report, during the final approach the crew initiated a [[go-around]], but being under high [[workload]], which possibly caused a \"[[tunnel vision]] effect\", they did not perceive warning messages related to auto-pilot disconnection. When the plane climbed to 700 m, its pitch angle reached 25 degrees and the airspeed dropped to 230&nbsp;km/h. At that moment the captain, who had not performed a go-around outside of training, moved the yoke, pitching nose down, which led to stopping climb and started a descent and increase of the aircraft's airspeed. After reaching the altitude of 700 m, the aircraft started a steep nosedive, with the pitch angle reaching \u221275\u00b0 when the aircraft impacted the ground. The plane crashed on the airport's runway with a speed exceeding 450&nbsp;km/h. The time from the start of the go-around maneuver until the impact was about 45 seconds, including 20 seconds of aircraft descent.\n\n=== Alternative opinion report ===\n\nNikolay Studenikin, the official representative of the [[Federal Air Transport Agency|Rosaviatsiya]] in the air accident investigation commission, filed an alternative opinion report, in which he expressed his disagreement with the conclusions of the commission.<ref name=alternative>{{cite web |first=Nikolay |last=Studenikin |url=http://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/6e0/\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435%20\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.PDF |script-title=ru:\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 |trans-title=Alternative opinion of the Rosaviatsiya representative  |accessdate=27 March 2016 |publisher=[[Interstate Aviation Committee]] |language=ru }}</ref>\n\nIn it he stated that the IAC commission concentrated the investigation on the search of the shortcomings in the flight crew training in Russia, and that no direct connection between such shortcomings and the Flight 363 crash was actually established. He also criticized, that the investigation into the possible malfunction of the aircraft\u2019s [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]]' controls was entrusted to their manufacturer, the US-based [[Parker Hannifin|Parker Aerospace]], which ruled that their controls operated normally during the accident.

They were established by governor [[Philip Gidley King]] by drawing men from the [[New South Wales Corps]], the British garrison in the colony.  The provided an escort to the governor and carried his dispatches to outposts across the colony.  From 1802 the men of the unit were drawn from convicts pardoned by King, after a dispute between the governor and the commander of the New South Wales Corps.  Men from the unit distinguished themselves by their conduct during operations to recapture escaped convicts in 1803 and during the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804.\n\nAfter King was succeeded by [[William Bligh]] in 1806 the body guard reverted to being drawn from the New South Wales Corps.  They seem to have been absent during the [[Rum Rebellion|Corps' 1808 mutiny against Bligh]] and by one report supported it.  The unit was ordered to disband by the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Earl of Liverpool]] in 1811/12 but granted a reprieve by Liverpool's successor [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl Bathurst]].  [[F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Viscount Goderich]] ordered disbandment again in 1832 and Governor [[Richard Bourke]] transformed the unit into the Mounted Orderlies in 1834.  These were absorbed into the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]] in 1836 and continued as a separate component until at least 1860.\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:Philip Gidley King - Project Gutenberg eText 12992.jpg|thumb|right|Governor King]]\nThe body guard were raised in the British [[Colony of New South Wales]] in late 1800, at the initiative of Governor [[Philip Gidley King]].  An order was sent from King to Lieutenant-Colonel [[William Paterson (explorer)|William Paterson]] of the [[New South Wales Corps]] on 26 December 1800, requiring the corps to provide a [[non-commissioned officer]] and six privates to act as a body guard to King.  King intended to utilise the men as messengers to carry dispatches and so specified that the men be capable of riding a horse.  Six men and a corporal were found, some of whom had formerly served in cavalry regiments, and were serving the role by early 1801.

The convicts removed Anlezark's pistol flints, rendering his weapons useless, but allowed him to return unharmed.  Johnston then decided to speak with the convict leaders in person, accompanied by Anlezark.  The convicts refused to surrender and began forming up on a nearby hill (later nicknamed Vinegar Hill).

However, when newly arrived governor [[Richard Bourke]] disclosed an expenditure of \u00a3112 16s 6d in his December 1831 report this was queried by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies [[F.

Rank was indicated by chevrons in yellow lace with gold trim.  The sergeant had plated shoulder scales, lace girdles and silver trim to the cap.

They were established by governor [[Philip Gidley King]] by drawing men from the [[New South Wales Corps]], the British garrison in the colony.  The provided an escort to the governor and carried his dispatches to outposts across the colony.  From 1802 the men of the unit were drawn from convicts pardoned by King, after a dispute between the governor and the commander of the New South Wales Corps.  Men from the unit distinguished themselves by their conduct during operations to recapture escaped convicts in 1803 and during the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion]] of 1804.\n\nAfter King was succeeded by [[William Bligh]] in 1806 the body guard reverted to being drawn from the New South Wales Corps.  They seem to have been absent during the [[Rum Rebellion|Corps' 1808 mutiny against Bligh]] and by one report supported it.  The unit was ordered to disband by the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Earl of Liverpool]] in 1811/12 but granted a reprieve by Liverpool's successor [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl Bathurst]].  [[F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Viscount Goderich]] ordered disbandment again in 1832 and Governor [[Richard Bourke]] transformed the unit into the Mounted Orderlies in 1834.  These were absorbed into the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]] in 1836 and continued as a separate component until at least 1860.\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:Philip Gidley King - Project Gutenberg eText 12992.jpg|thumb|right|Governor King]]\nThe body guard were raised in the British [[Colony of New South Wales]] in late 1800, at the initiative of Governor [[Philip Gidley King]].  An order was sent from King to Lieutenant-Colonel [[William Paterson (explorer)|William Paterson]] of the [[New South Wales Corps]] on 26 December 1800, requiring the corps to provide a [[non-commissioned officer]] and six privates to act as a body guard to King.  King intended to utilise the men as messengers to carry dispatches and so specified that the men be capable of riding a horse.  Six men and a corporal were found, some of whom had formerly served in cavalry regiments, and were serving the role by early 1801.  King provided horses and cavalry equipment from colony government funds and authorised a one shilling per day pay rise to the corporal and six-pence to the privates.

The unit was kept up to strength with replacements drawn from the British regiment on garrison duty in the colony which, from 1817, was the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot|48th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name=sargent9/>  The body guard's duties at this time included escorting the governor on visits around the colony and announcing guests at the governor's balls.<ref name=sargent9/><ref name=sargent11/>  The body guard sergeant from 1808 to 1822 was Charles Whalan who became good friends with Macquarie, accompanying him on personal holidays and being one of the last people to see him off on his return to Britain in 1821.<ref name=sargent10>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=10}}</ref>\n\n== Disbandment ==\n[[File:Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon by Sir Thomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|Viscount Goderich]]\nThe body guard survived through the governorships of [[Thomas Brisbane]] (1821-25) and [[Ralph Darling]] (1825-31).  However, when newly arrived governor [[Richard Bourke]] disclosed an expenditure of \u00a3112 16s 6d in his December 1831 report this was queried by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies [[F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Viscount Goderich]] who ordered the unit disbanded.<ref name=sargent11/>  Bourke, who considered the title of the body guard as \"much too lofty for so trifling an establishment\", responded by establishing the Mounted Orderlies as a replacement in 1834.<ref name=sargent12/><ref name=sargent11/>  These were drawn from the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]], and commanded by Bourke's aide-de-camp.<ref name=sargent11>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=11}}</ref>  Upon hearing of this Goderich ordered their disbandment also.<ref name=sargent12/>  Bourke transferred the unit to the [[New South Wales Mounted Police]] on 1 July 1836 and they continued to serve the governor until at least 1860.<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|1839|p=427}}</ref><ref name=sargent12/>\n\nClem Sargent, writing in 1998, stated that the ambiguous status of the Governor's Body Guard of Light Horse, was indicative of the difficulty the British government had in understanding the colony in this period.  The British were keen to restrict expenses incurred by the government of the colony and, without an understanding of the local conditions, saw no reason for the governor to have a personal body guard.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\n== Uniform and equipment ==\nThe body guard wore the British [[light dragoon]] uniform throughout its service.<ref name=sargent12>{{Harvnb|Sargent|1998|p=12}}</ref>  In the early period this was a blue tunic (with red facings) and breeches, a [[Tarleton helmet]], with red and yellow turban and a white plume with red tip and this uniform is depicted in the 1804 painting of Trooper Anzelark.<ref name=sargent6/>  The unit was armed with the [[pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre]].<ref name=sargent7/>  It is not known if the unit adopted the revised light dragoon uniform of 1812, which replaced the Tarleton with a bell top [[shako]] and introduced a new jacket.<ref name=sargent12/><ref>{{Harvnb|Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society|1941|p=341}}</ref>\n\nBy 1830 the body guard was wearing the revised light dragoon uniform of blue [[broadcloth]] jackets with scarlet facings and yellow ball buttons, brass [[Epaulette|shoulder scales]], blue cloth girdles with scarlet stripe, blue broadcloth dress trousers with scarlet stripes, blue broadcloth cloaks with scarlet facings, caps with black plumes, leather gloves and wellington boots.  Rank was indicated by chevrons in yellow lace with gold trim.  The sergeant had plated shoulder scales, lace girdles and silver trim to the cap.  When off duty the body guard wore white [[duck cloth]] trousers with buttons down the legs and there was an optional round jacket of the same material and facings as the formal jacket.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\nThe British light dragoon uniform changed again in 1831, in accordance with [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]'s wish to see them in red coats.  It is unlikely that this change was effected before the guard disbanded, though a later depiction of the Mounted Orderlies shows them in red coats.<ref name=sargent12/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n*{{citation|last1=Binney |first1=Keith Robert |title=Horsemen of the First Frontier (1788-1900) and the Serpent's Legacy |date=2005 |publisher=Volcanic Productions |isbn=978-0-646-44865-7 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0xYF0v8doEgC |language=en}}\n*{{citation|last1=Clune |first1=David |title=The Governors of New South Wales 1788-2010 |date=2009 |publisher=Federation Press |isbn=978-1-86287-743-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rHqv_zt_veQC |language=en}}\n*{{citation  |last1=Martin |first1=Robert Montgomery |title=Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire in the West Indies, South America, North America, Asia, Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe ...: From the Official Records of the Colonial Office |date=1839 |publisher=W.H.
