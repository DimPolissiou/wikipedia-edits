Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech.

Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracts its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords are sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments are sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=etuse>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940004970_1994004970.pdf NASA-CR-195281, \"Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system\"].

The initial design of the reusable Space Shuttle envisioned an increasingly cheap launch platform to deploy commercial and government satellites. Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]]. While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], Spacelab, and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]].  Beginning with [[STS-74]], the orbiter vehicle conducted dockings with the [[Mir space station]].

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The Kennedy Space Center was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned. ''Discovery'' was the first of NASA's three remaining operational Space Shuttles to be retired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA\u2014NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Launch Schedule |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate= July 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe final Space Shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010, but the program was later extended to July 2011 when Michael Suffredini of the ISS program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the International Space Station.<ref>{{cite web |first=John|last= Pike |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2010/space-100506-rianovosti01.htm |title=Space Shuttle may continue through next year\u2014Roscosmos |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}</ref> [[STS-135]] launched on July 8, 2011, and landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/index.html |title= Launch and Landing |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Distribution of orbiters and other hardware===\nNASA announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle program.

He was involved in the London underground counter culture scene and gained public notoriety as 'Dr John', a leader in the [[Squatting|squatter's rights]] movement but is now better known for his work on youth culture and the impact of urban regeneration on working class communities, particularly in East London, with a focus of issues of race and popular racism. More recently the scope of his work has widened to includes issues of identity politics, memory and loss, and the future of the Left in Britain Cohen\u2019s academic work is trans-disciplinary and draws on concepts from linguistics and narratology, psycho-analysis and anthropology, cultural history and social phenomenology.

His approach to labour history focuses on the split representation of the labouring body into Promethean and abject images, and how this in turn positions communities of labour as either backbones of the nation or a race apart. He argues that these fundamental binaries can either cut across or reinforce more familiar distinctions of occupational skill and moral status. In some of his research he has traced the evolution of these representations within specific social groups especially those who perform \u2018elemental\u2019 labour: miners, tunnellers, sweeps, mariners, foundry workers and roustabouts.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Phil|date=2017-08-15|title=Finding uncommon ground: working-class identity politics after Labourism|journal=Soundings|volume=66|issue=66|pages=113\u2013128|doi=10.3898/136266217821733723|issn=1362-6620}}</ref>\n\n== Unconscious racism and its other scene ==\nStarting from a critique of reductive psychologies of racism, which reduce it to patterns of prejudice, or individual pathology, Cohen looked for the social structures and cultural norms through which Freud's concept of \u2018narcissism of minor difference\u2019 might become racialised. He found these in the autochthonies which feature in myths of origin operating in discourses of nation, people , and race. Cohen argues that it is through these \u2018perversions of inheritance\u2019 that the racist imagination gains its purchase on the real and becomes 'common sense'. If the unconscious is the 'discourse of the other' (Lacan) then unconscious racism is the 'discourse of the other\u2019s discourse of the other'. Cohen argued that It follows that rationalist pedagogies favoured by anti-racists are doomed to failure since they fail to engage with the structures of disavowal which are intrinsic to racialised structures of feeling and belief.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Phil|date=2019-03-01|title=Both Sides of the Line: Stuart Hall and New Ethnicities, then and now|journal=New Formations|volume=96|issue=96|pages=147\u2013159|doi=10.3898/newf:96/97.06.2019|issn=0950-2378}}</ref><ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Left Fields: Class, Community and Identity Politics ==\nIn a series of articles for the journal ''Soundings''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Phil|date=1997-2018|title=Various|url=|journal=Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=3, 50, 60, 68, 70|pages=|via=}}</ref> Cohen argued for abandoning the classic Marxist analysis of class consciousness based on the distinction between class in and for itself, and replacing it with the notion of class from and to itself, mediated by identity formations centred on multitude or tribe. Theses imagined communities of citizens have become important actors outside and sometimes against the formal apparatus of political representation, posing a direct challenge to Social Democracy. The rise of communitarianism and populism is analysed from this standpoint and a political actor network theory proposed as a way of mapping this more fluid space of ideological affiliations and affinities. These ideas are being developed further in a study examining the political culture of the British Left following the historic defeat of the Labour Party in 2019.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Phil|title=Left Fields: Changing Ecologies of Political Radicalism|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.compass.org|title=There Must be Some Way Out of Here: Political Mindfulness and the Left in Uncertain Times|last=Cohen|first=Phil|last2=Lister|first2=Ruth|date=2020|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=Pountain|first3=Dick|last4=Rustin|first4=Mike|authorlink4=|last5=Walkerdine|first5=Valerie}}</ref>\n\n== East London ==\nOver a forty year period some twenty projects have been carried out in different parts of East London, including the Isle of Dogs, Whitechapel, The Royal Docks, Stratford and Barking.

He was involved in the London underground counter culture scene and gained public notoriety as 'Dr John', a leader in the [[Squatting|squatter's rights]] movement but is now better known for his work on youth culture and the impact of urban regeneration on working class communities, particularly in East London, with a focus of issues of race and popular racism. More recently the scope of his work has widened to includes issues of identity politics, memory and loss, and the future of the Left in Britain Cohen\u2019s academic work is trans-disciplinary and draws on concepts from linguistics and narratology, psycho-analysis and anthropology, cultural history and social phenomenology. He is currently (2020) Emeritus Professor at the Centre for Cultural Studies at the University of East London, a research fellow at the Young Foundation and Research Director of the Livingmaps Network.

His approach to labour history focuses on the split representation of the labouring body into Promethean and abject images, and how this in turn positions communities of labour as either backbones of the nation or a race apart. He argues that these fundamental binaries can either cut across or reinforce more familiar distinctions of occupational skill and moral status. In some of his research he has traced the evolution of these representations within specific social groups especially those who perform \u2018elemental\u2019 labour: miners, tunnellers, sweeps, mariners, foundry workers and roustabouts.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Phil|date=2017-08-15|title=Finding uncommon ground: working-class identity politics after Labourism|journal=Soundings|volume=66|issue=66|pages=113\u2013128|doi=10.3898/136266217821733723|issn=1362-6620}}</ref>\n\n== Unconscious racism and its other scene ==\nStarting from a critique of reductive psychologies of racism, which reduce it to patterns of prejudice, or individual pathology, Cohen looked for the social structures and cultural norms through which Freud's concept of \u2018narcissism of minor difference\u2019 might become racialised. He found these in the autochthonies which feature in myths of origin operating in discourses of nation, people , and race. Cohen argues that it is through these \u2018perversions of inheritance\u2019 that the racist imagination gains its purchase on the real and becomes 'common sense'. If the unconscious is the 'discourse of the other' (Lacan) then unconscious racism is the 'discourse of the other\u2019s discourse of the other'. Cohen argued that It follows that rationalist pedagogies favoured by anti-racists are doomed to failure since they fail to engage with the structures of disavowal which are intrinsic to racialised structures of feeling and belief.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Phil|date=2019-03-01|title=Both Sides of the Line: Stuart Hall and New Ethnicities, then and now|journal=New Formations|volume=96|issue=96|pages=147\u2013159|doi=10.3898/newf:96/97.06.2019|issn=0950-2378}}</ref><ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Left Fields: Class, Community and Identity Politics ==\nIn a series of articles for the journal ''Soundings''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Phil|date=1997-2018|title=Various|url=|journal=Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=3, 50, 60, 68, 70|pages=|via=}}</ref> Cohen argued for abandoning the classic Marxist analysis of class consciousness based on the distinction between class in and for itself, and replacing it with the notion of class from and to itself, mediated by identity formations centred on multitude or tribe. Theses imagined communities of citizens have become important actors outside and sometimes against the formal apparatus of political representation, posing a direct challenge to Social Democracy. The rise of communitarianism and populism is analysed from this standpoint and a political actor network theory proposed as a way of mapping this more fluid space of ideological affiliations and affinities. These ideas are being developed further in a study examining the political culture of the British Left following the historic defeat of the Labour Party in 2019.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Phil|title=Left Fields: Changing Ecologies of Political Radicalism|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2020|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.compass.org|title=There Must be Some Way Out of Here: Political Mindfulness and the Left in Uncertain Times|last=Cohen|first=Phil|last2=Lister|first2=Ruth|date=2020|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=Pountain|first3=Dick|last4=Rustin|first4=Mike|authorlink4=|last5=Walkerdine|first5=Valerie}}</ref>\n\n== East London ==\nOver a forty year period some twenty projects have been carried out in different parts of East London, including the Isle of Dogs, Whitechapel, The Royal Docks, Stratford and Barking.

Of the 55,000 guards who served in [[Nazi concentration camps|German Nazi concentration camps]], about 3,700 were women. In 1942, the first female guards arrived at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] from [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp|Ravensbr\u00fcck]]. The year after, the Nazis began conscripting women because of a shortage of male guards. The German title for this position, ''Aufseherin'' means (female) ''overseer'' or ''attendant''. Later female guards were dispersed to [[Bolzano]] (1944\u20131945), Kaiserwald-Riga (1943\u201344), [[Mauthausen]] (March \u2013 May 1945), [[Stutthof]] (1942\u20131945), [[Vaivara]]<ref>'Petzold, Elfriede,' appeared on a November 1, 1947 list of female war criminals held in U.S. custody at Augsburg-Goegingen, 'Central Komitet, Juridisze Optejlung, Krigsfarbrecher Referat,' as a guard in, 'Gr\u00fcneberg-Vaivara (Estland).'</ref> (1943\u20131944), [[Vught]] (1943\u20131944), and at other [[Nazi concentration camps|German Nazi concentration camps]], subcamps, work camps, detention camps, etc.\n[[File:Irma Grese.jpg|thumb|upright|Mugshot of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] guard [[Irma Grese]]]]\n[[File:Ilse Koch.png|thumb|upright|Mugshot of [[Ilse Koch]].]]\n[[File:Maria Mandel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maria Mandel]] of [[Auschwitz]]]]\n[[File:Herta Bothe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herta Bothe]], in [[Celle]] awaiting trial, August 1945]]\n[[File:Majdanek - Hermine Braunsteiner.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hermine Braunsteiner]] of KZ Majdanek]]\n\n==Recruitment==\n{{Disputed section|date=February 2017}}\nFemale guards were generally from the lower to middle class<ref>There were, however, some exceptions.

Many of them belonged to the [[Waffen-SS]] and to the [[Schutzstaffel#SS Women.27s Corps|SS-Helferinnen Corps]].<ref name=\"history.ac\">Rachel Century, [http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1183 Das SS-Helferinnenkorps] Royal Holloway, University of London.</ref><ref name=\"Rempel\">Gerhard Rempel, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=5U5kXjVq6p0C&pg=PA223&dq=%22Ernst+Sachs%22+%22the+SS+female+assistance%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=exF4UbWEFom4igL_tYHoDA&ved=0CDYQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Ernst%20Sachs%22%20%22the%20SS%20female%20assistance%22&f=false The SS Female Assistance Corps] (in) ''Hitler's Children: The Hitler Youth and the SS.''

They were never given any positional titles or equivalent [[Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|ranks of the SS]]. The supervisory levels within the ''SS-Helferin'' were as follows: \n#''Chef Oberaufseherin'', \"Chief Senior Overseer\" [Ravensbr\u00fcck]\n#''Lagerf\u00fchrerin'', \"Camp Leader\"                                                                                             \n#''Oberaufseherin'', \"Senior Overseer\" \n#''Erstaufseherin'', \"First Guard\" [Senior Overseer in some satellite camps]\n#''Rapportf\u00fchrerin'', \"Report Leader\"\n#''Arbeitsdienstf\u00fchrerin'', \"Work Recording Leader\"\n#''Arbeitseinsatzf\u00fchrerin'', \"Work Input Overseers\"                                               \n#''Blockf\u00fchrerin'', \"Block Leader\" \n#''Kommandof\u00fchrerin'', \"Work Squad Leader\" [Senior Overseer in some satellite camps]\n#''Hundef\u00fchrerin'', \"Dog Guide Overseer\"                                                                                           \n#''Aufseherin'', \"Overseer\"                                                                       \n#''Arrestf\u00fchrerin'', \"Arrested Overseer\"\n\n==Daily life==\nRelations between SS men and female guards are said to have existed in many of the camps, and [[Heinrich Himmler]] had told the SS men to regard the female guards as equals and comrades. At the relatively small [[Helmbrechts concentration camp|Helmbrechts]] subcamp near [[Hof, Germany|Hof]], Germany, the camp commandant, Doerr, openly pursued a sexual relationship with the head female overseer Herta Haase-Breitmann-Schmidt.\n\nCorruption was another aspect of the female guard culture. [[Ilse Koch]], known as \"The Witch of [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]\", was married to the camp commandant, [[Karl-Otto Koch|Karl Koch]]. Both were rumored to have embezzled millions of Reichmarks, for which Karl Koch was convicted and executed by the Nazis a few weeks before Buchenwald was liberated by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]; however, Ilse was cleared of the charge. Convicted of war crimes, she was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1951.\n\nOne apparent exception to the brutal female overseer prototype was Klara Kunig, a camp guard in 1944 who served at [[Ravensbruck]] and its subcamp at Dresden-Universelle. The head wardress at the camp pointed out that she was too polite and too kind towards the inmates, resulting in her subsequent dismissal from camp duty in January 1945. Her fate has been unknown since February 13, 1945, the date of the allied [[firebombing of Dresden]].<ref>Sarti, Wendy Adele Marie (2011).

She was originally sentenced to death by a Soviet court, but it was commuted to a life sentence, and she was released in 1956. In the early 1990s, at the age of 74, Pietzner was awarded the title \"Stalinist victim\" and given 64,350 [[Deutsche Marks]] (32,902 Euros). Many historians argued that she had lied and did not deserve the money. She had, in fact, served time in a German prison which was overseen by the Soviets, but she was imprisoned because she had served brutally in the ranks of three concentration camps. Pietzner currently lives in a small town in northern Germany.\n\nThe only female guard to tell her story to the public has been [[Herta Bothe]], who served as a guard at [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]] in 1942, then at [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]], [[Bromberg-Ost]] subcamp, and finally in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. She received 10 years' imprisonment and was released in the mid-1950s. In a rare interview in 2004, Bothe was asked if she regretted being a guard in a [[concentration camp]]. Her response was, \"What do you mean? ...I made a mistake, no... The mistake was that it was a concentration camp, but I had to go to it\u2014otherwise I would have been put into it myself, that was my mistake.\"<ref>{{cite video|people=Dreykluft, Friederike|title=Holokaust|medium=TV mini-series|publisher=MPR Film und Fernsehproduktion|location=Germany|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, 84-year-old San Francisco resident [[Elfriede Rinkel]] was deported by the US Justice Department.

She had hidden her secret for more than 60 years from her family, friends and Jewish-German husband Fred.

Of the 55,000 guards who served in [[Nazi concentration camps]], about 3,700 were women.

The year after, the Nazis began conscripting women because of a shortage of male guards. The German title for this position, ''Aufseherin'' means (female) ''overseer'' or ''attendant''. Later female guards were dispersed to [[Bolzano]] (1944\u20131945), Kaiserwald-Riga (1943\u201344), [[Mauthausen]] (March \u2013 May 1945), [[Stutthof]] (1942\u20131945), [[Vaivara]]<ref>'Petzold, Elfriede,' appeared on a November 1, 1947 list of female war criminals held in U.S. custody at Augsburg-Goegingen, 'Central Komitet, Juridisze Optejlung, Krigsfarbrecher Referat,' as a guard in, 'Gr\u00fcneberg-Vaivara (Estland).'</ref> (1943\u20131944), [[Vught]] (1943\u20131944), and at other [[Nazi concentration camps]], subcamps, work camps, detention camps, etc.\n[[File:Irma Grese.jpg|thumb|upright|Mugshot of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] guard [[Irma Grese]]]]\n[[File:Ilse Koch.png|thumb|upright|Mugshot of [[Ilse Koch]].]]\n[[File:Maria Mandel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maria Mandel]] of [[Auschwitz]]]]\n[[File:Herta Bothe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herta Bothe]], in [[Celle]] awaiting trial, August 1945]]\n[[File:Majdanek - Hermine Braunsteiner.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hermine Braunsteiner]] of KZ Majdanek]]\n\n==Recruitment==\n{{Disputed section|date=February 2017}}\nFemale guards were generally from the lower to middle class<ref>There were, however, some exceptions.

They were never given any positional titles or equivalent [[Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|ranks of the SS]].

At the relatively small [[Helmbrechts concentration camp|Helmbrechts]] subcamp near [[Hof, Germany|Hof]], Germany, the camp commandant, Doerr, openly pursued a sexual relationship with the head female overseer Herta Haase-Breitmann-Schmidt.\n\nCorruption was another aspect of the female guard culture. [[Ilse Koch]], known as \"The Witch of [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]\", was married to the camp commandant, [[Karl-Otto Koch|Karl Koch]]. Both were rumored to have embezzled millions of Reichmarks, for which Karl Koch was convicted and executed by the Nazis a few weeks before Buchenwald was liberated by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]; however, Ilse was cleared of the charge. Convicted of war crimes, she was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1951.\n\nOne apparent exception to the brutal female overseer prototype was Klara Kunig, a camp guard in 1944 who served at [[Ravensbruck]] and its subcamp at Dresden-Universelle. The head wardress at the camp pointed out that she was too polite and too kind towards the inmates, resulting in her subsequent dismissal from camp duty in January 1945. Her fate has been unknown since February 13, 1945, the date of the allied [[firebombing of Dresden]].<ref>Sarti, Wendy Adele Marie (2011).

She was originally sentenced to death by a Soviet court, but it was commuted to a life sentence, and she was released in 1956. In the early 1990s, at the age of 74, Pietzner was awarded the title \"Stalinist victim\" and given 64,350 [[Deutsche Marks]] (32,902 Euros). Many historians argued that she had lied and did not deserve the money. She had, in fact, served time in a German prison which was overseen by the Soviets, but she was imprisoned because she had served brutally in the ranks of three concentration camps. Pietzner currently lives in a small town in northern Germany.\n\nThe only female guard to tell her story to the public has been [[Herta Bothe]], who served as a guard at [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]] in 1942, then at [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]], [[Bromberg-Ost]] subcamp, and finally in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. She received 10 years' imprisonment and was released in the mid-1950s. In a rare interview in 2004, Bothe was asked if she regretted being a guard in a [[concentration camp]]. Her response was, \"What do you mean? ...I made a mistake, no... The mistake was that it was a concentration camp, but I had to go to it\u2014otherwise I would have been put into it myself, that was my mistake.\"<ref>{{cite video|people=Dreykluft, Friederike|title=Holokaust|medium=TV mini-series|publisher=MPR Film und Fernsehproduktion|location=Germany|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, 84-year-old San Francisco resident [[Elfriede Rinkel]] was deported by the US Justice Department.

She had hidden her secret for more than 60 years from her family, friends and Jewish-German husband Fred.

The uprisings helped topple [[Emperor Huai of Jin]] in [[Luoyang]] and ended the Western Jin dynasty in northern China.\n\nRulers from four ethnic groups, the [[Xiongnu]], Jie, [[Qiang people|Qiang]] and [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]], then established a series of independent kingdoms in what is now northern China.  The fifth group, the [[Xianbei]] in the north, were allied to the Western Jin and later Eastern Jin against the other four barbarians until turning on the Chinese much later.  A series of revolts in southern China occurred at the same time by southern [[Ba (state)|Ba]]-[[Di (Wu Hu)|Di]] rebels aboriginal people in Sichuan and [[Nanman]] aboriginals in Hubei resulting in the establishment of the [[Cheng Han]] state in Sichuan.  This chaotic period of Chinese history, known as the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] (\u4e94\u80e1\u5341\u516d\u570b, \"sixteen kingdoms of the five barbarians\"), lasted over 130 years until the [[Northern Wei dynasty]] united northern China in the 5th century.  The Eastern Jin dynasty survived in southern China.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe southward migration of nomadic tribes into the lands around the [[Yellow River]] had been ongoing since the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] for several reasons. the Han dynasty's defeated of the Xiongnu confederation in the [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War]] by Han General [[Dou Xian]] led to the Han dynasty deporting the [[Southern Xiongnu]] along with their [[Chanyu]] into northern China. In 167 AD, [[Duan Jiong]] conducted an anti-Qiang campaign and massacred Qiang populations as well as settled them outside the frontier in northern China.{{sfn|Cosmo|2009|p=104}}\n\nThe wars of the later [[Three Kingdoms period]] also encouraged this immigration, which repopulated previously devastated areas and provided military power and labour.\n\nBy the end of the 4th century, the nomadic tribes had moved into the [[Guanzhong]] area, as well as the watersheds of the [[Wei River|Wei]] and [[Xing River|Xing]] rivers, practically surrounding the Jin capital in Luoyang. At the same time, the accession of [[Emperor Hui of Jin]], who was possibly [[developmentally disabled]], led to a struggle between the princes of the ruling Sima family to control him, sparking off the [[War of the Eight Princes]].\n\nRevolts by the five barbarians took place before such as in Shanxi and Shaanxi, He San's Xiongnu revolt in 294 and Qi Wannian's Qiang and Di revolt in Yong and Qin provinces and the Beidi region (Shaanxi) He Duyuan's Qiang revolt in 296.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kleeman |first1=Terry F. |title=Great Perfection |date=1998 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=0824818008 |pages=90\u201391 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FAJrw0yInnAC&pg=PA90}}</ref>\n\n==Uprising==\n\n===Beginnings of the uprising===\nThe [[War of the Eight Princes]] lasted for more than a decade, severely weakening the economy and military capacity of the Western Jin. At the same time, the nomads were also being enlisted by the princes as military forces; one such force of Xianbei, under the command of [[Sima Yue]], captured [[Chang'an]] in 306.\n\nTaking advantage of this period of weakness, the different non-Chinese peoples began to openly revolt and proclaim new regimes.  The [[Jie people|Jie]] chief [[Shi Le]] was sold as a slave by Western Jin officials before his uprising and owned by a Han Chinese called Shi Huan (\u5e2b\u61fd), and began his rebellion as a slave revolt against his Han Chinese masters.  The Di chief [[Li Xiong]] captured [[Chengdu]] in 304, proclaiming the kingdom of [[Cheng Han]]. The most serious initial revolt, however, was [[Xiongnu]] chieftain [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]], who proclaimed the kingdom of [[Han Zhao]] in 304 as well, in the northern heartland of the Jin dynasty.<ref name=\"Li and Zheng, pg 382\">Li and Zheng, pg 382</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA Sogdian merchant in China wrote a letter to another Sogdian referring to the Huns (Xiongnu) who had revolted as people who had previously been \"property\" of the Chinese Western Jin Emperor until their uprising against him and destruction of the capital at Luoyang.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinor |first1=Denis |title=Inner Asia |date=1997 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=0700708960 |page=94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foS-y-ShWJ0C&pg=PA94}}</ref><ref name=\"Z\u00fcrcher 2007 p84\">{{cite book |last1=Z\u00fcrcher |first1=Erik |title=The Buddhist Conquest of China: The Spread and Adaptation of Buddhism in Early Medieval China |date=2007 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-9047419426 |page=84 |edition=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9yvCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA84}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Sinica Leidensia, Volume 11, Issue 1 |date=1972 |publisher=E.J.

However, the Jin Chancellor Sima Yue fled Luoyang in 310CE with 40,000 troops to Xiangcheng in Henan in an attempt to flee this threat.<ref name=\"Li and Zheng, pg 382\" />{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfter Sima Yue's death, the main Jin forces in Henan, led by Wang Yan, decided to proceed to Shantung to defeat [[Shi Le]], a general of Jie ethnicity under Liu Cong, but was defeated by the rebel forces and more than 100,000 soldiers perished, including Wang Yan himself.<ref name=\"Li and Zheng, pg 383\">Li and Zheng, pg 383</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe defeat of Wang Yan's forces finally exhausted the military capacity of the Jin, leaving the capital open to capture.  Upon entering the city, the invaders engaged in a massacre, razing the city and causing more than 30,000 deaths. This event in Chinese history was known as the [[Disaster of Yongjia]], after the [[era name]] of Emperor Huai of Jin; the emperor himself was captured, while his crown prince and clansmen were killed.<ref name=\"Li and Zheng, pg 383\" />{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAlthough the main Jin regime in the North was defeated, Jin forces continued to hold three provinces in the North, namely Youzhou, Liangzhou, and Bingzhou. These provinces, however, were cut off from the remnant Jin forces now in the South and eventually overrun, reducing [[Eastern Jin|Jin]] control to the area south of the [[Huai River]].\n\n==Historical impact==\n\nThe collapse of the Western Jin had long-lasting effects. In the conquered areas, various non-Han leaders quickly established a large series of kingdoms and states, most of which were short lived; this era of fragmentation and state creation lasted for more than a century, until the [[Northern Wei]] regime finally conquered and \"unified\" the northern regions in 439 and became the first of the [[Northern and Southern Dynasties|Northern Dynasties]].\n\nThe chaos and devastation of the north also led to a mass migration of Han Chinese to the areas south of the Huai River, where conditions were relatively stable. The southward migration of the Jin nobility is referred to in Chinese as ''y\u012b gu\u0101n n\u00e1n d\u00f9'' ({{linktext|\u8863|\u51a0|\u5357|\u6e21}}, <small>lit.</small> \"garments and headdresses moving south\"). Many of those who fled south were of prominent families, who had the means to escape; among these prominent northern families were the Xie clan and the Wang clan, whose prominent members included [[Xie An]] and [[Wang Dao]]. Wang Dao, in particular, was instrumental in supporting [[Emperor Yuan of Jin|Sima Rui]] to proclaim the Eastern Jin dynasty at [[Jiankang]] and serving as his chancellor. The Eastern Jin, dependent on established southern nobility as well as exiled northern nobility for its survival, became a relatively weak dynasty dominated by regional nobles who served as governors; nonetheless it would survive for another century as a southern regime.\n\nWhile the era was one of military catastrophe, it was also one of deep cultural interaction. The nomadic tribes introduced new methods of government, while also encouraging introduced faiths such as [[Buddhism]]. Meanwhile, the southward exodus of the cultured Jin elite, who then spread across the southern provinces including modern-day [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]], further integrated the areas south of the Yangtze River into the Chinese cultural sphere.\n\nThe \"Eight Great Surnames\" were eight noble families who migrated from northern China to [[Fujian]] in southern China due to the uprising of the five barbarians when the Eastern Jin was founded, the Hu, He, Qiu, Dan, Zheng, Huang, Chen and Lin surnames.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dean |first1=Kenneth |last2=Zheng |first2=Zhenman |date=2009 |title=Ritual Alliances of the Putian Plain.

The uprisings helped topple [[Emperor Huai of Jin]] in [[Luoyang]] and ended the Western Jin dynasty in northern China.\n\nRulers from four ethnic groups, the [[Xiongnu]], Jie, [[Qiang people|Qiang]] and [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]], then established a series of independent kingdoms in what is now northern China.  The fifth group, the [[Xianbei]] in the north, were allied to the Western Jin and later Eastern Jin against the other four barbarians until turning on the Chinese much later.  A series of revolts in southern China occurred at the same time by southern [[Ba (state)|Ba]]-[[Di (Wu Hu)|Di]] rebels aboriginal people in Sichuan and [[Nanman]] aboriginals in Hubei resulting in the establishment of the [[Cheng Han]] state in Sichuan.  This chaotic period of Chinese history, known as the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] (\u4e94\u80e1\u5341\u516d\u570b, \"sixteen kingdoms of the five barbarians\"), lasted over 130 years until the [[Northern Wei dynasty]] united northern China in the 5th century.  The Eastern Jin dynasty survived in southern China.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe southward migration of nomadic tribes into the lands around the [[Yellow River]] had been ongoing since the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] for several reasons. the Han dynasty's defeated of the Xiongnu confederation in the [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War]] by Han General [[Dou Xian]] led to the Han dynasty deporting the [[Southern Xiongnu]] along with their [[Chanyu]] into northern China. In 167 AD, [[Duan Jiong]] conducted an anti-Qiang campaign and massacred Qiang populations as well as settled them outside the frontier in northern China.{{sfn|Cosmo|2009|p=104}}\n\nThe wars of the later [[Three Kingdoms period]] also encouraged this immigration, which repopulated previously devastated areas and provided military power and labour.\n\nBy the end of the 4th century, the nomadic tribes had moved into the [[Guanzhong]] area, as well as the watersheds of the [[Wei River|Wei]] and [[Xing River|Xing]] rivers, practically surrounding the Jin capital in Luoyang. At the same time, the accession of [[Emperor Hui of Jin]], who was possibly [[developmentally disabled]], led to a struggle between the princes of the ruling Sima family to control him, sparking off the [[War of the Eight Princes]].\n\nRevolts by the five barbarians took place before such as in Shanxi and Shaanxi, He San's Xiongnu revolt in 294 and Qi Wannian's Qiang and Di revolt in Yong and Qin provinces and the Beidi region (Shaanxi) He Duyuan's Qiang revolt in 296.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kleeman |first1=Terry F. |title=Great Perfection |date=1998 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=0824818008 |pages=90\u201391 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FAJrw0yInnAC&pg=PA90}}</ref>\n\n==Uprising==\n\n===Beginnings of the uprising===\nThe [[War of the Eight Princes]] lasted for more than a decade, severely weakening the economy and military capacity of the Western Jin. At the same time, the nomads were also being enlisted by the princes as military forces; one such force of Xianbei, under the command of [[Sima Yue]], captured [[Chang'an]] in 306.\n\nTaking advantage of this period of weakness, the different non-Chinese peoples began to openly revolt and proclaim new regimes.  The [[Jie people|Jie]] chief [[Shi Le]] was sold as a slave by Western Jin officials before his uprising and owned by a Han Chinese called Shi Huan (\u5e2b\u61fd), and began his rebellion as a slave revolt against his Han Chinese masters.  The Di chief [[Li Xiong]] captured [[Chengdu]] in 304, proclaiming the kingdom of [[Cheng Han]]. The most serious initial revolt, however, was [[Xiongnu]] chieftain [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]], who proclaimed the kingdom of [[Han Zhao]] in 304 as well, in the northern heartland of the Jin dynasty.<ref name=\"Li and Zheng, pg 382\">Li and Zheng, pg 382</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA Sogdian merchant in China wrote a letter to another Sogdian referring to the Huns (Xiongnu) who had revolted as people who had previously been \"property\" of the Chinese Western Jin Emperor until their uprising against him and destruction of the capital at Luoyang.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sinor |first1=Denis |title=Inner Asia |date=1997 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=0700708960 |page=94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foS-y-ShWJ0C&pg=PA94}}</ref><ref name=\"Z\u00fcrcher 2007 p84\">{{cite book |last1=Z\u00fcrcher |first1=Erik |title=The Buddhist Conquest of China: The Spread and Adaptation of Buddhism in Early Medieval China |date=2007 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-9047419426 |page=84 |edition=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_9yvCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA84}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Sinica Leidensia, Volume 11, Issue 1 |date=1972 |publisher=E.J.

The Jin capital, Luoyang was open to Liu Yuan's son Liu Cong (who was now commander of the rebellious forces), and he attacked Luoyang in 309 and 310 CE twice, without success. However, the Jin Chancellor Sima Yue fled Luoyang in 310CE with 40,000 troops to Xiangcheng in Henan in an attempt to flee this threat.<ref name=\"Li and Zheng, pg 382\" />{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfter Sima Yue's death, the main Jin forces in Henan, led by Wang Yan, decided to proceed to Shantung to defeat [[Shi Le]], a general of Jie ethnicity under Liu Cong, but was defeated by the rebel forces and more than 100,000 soldiers perished, including Wang Yan himself.<ref name=\"Li and Zheng, pg 383\">Li and Zheng, pg 383</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe defeat of Wang Yan's forces finally exhausted the military capacity of the Jin, leaving the capital open to capture.  Upon entering the city, the invaders engaged in a massacre, razing the city and causing more than 30,000 deaths. This event in Chinese history was known as the [[Disaster of Yongjia]], after the [[era name]] of Emperor Huai of Jin; the emperor himself was captured, while his crown prince and clansmen were killed.<ref name=\"Li and Zheng, pg 383\" />{{Full citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAlthough the main Jin regime in the North was defeated, Jin forces continued to hold three provinces in the North, namely Youzhou, Liangzhou, and Bingzhou. These provinces, however, were cut off from the remnant Jin forces now in the South and eventually overrun, reducing [[Eastern Jin|Jin]] control to the area south of the [[Huai River]].\n\n==Historical impact==\n\nThe collapse of the Western Jin had long-lasting effects. In the conquered areas, various non-Han leaders quickly established a large series of kingdoms and states, most of which were short lived; this era of fragmentation and state creation lasted for more than a century, until the [[Northern Wei]] regime finally conquered and \"unified\" the northern regions in 439 and became the first of the [[Northern and Southern Dynasties|Northern Dynasties]].\n\nThe chaos and devastation of the north also led to a mass migration of Han Chinese to the areas south of the Huai River, where conditions were relatively stable. The southward migration of the Jin nobility is referred to in Chinese as ''y\u012b gu\u0101n n\u00e1n d\u00f9'' ({{linktext|\u8863|\u51a0|\u5357|\u6e21}}, <small>lit.</small> \"garments and headdresses moving south\"). Many of those who fled south were of prominent families, who had the means to escape; among these prominent northern families were the Xie clan and the Wang clan, whose prominent members included [[Xie An]] and [[Wang Dao]]. Wang Dao, in particular, was instrumental in supporting [[Emperor Yuan of Jin|Sima Rui]] to proclaim the Eastern Jin dynasty at [[Jiankang]] and serving as his chancellor. The Eastern Jin, dependent on established southern nobility as well as exiled northern nobility for its survival, became a relatively weak dynasty dominated by regional nobles who served as governors; nonetheless it would survive for another century as a southern regime.\n\nWhile the era was one of military catastrophe, it was also one of deep cultural interaction. The nomadic tribes introduced new methods of government, while also encouraging introduced faiths such as [[Buddhism]]. Meanwhile, the southward exodus of the cultured Jin elite, who then spread across the southern provinces including modern-day [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]], further integrated the areas south of the Yangtze River into the Chinese cultural sphere.\n\nThe \"Eight Great Surnames\" were eight noble families who migrated from northern China to [[Fujian]] in southern China due to the uprising of the five barbarians when the Eastern Jin was founded, the Hu, He, Qiu, Dan, Zheng, Huang, Chen and Lin surnames.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dean |first1=Kenneth |last2=Zheng |first2=Zhenman |date=2009 |title=Ritual Alliances of the Putian Plain.
