A third collection, ''The Mallet of Loving Correction'', was released in 2013 and named after his nickname for moderating activities on his blog.  A fourth collection, ''Don't Live For Your Obituary'', was released in December 2017.\n\n===Online and other writing===\nScalzi began writing for his personal blog ''Whatever'' in September 1998.<ref name=\":8\" /> He started it because he wanted to practice writing in a newspaper- or column-like format, which he had done prior to his novel-writing career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Agent-to-the-Stars-John-Scalzi/pid=1180662|title=Interview: John Scalzi|last=Stocks|first=Erin|date=September 2010|website=[[Lightspeed (magazine)|Lightspeed]]|access-date=April 18, 2017}}</ref> The name suggests the wide range of topics Scalzi writes about there, although many of Scalzi's postings center on the topics of politics and writing. A number of writings originally posted there have gone on to be published in traditional media, including his \"I Hate Your Politics\" and \"Being Poor\"<ref name=\"ct-2005sep15\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-15/news/0509150091_1_poor-free-lunch-kid-s-school |title=Being Poor |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=September 15, 2005 |first=John |last=Scalzi}}</ref> entries, the latter of which was published in the op-ed pages of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in September 2005.

The original solicitation was posted in March 2005 with the unique requirements that submissions would only be accepted electronically in plain text, and ONLY during the period between 10/1/05 and 11/1/05 instead of before a traditional deadline. After the print run sold out, the issue was made available online as a free download.<ref>{{cite web|title=Subterranean Issue|url=http://scalzi.com/subterranean_issue_4.pdf|website=Scalzi.com}}</ref>\n\nScalzi's own short story, ''How I Proposed to My Wife: An Alien Sex Story'', was not printed in the magazine itself but only in a separated chapbook reserved to the people who bought the hardcover limited edition. In April 2008 Scalzi released the story as a \"shareware short story\" on his website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=638|title=A Shareware Short Story: \"How I Proposed to My Wife: An Alien Sex Story\"|website=Whatever |last=Scalzi |first=John |date=April 16, 2008 |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn March 29, 2007, it was announced that Scalzi had again been nominated for a Hugo Award, this time in the category \"Best Fan Writer\", for his online writing about the science fiction field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon2007.us/hugo_nominees.php |title=Hugo nominees, Nippon 2007 site |publisher=Nippon2007.us |date=n.d.|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref> He was the first Campbell Award winner to receive a nomination in this category. In 2008, he was again nominated for the Best Fan Writer Hugo, this time winning the award, becoming the first person to be nominated for that category and the Best Novel Hugo award at the same time since 1970.\n\nScalzi also uses the Whatever to help raise money for organizations and causes he supports. Notably, in June 2007 he raised over $5000 in 6 days for [[Americans United for the Separation of Church and State]] after fellow writer [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]] challenged him<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatever.scalzi.com/2007/06/09/all-right-fine-i-will-go-to-the-creation-museum-if/|title=All Right, Fine, I Will Go to The Creation Museum...

Scalzi extended the deal to all Whatever readers, raised 256 times the admission price, and posted his critical report on the Creation Museum on November 12, 2007. In September 2010 he joined with Subterranean Press and authors [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Patrick Rothfuss]], [[Catherynne M. Valente]], [[Rachel Swirsky]] and others to create a chapbook story collection called ''Clash of the Geeks'', offered online in exchange for donations to the Michigan/Indiana affiliate of the Lupus Alliance of America. Some of the stories were selected from a competition run on Whatever to write a story to explain a painting Scalzi had commissioned from Jeff Zugale, that featured Scalzi as an [[orc]] and Wheaton riding a unicorn pegasus kitten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unicornpegasuskitten.com/ |title=Clash of the Geeks |publisher=Unicornpegasuskitten.com |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nScalzi's notable online presence and support for feminist causes have often led to harassment and trolling.<ref name=\":1\" /> After writing a satirical blog post in October 2012 criticizing some conservative politicians for their positions on abortion,<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/05/trolls-prompt-author-charity-donation|title=Troll's comments prompt author to pledge charity donation for every insult|last=Barnett|first=David|date=February 5, 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref> Scalzi was targeted by writer [[Vox Day]] and his supporters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/02/06/sci_fi_writer_makes_50000_for_charity_off_of_his_troll/|title=Sci-fi writer makes $50,000 for charity off of his \"troll\"|last=D'Addario|first=Daniel|date=February 6, 2013|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref> Scalzi pledged to donate $5 to RAINN, Emily's List, the Human Rights Campaign, and the NAACP every time Day mentioned him on his website. While he capped his donation at $1,000, Scalzi raised over $50,000 after others, including actor [[Wil Wheaton]], promised to match this pledge.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn addition to his personal site, Scalzi was a professional blogger for America Online's AOL Journals and AIM Blogs service from August 2003 through December 2007. In this role he created participatory entries (most notably the Weekend Assignment and Monday Photo Shoot), answered questions about blogging from AOL members, and posted interesting links for readers. Readers of both Scalzi's personal site and his AOL Journal \"By the Way\" noted distinct differences in tone at each site. Scalzi has acknowledged this tonal difference, based on the different missions of each site. Scalzi also blogged professionally for AOL's [[Ficlets]] site beginning in March 2007, writing about literature and other related topics. On December 7, 2007, Scalzi announced that by mutual agreement, his contract with AOL would not be renewed at the end of the year, in part so that he would have more time to devote to writing books.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.aol.com/johnmscalzi/bytheway/entries/2007/12/07/an-important-announcement/8073 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213021128/http://journals.aol.com/johnmscalzi/bytheway/entries/2007/12/07/an-important-announcement/8073 |archive-date=December 13, 2007 |title=By the Way: An Important Announcement |last=Scalzi |first=John |website=Journals.aol.com |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Scalzi began writing a weekly column on science fiction/fantasy films for AMCTV.com, the Web site of cable television network [[AMC (TV network)|AMC]].\n\nFor traditional media, Scalzi wrote a DVD review column and an opinion column for the ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' from 2000 through 2006, wrote an additional DVD review column for the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' through 2006, and writes for other magazines and newspapers on an occasional basis.

A sequel audiobook, ''METAtropolis: Cascadia'', edited by Jay Lake, came out in 2010. In 2009 Subterranean Press released a limited edition print run of ''METAtropolis'', which was subsequently published by Tor in a standard hardcover edition, in 2010.\n\n''[[Fuzzy Nation]]'', Scalzi's ninth novel, began as a writing exercise. Scalzi explained that it had been \"basically written just for the fun of it and for sort of getting into the habit of actually enjoying writing science fiction again.\" It was an adaptation of ''[[Little Fuzzy]]'', published by [[H. Beam Piper]] in 1962, and was authorized by the Piper estate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/scalzi_interview/|title=Same Story with a 21st Century Sensibility: A Conversation with John Scalzi|last=Jones|first=Jeremy L.

Scalzi's next non-fiction book was ''The Rough Guide to the Universe'', an astronomy book designed for novice-to-intermediate stargazers, released in May 2003. Scalzi's third book for Rough Guides, ''The Rough Guide to Sci-Fi Movies'', was released in October 2005. This book covered the history of science fiction and science fiction film and listed a \"canon\" of 50 significant science fiction films.\n\nScalzi is also the author of the \"Book of the Dumb\" series of books from [[Portable Press]]. These books chronicle people doing stupid things. The first book in the series was released in October 2003 with a second following a year later.\n\nIn November 2005, Scalzi announced that entries from the run of the Whatever, his blog, would be compiled into a book from [[Subterranean Press]]. The book, ''You're Not Fooling Anyone When You Take Your Laptop to a Coffee Shop: Scalzi on Writing''; was released by Subterranean Press in February 2007. Another collection of entries from Whatever, entitled ''Your Hate Mail Will Be Graded: A Decade of Whatever 1998\u20132008'' was released in September 2008. It subsequently won the [[Hugo Award for Best Related Book]] in 2009. A third collection, ''The Mallet of Loving Correction'', was released in 2013 and named after his nickname for moderating activities on his blog.  A fourth collection, ''Don't Live For Your Obituary'', was released in December 2017.\n\n===Online and other writing===\nScalzi began writing for his personal blog ''Whatever'' in September 1998.<ref name=\":8\" /> He started it because he wanted to practice writing in a newspaper- or column-like format, which he had done prior to his novel-writing career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/Agent-to-the-Stars-John-Scalzi/pid=1180662|title=Interview: John Scalzi|last=Stocks|first=Erin|date=September 2010|website=[[Lightspeed (magazine)|Lightspeed]]|access-date=April 18, 2017}}</ref> The name suggests the wide range of topics Scalzi writes about there, although many of Scalzi's postings center on the topics of politics and writing.

The original solicitation was posted in March 2005 with the unique requirements that submissions would only be accepted electronically in plain text, and ONLY during the period between 10/1/05 and 11/1/05 instead of before a traditional deadline. After the print run sold out, the issue was made available online as a free download.<ref>{{cite web|title=Subterranean Issue|url=http://scalzi.com/subterranean_issue_4.pdf|website=Scalzi.com}}</ref>\n\nScalzi's own short story, ''How I Proposed to My Wife: An Alien Sex Story'', was not printed in the magazine itself but only in a separated chapbook reserved to the people who bought the hardcover limited edition. In April 2008 Scalzi released the story as a \"shareware short story\" on his website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=638|title=A Shareware Short Story: \"How I Proposed to My Wife: An Alien Sex Story\"|website=Whatever |last=Scalzi |first=John |date=April 16, 2008 |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn March 29, 2007, it was announced that Scalzi had again been nominated for a Hugo Award, this time in the category \"Best Fan Writer\", for his online writing about the science fiction field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon2007.us/hugo_nominees.php |title=Hugo nominees, Nippon 2007 site |publisher=Nippon2007.us |date=n.d.|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref> He was the first Campbell Award winner to receive a nomination in this category. In 2008, he was again nominated for the Best Fan Writer Hugo, this time winning the award, becoming the first person to be nominated for that category and the Best Novel Hugo award at the same time since 1970.\n\nScalzi also uses the Whatever to help raise money for organizations and causes he supports. Notably, in June 2007 he raised over $5000 in 6 days for [[Americans United for the Separation of Church and State]] after fellow writer [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]] challenged him<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatever.scalzi.com/2007/06/09/all-right-fine-i-will-go-to-the-creation-museum-if/|title=All Right, Fine, I Will Go to The Creation Museum...

Scalzi extended the deal to all Whatever readers, raised 256 times the admission price, and posted his critical report on the Creation Museum on November 12, 2007. In September 2010 he joined with Subterranean Press and authors [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Patrick Rothfuss]], [[Catherynne M. Valente]], [[Rachel Swirsky]] and others to create a chapbook story collection called ''Clash of the Geeks'', offered online in exchange for donations to the Michigan/Indiana affiliate of the Lupus Alliance of America. Some of the stories were selected from a competition run on Whatever to write a story to explain a painting Scalzi had commissioned from Jeff Zugale, that featured Scalzi as an [[orc]] and Wheaton riding a unicorn pegasus kitten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unicornpegasuskitten.com/ |title=Clash of the Geeks |publisher=Unicornpegasuskitten.com |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nScalzi's notable online presence and support for feminist causes have often led to harassment and trolling.<ref name=\":1\" /> After writing a satirical blog post in October 2012 criticizing some conservative politicians for their positions on abortion,<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/05/trolls-prompt-author-charity-donation|title=Troll's comments prompt author to pledge charity donation for every insult|last=Barnett|first=David|date=February 5, 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref> Scalzi was targeted by writer [[Vox Day]] and his supporters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/02/06/sci_fi_writer_makes_50000_for_charity_off_of_his_troll/|title=Sci-fi writer makes $50,000 for charity off of his \"troll\"|last=D'Addario|first=Daniel|date=February 6, 2013|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref> Scalzi pledged to donate $5 to RAINN, Emily's List, the Human Rights Campaign, and the NAACP every time Day mentioned him on his website.

In this role he created participatory entries (most notably the Weekend Assignment and Monday Photo Shoot), answered questions about blogging from AOL members, and posted interesting links for readers. Readers of both Scalzi's personal site and his AOL Journal \"By the Way\" noted distinct differences in tone at each site. Scalzi has acknowledged this tonal difference, based on the different missions of each site. Scalzi also blogged professionally for AOL's [[Ficlets]] site beginning in March 2007, writing about literature and other related topics. On December 7, 2007, Scalzi announced that by mutual agreement, his contract with AOL would not be renewed at the end of the year, in part so that he would have more time to devote to writing books.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.aol.com/johnmscalzi/bytheway/entries/2007/12/07/an-important-announcement/8073 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213021128/http://journals.aol.com/johnmscalzi/bytheway/entries/2007/12/07/an-important-announcement/8073 |archive-date=December 13, 2007 |title=By the Way: An Important Announcement |last=Scalzi |first=John |website=Journals.aol.com |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Scalzi began writing a weekly column on science fiction/fantasy films for AMCTV.com, the Web site of cable television network [[AMC (TV network)|AMC]].\n\nFor traditional media, Scalzi wrote a DVD review column and an opinion column for the ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' from 2000 through 2006, wrote an additional DVD review column for the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' through 2006, and writes for other magazines and newspapers on an occasional basis.

Examples include \"[[grok]]\" (to intuitively understand) from the science fiction novel about a Martian, entitled ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]; \"[[McJob]]\" ( precarious, poorly-paid employment) from ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'' by [[Douglas Coupland]]; \"[[cyberspace]]\" (widespread, interconnected digital technology) from ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]]<ref>Dunn, Robin. 2003: \"The Generative Edge.\" Foundation 87 (2003): 73\u201393.</ref> and \"[[Quark#Etymology|quark]]\" (Slavic slang for \"rubbish\"; German for a type of [[Quark (dairy product)|dairy product]]) from [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.\n\nThe title of a book may become a neologism, for instance, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (from the title of [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel). Alternatively, the author's name may give rise to the neologism, although the term is sometimes based on only one work of that author. This includes such words as \"[[Orwellian]]\" (from [[George Orwell]], referring to his dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'') and \"Kafkaesque\" (from [[Franz Kafka]]), which refers to arbitrary, complex bureaucratic systems.\n\nNames of famous characters are another source of literary neologisms, e.g. ''[[quixotism|quixotic]]'' (referring to the romantic and misguided [[Don Quixote|title character]] in ''[[Don Quixote de la Mancha]]'' by [[Cervantes]]), ''[[Ebenezer Scrooge|scrooge]]'' (from the avaricious main character in [[Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'') and ''[[pollyanna]]'' (from the unfailingly optimistic character in [[Eleanor H. Porter]]'s book of the same name).\n\n==Cant==\n{{Main|Cant (language)}}\n\n[[Polari]] is a cant used by some actors, circus performers, and the [[gay subculture]] to communicate without outsiders understanding. Some Polari terms have crossed over into mainstream slang, in part through their usage in pop song lyrics and other works. Example include: ''acdc'', ''barney'', ''blag'', ''[[wikt:butch#Adjective|butch]]'', ''[[Camp (style)|camp]]'', ''khazi'', ''cottaging'', ''hoofer'', ''mince'', ''ogle'', ''scarper'', ''slap'', ''strides'', ''tod'', ''[rough] trade'' ([[Trade (gay slang)|rough trade]]).\n\n[[Verlan]] ({{IPA-fr|v\u025b\u0281l\u0251\u0303}}), (''verlan'' is the reverse of the expression \"l'envers\") is a type of [[argot]] in the [[French language]], featuring inversion of [[syllable]]s in a word, and is common in [[slang]] and youth language.  It rests on a long French tradition of transposing syllables of individual words to create slang words.<ref name=Lefkowitz>{{cite book |last=Lefkowitz |first=Natalie |title=Talking Backwards, Looking Forwards: The French Language Game Verlan |date=1991 |publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag |isbn=3823340735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOk9Pldx7i0C}}</ref>{{rp|50}} Some ''verlan'' words, such as ''meuf'' (\"femme\", which means \"woman\" roughly backwards), have become so commonplace that they have been included in the ''[[Petit Larousse]]''<ref>See the [[Petit Larousse]] itself.

Like any slang, the purpose of ''verlan'' is to create a somewhat secret language that only its speakers can understand. Words becoming mainstream is counterproductive. As a result, such newly common words are re-verlanised: reversed a second time. The common ''meuf'' became ''feumeu''.<ref name=Valdman>{{cite journal |last=Valdman |first=Albert |title=La Langue des faubourgs et des banlieues: de l'argot au fran\u00e7ais populaire |journal=The French Review |volume=73 |issue=6 |year=2000 |language=fr}}</ref><ref name=LefkowitzReview>{{cite journal |title=Verlan: talking backwards in French |first=Natalie J |last= Lefkowitz |journal=[[The French Review]] |volume=63 |issue=2 |year=1989}}</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\nNeologism development may be spurred, or at least spread, by popular culture. Examples of 2000s-era pop-culture neologisms include the American [[Alt-right]] (2010s), the Canadian [[portmanteau]] \"[[Snowmageddon]]\" (2009), and the Russian [[parody]] \"[[Monstration]]\" (ca. 2004).\n\nNeologisms spread mainly through their exposure in [[mass media]].  The [[genericize|genericizing]] of [[brand names]], such as \"coke\" for [[Coca-Cola]], \"kleenex\" for [[Kleenex]] facial tissue, and \"xerox\" for [[Xerox]] [[photocopier|photocopying]], all spread through their popular use being enhanced by mass media.<ref>Sayadi, Forough (April 2011).

Examples include \"[[grok]]\" (to intuitively understand) from the science fiction novel about a Martian, entitled ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]; \"[[McJob]]\" ( precarious, poorly-paid employment) from ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'' by [[Douglas Coupland]]; \"[[cyberspace]]\" (widespread, interconnected digital technology) from ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]]<ref>Dunn, Robin. 2003: \"The Generative Edge.\" Foundation 87 (2003): 73\u201393.</ref> and \"[[Quark#Etymology|quark]]\" (Slavic slang for \"rubbish\"; German for a type of [[Quark (dairy product)|dairy product)) from [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.\n\nThe title of a book may become a neologism, for instance, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (from the title of [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel). Alternatively, the author's name may give rise to the neologism, although the term is sometimes based on only one work of that author. This includes such words as \"[[Orwellian]]\" (from [[George Orwell]], referring to his dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'') and \"Kafkaesque\" (from [[Franz Kafka]]), which refers to arbitrary, complex bureaucratic systems.\n\nNames of famous characters are another source of literary neologisms, e.g. ''[[quixotism|quixotic]]'' (referring to the romantic and misguided [[Don Quixote|title character]] in ''[[Don Quixote de la Mancha]]'' by [[Cervantes]]), ''[[Ebenezer Scrooge|scrooge]]'' (from the avaricious main character in [[Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'') and ''[[pollyanna]]'' (from the unfailingly optimistic character in [[Eleanor H. Porter]]'s book of the same name).\n\n==Cant==\n{{Main|Cant (language)}}\n\n[[Polari]] is a cant used by some actors, circus performers, and the [[gay subculture]] to communicate without outsiders understanding. Some Polari terms have crossed over into mainstream slang, in part through their usage in pop song lyrics and other works. Example include: ''acdc'', ''barney'', ''blag'', ''[[wikt:butch#Adjective|butch]]'', ''[[Camp (style)|camp]]'', ''khazi'', ''cottaging'', ''hoofer'', ''mince'', ''ogle'', ''scarper'', ''slap'', ''strides'', ''tod'', ''[rough] trade'' ([[Trade (gay slang)|rough trade]]).\n\n[[Verlan]] ({{IPA-fr|v\u025b\u0281l\u0251\u0303}}), (''verlan'' is the reverse of the expression \"l'envers\") is a type of [[argot]] in the [[French language]], featuring inversion of [[syllable]]s in a word, and is common in [[slang]] and youth language.  It rests on a long French tradition of transposing syllables of individual words to create slang words.<ref name=Lefkowitz>{{cite book |last=Lefkowitz |first=Natalie |title=Talking Backwards, Looking Forwards: The French Language Game Verlan |date=1991 |publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag |isbn=3823340735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOk9Pldx7i0C}}</ref>{{rp|50}} Some ''verlan'' words, such as ''meuf'' (\"femme\", which means \"woman\" roughly backwards), have become so commonplace that they have been included in the ''[[Petit Larousse]]''<ref>See the [[Petit Larousse]] itself.

Like any slang, the purpose of ''verlan'' is to create a somewhat secret language that only its speakers can understand. Words becoming mainstream is counterproductive. As a result, such newly common words are re-verlanised: reversed a second time. The common ''meuf'' became ''feumeu''.<ref name=Valdman>{{cite journal |last=Valdman |first=Albert |title=La Langue des faubourgs et des banlieues: de l'argot au fran\u00e7ais populaire |journal=The French Review |volume=73 |issue=6 |year=2000 |language=fr}}</ref><ref name=LefkowitzReview>{{cite journal |title=Verlan: talking backwards in French |first=Natalie J |last= Lefkowitz |journal=[[The French Review]] |volume=63 |issue=2 |year=1989}}</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\nNeologism development may be spurred, or at least spread, by popular culture. Examples of 2000s-era pop-culture neologisms include the American [[Alt-right]] (2010s), the Canadian [[portmanteau]] \"[[Snowmageddon]]\" (2009), and the Russian [[parody]] \"[[Monstration]]\" (ca. 2004).\n\nNeologisms spread mainly through their exposure in [[mass media]].  The [[genericize|genericizing]] of [[brand names]], such as \"coke\" for [[Coca-Cola]], \"kleenex\" for [[Kleenex]] facial tissue, and \"xerox\" for [[Xerox]] [[photocopier|photocopying]], all spread through their popular use being enhanced by mass media.<ref>Sayadi, Forough (April 2011). [http://translationjournal.net/journal/56neologisms.htm \"The Translation of Neologisms\"]. ''Translation Journal''.</ref>\n\nHowever, in some limited cases, words break out of their original communities and spread through [[social media]].{{cn|date=February 2019}} \"Doggo-Lingo\", a term still below the threshold of a neologism according to [[Merriam-Webster]],<ref name=\":0\" /> is an example of the latter which has specifically spread primarily through [[Facebook]] group and [[Twitter]] account use.<ref name=\":0\">Boddy, Jessica (April 23, 2017).

In 1988, the Daniels gave the property to Norman Starkey, trustee of \"Author's Family Trust\". Starkey gave the property to the Church of Spiritual Technology in 1993. Digging began in 1997. According to the Los Angeles Times, the CST \"is using state-of-the-art technology to protect Hubbard's writings, tape-recorded lectures and filmed treatises from natural and man-made calamities, including [[nuclear holocaust]].\"\n\nAccording to plans filed with the Tuolumne County Building Department the facility features a 15-foot-wide, 250-foot-long-tunnel.

The project began in the late 1980s.\n\nThe base includes a number of dwellings and the archives themselves, the latter in a network of tunnels. The base also has its own private, concrete airstrip, the San Miguel Ranch Airport (NM53).\n\nThe site is about a 2 1/2-hour drive east of Santa Fe. Access is through a gated road and a private concrete airstrip, the San Miguel Ranch Airport (NM53). The Trementina location is supposedly a store for material written by L.R. Hubbard, as shown in 1998 on [[ABC News]] ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV program)|20/20]]'':\n\n\"Buried deep in these New Mexico hills in steel-lined tunnels, said to be able to survive a nuclear blast, is what Scientology considers the future of mankind,\" ABC's Tom Jarriel said in his report. \"Seen here for the first time, thousands of metal records, stored in heat-resistant titanium boxes and playable on a solar-powered turntable, all containing the beliefs of Scientology's founder, L.
