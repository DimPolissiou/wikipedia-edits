In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. After the Croatian Army's [[Operation Storm]], the RSK ceased to exist, its territory was reincorporated into Croatia, and approximately 200,000 Serbs fled the country.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there were 186,633 Serbs living in Croatia (4.4% of the population) which are recognized as a national minority by the Croatian Constitution and therefore have 3 permanent seats in the [[Croatian Parliament]].\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional elements of their identity are the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]], [[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic script]] and military history, while modern elements are [[Serbian language|language]] and [[Serbian literature|literature]], civic, social and political values, concern for ethnic status and national organisation, and celebration of the [[Liberation of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:514233-Srbi-u-Hrvatskoj-zabrinuti-da-ce-nestati|title=Srbi u Hrvatskoj zabrinuti da \u0107e nestati}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2011 census there were 186,633 ethnic [[Serbs]] living in Croatia, 4.4% of the total population.

The Venetian government welcomed immigrants, as they protected possessions against the Ottomans. The [[Morlachs]], former Ottoman subjects, helped Venice triple its size in Dalmatia. The bishop of Makarska described how many people migrated from the Ottoman Empire to Venetian territories. Major population movements into Venetian Dalmatia occurred during the 1670s and 1680s. In the summer of 1685, Cosmi, the Archbishop of Split, wrote that Morlach leader [[Stojan Jankovi\u0107]] had brought 300 families with him to Dalmatia, and also that around Trogir and Split there were 5,000 refugees from Ottoman lands, without food; this was seen as a serious threat to the defense of Dalmatia.

In 1918, it became part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which immediately joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe formation of the Serbian identity of Vlahs in Croatia began in the 18th century under the influence of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] (SPC), and most of the local Orthodox priests of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] who were educated in monasteries outside Croatia under the guidance of SPC clergy who came to the southwestern region of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] during the [[Great Migrations of the Serbs]] (1690\u20131739).

The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]]. At first through the religious denomination, and by the time as a sign of national affiliation. There was also a brief occurrence when certain Catholic intellectuals, predominantly in [[Dubrovnik]], were won over by the Serbian thought.

With the creation of [[Yugoslavia]], their political goals were achieved, and after that these \"one-time Serbs\" disappeared from the political stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/hrvatska/clanak/id/156882/pitanje-boskovica-dr-nikola-tolja-posrbljenje-dubrovcana-bio-je-cin-otpora-becu-i-pesti|title=Tolja: Posrbljenje Dubrov\u010dana bio je \u010din otpora Be\u010du i Pe\u0161ti|publisher=}}</ref> Such developments in the spread of Serbian thought in the Croatian lands were the result of Serbian politicians' plans dating back to the first half of the 19th century when Serbia wasn't an independent country, but a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. According to the 1844 [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]]'s Na\u010dertanije, they intended to establish a Serbian Empire on the territory of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\". Geostrategic position of Belgrade in relation to Zagreb further contributed to favoring the Serbs whom Austrians did not perceive as a danger, unlike Croats who had own language, politicians, national consciousness, laws, military tradition and prepared army, as well as international [[Election in Cetin|treaties which have affirmed their rights]], so Austrians needed someone (Serbs) to discipline the Croats. The same was done by Hungary which became a strong political factor after 1848 and that wished to expand into the [[Southeast Europe]], which was particularly strong during the reign of [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] over Croatia.<ref name=\"matica.hr\"/>\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Matija Ban]], poet and dramatist, member of [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]<br />'''Right:''' [[Josip Runjanin]], composer of [[Lijepa na\u0161a domovino|Croatian national anthem]]\n| width1    = 130\n| image1    = MatijaBan.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| image2    = Josip Runjanin.png\n}}\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutionary 1848]] and the process of building a modern Croatian nation resulted in closer co-operation between Croats and Serbs and recognition of their equality in the sense of [[Illyrian Movement]] (also known as the Croatian National Revival) and [[Yugoslavia]]n ideas. In the 1830s, ideas of the Illyrian Movement spread to Dalmatia. In 1835, Bo\u017eidar Petranovi\u0107 began publishing the ''Serbo-Dalmatian Magazine''. In the following thirty years, Croats and Serbs worked together in the 'national movement' (by using this neutral name they avoided conflicts) against the Austro-Hungarian unitarism and [[Autonomist Party|Italian nationalists]]. However, since [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]], [[Ilija Gara\u0161anin]] and [[Jovan Suboti\u0107]] started writing of Dalmatia as a \"Serbian land\", and the recognition of Serbia as an independent state at the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], the differences between Croats and Serbs in Dalmatia increased. Following Croat enthusiasm with the successful 1878 [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], during which many Croatian soldiers died, and them seeking unification of Dalmatia and the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, the conflict between Croats and Serbs was inevitable.<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\">{{cite web|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20000813/podlistak.htm|title=SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, NEDJELJA 13. kolovoza 2000. \u2013 podlistak: Preokret i odvajanje|website=arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr}}</ref> In 1879, Serbs from Bukovica voted for the Italian candidate instead of Croat [[Miho Klai\u0107]].<ref name=\"slobodnadalmacija.hr\"/> This event was called by People's Party's supporters ''Bukovica betrail''.

In exchange for land and exemption from taxation, they had to conduct military service and participate in the protection of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s border against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They populated the [[Dalmatian hinterland]], [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]], [[Slavonia]], and [[Syrmia|Western Syrmia]]. After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918 (later renamed to Yugoslavia), a few thousand Serbs moved to Croatian territory. During [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Serbs were targeted for extermination as part of [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] by [[Usta\u0161e]]. After the beginning of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia's proclamation of independence, the Serbs living in Croatia rebelled against the Croatian government and proclaimed the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) on parts of Croatian territory, which led to the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. After the Croatian Army's [[Operation Storm]], the RSK ceased to exist, its territory was reincorporated into Croatia, and approximately 200,000 Serbs fled the country.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there were 186,633 Serbs living in Croatia (4.4% of the population) which are recognized as a national minority by the Croatian Constitution and therefore have 3 permanent seats in the [[Croatian Parliament]].\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional elements of their identity are the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]], [[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic script]] and military history, while modern elements are [[Serbian language|language]] and [[Serbian literature|literature]], civic, social and political values, concern for ethnic status and national organisation, and celebration of the [[Liberation of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/planeta.300.html:514233-Srbi-u-Hrvatskoj-zabrinuti-da-ce-nestati|title=Srbi u Hrvatskoj zabrinuti da \u0107e nestati}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2011 census there were 186,633 ethnic [[Serbs]] living in Croatia, 4.4% of the total population.

In the summer of 1685, Cosmi, the Archbishop of Split, wrote that Morlach leader [[Stojan Jankovi\u0107]] had brought 300 families with him to Dalmatia, and also that around Trogir and Split there were 5,000 refugees from Ottoman lands, without food; this was seen as a serious threat to the defense of Dalmatia.

The [[Serbianisation]] of the Vlachs in southern Croatia was the result of the hierarchical linkage of Orthodox Vlachs from southern Croatian territories, at the time ruled by the Venetians, with the SPC in northern Croatia, which strengthened the ritual and ecclesiastical connection of the Vlachs with the Serb immigrants.<ref>Introduction by Mirko Valenti\u0107 in: Mile Bogovi\u0107: Katoli\u010dka Crkva i Pravoslavlje u Dalmaciji za vrijeme mleta\u010dke vladavine, Kr\u0161\u0107anska sada\u0161njost/\u0160kolska knjiga, Zagreb, 1993., p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, the Serbian thought began spreading among the Orthodox Christians in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]].

At first, its borders were supposed to be the borders of the Ottoman Empire and the Slavs in them, but they gradually expanded to the territory of present-day Croatia (including the Military Frointaire and Dalmatia).<ref name=\"auto\">Benedikta Zeli\u0107-Bu\u0107an, Prologue in: Mihovil Pavlinovi\u0107: Misao hrvatska i misao srbska u Dalmaciji, Laus, Split, 1994., p. 11</ref> To accomplish this, the ground had to be prepared, so that diplomacy and the military would have a stronger base for taking action. The bases for this was the Serbian state law, and where it wasn't possible to appropriate the land with it, the argument of nationality, and when that argument couldn't be applied, then it was necessary to \"create\" the Serbs among the target population, if not among all, then among the majority. The main target were Orthodox Christians in the neighboring, non-Serb countries. In 1848/50, Serbian government organized a secret network of agents who propagated the Serbian ideas. Those agents were concealed as cultural workers. The famous agents were [[Georgije Nikolajevi\u0107]] and [[Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The 'creation' of new Serbs was carried out by identification of Orthodox Christianity in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina only with Serbs.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/67500|title=The Serbian question in Croatian politics, 1848\u20131918|first=Markus|last=Tomislav|date=1 April 2011|journal=Review of Croatian History|volume=VI|issue=1}}</ref> Another argument used in the areas with no Orthodox Christians was identifying people who spoke [[Shtokavian]] with the Serbs. The idea \"all Shtokavians are Serbs\" was created by German Slavists in the 1850s, and was promoted by the Austrian government who wanted to equalize Croats and Serbs so that it could more easily rule the Croatian lands and in the next stage conquer Serbia and penetrate across [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"matica.hr\">http://www.matica.hr/vijenac/427/Srpski%20jezik%20nije%20\u0161tokavski/</ref> The idea was that it was easier to \"govern Belgrade and Zagreb if the same language was spoken in them\".

The plan, which was submitted five months later by Don Eduardo Lopez Navarro, was entitled ''Memoria Sobre el Plan General de Ferrocarriles en la Isla de Luz\u00f3n'', and was promptly approved. A concession for the construction of a railway line from [[Manila]] to [[Dagupan City|Dagupan]] was granted to Don Edmundo Sykes of the Ferrocarril de Manila\u2013Dagupan (Manila\u2013Dagupan Railway), later to become the Manila Railway Company, Ltd. of London, on June 1, 1887.<ref name=\"PNR history\">{{cite web|url=http://pnr.gov.ph/history.htm |title=Brief history of PNR |publisher=Philippine National Railways (February 27, 2009) |accessdate=November 4, 2011<!-->at [[Internet Archive]]<--> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227040648/http://pnr.gov.ph/history.htm |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHCP\">{{cite web|title=Manila Railroad Company|url=http://nhcphistoricsites.blogspot.com/2011/11/manila-railroad-company.html|work=National Register of Historic Sites & Structures in the Philippines|publisher=[[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Ferrocarril de Manila\u2013Dagupan, which constitutes much of the North Main Line today, began construction on July 31, 1887 with the laying of the cornerstone for [[Tutuban railway station|Tutuban station]], and the {{convert|195|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} line opened on November 24, 1892.  Expansion of the Philippine railway network would not begin until the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American colonial period]], when on December 8, 1902, the [[Philippine Commission]] passed legislation authorizing the construction of another railway line, which would later form the South Main Line.\n\n===American period===\n[[File:Manila Railway Company 1907.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.8|left|Bond of the Manila Railway Company Ltd, issued 10.

The MRR was eventually nationalized in January 1917, with the Philippine government paying \u20b18 million to the company's owners and assuming \u20b153.9 million in outstanding debt. Consequently, the MRR's management shifted from British to American hands, and in 1923, Jos\u00e9 Paez became the first Filipino general manager.<ref name=\"survey1951\" />\n\nDuring the 1920s, the MRR embarked on a general program of improvements as a result of operating surpluses accrued over much of the decade.  The \u20b130 million program allowed for the extension of railway service on the North Main Line from Dagupan to [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]] in [[La Union]], the extension of the South Main Line to [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] in [[Albay]], and the construction of several spur lines. The last rail connecting Manila to Bicol was laid on November 17, 1937 and regular direct service between Manila and Legazpi was inaugurated on May 8, 1938, and by 1941, the MRR operated {{convert|1140.5|km|mi|sp=us}} of track.<ref name=\"survey1951\" />\n\nOn December 14, 1941, at the start of [[World War II]], the MRR was put under U.S. military control, and on December 30, the MRR management was ordered to allow U.S. military forces to destroy network infrastructure, resulting in very extensive damage to train facilities and right of way.  Coupled with further damage during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]], where the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] operated services on a very limited basis using whatever could be salvaged, and further fighting in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|Allied liberation of the Philippines]] by the combined American and Filipino forces a few years later, damages to railroad property amounted to around \u20b130 million.<ref name=\"survey1951\" />  By the end of the war, only {{convert|452|km|mi|sp=us}} were operational,<ref name=\"PNR history\" /> largely as a result of the [[United States Army]] and the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] performing temporary repairs on railroad infrastructure for military purposes.  MRR property was later returned to the Philippine government on February 1, 1946.<ref name=\"survey1951\" />\n\n===Post-war period===\nFollowing the war, the MRR was able to restore limited services, using surplus military equipment and payments made by the United States Army and the Philippine Commonwealth Army for use of railway facilities in the Philippines Campaign.  By July 1, 1947, funded by a \u20b120 million rehabilitation allocation set aside by the Philippine government, around 75% of the entire railway network prior to 1941 was rehabilitated.

On July 23, 1979, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] issued Executive Order No. 546, which designated the Philippine National Railways as an attached agency of the then [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]].<ref name=\"PNR history\" />\n\nIn 1988, during the administration of [[Corazon Aquino]], the North main line was closed, with trains unable to reach various [[provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] in the country. The South main line was also closed due to typhoons and floods, and the eruption of [[Mayon|Mayon Volcano]] in 1993, in which ash flows and lava destroyed the rail line and its facilities. However, jeeps, buses and taxis were popular, and many people were swayed from the present service until 2009.\n\nWhen Fidel V. Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino, he decided to rehabilitate the South Main Line from Tutuban to Legaspi, and appointed Jose B. Dado as the new PNR general manager. A railway system running from Manila to Clark was also set to be constructed in the 1990s, when Ramos signed a memorandum of agreement with [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] for its construction in September 1994, but the project was later cancelled due to disagreement on the source of funding.<ref name=\"ABSCBN-NorthRailTimeline\">{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/07/15/08/track-northrail-timeline|title=Off track: Northrail timeline|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary history===\n====Rehabilitation attempts and the NorthRail project====\n{{See also|North\u2013South Commuter Railway#NorthRail project}}\nThe administration of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] actively pursued the rehabilitation of the Philippine National Railways through various investments and projects designed to revive Philippine rail transport,<ref name=\"PNR history\" /><ref name=\"southrail\" /><ref name=\"pnr-rehab\">{{cite news |title=PNR rail rehabilitation to start September |first=Riza T. |last=Olchondra |url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view_article.php?article_id=61814 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221155141/http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view_article.php?article_id=61814 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 21, 2013 |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |location=Manila |date=April 22, 2007 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |quote=The Philippine National Railways (PNR) will start repairing and improving its North and South railways by September, PNR General Manager Jose Ma.

A separate train between Pamplona and Tabaco, and between Port Ragay and Legazpi was opened by 1933. The Tabaco branch line during this era was closed in 1937 and instead, they linked these three sections into a single line. This formed the backbone of the South Main Line and was subsequently opened in 1938. This service was short lived and ended during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in 1942. During this era, the Japanese government focused on rebuilding the North Main Line instead and extended it to [[Sudipen]] on the border between [[Ilocos Sur]] and [[La Union]], and the south line's rehabilitation was cut to [[San Pablo, Laguna]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1942 0619 Affairs Concerning Railway Battalion of the Imperial Japanese Forces|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/29421855@N07/21621048500/in/pool-1395212@N21/|website=[[Flickr]]|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the line's post-war rehabilitation, another service was opened.

The inter-city CMCs were replaced by new streamlined ''Pe\u00f1afrancia Express'' trains in the 1980s while it continued to serve on the [[PNR Metro Commuter Line]] until 1999 when it was replaced by Japanese push-pull 7A class coaches.\n\nSince 2009, PNR has acquired several multiple units that were either given second-hand from Japan, or brand new from other countries. This began with the purchase of then brand-new [[PNR Hyundai Rotem DMU|Hyundai Rotem DMUs]].<ref name=\"Specs\" /> This order was followed by several orders of mostly second-hand rolling stock from Japan. In 2018, PNR signed a deal with Indonesian rolling stock manufacturer [[Industri Kereta Api]] (PT INKA) for purchase of another six sets of multiple units. By entering service in 2019, these were officially named the 8000 Class.<ref name=\"Inquirer-7Trains\" /> The Department of Science and Technology also helped in building additional stock through the Hybrid Electric Train (HET).

Each of these are painted by hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/46273205@N02/5796451721|title=GEDC2105|website=Flickr|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Steam locomotive era (1892-1954)===\nThere were no available colored images of Manila-Dagupan Railway and the Manila Railroad Company's rolling stock before the war so the color scheme of the carriages remains unknown. However, based on the surviving locomotives, the steam locomotives owned by the two companies sported a black-only livery like most of the notable American steam engines.<ref name=\"is\"/>\n\n===Railmotor livery (1948)===\nThe Cummins railmotors were colored black or white, and orange. The pre-war carriages salvaged and refurbished in the late 1940s also used this color scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/36157525@N02/4540997038/in/photolist-7VgNdo|title=MotorTrain-1|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===MRR/PNR livery (1955)===\n[[File:PNR Logo.png|thumbnail|upright=0.9|right|Monogram of the PNR used in the 1960s.

The livery was retained when the Philippine government took over and renamed it the Philippine National Railways. During the transition to PNR, the old MRR monogram with a diamond-shaped seal was painted out and the PNR circular seal and monogram was placed on the front of the cab with yellow wing-like symbols outside it. The PNR acronym is also placed on the sides as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/intervene/4495939839 |title=1978 LOCO No. 901|website=Flickr|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref> By the 1980s, the diesel multiple units will have a yellow body and the wing-like symbols are colored dark green.\n\n===Commuter Motor Coach livery (c. 1978)===\nDuring the late 1970s, the Commuter Motor Coaches used on PNR's local train services in Metro Manila and the Bicol Region was colored white and navy blue.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1980 PNR TO CARMONA|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/intervene/3473134160|website=Flickr|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Metrotren livery (1990)===\nWhen President [[Corazon Aquino]] inaugurated the rebranded [[PNR Metro Commuter Line|Manila commuter service]] as \"Metrotren\" in 1990, the CMC coaches were repainted to navy blue, white and red. This was also used for the 1998 restocking of the ''Bicol Express'' with the old ''Pe\u00f1afrancia Express'' IC-888 train. This was used until the mid 2000s when both multiple unit types were changed to the navy blue livery.<ref>{{Cite web|title=06649 (228) 04-02-1990 Philippine National Railways (PNR) in the yard outside the workshops I building with a Metrotren carriage in Kaloocan City, Manila, Philippines. |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/25653307@N03/3696525933/|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Philippines 2000 livery (1997)===\nThe [[GE Universal Series]]-based 900, 2500 and 5000 classes sported a red livery celebrating Fidel Ramos' [[Philippines 2000]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/14564368@N02/33599106536/|title=908 Tayuman|access-date=March 16, 2020.}}</ref> Although the PNR revised this livery after 2000, some retained it due to lack of maintenance funds and a 900 class survived with this livery in use until 2008.

This followed after PNR acquired locomotive-hauled 12 and 14 series coaches from Japan. There are subtle differences with the coaches used on the ''Commuter Express'' (formerly ''Metrotren'') and the ''Bicol Express''. The ''Commuter Express'' trainsets were navy blue with orange highlights while the ''Bicol Express'' were navy blue with gold highlights. The PNR symbol on the ''Commuter Express'' was white while on the ''Bicol Express'' was gold. The locomotives' colors were also changed to navy blue and orange.\n\nThis livery was re-introduced in 2011 although it was not used on the ''Bicol Express'' trainsets.\n{{-}}\n\n===Filtrack livery (2009)===\nPNR attempted to revitalize the ''Bicol Express'' in 2009 with the support of president [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]]. This was supported with a change of logo and liveries. The coaches in PNR service used white and orange while the locomotives' cabs were colored white while the PNR monogram logo was sealed out. The trains also sported the \"Filtrack\" brand on the coaches and on the side of the locomotives. However, this was short lived after the ''Bicol Express'' stopped its services indefinitely. By 2015, all of the rolling stock followed the 2000s navy blue livery.\n\n===INKA livery (2019)===\n[[File:INKA-8101_near_FTI_Station.jpg|thumbnail|left|An INKA-built [[PNR 8100 class]] with the new livery]].\nThe PNR announced another logo change and changes to its livery in 2019. This is after the [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte administration]] under the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] announced major reforms to the PNR. The PNR's monogram is now fully incorporated on a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]-type logo, bearing the agency's name and the year it was founded. The seal was also changed from orange and blue to golden yellow and navy blue. At the same time, the rolling stock also changed its liveries with regards to the arrival of the new rolling stock from Indonesia. The [[203 series]]-based passenger cars' liveries did not change as of 2020.\n\nThe first among the old rolling stock was the [[KiHa 35]]0 and [[KiHa 59 series]] trains. After this was the Hyundai Rotem DMUs and finally, 900 series locomotive DEL 917 changed its livery to orange, similar to the upcoming CC300s. All multiple units were fitted with new windows to resist stoning. The colors however varied from one type of rolling stock to another but the common theme was the inclusion of orange (as the highlight color), white (as the main stock color), navy blue (as the side line color) and black (as the bottom color).\n\n===CRRC diesel multiple unit livery (2021)===\nThe latest effort to the revitalization of the South Main Line, particularly the ''Bicol Express'' intercity service, was unveiled in 2019 dubbed the \"South Long Haul\" project. A scale model of the train that will be used was revealed during a contract signing ceremony between the Philippine National Railways, its superior agency the Department of Transportation, and the Chinese rolling stock manufacturer CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive. The three-car train will also feature a red-orange livery with black stripes on its windows. This train is set to arrive by 2021.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transportation|Railways|Philippines}}\n* [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]]\n* [[List of Philippine National Railways stations]]\n* [[Panay Railways]]\n* [[Rail transport in the Philippines]]\n* [[Strong Republic Transit System]]\n\n==Notes==\n:{{Note|a}} Inter-city and freight services have been suspended since 2016.

The plan, which was submitted five months later by Don Eduardo Lopez Navarro, was entitled ''Memoria Sobre el Plan General de Ferrocarriles en la Isla de Luz\u00f3n'', and was promptly approved. A concession for the construction of a railway line from [[Manila]] to [[Dagupan City|Dagupan]] was granted to Don Edmundo Sykes of the Ferrocarril de Manila\u2013Dagupan (Manila\u2013Dagupan Railway), later to become the Manila Railway Company, Ltd. of London, on June 1, 1887.<ref name=\"PNR history\">{{cite web|url=http://pnr.gov.ph/history.htm |title=Brief history of PNR |publisher=Philippine National Railways (February 27, 2009) |accessdate=November 4, 2011<!-->at [[Internet Archive]]<--> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227040648/http://pnr.gov.ph/history.htm |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHCP\">{{cite web|title=Manila Railroad Company|url=http://nhcphistoricsites.blogspot.com/2011/11/manila-railroad-company.html|work=National Register of Historic Sites & Structures in the Philippines|publisher=[[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]]|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Ferrocarril de Manila\u2013Dagupan, which constitutes much of the North Main Line today, began construction on July 31, 1887 with the laying of the cornerstone for [[Tutuban railway station|Tutuban station]], and the {{convert|195|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} line opened on November 24, 1892.  Expansion of the Philippine railway network would not begin until the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American colonial period]], when on December 8, 1902, the [[Philippine Commission]] passed legislation authorizing the construction of another railway line, which would later form the South Main Line.\n\n===American period===\n[[File:Manila Railway Company 1907.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.8|left|Bond of the Manila Railway Company Ltd, issued 10.

The MRR was eventually nationalized in January 1917, with the Philippine government paying \u20b18 million to the company's owners and assuming \u20b153.9 million in outstanding debt. Consequently, the MRR's management shifted from British to American hands, and in 1923, Jos\u00e9 Paez became the first Filipino general manager.<ref name=\"survey1951\" />\n\nDuring the 1920s, the MRR embarked on a general program of improvements as a result of operating surpluses accrued over much of the decade.  The \u20b130 million program allowed for the extension of railway service on the North Main Line from Dagupan to [[San Fernando, La Union|San Fernando]] in [[La Union]], the extension of the South Main Line to [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] in [[Albay]], and the construction of several spur lines. The last rail connecting Manila to Bicol was laid on November 17, 1937 and regular direct service between Manila and Legazpi was inaugurated on May 8, 1938, and by 1941, the MRR operated {{convert|1140.5|km|mi|sp=us}} of track.<ref name=\"survey1951\" />\n\nOn December 14, 1941, at the start of [[World War II]], the MRR was put under U.S. military control, and on December 30, the MRR management was ordered to allow U.S. military forces to destroy network infrastructure, resulting in very extensive damage to train facilities and right of way.  Coupled with further damage during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]], where the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] operated services on a very limited basis using whatever could be salvaged, and further fighting in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|Allied liberation of the Philippines]] by the combined American and Filipino forces a few years later, damages to railroad property amounted to around \u20b130 million.<ref name=\"survey1951\" />  By the end of the war, only {{convert|452|km|mi|sp=us}} were operational,<ref name=\"PNR history\" /> largely as a result of the [[United States Army]] and the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] performing temporary repairs on railroad infrastructure for military purposes.  MRR property was later returned to the Philippine government on February 1, 1946.<ref name=\"survey1951\" />\n\n===Post-war period===\nFollowing the war, the MRR was able to restore limited services, using surplus military equipment and payments made by the United States Army and the Philippine Commonwealth Army for use of railway facilities in the Philippines Campaign.  By July 1, 1947, funded by a \u20b120 million rehabilitation allocation set aside by the Philippine government, around 75% of the entire railway network prior to 1941 was rehabilitated.  By 1951, with the MRR receiving \u20b13 million in war reparations funds, {{convert|941.9|km|mi|sp=us}} of track, representing 82.5% of the total railway network prior to 1941, was in operation.<ref name=\"survey1951\" />  Later in the 1950s, the MRR fleet of locomotives was converted from steam to [[diesel engine]]s, and the company was given a new charter under [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act No. 4156]], becoming the modern-day Philippine National Railways.\n\n===Creation of PNR===\nNatural calamities such as the 1973 and 1975 floods disrupted services and forced the closure of several parts of the main lines. On July 23, 1979, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] issued Executive Order No. 546, which designated the Philippine National Railways as an attached agency of the then [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]].<ref name=\"PNR history\" />\n\nIn 1988, during the administration of [[Corazon Aquino]], the North main line was closed, with trains unable to reach various [[provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] in the country. The South main line was also closed due to typhoons and floods, and the eruption of [[Mayon|Mayon Volcano]] in 1993, in which ash flows and lava destroyed the rail line and its facilities. However, jeeps, buses and taxis were popular, and many people were swayed from the present service until 2009.\n\nWhen Fidel V. Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino, he decided to rehabilitate the South Main Line from Tutuban to Legaspi, and appointed Jose B. Dado as the new PNR general manager. A railway system running from Manila to Clark was also set to be constructed in the 1990s, when Ramos signed a memorandum of agreement with [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] for its construction in September 1994, but the project was later cancelled due to disagreement on the source of funding.<ref name=\"ABSCBN-NorthRailTimeline\">{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/07/15/08/track-northrail-timeline|title=Off track: Northrail timeline|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary history===\n====Rehabilitation attempts and the NorthRail project====\n{{See also|North\u2013South Commuter Railway#NorthRail project}}\nThe administration of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] actively pursued the rehabilitation of the Philippine National Railways through various investments and projects designed to revive Philippine rail transport,<ref name=\"PNR history\" /><ref name=\"southrail\" /><ref name=\"pnr-rehab\">{{cite news |title=PNR rail rehabilitation to start September |first=Riza T. |last=Olchondra |url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view_article.php?article_id=61814 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221155141/http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view_article.php?article_id=61814 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 21, 2013 |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |location=Manila |date=April 22, 2007 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |quote=The Philippine National Railways (PNR) will start repairing and improving its North and South railways by September, PNR General Manager Jose Ma.

A separate train between Pamplona and Tabaco, and between Port Ragay and Legazpi was opened by 1933. The Tabaco branch line during this era was closed in 1937 and instead, they linked these three sections into a single line. This formed the backbone of the South Main Line and was subsequently opened in 1938. This service was short lived and ended during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in 1942. During this era, the Japanese government focused on rebuilding the North Main Line instead and extended it to [[Sudipen]] on the border between [[Ilocos Sur]] and [[La Union]], and the south line's rehabilitation was cut to [[San Pablo, Laguna]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1942 0619 Affairs Concerning Railway Battalion of the Imperial Japanese Forces|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/29421855@N07/21621048500/in/pool-1395212@N21/|website=[[Flickr]]|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the line's post-war rehabilitation, another service was opened.

However, since the early 2010s, the government has put several diesel multiple units into service which were either second-hand Japanese trainsets or the Hyundai Rotem EMU that was new at the time. Currently, the only locomotive-hauled railcar type in service are the [[203 series]]-derived coaches which were EMUs stripped of motive power components which they have used during their Japanese service. By 2020, it is expected that a batch of 15 coaches will arrive from Indonesia.<ref name=\"Inquirer-7Trains\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Coaches\n! Class  \n!

It was later complemented and replaced by the box-shaped CMC units built in 1973. The CMC units were used on the ''Mayon Limited'' and also became the first trains on the ''Pe\u00f1afrancia Express'' service. The inter-city CMCs were replaced by new streamlined ''Pe\u00f1afrancia Express'' trains in the 1980s while it continued to serve on the [[PNR Metro Commuter Line]] until 1999 when it was replaced by Japanese push-pull 7A class coaches.\n\nSince 2009, PNR has acquired several multiple units that were either given second-hand from Japan, or brand new from other countries. This began with the purchase of then brand-new [[PNR Hyundai Rotem DMU|Hyundai Rotem DMUs]].<ref name=\"Specs\" /> This order was followed by several orders of mostly second-hand rolling stock from Japan. In 2018, PNR signed a deal with Indonesian rolling stock manufacturer [[Industri Kereta Api]] (PT INKA) for purchase of another six sets of multiple units. By entering service in 2019, these were officially named the 8000 Class.<ref name=\"Inquirer-7Trains\" /> The Department of Science and Technology also helped in building additional stock through the Hybrid Electric Train (HET). This is the first trainset to be designed by Filipino engineers and the first locally-built multiple units since the 1948 Cummins railmotors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://techmagus.icu/dost-hybrid-electric-train-inauguration/|title=DOST's Hybrid Electric Train Inauguration|date=April 29, 2019|work=techmagus|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref> It was officially turned over to PNR on June 20, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mirdc.dost.gov.ph/2-uncategorised/188-dost-mirdc-turns-over-the-hybrid-electric-train-het-to-the-pnr|title=DOST-MIRDC turns over the Hybrid Electric Train (HET) to the PNR|website=The Official Website of Metals Industry Research and Development Center|language=en-gb|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> The government is currently negotiating with local companies for the HET's mass production.\n\nIn 2019, with the realization of the [[North\u2013South Commuter Railway]] project that has been on hold, PNR ordered thirteen Sustina Commuter electric trains from [[Japan Transport Engineering Company]] (J-TREC) and shall begin operations by 2021.<ref name=\"BWorldOnline-DoTr\" /> The project will be the first part of the system-wide modernization of PNR from narrow gauge and diesel power to standard gauge and electric power that shall happen in the long term.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nMultiple Units\n!Class\n!Image\n!Type\n!Gauge\n!Manufacturer\n!Year Built\n!Top Speed\n!Units Built\n!Status\n|-\n|''Cummins Railmotor''\n|\n|DMU\n|{{Track gauge|1067 mm|lk=on}}\n|MRR\n|1948\n|\n|\n|Decommissioned<ref name=\"cmi\">[https://www.flickr.com/photos/79691913@N05/12693933305/in/pool-1395212@N21/ 1948 0331 New Rail Motor train -

Each of these are painted by hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/46273205@N02/5796451721|title=GEDC2105|website=Flickr|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Steam locomotive era (1892-1954)===\nThere were no available colored images of Manila-Dagupan Railway and the Manila Railroad Company's rolling stock before the war so the color scheme of the carriages remains unknown. However, based on the surviving locomotives, the steam locomotives owned by the two companies sported a black-only livery like most of the notable American steam engines.<ref name=\"is\"/>\n\n===Railmotor livery (1948)===\nThe Cummins railmotors were colored black or white, and orange. The pre-war carriages salvaged and refurbished in the late 1940s also used this color scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/36157525@N02/4540997038/in/photolist-7VgNdo|title=MotorTrain-1|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===MRR/PNR livery (1955)===\n[[File:PNR Logo.png|thumbnail|upright=0.9|right|Monogram of the PNR used in the 1960s. The modern PNR seal altered its colors to blue and orange.]]\nThe MRR celebrated the arrival of its first diesel rolling stock with its colors changed to dark green and yellow, or alternately to yellow-orange and dark green. The livery was retained when the Philippine government took over and renamed it the Philippine National Railways. During the transition to PNR, the old MRR monogram with a diamond-shaped seal was painted out and the PNR circular seal and monogram was placed on the front of the cab with yellow wing-like symbols outside it. The PNR acronym is also placed on the sides as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/intervene/4495939839 |title=1978 LOCO No. 901|website=Flickr|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref> By the 1980s, the diesel multiple units will have a yellow body and the wing-like symbols are colored dark green.\n\n===Commuter Motor Coach livery (c. 1978)===\nDuring the late 1970s, the Commuter Motor Coaches used on PNR's local train services in Metro Manila and the Bicol Region was colored white and navy blue.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1980 PNR TO CARMONA|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/intervene/3473134160|website=Flickr|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Metrotren livery (1990)===\nWhen President [[Corazon Aquino]] inaugurated the rebranded [[PNR Metro Commuter Line|Manila commuter service]] as \"Metrotren\" in 1990, the CMC coaches were repainted to navy blue, white and red. This was also used for the 1998 restocking of the ''Bicol Express'' with the old ''Pe\u00f1afrancia Express'' IC-888 train. This was used until the mid 2000s when both multiple unit types were changed to the navy blue livery.<ref>{{Cite web|title=06649 (228) 04-02-1990 Philippine National Railways (PNR) in the yard outside the workshops I building with a Metrotren carriage in Kaloocan City, Manila, Philippines. |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/25653307@N03/3696525933/|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Philippines 2000 livery (1997)===\nThe [[GE Universal Series]]-based 900, 2500 and 5000 classes sported a red livery celebrating Fidel Ramos' [[Philippines 2000]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/14564368@N02/33599106536/|title=908 Tayuman|access-date=March 16, 2020.}}</ref> Although the PNR revised this livery after 2000, some retained it due to lack of maintenance funds and a 900 class survived with this livery in use until 2008.

This followed after PNR acquired locomotive-hauled 12 and 14 series coaches from Japan. There are subtle differences with the coaches used on the ''Commuter Express'' (formerly ''Metrotren'') and the ''Bicol Express''. The ''Commuter Express'' trainsets were navy blue with orange highlights while the ''Bicol Express'' were navy blue with gold highlights. The PNR symbol on the ''Commuter Express'' was white while on the ''Bicol Express'' was gold. The locomotives' colors were also changed to navy blue and orange.\n\nThis livery was re-introduced in 2011 although it was not used on the ''Bicol Express'' trainsets.\n{{-}}\n\n===Filtrack livery (2009)===\nPNR attempted to revitalize the ''Bicol Express'' in 2009 with the support of president [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]]. This was supported with a change of logo and liveries. The coaches in PNR service used white and orange while the locomotives' cabs were colored white while the PNR monogram logo was sealed out. The trains also sported the \"Filtrack\" brand on the coaches and on the side of the locomotives. However, this was short lived after the ''Bicol Express'' stopped its services indefinitely. By 2015, all of the rolling stock followed the 2000s navy blue livery.\n\n===INKA livery (2019)===\n[[File:INKA-8101_near_FTI_Station.jpg|thumbnail|left|An INKA-built [[PNR 8100 class]] with the new livery]].\nThe PNR announced another logo change and changes to its livery in 2019. This is after the [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte administration]] under the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] announced major reforms to the PNR. The PNR's monogram is now fully incorporated on a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]-type logo, bearing the agency's name and the year it was founded. The seal was also changed from orange and blue to golden yellow and navy blue. At the same time, the rolling stock also changed its liveries with regards to the arrival of the new rolling stock from Indonesia. The [[203 series]]-based passenger cars' liveries did not change as of 2020.\n\nThe first among the old rolling stock was the [[KiHa 35]]0 and [[KiHa 59 series]] trains. After this was the Hyundai Rotem DMUs and finally, 900 series locomotive DEL 917 changed its livery to orange, similar to the upcoming CC300s. All multiple units were fitted with new windows to resist stoning. The colors however varied from one type of rolling stock to another but the common theme was the inclusion of orange (as the highlight color), white (as the main stock color), navy blue (as the side line color) and black (as the bottom color).\n\n===CRRC diesel multiple unit livery (2021)===\nThe latest effort to the revitalization of the South Main Line, particularly the ''Bicol Express'' intercity service, was unveiled in 2019 dubbed the \"South Long Haul\" project. A scale model of the train that will be used was revealed during a contract signing ceremony between the Philippine National Railways, its superior agency the Department of Transportation, and the Chinese rolling stock manufacturer CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive. The three-car train will also feature a red-orange livery with black stripes on its windows. This train is set to arrive by 2021.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transportation|Railways|Philippines}}\n* [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]]\n* [[List of Philippine National Railways stations]]\n* [[Panay Railways]]\n* [[Rail transport in the Philippines]]\n* [[Strong Republic Transit System]]\n\n==Notes==\n:{{Note|a}} Inter-city and freight services have been suspended since 2016.

Heat and work depend on the way in which an energy transfer occurred, whereas internal energy is a [[state function|property of the state of a system]] and can thus be understood without knowing how the energy got there.\n\nIn a statistical mechanical account of an [[ideal gas]], in which the molecules move independently between instantaneous collisions, the internal energy is the sum total of the gas's independent particles' kinetic energies, and it is this kinetic motion that is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system's boundary. For such a gas, the term 'thermal energy' is effectively synonymous with '[[internal energy]]'.

It was primarily an [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]], [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration]], and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] movement, originally starting as a [[secret society]]. The Know Nothing movement also briefly emerged as a major political party in the form of the American Party. Adherents to the movement were to simply reply \"I know nothing\" when asked about its specifics by outsiders, providing the group with its common name.<ref name=\"Boissoneault\">{{cite web|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|title=How the 19th-Century Know Nothing Party Reshaped American Politics|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/immigrants-conspiracies-and-secret-society-launched-american-nativism-180961915/|website=Smithsonian Magazine|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nSupporters of the Know Nothing movement believed that an alleged \"[[Romanism|Romanist]]\" conspiracy was being planned to subvert civil and religious liberty in the United States, and sought to politically organize native-born [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in what they described as a defense of their traditional religious and political values. The Know Nothing movement is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large bloc of voters. In most places, the ideology and influence of the Know Nothing movement lasted only a year or two before disintegrating due to weak and inexperienced local leaders, a lack of publicly declared national leaders, and a deep split over the issue of slavery. In the South, the party did not emphasize anti-Catholicism as frequently as it did in the North, but it became the main alternative to the dominant [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name=\"Boissoneault\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] after the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] left an opening for the emergence of a new major political party in opposition to the Democratic Party. The Know Nothing movement managed to elect congressman [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] of [[Massachusetts]] and several other individuals in the [[1854 United States elections|1854 elections]] into the U.S. Congress (with Banks becoming [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] of Representatives), and subsequently coalesced into a new political party known as the American Party. Particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]], the American Party served as a group of politicians who opposed the Democrats. Many also hoped that it would stake out a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of Democratic politicians and the radical anti-slavery positions of the rapidly emerging [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The American Party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], although he kept quiet about his membership, and personally refrained from supporting the Know Nothing movement's activities and ideology. Fillmore received 21.5% of the popular vote in the 1856 presidential election, finishing behind the Democratic and Republican nominees.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/know-nothings-opposed-immigration-in-lincoln-s-day/article_504e1b70-3331-5640-9248-0fc62c866a39.html|title='Know Nothings' Opposed Immigration in Lincoln's Day|newspaper=[[The Pantagraph]]|date=January 17, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2016|last=Kemp|first=Bill}}</ref>\n\nThe party entered a period of rapid decline after Millard Fillmore's loss in the 1856 election, and the controversial ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' decision made by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in 1857 further galvanized opposition to slavery in the North, causing many former Know Nothings to join the Republicans. Most of the remaining members of the party supported the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], which subsequently lost to [[Abraham Lincoln]] of the Republican Party, and said defeat ultimately led to the final dissolution of the Know Nothing movement that same year.\n\n== History ==\nAnti-Catholicism had been a factor in colonial America but played a minor role in American politics until the arrival of large numbers of Irish and German Catholics in the 1840s.<ref>Francis D. Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (Greenwood 1995).</ref> It then reemerged in nativist attacks on Catholic immigration. It appeared in [[New York City|New York]] politics as early as 1843 under the banner of the [[American Republican Party (1843)|American Republican Party]].<ref>Ira M.

They succeeded in a number of local and Congressional elections, notably in 1844 in Philadelphia, where the anti-Catholic orator [[Lewis Charles Levin]], who went on to be the first Jewish congressman, was elected Representative from Pennsylvania's 1st district. In the early 1850s, numerous secret orders grew up, of which the Order of United Americans<ref>Louis D. Scisco, ''Political Nativism in New York State'' (1901) p. 267.</ref> and the [[Order of the Star Spangled Banner]] came to be the most important. They merged in New York in the early 1850s as a secret order that quickly spread across the North, reaching non-Catholics, particularly those who were lower middle class or skilled workmen.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2675102|title = Conservatism, Nativism, and Slavery: Thomas R.

When a member was asked about his activities, he was supposed to reply, \"I know nothing.\" Outsiders derisively called them \"Know Nothings\", and the name stuck. In 1855, the Know Nothings first entered politics under the American Party label.<ref>Sean Wilentz. pp. 681\u20132, 693.</ref><ref>Ray A. Billington. pp. 337, 380\u2013406.</ref>\n\n=== Underlying issues ===\nThe immigration of large numbers of [[Irish Catholic|Irish]] and [[German Catholic|German]] Catholics to the United States in the period between 1830 and 1860 made religious differences between Catholics and Protestants a political issue. Violence occasionally erupted at the polls. Protestants alleged that Pope [[Pius IX]] had put down the failed liberal [[Revolutions of 1848]] and that he was an opponent of [[liberty]], [[democracy]] and [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. One [[Boston]] minister described Catholicism as \"the ally of tyranny, the opponent of material prosperity, the foe of thrift, the enemy of the railroad, the caucus, and the school\".<ref>Ray A. Billington. ''The Protestant Crusade, 1800\u20131860'' (1938) p. 242.</ref><ref>John T. McGreevey. ''Catholicism and American Freedom: A History'' (2003) pp. 22\u20135, 34 (quotation).</ref> These fears encouraged [[conspiracy theories]] regarding papal intentions of subjugating the United States through a continuing influx of Catholics controlled by Irish bishops obedient to and personally selected by the Pope.\n\nIn 1849, an oath-bound [[secret society]], the [[Order of the Star Spangled Banner]], was created by Charles B. Allen in New York City. At its inception, the Order of the Star Spangled Banner only had about 36 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wigwags.wordpress.com/category/the-order-of-the-star-spangled-banner/|title=Order of the Star Spangled Banner|last=Tyree|first=Rene|date=2008-12-29|website=wig-wags.worldpress.com|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref> Fear of Catholic immigration led to a dissatisfaction with the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], whose leadership in many cities included Catholics of Irish descent. Activists formed secret groups, coordinating their votes and throwing their weight behind candidates sympathetic to their cause: {{quote|Immigration during the first five years of the 1850s reached a level five times greater than a decade earlier. Most of the new arrivals were poor Catholic peasants or laborers from Ireland and Germany who crowded into the tenements of large cities. Crime and welfare costs soared.

McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', p. 131|source=}}\n\n=== Rise ===\nIn spring 1854, the Know Nothings carried Boston, [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], and other [[New England]] cities. They swept the state of Massachusetts in the fall 1854 elections, their biggest victory. The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate for mayor of [[Philadelphia]], editor [[Robert T. Conrad]], was soon revealed as a Know Nothing as he promised to crack down on crime, close saloons on Sundays and to appoint only native-born Americans to office\u2014he won by a landslide. In Washington, D.C., Know Nothing candidate [[John T. Towers]] defeated incumbent Mayor [[John Walker Maury]], causing opposition of such proportion that the Democrats, Whigs, and [[Free Soil Party|Freesoilers]] in the capital united as the \"Anti-Know-Nothing Party\". In New York, in a four-way race the Know Nothing candidate ran third with 26%. After the 1854 elections, they exerted decisive influence in Maine, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and California, but historians are unsure about the accuracy of this information due to the secrecy of the party as all parties were in turmoil and the [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] and [[Prohibition of alcohol|prohibition]] issues overlapped with nativism in complex and confusing ways. They helped elect [[Stephen Palfrey Webb]] as [[Mayor of San Francisco]] and [[J. Neely Johnson]] as [[Governor of California]]. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] was elected to Congress as a Know Nothing candidate, but after a few months he aligned with Republicans. A coalition of Know Nothings, Republicans and other members of Congress [[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|opposed]] to the Democratic Party elected Banks to the position of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].\n\nThe results of the 1854 elections were so favorable to the Know Nothings, up to then an informal movement with no centralized organization, that they formed officially as a political party called the American Party, which attracted many members of the now nearly defunct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] party as well as a significant number of Democrats. Membership in the American Party increased dramatically, from 50,000 to an estimated one million plus in a matter of months during that year.<ref>Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery'', pp. 75\u2013102.</ref>\n\nThe historian Tyler Anbinder concluded: {{quote|The key to Know Nothing success in 1854 was the collapse of the [[second party system]], brought about primarily by the demise of the Whig Party. The Whig Party, weakened for years by internal dissent and chronic factionalism, was nearly destroyed by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. Growing anti-party sentiment, fueled by anti-slavery sentiment as well as [[Temperance movement|temperance]] and nativism, also contributed to the disintegration of the party system. The collapsing second party system gave the Know Nothings a much larger pool of potential converts than was available to previous nativist organizations, allowing the Order to succeed where older nativist groups had failed.<ref>Tyler Anbinder.

Their Ohio success seems to have come from winning over immigrants, especially [[German American]] Lutherans and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[Presbyterians]], both hostile to Catholicism. In Alabama, Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, discontented Democrats and other political outsiders who favored state aid to build more railroads. Virginia attracted national attention in its tempestuous 1855 gubernatorial election. Democrat [[Henry Alexander Wise]] won by convincing state voters that Know Nothings were in bed with Northern abolitionists. With the victory by Wise, the movement began to collapse in the South.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (1947) 2:396\u20138.</ref><ref>John David Bladek, {{\"'}}Virginia Is Middle Ground': The Know Nothing Party and the Virginia Gubernatorial Election of 1855\".

Although most of the new immigrants lived in the North, resentment and anger against them was national and the American Party initially polled well in the South, attracting the votes of many former southern Whigs.<ref name=\"Carey1995\" />\n\nThe party name gained wide but brief popularity. Nativism became a new American rage: Know Nothing candy, Know Nothing tea, and Know Nothing toothpicks appeared. Stagecoaches were dubbed \"The Know Nothing\".

''Ohio History'', p. 93.</ref>\n\n=== Leadership and legislation ===\nHistorian John Mulkern has examined the party's success in sweeping to almost complete control of the Massachusetts legislature after its 1854 landslide victory. He finds the new party was populist and highly democratic, hostile to wealth, elites and to expertise and deeply suspicious of outsiders, especially Catholics. The new party's voters were concentrated in the rapidly growing industrial towns, where Yankee workers faced direct competition with new Irish immigrants. Whereas the Whig Party was strongest in high income districts, the Know Nothing electorate was strongest in the poor districts. They expelled the traditional upper-class closed political leadership class, especially the lawyers and merchants. In their stead, they elected working class men, farmers and a large number of teachers and ministers. Replacing the moneyed elite were men who seldom owned $10,000 in property.<ref>{{cite book|author=John R. Mulkern|title=The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts: The Rise and Fall of a People's Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyISxp0yfG0C&pg=PA86|year=1990|publisher=University Press of New England|pages=74\u201389|isbn=9781555530716}}</ref>\n\nNationally, the new party leadership showed incomes, occupation and social status that were about average. Few were wealthy, according to detailed historical studies of once-secret membership rosters. Fewer than 10% were unskilled workers who might come in direct competition with Irish laborers. They enlisted few farmers, but on the other hand they included many merchants and factory owners.<ref>Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery'', pp. 34\u201343.</ref> The party's voters were by no means all native-born Americans, for it won more than a fourth of the German and British Protestants in numerous state elections. It especially appealed to Protestants such as the Lutherans, Dutch Reformed and Presbyterians.<ref>{{cite book |first=William E. |last=Gienapp |title=Origins of the Republican Party 1852\u20131856 |year=1987 |pages=538\u2013542 }}</ref>\n\nThe most aggressive and innovative legislation came out of Massachusetts, where the new party controlled all but three of the 400 seats\u2014only 35 had any previous legislative experience. The Massachusetts legislature in 1855 passed a series of reforms that \"burst the dam against change erected by party politics, and released a flood of reforms.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Ronald P. |last=Formisano |title=The Transformation of Political Culture: Massachusetts Parties, 1790s\u20131840s |url=https://archive.org/details/transformationof0000form |url-access=registration |year=1983 |page=[https://archive.org/details/transformationof0000form/page/332 332] }}</ref> Historian Stephen Taylor says: {{quote|[In addition to nativist legislation], the party also distinguished itself by its opposition to slavery, support for an expansion of the rights of women, regulation of industry, and support of measures designed to improve the status of working people.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Taylor |title=Progressive Nativism: The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts |journal=Historical Journal of Massachusetts |year=2000 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=167\u201384 }}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nIt passed legislation to regulate railroads, insurance companies and public utilities. It funded free textbooks for the public schools and raised the appropriations for local libraries and for the school for the blind. Purification of Massachusetts against divisive social evils was a high priority. The legislature set up the state's first reform school for juvenile delinquents while trying to block the importation of supposedly subversive government documents and academic books from Europe. It upgraded the legal status of wives, giving them more property rights and more rights in divorce courts. It passed harsh penalties on speakeasies, gambling houses and bordellos. It passed prohibition legislation with penalties that were so stiff\u2014such as six months in prison for serving one glass of beer\u2014that juries refused to convict defendants. Many of the reforms were quite expensive; state spending rose 45% on top of a 50% hike in annual taxes on cities and towns. This extravagance angered the taxpayers, and few Know Nothings were reelected.<ref>Taylor, \"Progressive Nativism: The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts\" pp. 171\u20132.</ref>\n\nThe highest priority included attacks on the civil rights of Irish Catholic immigrants. After this, state courts lost the power to process applications for citizenship and public schools had to require compulsory daily reading of the Protestant Bible (which the nativists were sure would transform the Catholic children). The governor disbanded the Irish militias and replaced Irish holding state jobs with Protestants. It failed to reach the two-thirds vote needed to pass a state constitutional amendment to restrict voting and office holding to men who had resided in Massachusetts for at least 21 years. The legislature then called on Congress to raise the requirement for naturalization from five years to 21 years, but Congress never acted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mulkern|title=The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts: The Rise and Fall of a People's Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyISxp0yfG0C&pg=PA101|year=1990|pages=101\u20132|isbn=9781555530716}}</ref> The most dramatic move by the Know Nothing legislature was to appoint an investigating committee designed to prove widespread sexual immorality underway in Catholic convents.

States-rightist Whigs shunned it, enabling the Democrats to win most of the South.

Gleeson notes that many Irish Catholics in the South feared the arrival of the Know-Nothing movement portended a serious threat. He argues:\n\n<blockquote>The southern Irish, who had seen the dangers of Protestant bigotry in Ireland, had the distinct feeling that the Know-Nothings were an American manifestation of that phenomenon. Every migrant, no matter how settled or prosperous, also worried that this virulent strain of nativism threatened his or her hard-earned gains in the South and integration into its society. Immigrants' fears were unjustified, however, because the national debate over slavery and its expansion, not nativism or anti-Catholicism, was the major reason for Know-Nothing success in the South. The southerners who supported the Know-Nothings did so, for the most part, because they thought the Democrats who favored the expansion of slavery might break up the Union.<ref>David T. Gleeson, ''The Irish in the South, 1815\u20131877'' (2001) p. 78.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1855, the American Party challenged the Democrats' dominance. In Alabama, the Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, malcontented Democrats and other political misfits; they favored state aid to build more railroads. In the fierce campaign, the Democrats argued that Know Nothings could not protect slavery from Northern abolitionists. The Know Nothing American Party disintegrated soon after losing in 1855.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Unintended Consequences: The Rise and Fall of the Know-Nothing Party in Alabama |journal=[[Alabama Review]] |year=2002 |last=Frederick |first=Jeff|volume=55|issue=1|pages=3\u201333 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/5569301/unintended-consequences-rise-fall-know-nothing-party-alabama|access-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Louisiana and Maryland, the Know Nothings enlisted native-born Catholics.<ref name=\"Anbinder1992\">{{cite book|last=Anbinder|first=Tyler|title=Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the Politics of the 1850s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBZxbQRA0JkC&pg=PA103|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-507233-4|page=167}}</ref> Know Nothing congressman [[John Edward Bouligny]] was the only member of the Louisiana congressional delegation to refuse to resign his seat after the state seceded from the Union.<ref>{{cite speech |title=Feb. 5, 1861: Secession of Louisiana |first=John Edward |last=Bouligny |event=Speech in the House of Representatives |location=Washington, D.C. |date=February 5, 1861 |url=https://www.hnoc.org/programs/documents/LessonPlan_CivilWar.pdf |access-date=January 23, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202023424/https://www.hnoc.org/programs/documents/LessonPlan_CivilWar.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In Maryland, the party's influence lasted at least through the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]:  the American Party's Governor and later Senator [[Thomas Holliday Hicks]], Representative [[Henry Winter Davis]], and Senator [[Anthony Kennedy (Maryland)|Anthony Kennedy]], with his brother, former Representative [[John Pendleton Kennedy]], all supported the United States in a State which bordered the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]]. Historian Michael F. Holt argues that \"Know Nothingism originally grew in the South for the same reasons it spread in the North\u2014nativism, anti-Catholicism, and animosity toward unresponsive politicos\u2014not because of conservative Unionism\". Holt cites [[William B.

In the [[1856 U.S. presidential election|presidential election of 1856]], it was bitterly divided over slavery. The main faction supported the ticket of presidential nominee [[Millard Fillmore]] and vice presidential nominee [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]]. Fillmore, a former President, had been a Whig and Donelson was the nephew of Democratic President [[Andrew Jackson]], so the ticket was designed to appeal to loyalists from both major parties, winning 23% of the popular vote and carrying one state, [[Maryland]], with eight electoral votes. Fillmore did not win enough votes to block Democrat [[James Buchanan]] from the White House. During this time, Nathaniel Banks decided he was not as strongly for the anti-immigrant platform as the party wanted him to be, so he left the Know Nothing Party for the more anti-slavery Republican Party. He contributed to the decline of the Know Nothing Party by taking two-thirds of its members with him.\n\nMany were appalled by the Know Nothings. [[Abraham Lincoln]] expressed his own disgust with the political party in a private letter to [[Joshua Speed]] written August 24, 1855. Lincoln never publicly attacked the Know Nothings, whose votes he needed:\n\n<blockquote>I am not a Know-Nothing\u2014that is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that \"all men are created equal.\" We now practically read it \"all men are created equal, except negroes.\" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \"all men are created equals, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.\" When it comes to that I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty\u2014to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Francis Fisher|authorlink1=Francis Fisher Browne|title=The Every-day Life of Abraham Lincoln: A Narrative and Descriptive Biography with Pen-pictures and Personal Recollections by Those Who Knew Him|date=1914|publisher=Browne & Howell|page=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeabr03browgoog/page/n210 153]|url=https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeabr03browgoog|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Allan Nevins]], writing about the turmoil preceding the American Civil War, states that Millard Fillmore was never a Know Nothing nor a nativist. Fillmore was out of the country when the presidential nomination came and had not been consulted about running.  Nevins further states:\n\n<blockquote>[Fillmore] was not a member of the party; he had never attended an American [Know-Nothing] gathering. By no spoken or written word had he indicated a subscription to American [Party] tenets.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (1947), 2:467</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the Supreme Court's controversial ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1857, most of the anti-slavery members of the American Party joined the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. The pro-slavery wing of the American Party remained strong on the local and state levels in a few southern states, but by the [[1860 U.S. presidential election|1860 election]], they were no longer a serious national political movement. Most of their remaining members supported the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in 1860.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Anbinder |first=Tyler |year=1992 |title=Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the Politics of the 1850s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBZxbQRA0JkC&pg=PA270#v=twopage&q&f=false |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=270 |isbn=9780195072334 |oclc=925224120}}</ref>\n\n== Electoral history ==\n=== Congressional elections ===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|+United States<br />House of Representatives\n|-\n!Election year\n!No. of<br />overall seats won\n!+/\u2013\n!Presidency\n|-{{Party shading/Democratic}}\n![[1844 United States House of Representatives elections|1844]]\n|{{composition bar|6|227|hex=#999999}}\n|{{increase}} 6\n|{{Party shading/Democratic}} & rowspan=\"2\"|[[James K.

It was primarily an [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]], [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration]], and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] movement, originally starting as a [[secret society]]. The Know Nothing movement also briefly emerged as a major political party in the form of the American Party. Adherents to the movement were to simply reply \"I know nothing\" when asked about its specifics by outsiders, providing the group with its common name.<ref name=\"Boissoneault\">{{cite web|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|title=How the 19th-Century Know Nothing Party Reshaped American Politics|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/immigrants-conspiracies-and-secret-society-launched-american-nativism-180961915/|website=Smithsonian Magazine|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nSupporters of the Know Nothing movement believed that an alleged \"[[Romanism|Romanist]]\" conspiracy was being planned to subvert civil and religious liberty in the United States, and sought to politically organize native-born [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in what they described as a defense of their traditional religious and political values. The Know Nothing movement is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large bloc of voters. In most places, the ideology and influence of the Know Nothing movement lasted only a year or two before disintegrating due to weak and inexperienced local leaders, a lack of publicly declared national leaders, and a deep split over the issue of slavery. In the South, the party did not emphasize anti-Catholicism as frequently as it did in the North, but it became the main alternative to the dominant [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].<ref name=\"Boissoneault\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] after the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] left an opening for the emergence of a new major political party in opposition to the Democratic Party. The Know Nothing movement managed to elect congressman [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] of [[Massachusetts]] and several other individuals in the [[1854 United States elections|1854 elections]] into the U.S. Congress (with Banks becoming [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] of Representatives), and subsequently coalesced into a new political party known as the American Party. Particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]], the American Party served as a group of politicians who opposed to the Democrats. Many also hoped that it would stake out a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of Democratic politicians and the radical anti-slavery positions of the rapidly emerging [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The American Party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], although he kept quiet about his membership, and personally refrained from supporting the Know Nothing movement's activities and ideology. Fillmore received 21.5% of the popular vote in the 1856 presidential election, finishing behind the Democratic and Republican nominees.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/know-nothings-opposed-immigration-in-lincoln-s-day/article_504e1b70-3331-5640-9248-0fc62c866a39.html|title='Know Nothings' Opposed Immigration in Lincoln's Day|newspaper=[[The Pantagraph]]|date=January 17, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2016|last=Kemp|first=Bill}}</ref>\n\nThe party entered a period of rapid decline after Millard Fillmore's loss in the 1856 election, and the controversial ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' decision made by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in 1857 further galvanized opposition to slavery in the North, causing many former Know Nothings to join the Republicans. Most of the remaining members of the party supported the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], which subsequently lost to [[Abraham Lincoln]] of the Republican Party, and said defeat ultimately led to the final dissolution of the Know Nothing movement that same year.\n\n== History ==\nAnti-Catholicism had been a factor in colonial America but played a minor role in American politics until the arrival of large numbers of Irish and German Catholics in the 1840s.<ref>Francis D. Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (Greenwood 1995).</ref> It then reemerged in nativist attacks on Catholic immigration. It appeared in [[New York City|New York]] politics as early as 1843 under the banner of the [[American Republican Party (1843)|American Republican Party]].<ref>Ira M. Leonard, \"The Rise and Fall of the American Republican Party in New York City, 1843\u20131845.\" ''New-York Historical Society Quarterly'' 50 (1966): 151\u201392.</ref> The movement quickly spread to nearby states using that name or Native American Party or variants of it. They succeeded in a number of local and Congressional elections, notably in 1844 in Philadelphia, where the anti-Catholic orator [[Lewis Charles Levin]], who went on to be the first Jewish congressman, was elected Representative from Pennsylvania's 1st district. In the early 1850s, numerous secret orders grew up, of which the Order of United Americans<ref>Louis D. Scisco, ''Political Nativism in New York State'' (1901) p. 267.</ref> and the [[Order of the Star Spangled Banner]] came to be the most important. They merged in New York in the early 1850s as a secret order that quickly spread across the North, reaching non-Catholics, particularly those who were lower middle class or skilled workmen.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2675102|title = Conservatism, Nativism, and Slavery: Thomas R.

When a member was asked about his activities, he was supposed to reply, \"I know nothing.\" Outsiders derisively called them \"Know Nothings\", and the name stuck. In 1855, the Know Nothings first entered politics under the American Party label.<ref>Sean Wilentz. pp. 681\u20132, 693.</ref><ref>Ray A. Billington. pp. 337, 380\u2013406.</ref>\n\n=== Underlying issues ===\nThe immigration of large numbers of [[Irish Catholic|Irish]] and [[German Catholic|German]] Catholics to the United States in the period between 1830 and 1860 made religious differences between Catholics and Protestants a political issue. Violence occasionally erupted at the polls. Protestants alleged that Pope [[Pius IX]] had put down the failed liberal [[Revolutions of 1848]] and that he was an opponent of [[liberty]], [[democracy]] and [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. One [[Boston]] minister described Catholicism as \"the ally of tyranny, the opponent of material prosperity, the foe of thrift, the enemy of the railroad, the caucus, and the school\".<ref>Ray A. Billington. ''The Protestant Crusade, 1800\u20131860'' (1938) p. 242.</ref><ref>John T. McGreevey. ''Catholicism and American Freedom: A History'' (2003) pp. 22\u20135, 34 (quotation).</ref> These fears encouraged [[conspiracy theories]] regarding papal intentions of subjugating the United States through a continuing influx of Catholics controlled by Irish bishops obedient to and personally selected by the Pope.\n\nIn 1849, an oath-bound [[secret society]], the [[Order of the Star Spangled Banner]], was created by Charles B. Allen in New York City. At its inception, the Order of the Star Spangled Banner only had about 36 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wigwags.wordpress.com/category/the-order-of-the-star-spangled-banner/|title=Order of the Star Spangled Banner|last=Tyree|first=Rene|date=2008-12-29|website=wig-wags.worldpress.com|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref> Fear of Catholic immigration led to a dissatisfaction with the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], whose leadership in many cities included Catholics of Irish descent. Activists formed secret groups, coordinating their votes and throwing their weight behind candidates sympathetic to their cause: {{quote|Immigration during the first five years of the 1850s reached a level five times greater than a decade earlier. Most of the new arrivals were poor Catholic peasants or laborers from Ireland and Germany who crowded into the tenements of large cities. Crime and welfare costs soared. Cincinnati's crime rate, for example, tripled between 1846 and 1853 and its murder rate increased sevenfold. Boston's expenditures for poor relief rose threefold during the same period.|[[James M. McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', p. 131|source=}}\n\n=== Rise ===\nIn spring 1854, the Know Nothings carried Boston, [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], and other [[New England]] cities. They swept the state of Massachusetts in the fall 1854 elections, their biggest victory. The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate for mayor of [[Philadelphia]], editor [[Robert T. Conrad]], was soon revealed as a Know Nothing as he promised to crack down on crime, close saloons on Sundays and to appoint only native-born Americans to office\u2014he won by a landslide. In Washington, D.C., Know Nothing candidate [[John T. Towers]] defeated incumbent Mayor [[John Walker Maury]], causing opposition of such proportion that the Democrats, Whigs, and [[Free Soil Party|Freesoilers]] in the capital united as the \"Anti-Know-Nothing Party\". In New York, in a four-way race the Know Nothing candidate ran third with 26%. After the 1854 elections, they exerted decisive influence in Maine, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and California, but historians are unsure about the accuracy of this information due to the secrecy of the party as all parties were in turmoil and the [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] and [[Prohibition of alcohol|prohibition]] issues overlapped with nativism in complex and confusing ways. They helped elect [[Stephen Palfrey Webb]] as [[Mayor of San Francisco]] and [[J. Neely Johnson]] as [[Governor of California]]. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] was elected to Congress as a Know Nothing candidate, but after a few months he aligned with Republicans. A coalition of Know Nothings, Republicans and other members of Congress [[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|opposed]] to the Democratic Party elected Banks to the position of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].\n\nThe results of the 1854 elections were so favorable to the Know Nothings, up to then an informal movement with no centralized organization, that they formed officially as a political party called the American Party, which attracted many members of the now nearly defunct [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] party as well as a significant number of Democrats. Membership in the American Party increased dramatically, from 50,000 to an estimated one million plus in a matter of months during that year.<ref>Anbinder, ''Nativism and Slavery'', pp. 75\u2013102.</ref>\n\nThe historian Tyler Anbinder concluded: {{quote|The key to Know Nothing success in 1854 was the collapse of the [[second party system]], brought about primarily by the demise of the Whig Party. The Whig Party, weakened for years by internal dissent and chronic factionalism, was nearly destroyed by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. Growing anti-party sentiment, fueled by anti-slavery sentiment as well as [[Temperance movement|temperance]] and nativism, also contributed to the disintegration of the party system. The collapsing second party system gave the Know Nothings a much larger pool of potential converts than was available to previous nativist organizations, allowing the Order to succeed where older nativist groups had failed.<ref>Tyler Anbinder. ''Nativism and Slavery'', p. 95.</ref>}}\n\nIn [[San Francisco, California]], a Know Nothing chapter was founded in 1854 to oppose Chinese immigration\u2014members included a judge of the state supreme court, who ruled that no Chinese person could testify as a witness against a white man in court.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael C.

Their Ohio success seems to have come from winning over immigrants, especially [[German American]] Lutherans and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[Presbyterians]], both hostile to Catholicism. In Alabama, Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, discontented Democrats and other political outsiders who favored state aid to build more railroads. Virginia attracted national attention in its tempestuous 1855 gubernatorial election. Democrat [[Henry Alexander Wise]] won by convincing state voters that Know Nothings were in bed with Northern abolitionists. With the victory by Wise, the movement began to collapse in the South.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (1947) 2:396\u20138.</ref><ref>John David Bladek, {{\"'}}Virginia Is Middle Ground': The Know Nothing Party and the Virginia Gubernatorial Election of 1855\". ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' (1998): 35\u201370. {{jstor|4249690}}.</ref>\n\nKnow Nothings scored victories in Northern state elections in 1854, winning control of the legislature in Massachusetts and polling 40% of the vote in Pennsylvania. Although most of the new immigrants lived in the North, resentment and anger against them was national and the American Party initially polled well in the South, attracting the votes of many former southern Whigs.<ref name=\"Carey1995\" />\n\nThe party name gained wide but brief popularity. Nativism became a new American rage: Know Nothing candy, Know Nothing tea, and Know Nothing toothpicks appeared. Stagecoaches were dubbed \"The Know Nothing\". In [[East Central Washington, Maine|Trescott]], [[Maine]], a shipowner dubbed his new 700-ton freighter ''Know Nothing.''<ref>David Harry Bennett, ''The Party of Fear: From Nativist Movements to the New Right in American History'' (1988), p. 15.</ref> The party was occasionally referred to, contemporaneously, in a slightly pejorative shortening, \"Knism.\"<ref>William E. Gienapp. ''Salmon P. Chase, Nativism, and the Formation of the Republican Party in Ohio'', pp. 22, 24. ''Ohio History'', p. 93.</ref>\n\n=== Leadership and legislation ===\nHistorian John Mulkern has examined the party's success in sweeping to almost complete control of the Massachusetts legislature after its 1854 landslide victory. He finds the new party was populist and highly democratic, hostile to wealth, elites and to expertise and deeply suspicious of outsiders, especially Catholics. The new party's voters were concentrated in the rapidly growing industrial towns, where Yankee workers faced direct competition with new Irish immigrants. Whereas the Whig Party was strongest in high income districts, the Know Nothing electorate was strongest in the poor districts.

It funded free textbooks for the public schools and raised the appropriations for local libraries and for the school for the blind. Purification of Massachusetts against divisive social evils was a high priority. The legislature set up the state's first reform school for juvenile delinquents while trying to block the importation of supposedly subversive government documents and academic books from Europe. It upgraded the legal status of wives, giving them more property rights and more rights in divorce courts. It passed harsh penalties on speakeasies, gambling houses and bordellos. It passed prohibition legislation with penalties that were so stiff\u2014such as six months in prison for serving one glass of beer\u2014that juries refused to convict defendants. Many of the reforms were quite expensive; state spending rose 45% on top of a 50% hike in annual taxes on cities and towns. This extravagance angered the taxpayers, and few Know Nothings were reelected.<ref>Taylor, \"Progressive Nativism: The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts\" pp. 171\u20132.</ref>\n\nThe highest priority included attacks on the civil rights of Irish Catholic immigrants. After this, state courts lost the power to process applications for citizenship and public schools had to require compulsory daily reading of the Protestant Bible (which the nativists were sure would transform the Catholic children). The governor disbanded the Irish militias and replaced Irish holding state jobs with Protestants. It failed to reach the two-thirds vote needed to pass a state constitutional amendment to restrict voting and office holding to men who had resided in Massachusetts for at least 21 years. The legislature then called on Congress to raise the requirement for naturalization from five years to 21 years, but Congress never acted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mulkern|title=The Know-Nothing Party in Massachusetts: The Rise and Fall of a People's Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KyISxp0yfG0C&pg=PA101|year=1990|pages=101\u20132|isbn=9781555530716}}</ref> The most dramatic move by the Know Nothing legislature was to appoint an investigating committee designed to prove widespread sexual immorality underway in Catholic convents.

Gleeson notes that many Irish Catholics in the South feared the arrival of the Know-Nothing movement portended a serious threat. He argues:\n\n<blockquote>The southern Irish, who had seen the dangers of Protestant bigotry in Ireland, had the distinct feeling that the Know-Nothings were an American manifestation of that phenomenon. Every migrant, no matter how settled or prosperous, also worried that this virulent strain of nativism threatened his or her hard-earned gains in the South and integration into its society. Immigrants' fears were unjustified, however, because the national debate over slavery and its expansion, not nativism or anti-Catholicism, was the major reason for Know-Nothing success in the South. The southerners who supported the Know-Nothings did so, for the most part, because they thought the Democrats who favored the expansion of slavery might break up the Union.<ref>David T. Gleeson, ''The Irish in the South, 1815\u20131877'' (2001) p. 78.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1855, the American Party challenged the Democrats' dominance. In Alabama, the Know Nothings were a mix of former Whigs, malcontented Democrats and other political misfits; they favored state aid to build more railroads. In the fierce campaign, the Democrats argued that Know Nothings could not protect slavery from Northern abolitionists.

Historian Michael F. Holt argues that \"Know Nothingism originally grew in the South for the same reasons it spread in the North\u2014nativism, anti-Catholicism, and animosity toward unresponsive politicos\u2014not because of conservative Unionism\". Holt cites [[William B.

In the [[1856 U.S. presidential election|presidential election of 1856]], it was bitterly divided over slavery. The main faction supported the ticket of presidential nominee [[Millard Fillmore]] and vice presidential nominee [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]]. Fillmore, a former President, had been a Whig and Donelson was the nephew of Democratic President [[Andrew Jackson]], so the ticket was designed to appeal to loyalists from both major parties, winning 23% of the popular vote and carrying one state, [[Maryland]], with eight electoral votes. Fillmore did not win enough votes to block Democrat [[James Buchanan]] from the White House. During this time, Nathaniel Banks decided he was not as strongly for the anti-immigrant platform as the party wanted him to be, so he left the Know Nothing Party for the more anti-slavery Republican Party. He contributed to the decline of the Know Nothing Party by taking two-thirds of its members with him.\n\nMany were appalled by the Know Nothings. [[Abraham Lincoln]] expressed his own disgust with the political party in a private letter to [[Joshua Speed]] written August 24, 1855. Lincoln never publicly attacked the Know Nothings, whose votes he needed:\n\n<blockquote>I am not a Know-Nothing\u2014that is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring that \"all men are created equal.\" We now practically read it \"all men are created equal, except negroes.\" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \"all men are created equals, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.\" When it comes to that I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty\u2014to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Francis Fisher|authorlink1=Francis Fisher Browne|title=The Every-day Life of Abraham Lincoln: A Narrative and Descriptive Biography with Pen-pictures and Personal Recollections by Those Who Knew Him|date=1914|publisher=Browne & Howell|page=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeabr03browgoog/page/n210 153]|url=https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeabr03browgoog|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Allan Nevins]], writing about the turmoil preceding the American Civil War, states that Millard Fillmore was never a Know Nothing nor a nativist. Fillmore was out of the country when the presidential nomination came and had not been consulted about running.  Nevins further states:\n\n<blockquote>[Fillmore] was not a member of the party; he had never attended an American [Know-Nothing] gathering. By no spoken or written word had he indicated a subscription to American [Party] tenets.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing 1852\u20131857'' (1947), 2:467</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter the Supreme Court's controversial ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1857, most of the anti-slavery members of the American Party joined the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. The pro-slavery wing of the American Party remained strong on the local and state levels in a few southern states, but by the [[1860 U.S. presidential election|1860 election]], they were no longer a serious national political movement.

Vanier Secondary School]] in 1972, when she left Canada for [[New York City]]. There, she attended the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], and upon her graduation signed a five-year film deal with director [[Otto Preminger]]. She made her film debut in Preminger's action thriller ''[[Rosebud (1975 film)|Rosebud]]'' (1975). A year later, [[Universal Studios]] bought out that contract and Cattrall became one of the last participants in the contract player system of Universal (also referenced as MCA/Universal during this period) before the system ended in 1980. The Universal system's representative in New York, Eleanor Kilgallen (sister of [[Dorothy Kilgallen]]), cast Cattrall in numerous television guest-star roles. One of the first jobs Kilgallen got her was in a 1977 episode of ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' starring [[Jack Klugman]], whom Kilgallen also represented.\n\nIn 1978, Cattrall played the love interest of a murderous psychologist in an episode of ''[[Columbo]]'' and also in \"Blindfold\", an episode of the 1970s action series ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]'', in which Starsky (played by [[Paul Michael Glaser]]) is grief-stricken since he accidentally blinded Cattrall's character, young artist Emily Harrison, by a shot of his gun. She starred in ''[[The Bastard (1978 film)|The Bastard]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Rebels (film)|The Rebels]]'' (1979), two television miniseries based on the [[John Jakes]] novels of the same names. In 1979, she played the role of Dr. Gabrielle White on ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and would go down in television ''Hulk'' lore as one of the few characters who knew David Banner (alter ego of the title character) was alive and was the creature. Her work in television paid off and she quickly made the transition to cinema. She starred opposite [[Jack Lemmon]] in his [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated film ''[[Tribute (1980 film)|Tribute]]'' (1980), and in ''Crossbar'', the film about a high jumper who loses his leg and still participates in the Olympic trials, with Cattrall's help. The following year, she appeared in ''[[Ticket to Heaven]]''.\n\nIn 1982, Cattrall played [[Physical education|P.E.]] teacher Miss Honeywell in ''[[Porky's]]'', followed two years later by a role in the original ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]''. In 1985, she starred in three films: ''[[Turk 182]]'', ''[[City Limits (1985 film)|City Limits]]'' and ''[[Hold-Up (1985 film)|Hold-Up]]'', the last with French star [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]]. In 1986, she played [[Kurt Russell]]'s brainy flame in the action film ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]''. In 1987, her lead role in the cult comedy film ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' proved a huge success with audiences. One of her best-known film roles is that of Lieutenant Valeris in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''; Cattrall assisted in developing the character by designing her own hairstyle and even helped come up with the name. Near the end of filming, Cattrall had a photographer shoot a roll of film on the ''Enterprise'' bridge set, in which she wore nothing but her [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] ears. After finding out about the unauthorized photo session, [[Leonard Nimoy]] had the film destroyed.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]] |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |date=Summer 1992 |title=Hollywood's Most Voluptuous Vulcan |first=Mark A. |last=Altman |authorlink=Mark A. Altman |page=41}}</ref>\n\nAside from her film work, Cattrall is also a stage actress, with performances in [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' and [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[Wild Honey (play)|Wild Honey]]'' to her credit. In addition, she can be heard reading the poetry of [[Rupert Brooke]] on the CD ''Red Rose Music SACD Sampler Volume One''. In 1997, she was cast in ''[[Sex and the City]]'', [[Darren Star]]'s series which was broadcast on HBO. As [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]], Cattrall gained international recognition. She capitalized on her success by appearing in steamy television commercials promoting [[Pepsi One]].

Vanier Secondary School]] in 1972, when she left Canada for [[New York City]]. There, she attended the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], and upon her graduation signed a five-year film deal with director [[Otto Preminger]]. She made her film debut in Preminger's action thriller ''[[Rosebud (1975 film)|Rosebud]]'' (1975). A year later, [[Universal Studios]] bought out that contract and Cattrall became one of the last participants in the contract player system of Universal (also referenced as MCA/Universal during this period) before the system ended in 1980. The Universal system's representative in New York, Eleanor Kilgallen (sister of [[Dorothy Kilgallen]]), cast Cattrall in numerous television guest-star roles. One of the first jobs Kilgallen got her was in a 1977 episode of ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' starring [[Jack Klugman]], whom Kilgallen also represented.\n\nIn 1978, Cattrall played the love interest of a murderous psychologist in an episode of ''[[Columbo]]'' and also in \"Blindfold\", an episode of the 1970s action series ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]'', in which Starsky (played by [[Paul Michael Glaser]]) is grief-stricken since he accidentally blinded Cattrall's character, young artist Emily Harrison, by a shot of his gun. She starred in ''[[The Bastard (1978 film)|The Bastard]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Rebels (film)|The Rebels]]'' (1979), two television miniseries based on the [[John Jakes]] novels of the same names. In 1979, she played the role of Dr. Gabrielle White on ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and would go down in television ''Hulk'' lore as one of the few characters who knew David Banner (alter ego of the title character) was alive and was the creature. Her work in television paid off and she quickly made the transition to cinema. She starred opposite [[Jack Lemmon]] in his [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated film ''[[Tribute (1980 film)|Tribute]]'' (1980), and in ''Crossbar'', the film about a high jumper who loses his leg and still participates in the Olympic trials, with Cattrall's help. The following year, she appeared in ''[[Ticket to Heaven]]''.\n\nIn 1982, Cattrall played [[Physical education|P.E.]] teacher Miss Honeywell in ''[[Porky's]]'', followed two years later by a role in the original ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]''. In 1985, she starred in three films: ''[[Turk 182]]'', ''[[City Limits (1985 film)|City Limits]]'' and ''[[Hold-Up (1985 film)|Hold-Up]]'', the last with French star [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]]. In 1986, she played [[Kurt Russell]]'s brainy flame in the action film ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]''. In 1987, her lead role in the cult comedy film ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' proved a huge success with audiences. One of her best-known film roles is that of Lieutenant Valeris in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''; Cattrall assisted in developing the character by designing her own hairstyle and even helped come up with the name. Near the end of filming, Cattrall had a photographer shoot a roll of film on the ''Enterprise'' bridge set, in which she wore nothing but her [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] ears. After finding out about the unauthorized photo session, [[Leonard Nimoy]] had the film destroyed.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]] |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |date=Summer 1992 |title=Hollywood's Most Voluptuous Vulcan |first=Mark A. |last=Altman |authorlink=Mark A.

In addition, she can be heard reading the poetry of [[Rupert Brooke]] on the CD ''Red Rose Music SACD Sampler Volume One''. In 1997, she was cast in ''[[Sex and the City]]'', [[Darren Star]]'s series which was broadcast on HBO. As [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]], Cattrall gained international recognition.

''Sex and the City'' ran for six seasons and ended as a weekly series in spring 2004 with 10.6 million viewers. Cattrall reprised the role of Samantha Jones in the ''[[Sex and the City (film)|Sex and the City]]'' film, released on 30 May 2008.

It is roughly {{convert|20|km|2|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Bratislava]] and, as of December 2018, had a population of 23,002.\n\nPezinok lies near the [[Little Carpathians]] and thrives mainly on viticulture and agriculture, as well as on brick making and ceramic(s) production.\n\n==History==\n\nFrom the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Pezinok, or at least its surroundings, was for the first time mentioned in 1208 under name \"''terra Bozin''\". During the next few centuries, the town changed from a mining settlement to a vineyard town. It gained status of a free royal town on 14 June 1647. Pezinok had its most glorious era of wealth and prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was also one of the richest towns in the Kingdom of Hungary. Its wealth was based on production of quality wines. In the 19th century, the town slowly began to industrialize: the first [[sulphuric acid]] factory in Hungary or the known brick works were established here. It boomed further after it was connected to railway. After the break-up of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918/1920, the town became part of newly created [[Czechoslovakia]]. In the first half of the 20th century, it was declining, the vineyard production was declining, forcing many inhabitants to emigrate. It is growing again after the end of [[World War II]]. The town was [[Ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]] as its German-speaking minority was [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expelled]].\n\n==Geography and tourism==\nPezinok lies at an altitude of {{convert|152|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] and covers an area of {{convert|72.555|km2|sqmi|1}}.<ref name=\"statistics\"/> It is located in the [[Danubian Lowland]] at the foothills of the [[Little Carpathians]], around {{convert|20|km|2|abbr=on}} north-east of Bratislava. Another major city, [[Trnava]], is located around {{convert|25|km|2|abbr=on}} to the east.\n\nA ski resort is situated on the ''Baba'' mountain. The neighboring Little Carpathians offer numerous [[hiking]] paths. All of the city forests are part of the [[Little Carpathians Protected Landscape Area]].\n\nThe Little Carpathians Museum (Malokarpatsk\u00e9 m\u00fazeum), which is in a typical wine merchant's house in the centre of the town, was undergoing a major renovation in 2008 and promises to be one of the best small museums in Slovakia.\n\nIt has the biggest collection of wine presses in central Europe, some of them gigantic wooden affairs dating from the early seventeenth century; the atmospheric old cellars of the building are partly given over to an exhibition of them.\n\nBut Martin Hrubala, the deputy director of the museum, is keen to make the museum not just about the old but also the new: the entrance fee includes a [[wine tasting]], accompanied by a sommelier. And the museum promises interactivity at a level unusual for Slovak museums. Visitors, for instance, as well as tasting wine will also get the opportunity to make their own.\n\nPezinok seems to have been investing heavily in public facilities lately: the city museum, in a building opposite the Little Carpathians Museum, opened in 2003. It features a range of attractively presented local archaeological finds and a selection of stonework salvaged from nearby churches; labelling, however, is in Slovak only.\n\nAnd at the northern end of the city centre, next to a park which once formed its landscaped grounds, is Pezinok Castle. Originally a moated fortress which was later turned into a chateau for the aristocratic P\u00e1lffy family, the cellars of the castle are now home to the National Wine Salon.\n\n[[Little Carpathians Museum]] (''Malokarpatsk\u00e9 m\u00fazeum'') is situated in Pezinok.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bazini-kastelycivertanlegi1.jpg\nFile:Bazini-kastelycivertanlegi2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Town suburbs ==\n* [[Grinava|Historical suburb Grinava]]\n* Town center\n* [[Cajla|Historical suburb Cajla]]\n* Estate housing:\n** Sever ({{lang-en|North}})\n** Juh ({{lang-en|South}})\n** Mu\u0161k\u00e1t\n** Star\u00fd dvor\n** Sahara\n* Panholec\n* Ku\u010di\u0161dorf Valley\n\n==Traditional Events==\nFebruary\n\n'''Ethnofestival'''\n\nMarch\n \n'''Selection of the Queen of wine'''\n\n'''PAFF''' \u2013 alternative (amateur) film festival in House of Culture\n\nApril\n\n'''Wine markets''' - international competition, exhibition and wine tasting\n\nMay\n\n'''Ad Una Corda''' - International church choir festival {every even year}\n\n'''Sponsorship march in support if UNICEF'''\n\nJune\n\n'''Cibul\u00e1k''' - theater festival\n\n'''Competition of ancient cars'''\n\nJuly \t\n\n'''Slovakia Matador''' - competition of cars driving in The mountain {to the hill of Baba}\n\nJuly - August \t\n\n'''Promenade concerts take place as a part of Cultural sumer''' {every Sunday late afternoon}\n\n'''Flamenco Verano''' summer flamenco school in Pezinok\n\nAugust \t\n\n'''Pezinsk\u00fd Permon\u00edk''' - Small Carpathian exhibition and bourse of minerals, fossils and precious stones connected with gold washing on the streets\n\n'''Dychovky v pre\u0161i''' - International festival of brass music\n\nSeptember \t\n\n'''Vinobranie''' - celebrations of wine including rich cultural program and tasting of regional specialties{food and wine} in the streets of the city center\n\nOctober\n\n'''Pezinsk\u00fd strapec''' - International competition in ballroom dancing\n\nNovember\n\n'''St. Martin's blessings of wine''' includes tasting of young wine\n\n'''Day of Open Cellars''' regional promotional wine tasting in private cellars\n\nDecember \t\n\n'''Christmas Inspirations''' - sell of Christmas goods Including cultural program on Radni\u010dn\u00e9 square and at Old Town hall\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 2001 [[census]], the town had 21,083 inhabitants. 96.51% of inhabitants were [[Slovaks]], 1.21% [[Czech people|Czechs]] and 0.52% [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]].<ref name=\"statistics\">{{cite web | title = Municipal Statistics | publisher = Statistical Office of the Slovak republic | url = http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html | accessdate = 2007-12-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217080336/http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-17}}</ref> The religious makeup was 64.83% [[Roman Catholics]], 21.02% people with no religious affiliation, and 8.22% [[Lutherans]].<ref name=\"statistics\"/>\n\n==People==\n*[[J\u00e1n Bah\u00fd\u013e]] \n*[[Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1]]\n*[[Moritz Fuerst]]\n*[[J\u00e1n Kupeck\u00fd]]\n*[[\u013dudov\u00edt Rajter]]\n*[[Richard R\u00e9ti]]\n*[[Eugen Sucho\u0148]]\n\n==Twin towns \u2014 sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Slovakia}}\n\nPezinok is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Partnersk\u00e9 mest\u00e1|url=https://www.pezinok.sk/?yggid=12|publisher=Pezinok|language=sk|accessdate=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|AUT}} [[Neusiedl am See]], Austria\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Mosonmagyar\u00f3v\u00e1r]], Hungary\n*{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav]], Czech Republic\n*{{flagicon|SLO}} [[Izola]], Slovenia\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat-inline|Pezinok}}\n{{wikivoyage|Pezinok}}\n*[http://www.pezinok.sk/index.php?
