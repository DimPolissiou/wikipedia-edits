The issues on how to achieve universal suffrage in the 2017 Chief Executive election became the focal point of the public debates.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yuen|first1=Samson|title=Hong Kong After the Umbrella Movement|url=https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/6656|website=China Perspectives|publisher=China Perspectives|accessdate=4 December 2017|pages=49\u201353|language=en|date=1 March 2015}}</ref> Most of the major political factions campaigned for their ideas on universal suffrage, including [[Occupy Central with Love and Peace]], an advocacy group for the [[Occupation (protest)|occupation movement]], to pressure the Beijing government to implement full universal suffrage initiated by the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy camp]], as well as the [[Alliance for Peace and Democracy (Hong Kong)|Alliance for Peace and Democracy]], an anti-occupy central alliance formed by the [[pro-Beijing camp]].\n\nAfter the first consultation period, lasting from December 2013 to May 2014, a consultation report was submitted to the [[National People's Congress]] in July 2014. On 31 August 2014, the NPCSC decided that a 1200-member Nominating Committee based on the present [[Election Committee]] should only select two or three candidates before presenting them for a territory-wide ballot by ordinary voters, and each candidate must have more than half of support members of the Election Committee. It also decided that the 2016 legislative election would undergo no further adaptations since those proposed by the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|2010 electoral reform]].\n\nOn 18 June 2015, the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] rejected the electoral reform proposal by 28 votes to 8, despite many pro-Beijing legislators having left the chamber in an attempt to forestall the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/18/asia/hong-kong-reform-vote/index.html|title=Hong Kong legislators reject China-backed reform bill|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=19 June 2015|accessdate=19 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Democratic development in Hong Kong}}\n\n===Articles of the Basic Law===\nThe electoral method of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] (CE) and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) has been a long debated issue in Hong Kong since the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] which decided the transfer of the Hong Kong sovereignty to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1997. In the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Annex I states that the Chief Executive in the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall be selected by election or through consultations and the Legislature of the HKSAR shall be constituted by elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd3.htm#con|title=The Joint Declaration \u2013 ANNEX I|work=Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau}}</ref> The Joint Declaration stipulates that the government will be composed of local inhabitants and the elections or consultations will be held locally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm|title=The Joint Declaration|publisher=Government of Hong Kong}}</ref>\n\nThe controversy on how the electoral system of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council sparked during the drafting of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee]] (BLDC) during the late 1980s. In the Basic Law promulgated in 1990, it states the ultimate aim of selecting the Chief Executive and all members of the Legislative Council by way of [[universal suffrage]] is guaranteed respectively in [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|Article 45]] and Article 68.\n\nAfter the transfer of sovereignty, the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy camp]], the opposition camp in the SAR in which its ultimate goal was to fight for the universal suffrage constantly received about 60% of the popular votes in the LegCo [[geographical constituency]] (GC) elections. The annual [[July 1 marches]] launched by the pan-democracy camp which demanded genuine democracy as promised in the Basic Law also draw thousands of Hong Kong people each year.\n\n===2007 NPCSC decision===\n[[Donald Tsang]], the then Chief Executive, published the [[Green Paper on Constitutional Development]] to consult the public on the options, roadmap, and timetable for implementing universal suffrage in July 2007. A report was submitted to the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) subsequently in December 2007. Following that, the NPCSC made the decision that provides:<ref>{{cite book|title=Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016 Consultation Document|author =The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government|year=2013|p=3|ref=harv|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr13-14/english/panels/ca/papers/ca1209-cdoc20131204-e.pdf}}</ref>\n{{blockquote|The election of the fifth Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2017 may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage, that after the Chief Executive is selected by universal suffrage, the election of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may be implemented by the method of electing all members by universal suffrage.}}\nThe NPCSC Decision rules out the universal suffrage in the [[2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2012 CE Election]] and [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|2012 LegCo Election]] but on the other hand provides the possibility of universal suffrage for CE in 2017 and LegCo in 2020.\n\nAlthough the pan-democracy camp protested against the decision of ruling out the 2007/2008 and 2012 universal suffrage, the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]], the flagship pro-democratic party in Hong Kong reached the agreement on the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform]] which allowed minor changes to the 2012 CE election and 2012 LegCo Election.\n\n==First consultation period==\nChief Executive [[Leung Chun-ying]] announced on 17 October 2013 the immediate establishment of the Task Force on Constitutional Development headed by the [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] [[Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor|Carrie Lam]], Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen, and Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs [[Raymond Tam]] as members to handle the public consultation. On 4 December 2013, the ''Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016'', entitled \"Let's Talk and Achieve Universal Suffrage\", was published which commenced a five-month public consultation period.<ref>{{cite news|title=LC: Statement by CS on \"Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016\"|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201312/04/P201312040525.htm|work=Information Services Department}}</ref>\n\nThe Consultation Document set out the questions such as the size and composition of the Nominating Committee for the CE election and the size of Legislative Council, the electorate base of the [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]] and also number of geographical constituencies and number of seats in each geographical constituency.\n\nThe consultation period ended in May with increasingly heated debates and the Consultation Report was published in July 2014. Following that Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying submitted the ''Report by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress''. The public generally speculated that the NPCSC will set the framework of the electoral reform in the meeting in coming August.\n\n===Alternative proposals===\nDuring the consultation period, there were proposals suggested by various political groups and individuals which included:\n\n====Ronny Tong's proposal====\n[[Civic Party]] legislator [[Ronny Tong]] put forward an initial proposal for the Chief Executive universal suffrage in October 2013 and supported by [[Professional Commons]] legislators [[Dennis Kwok]], [[Charles Mok]] and [[Kenneth Leung]].

The additional one-seat added to each geographical constituency (GC) for the [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|2012 LegCo election]] should be transferred to the TWGC, so that this constituency would comprise 10 seats.<ref name=\"HKDF\"/> A further 10 new LegCo seats would be added to the TWGC. Candidates for the TWGC would be required to secure a minimum of 500 nominations, 100 nominations from registered voters in each of the 5 GCs. In conclusion, the 2016 Legislative Council would consist of total 80 seats: 30 seats from 5 [[Geographical constituency|geographical constituencies]]; 30 seats from functional constituencies and; 20 seats from the Territory-wide geographical constituency.<ref name=\"HKDF\"/>\n\nThere are three alternatives for the formation of the nominating committee for electing the Chief Executive:<ref name=\"HKDF\"/>\n* By direct election of registered voters electing 3 members in each of the 400 [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Council]] sub-constituencies by the [[single transferable voting]] system.\n* Nomination committee based on 2012 CE election committee with all corporate votes replaced by individual votes from staff and management of companies in each sector and all elected district councillors to join the nominating committee.\n* Nominating committee formed through random selection of a statistically representative sample from all registered voters.\n\nHKDF suggested Any Chinese national who is a registered GC voter can become a potential candidate with nominations from at least 1/8 of the members of the Nominating Committee (NC) or with at least 100,000 nominations from registered GC voters.<ref name=\"HKDF\"/> All candidates once elected to be nominated by the NC have to affirm to abide by the Oath of the CE Office. After the closing date for submission of requests for nominations by candidates, the NC (e.g. jointly signed by 100 NC members) has right to evaluate the nominations for compliance with the rules after his or her declaration of candidacy and make complaint to the Electoral Affairs Commission to start a judicial process of removing the candidate. The final list of qualified nominated candidates will stand for election by universal suffrage, using the [[two-round system]]. A second round of CE elections will be held if no candidate received more than 50% of the votes and the two candidates with the highest vote count will proceed to the second round.<ref name=\"HKDF\"/>\n\n====Scholarism====\n[[Student activist]] group [[Scholarism]] issued a statement on 23 June 2013 stressed the necessity of civil nomination for the 2017 Chief Executive election.

Civil nomination demands a candidate to secure the signed endorsement of 1% of the registered voters; political party nomination requires a political party receiving 5% or more of the total valid votes in the last Legislative Council direct election. The nominating committee shall not refuse to endorse any civil and political party nominees who meet the legal requirements, such as not less than 40 years old, has no right of abode in any foreign country; political conditions such as \"love China, love Hong Kong\" and \"no confrontations with Beijing\" are not acceptable. The Alliance also demands the abolition of the existing stipulation which disallows the Chief Executive belonging to a political party membership.<ref name=\"ATD CE\"/>\n\nFor the Legislative Council elections, the Scholars Group of the ATD put forward proposals for the transition toward the universal suffrage:<ref name=\"ATD LegCo\">{{cite web|title=Scholars Group Proposals for Universal Suffrage for Legislative Council Elections|date=4 October 2013|url=http://www.atd.hk/en/?p=155|work=Alliance for True Democracy}}</ref> For 2016 Legislative Council Election, the Scholars Group suggests:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=50%| Proposal A !!width=50%|  Proposal B\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| \n* Number of seats in Legislative Council increases to 80.\n* 60 seats elected by universal suffrage, including 35 seats by proportional representation with the current division of constituency.\n* 25 seats will be elected under proportional representation with the whole Hong Kong as a constituency. There is no election threshold, and the largest remainder method\" and Hare quota are adopted. Each voter would then have two votes in two tiers of proportional representation.\n* [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|Functional constituency]] is reduced to 20 seats. In the 30 current traditional FC seats, there are 9 seats for professional sectors; 15 seats for commercial and economic sectors; and 6 seats for social and political sectors. We suggest combining those seats into three large constituencies along the lines above, with each constituency returning two-thirds of its original number of seats. That is, the professional sectors will return 6 seats; 10 seats for commercial and economic sectors; 4 seats for social and political sectors. In each constituency, each elector can cast only one vote. The candidates that get the most votes win.\n* The [[District Council (Second)|District Council (II) FC seats]] will be cancelled.\n* Split Voting in the Legco will be abolished.\n|\n* Number of seats in Legislative Council is 80.\n* 60 seats will be elected by universal suffrage, including 35 seats by proportional representation with current division of constituencies.\n* 25 seats will be elected by FPTP.

There is no election threshold in the proposal, any list that obtains more than 2% of votes (assuming voter turnout rate is about 50%, that is about 40,000 votes) can secure one seat.\n* Compare to proposal B, this proposal has fewer seats elected under FPTP, and has no election threshold, it would be relatively beneficial to small parties.\n|\n* Number of seats in Legislative Council is 90.\n* 50 seats will be elected under FPTP.

Hong Kong will be divided into 6 to 7 constituencies, each constituency will return 6 to 7 seats, and [[D'Hondt method]] will be adopted.\n* Compare to proposal A, this proposal has more seats elected under FPTP. The estimation is that parties with vote share lower than 5% may not get elected. The adoption of the D'Hondt method will reduce the fragmentation of the Legco.\n|}\n\n====18 Scholar Proposal====\nA group of 18 moderate academics, including Dr Brian Fong Chi-hang, vice-chairman of the thinktank SyngergyNet, former Legislative Council president [[Andrew Wong Wang-fat]], Community Care Fund head Dr [[Law Chi-kwong]] and University of Hong Kong law lecturer Eric Cheung Tat-ming, put forward a mid-way proposal in April 2014 to give the public a strong role in selecting Chief Executive candidates without breaching the Basic Law. Under the plan, a candidate who received signatures of support from 2% of registered voters and become a possible candidate to the 1,200-strong nominating committee.

responses==\n\n===United States===\nIn April 2014, [[Anson Chan]], former [[Chief Secretary of Hong Kong]] and founder of pro-democracy group [[Hong Kong 2020]], and [[Martin Lee]], founder of Hong Kong's opposition [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]], went to the United States and met [[Joe Biden]], US Vice-President at the [[White House]]. The activists spoke out against Beijing increasing control over Hong Kong and their fear of only candidates picked by Beijing would be allowed to take part in the 2017 Chief Executive election. Lee and Chan also voiced concerns over press freedom in Hong Kong, referring to violent assaults on journalists and alleging that Beijing is pressuring advertisers to shun critical media. Biden underscored Washington's \"long-standing support for democracy in Hong Kong and for the city's high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' framework,\" the White House said. China warned the United States against meddling in Hong Kong's internal affairs after Biden met with Chan and Lee. In response, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] said that it \"firmly opposes any countries meddling in the city's internal affairs in any way,\" ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' quoted.<ref name=\"Biden\">{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/china-us-biden-interfere-897/|title=China tells US not to meddle in Hong Kong's internal affairs|publisher=RT|date=7 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring their trip to America, Lee and Chan also met with [[Nancy Pelosi]], minority leader of the [[US House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and members of the [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]]. \"The future of freedom and democracy in Hong Kong is under serious threat,\" Senator [[Sherrod Brown]], head of the commission, said in a prepared statement, as quoted by Reuters. \"China is already placing 'pre-conditions' on who can run, raising serious doubts about whether the elections will be free and fair,\" he added.<ref name=\"Biden\"/>\n\nIn early May 2015, A US bipartisan delegation led by [[Matt Salmon]], a [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] who chairs the [[United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, The Pacific and International Cybersecurity Policy|Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs]] with Republican [[Tom Emmer]] and [[Democratic Party (US)|Democrat]] [[Alan Lowenthal]] on a fact-finding mission visited Hong Kong to learn about developments in Hong Kong. They held meetings with Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and also legislators across the spectrum on the government's reform package, which pan-democrats have pledged to reject. Matt Salmon told leaders of the four pan-democratic parties, [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] chairwoman [[Emily Lau Wai-hing]], [[Civic Party]] leader [[Alan Leong Kah-kit]], [[Labour Party (Hong Kong)|Labour Party]] chairman [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] and [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]] lawmaker [[Frederick Fung Kin-kee]], that a system where \"people are elected by the people\" was better than one in which leaders were chosen via a narrow constituency, saying that 'sometimes half a loaf is better than no loaf'. Lee said the congressmen had described the proposed chief executive election plan as \"definitely not equal suffrage\" and said they were not trying to convince the pan-democrats but to learn more about the reform debate. Fung said the congressmen had described the reform plan as not fully democratic but had stressed it was a decision for Hongkongers to make. [[Tam Yiu-chung]], ex-chairman of the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]] who also met the trio, read the congressmen's interest in compromise as a signal that they wanted to see the reform package passed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1789329/us-congressmen-probe-hong-kong-politicians-compromise-2017?page=all|title=Visiting US congressmen nudge Hong Kong lawmakers towards compromise on electoral reform|work=South China Morning Post|date=8 May 2015|first1=Jeffie|last1=Lam|first2=Gary|last2=Cheung}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn July 2014, Anson Chan and Martin Lee visited the United Kingdom and met with [[Deputy Prime Minister]] and the leader of the coalition's junior partner the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Nick Clegg]] and raised concerns over China's jurisdiction of the region, and questioning Britain's commitment to Hong Kong's democratic development. Clegg affirmed Britain's commitment to honour the pledge that if China breached the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], Britain would \"mobilize the international community and pursue every legal and other avenue available\".<ref name=\"responsibilities\">{{cite news|url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/britain-urged-to-live-up-to-responsibilities-in-hong-kong/|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Britain Urged to Live Up to Responsibilities in Hong Kong|first=Alan|last=Wong|date=17 July 2014}}</ref> Clegg also criticised British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] for prioritising trade with the world's second largest economy over democracy in Hong Kong. A source close to Clegg said Cameron's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had become \"so deferential in their attitude to China\" they would not stand up for democracy in Hong Kong. China issued a formal complaint to Britain after the meeting. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman [[Hong Lei (diplomat)|Hong Lei]] said China was firmly opposed to any foreign interference in its internal affairs on any pretext.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/07/16/uk-china-hongkong-britain-idUKKBN0FL1D620140716|title=China protests to Britain after deputy PM meets Hong Kong activists|agency=Reuters|date=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnson Chan and Martin Lee also attended a [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] hearing, speaking out that they were \"concerned that neither of the two signatories to the Joint Declaration \u2013 that is, China and Britain \u2013 is adequately fulfilling their respective responsibilities on the terms of this internationally binding treaty.\" [[Richard Ottaway]], a member of Parliament and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the committee would announce a report as early as next week on the British government's policy toward Hong Kong, but \"it's not a report into the internal operations of Hong Kong.\" Within two months of its publication, the British government will have to respond to the conclusions and recommendations set out in the report.<ref name=\"responsibilities\"/>\n\n[[Liu Xiaoming]], PRC's ambassador to Britain, described Martin Lee and Anson Chan as \"bent on undermining the stability of Hong Kong\". He sent a letter to the members of parliament on 14 July, warned members against visiting Hong Kong. \"I do not think your planned visit to Hong Kong is helpful and strongly advise you not make it,\" Liu wrote. A second letter, from the National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, sent to the British committee in July, saying that the inquiry into post-handover Hong Kong by the committee would be seen as interference in China's internal affairs and called for it to be cancelled.<ref name=\"probe\">{{cite news|title=Britain will 'keep an open mind' in probe of Hong Kong political reform|date=5 September 2014|first=Alice|last=Woodhouse|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1585839/british-lawmakers-release-angry-letters-china-demanding-end-hong-kong}}</ref> Undeterred by warnings from Beijing, Richard Ottaway told the ''[[Sunday Morning Post]]'': \"We are planning to come in December and I have no reason to think that we won't be there.\" \"The Hong Kong government, the Chinese government and the National People's Congress shouldn't necessarily think that we are automatically hostile,\" Ottaway said.<ref name=\"probe\"/>\n\n[[Chris Patten]], the last [[Governor of Hong Kong]] under the British rule, wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in September, questioning Britain's \"sense of honour\" in failing to condemn China's planned reforms in Hong Kong, which he said would introduce the kind of stage-managed democracy seen in Iran.<ref>{{cite news|date=2 September 2014|title=Patten criticises UK over failure to act on Hong Kong reforms|first1=George|last1=Parker|first2=Demetri|last2=Sevastopulo|newspaper=Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/28b917a8-329b-11e4-a5a2-00144feabdc0.html}}</ref> He said that the UK had a \u201cmoral and political obligation\u201d to defend full democracy in the city.<ref name=\"insult\"/> In response to the remarks by Chris Patten, a spokesman for the [[Leung Chun-ying]]'s Chief Executive's Office on Thursday responded by saying that all Governors of Hong Kong were not elected by Hong Kong people under the British rule; the Sino-British Joint Declaration does not provide for universal suffrage; Hong Kong's constitutional development under the Basic Law is an internal affair of China.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadailyasia.com/hknews/2014-09/04/content_15163157.html|title=HK CE Office responds to Chris Patten's remarks|work=China Daily|date=4 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the British government's first official response to China's 31 August decision, they said they \"welcome the confirmation that China's objective is for the election of Hong Kong's chief executive through universal suffrage.\" Anson Chan and Martin Lee heavily criticised the UK government's acceptance of China's plan for limiting free elections in its former colony of Hong Kong.<ref name=\"insult\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-05/u-k-acceptance-of-hong-kong-election-limits-insult-chan-says.html|title=U.K. Accepting Hong Kong Election Limits 'Insult,' Chan Says|first1=Ting|last1=Shi|first2=Jasmin|last2= Wang|date=5 September 2014|work=Bloomberg}}</ref>\n\nAfter the electoral reform proposal was voted down, British minister [[Hugo Swire]] expressed his country's disappointment at the outcome, and said that \"a transition to universal suffrage is the best way to guarantee Hong Kong\u2019s stability\".<ref>{{cite web|title=UK Response|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-response-to-hong-kong-vote-on-electoral-reform|website=GOV.UK}}</ref>\n\n==Opinion polling==\n\nOn the question (or variants thereof):  \"The National People's Congress Standing Committee has set a framework to limit the number of candidates to two or three and require them to have the support of at least half of the 1,200 nominating committee members.

The issues on how to achieve universal suffrage in the 2017 Chief Executive election became the focal point of the public debates.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yuen|first1=Samson|title=Hong Kong After the Umbrella Movement|url=https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/6656|website=China Perspectives|publisher=China Perspectives|accessdate=4 December 2017|pages=49\u201353|language=en|date=1 March 2015}}</ref> Most of the major political factions campaigned for their ideas on universal suffrage, including [[Occupy Central with Love and Peace]], an advocacy group for the [[Occupation (protest)|occupation movement]], to pressure the Beijing government to implement full universal suffrage initiated by the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy camp]], as well as the [[Alliance for Peace and Democracy (Hong Kong)|Alliance for Peace and Democracy]], an anti-occupy central alliance formed by the [[pro-Beijing camp]].\n\nAfter the first consultation period, lasting from December 2013 to May 2014, a consultation report was submitted to the [[National People's Congress]] in July 2014. On 31 August 2014, the NPCSC decided that a 1200-member Nominating Committee based on the present [[Election Committee]] should only select two or three candidates before presenting them for a territory-wide ballot by ordinary voters, and each candidate must have more than half of support members of the Election Committee. It also decided that the 2016 legislative election would undergo no further adaptations since those proposed by the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|2010 electoral reform]].\n\nOn 18 June 2015, the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] rejected the electoral reform proposal by 28 votes to 8, despite many pro-Beijing legislators having left the chamber in an attempt to forestall the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/18/asia/hong-kong-reform-vote/index.html|title=Hong Kong legislators reject China-backed reform bill|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=19 June 2015|accessdate=19 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Democratic development in Hong Kong}}\n\n===Articles of the Basic Law===\nThe electoral method of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] (CE) and [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) has been a long debated issue in Hong Kong since the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] which decided the transfer of the Hong Kong sovereignty to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1997. In the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Annex I states that the Chief Executive in the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall be selected by election or through consultations and the Legislature of the HKSAR shall be constituted by elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd3.htm#con|title=The Joint Declaration \u2013 ANNEX I|work=Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau}}</ref> The Joint Declaration stipulates that the government will be composed of local inhabitants and the elections or consultations will be held locally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/issues/jd2.htm|title=The Joint Declaration|publisher=Government of Hong Kong}}</ref>\n\nThe controversy on how the electoral system of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council sparked during the drafting of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee]] (BLDC) during the late 1980s. In the Basic Law promulgated in 1990, it states the ultimate aim of selecting the Chief Executive and all members of the Legislative Council by way of [[universal suffrage]] is guaranteed respectively in [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|Article 45]] and Article 68.\n\nAfter the transfer of sovereignty, the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy camp]], the opposition camp in the SAR in which its ultimate goal was to fight for the universal suffrage constantly received about 60% of the popular votes in the LegCo [[geographical constituency]] (GC) elections. The annual [[July 1 marches]] launched by the pan-democracy camp which demanded genuine democracy as promised in the Basic Law also draw thousands of Hong Kong people each year.\n\n===2007 NPCSC decision===\n[[Donald Tsang]], the then Chief Executive, published the [[Green Paper on Constitutional Development]] to consult the public on the options, roadmap, and timetable for implementing universal suffrage in July 2007. A report was submitted to the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) subsequently in December 2007. Following that, the NPCSC made the decision that provides:<ref>{{cite book|title=Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016 Consultation Document|author =The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government|year=2013|p=3|ref=harv|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr13-14/english/panels/ca/papers/ca1209-cdoc20131204-e.pdf}}</ref>\n{{blockquote|The election of the fifth Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2017 may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage, that after the Chief Executive is selected by universal suffrage, the election of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may be implemented by the method of electing all members by universal suffrage.}}\nThe NPCSC Decision rules out the universal suffrage in the [[2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|2012 CE Election]] and [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|2012 LegCo Election]] but on the other hand provides the possibility of universal suffrage for CE in 2017 and LegCo in 2020.\n\nAlthough the pan-democracy camp protested against the decision of ruling out the 2007/2008 and 2012 universal suffrage, the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]], the flagship pro-democratic party in Hong Kong reached the agreement on the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform]] which allowed minor changes to the 2012 CE election and 2012 LegCo Election.\n\n==First consultation period==\nChief Executive [[Leung Chun-ying]] announced on 17 October 2013 the immediate establishment of the Task Force on Constitutional Development headed by the [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] [[Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor|Carrie Lam]], Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen, and Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs [[Raymond Tam]] as members to handle the public consultation. On 4 December 2013, the ''Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016'', entitled \"Let's Talk and Achieve Universal Suffrage\", was published which commenced a five-month public consultation period.<ref>{{cite news|title=LC: Statement by CS on \"Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2016\"|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201312/04/P201312040525.htm|work=Information Services Department}}</ref>\n\nThe Consultation Document set out the questions such as the size and composition of the Nominating Committee for the CE election and the size of Legislative Council, the electorate base of the [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]] and also number of geographical constituencies and number of seats in each geographical constituency.\n\nThe consultation period ended in May with increasingly heated debates and the Consultation Report was published in July 2014. Following that Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying submitted the ''Report by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress''.

While calling for \"universal suffrage,\" the ''[[831 decision|Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]'' imposes the standard that \"the Chief Executive shall be a person who loves the country and loves Hong Kong\" and requires that \"the method for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage must provide corresponding institutional safeguards for this purpose.\" The decision states that for the 2017 Chief Executive election, a nominating committee, similar to the present Election Committee system, be formed to nominate two to three candidates, each of whom must receive the support of more than half of the members of the nominating committee. After popular election of one of the nominated candidates, the new Chief Executive \"will have to be appointed by the Central People's Government.\" The process of forming the 2016 Legislative Council would be unchanged, but following the new process for the election of the Chief Executive, a new system to elect the Legislative Council via universal suffrage would be developed with the approval of Beijing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-08/31/c_133609238.htm | title=Full text of NPC decision on universal suffrage for HKSAR chief selection | agency=Xinhua News Agency | date=31 August 2014 | accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhile Li Fei, a deputy secretary general of the Committee, said that the procedure would \"protect the broad stability of Hong Kong now and in the future,\" pro-democracy advocates viewed the decision as a betrayal of the principle of \"one person, one vote,\" as they feared that candidates deemed unsuitable by the Beijing authorities would stand no chance at being nominated.

Under the plan, if \"none of the above\" accounts for 50 per cent of the vote or more, there has to be a revote. It is intended to put pressure on the candidates, handpicked by a 1,200-strong nominating body, to lobby for support of the public as well as that of the committee members. Pan-democrats call it a \"passive\" scheme and dislike the high threshold for a revote, while the pro-Beijing side does not want to give the public veto power.

responses==\n\n===United States===\nIn April 2014, [[Anson Chan]], former [[Chief Secretary of Hong Kong]] and founder of pro-democracy group [[Hong Kong 2020]], and [[Martin Lee]], founder of Hong Kong's opposition [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]], went to the United States and met [[Joe Biden]], US Vice-President at the [[White House]]. The activists spoke out against Beijing increasing control over Hong Kong and their fear of only candidates picked by Beijing would be allowed to take part in the 2017 Chief Executive election. Lee and Chan also voiced concerns over press freedom in Hong Kong, referring to violent assaults on journalists and alleging that Beijing is pressuring advertisers to shun critical media. Biden underscored Washington's \"long-standing support for democracy in Hong Kong and for the city's high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' framework,\" the White House said. China warned the United States against meddling in Hong Kong's internal affairs after Biden met with Chan and Lee. In response, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] said that it \"firmly opposes any countries meddling in the city's internal affairs in any way,\" ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' quoted.<ref name=\"Biden\">{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/china-us-biden-interfere-897/|title=China tells US not to meddle in Hong Kong's internal affairs|publisher=RT|date=7 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring their trip to America, Lee and Chan also met with [[Nancy Pelosi]], minority leader of the [[US House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and members of the [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]]. \"The future of freedom and democracy in Hong Kong is under serious threat,\" Senator [[Sherrod Brown]], head of the commission, said in a prepared statement, as quoted by Reuters. \"China is already placing 'pre-conditions' on who can run, raising serious doubts about whether the elections will be free and fair,\" he added.<ref name=\"Biden\"/>\n\nIn early May 2015, A US bipartisan delegation led by [[Matt Salmon]], a [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] who chairs the [[United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, The Pacific and International Cybersecurity Policy|Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs]] with Republican [[Tom Emmer]] and [[Democratic Party (US)|Democrat]] [[Alan Lowenthal]] on a fact-finding mission visited Hong Kong to learn about developments in Hong Kong. They held meetings with Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and also legislators across the spectrum on the government's reform package, which pan-democrats have pledged to reject. Matt Salmon told leaders of the four pan-democratic parties, [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] chairwoman [[Emily Lau Wai-hing]], [[Civic Party]] leader [[Alan Leong Kah-kit]], [[Labour Party (Hong Kong)|Labour Party]] chairman [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] and [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]] lawmaker [[Frederick Fung Kin-kee]], that a system where \"people are elected by the people\" was better than one in which leaders were chosen via a narrow constituency, saying that 'sometimes half a loaf is better than no loaf'. Lee said the congressmen had described the proposed chief executive election plan as \"definitely not equal suffrage\" and said they were not trying to convince the pan-democrats but to learn more about the reform debate. Fung said the congressmen had described the reform plan as not fully democratic but had stressed it was a decision for Hongkongers to make. [[Tam Yiu-chung]], ex-chairman of the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong]] who also met the trio, read the congressmen's interest in compromise as a signal that they wanted to see the reform package passed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1789329/us-congressmen-probe-hong-kong-politicians-compromise-2017?page=all|title=Visiting US congressmen nudge Hong Kong lawmakers towards compromise on electoral reform|work=South China Morning Post|date=8 May 2015|first1=Jeffie|last1=Lam|first2=Gary|last2=Cheung}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn July 2014, Anson Chan and Martin Lee visited the United Kingdom and met with [[Deputy Prime Minister]] and the leader of the coalition's junior partner the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Nick Clegg]] and raised concerns over China's jurisdiction of the region, and questioning Britain's commitment to Hong Kong's democratic development. Clegg affirmed Britain's commitment to honour the pledge that if China breached the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], Britain would \"mobilize the international community and pursue every legal and other avenue available\".<ref name=\"responsibilities\">{{cite news|url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/britain-urged-to-live-up-to-responsibilities-in-hong-kong/|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Britain Urged to Live Up to Responsibilities in Hong Kong|first=Alan|last=Wong|date=17 July 2014}}</ref> Clegg also criticised British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] for prioritising trade with the world's second largest economy over democracy in Hong Kong. A source close to Clegg said Cameron's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had become \"so deferential in their attitude to China\" they would not stand up for democracy in Hong Kong. China issued a formal complaint to Britain after the meeting. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman [[Hong Lei (diplomat)|Hong Lei]] said China was firmly opposed to any foreign interference in its internal affairs on any pretext.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/07/16/uk-china-hongkong-britain-idUKKBN0FL1D620140716|title=China protests to Britain after deputy PM meets Hong Kong activists|agency=Reuters|date=16 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnson Chan and Martin Lee also attended a [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] hearing, speaking out that they were \"concerned that neither of the two signatories to the Joint Declaration \u2013 that is, China and Britain \u2013 is adequately fulfilling their respective responsibilities on the terms of this internationally binding treaty.\" [[Richard Ottaway]], a member of Parliament and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the committee would announce a report as early as next week on the British government's policy toward Hong Kong, but \"it's not a report into the internal operations of Hong Kong.\" Within two months of its publication, the British government will have to respond to the conclusions and recommendations set out in the report.<ref name=\"responsibilities\"/>\n\n[[Liu Xiaoming]], PRC's ambassador to Britain, described Martin Lee and Anson Chan as \"bent on undermining the stability of Hong Kong\". He sent a letter to the members of parliament on 14 July, warned members against visiting Hong Kong. \"I do not think your planned visit to Hong Kong is helpful and strongly advise you not make it,\" Liu wrote. A second letter, from the National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, sent to the British committee in July, saying that the inquiry into post-handover Hong Kong by the committee would be seen as interference in China's internal affairs and called for it to be cancelled.<ref name=\"probe\">{{cite news|title=Britain will 'keep an open mind' in probe of Hong Kong political reform|date=5 September 2014|first=Alice|last=Woodhouse|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1585839/british-lawmakers-release-angry-letters-china-demanding-end-hong-kong}}</ref> Undeterred by warnings from Beijing, Richard Ottaway told the ''[[Sunday Morning Post]]'': \"We are planning to come in December and I have no reason to think that we won't be there.\" \"The Hong Kong government, the Chinese government and the National People's Congress shouldn't necessarily think that we are automatically hostile,\" Ottaway said.<ref name=\"probe\"/>\n\n[[Chris Patten]], the last [[Governor of Hong Kong]] under the British rule, wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in September, questioning Britain's \"sense of honour\" in failing to condemn China's planned reforms in Hong Kong, which he said would introduce the kind of stage-managed democracy seen in Iran.<ref>{{cite news|date=2 September 2014|title=Patten criticises UK over failure to act on Hong Kong reforms|first1=George|last1=Parker|first2=Demetri|last2=Sevastopulo|newspaper=Financial Times|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/28b917a8-329b-11e4-a5a2-00144feabdc0.html}}</ref> He said that the UK had a \u201cmoral and political obligation\u201d to defend full democracy in the city.<ref name=\"insult\"/> In response to the remarks by Chris Patten, a spokesman for the [[Leung Chun-ying]]'s Chief Executive's Office on Thursday responded by saying that all Governors of Hong Kong were not elected by Hong Kong people under the British rule; the Sino-British Joint Declaration does not provide for universal suffrage; Hong Kong's constitutional development under the Basic Law is an internal affair of China.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadailyasia.com/hknews/2014-09/04/content_15163157.html|title=HK CE Office responds to Chris Patten's remarks|work=China Daily|date=4 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the British government's first official response to China's 31 August decision, they said they \"welcome the confirmation that China's objective is for the election of Hong Kong's chief executive through universal suffrage.\" Anson Chan and Martin Lee heavily criticised the UK government's acceptance of China's plan for limiting free elections in its former colony of Hong Kong.<ref name=\"insult\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-05/u-k-acceptance-of-hong-kong-election-limits-insult-chan-says.html|title=U.K. Accepting Hong Kong Election Limits 'Insult,' Chan Says|first1=Ting|last1=Shi|first2=Jasmin|last2= Wang|date=5 September 2014|work=Bloomberg}}</ref>\n\nAfter the electoral reform proposal was voted down, British minister [[Hugo Swire]] expressed his country's disappointment at the outcome, and said that \"a transition to universal suffrage is the best way to guarantee Hong Kong\u2019s stability\".<ref>{{cite web|title=UK Response|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-response-to-hong-kong-vote-on-electoral-reform|website=GOV.UK}}</ref>\n\n==Opinion polling==\n\nOn the question (or variants thereof):  \"The National People's Congress Standing Committee has set a framework to limit the number of candidates to two or three and require them to have the support of at least half of the 1,200 nominating committee members.

In the face of [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|broad opposition]], he restored the previous parliament in April 2006.

The royal government exercised minimum restraint{{clarify|date=January 2017}} but declared a curfew to control the deteriorating situation, which was enforced with live firearms and tear gas. After 23 protesters were killed, on 21 April 2006, Gyanendra announced that he would yield executive authority to a new prime minister chosen by the political parties to oversee the return of democracy. Several party leaders rejected the offer and again demanded that the King call a council to determine the monarchy's future role in politics. An agreement was reached between the parties under the supervision of the Indian ruling Congress that the monarchy would have a place in the new constitution. [[Girija Prasad Koirala]] was appointed prime minister in the interim. Girija Prasad, as the main leader, had talks with the King and the agreement for monarchy's position. As such, on 24 April 2006, King Gyanendra reinstated the previous parliament in a televised address to the nation.\n\n==End of direct rule==\nThe agreement between the parties and Gyanendra under Indian supervision was not honored by the parties.  It is widely believed that Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was deeply convinced that as long as King Gyanendra remained in the power structure, there was always danger to the democratic order in Nepal. On 10 June 2006, the Parliament scrapped the major powers of the King, including his right to veto laws. This ended the idea of a \"King in Parliament\", and he was reduced to a figurehead, though for a time he continued to offer felicitations and to receive diplomats. According to Article 167 of the constitution, all executive powers as well as those enjoyed by the King in the previous Constitution were now vested in the prime minister. All powers of the 239-year-old monarchy were stripped, making Gyanendra a civilian king.\n\nPrime Minister Koirala, who had previously supported the continuation of the monarchy, said in March 2007 that he thought Gyanendra should step down.<ref>{{cite news|last=Haviland |first=Charles |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6456145.stm |title=Nepal's king is made to cut staff |publisher=BBC News |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref> In June, Koirala repeated his call for King Gyanendra to abdicate in favour of his grandson [[Prince Hridayendra of Nepal|Prince Hridayendra]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1977459.ece King urged to let boy, 5, be Nepal\u2019s saviour] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829161416/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1977459.ece |date=29 August 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn 23 August 2007 Nepal's transitional government nationalised all the properties Gyanendra inherited from his brother, including the [[Narayanhity Palace Museum|Narayanhity Royal Palace]].

As a child, he was briefly king from 1950 to 1951, when his grandfather, [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan]], went into exile in [[India]] with the rest of his family. His second reign began after the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre]].\n\nGyanendra's second reign was marked by constitutional turmoil. His predecessor [[Birendra of Nepal|King Birendra]] had established a [[constitutional monarchy]] in which he delegated policy to a representative government. The growing insurgency of the [[Nepalese Civil War]] during King Gyanendra's reign interfered with elections of representatives. After several delays in elections, King Gyanendra suspended the constitution and assumed direct authority in February 2005, asserting that it would be a temporary measure to suppress the Maoist insurgency. In the face of [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|broad opposition]], he restored the previous parliament in April 2006. His reign ended about two years later, when the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly]] declared Nepal a republic and abolished the monarchy.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Early life and first reign ==\n[[File:Ford B2477 NLGRF photo contact sheet (1976-12-10)(Gerald Ford Library) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|President [[Gerald Ford]] with Gyanendra Shah in 1976]]\nGyanendra was born in the old [[Narayanhity Palace|Narayanhity Royal Palace]], [[Kathmandu]], as the second son of [[Mahendra of Nepal|Crown Prince Mahendra]] and his first wife, [[Indra, Crown Princess of Nepal|Crown Princess Indra]].

The royal government exercised minimum restraint{{clarify|date=January 2017}} but declared a curfew to control the deteriorating situation, which was enforced with live firearms and tear gas. After 23 protesters were killed, on 21 April 2006, Gyanendra announced that he would yield executive authority to a new prime minister chosen by the political parties to oversee the return of democracy. Several party leaders rejected the offer and again demanded that the King call a council to determine the monarchy's future role in politics. An agreement was reached between the parties under the supervision of the Indian ruling Congress that the monarchy would have a place in the new constitution. [[Girija Prasad Koirala]] was appointed prime minister in the interim. Girija Prasad, as the main leader, had talks with the King and the agreement for monarchy's position. As such, on 24 April 2006, King Gyanendra reinstated the previous parliament in a televised address to the nation.\n\n==End of direct rule==\nThe agreement between the parties and Gyanendra under Indian supervision was not honored by the parties.  It is widely believed that Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was deeply convinced that as long as King Gyanendra remained in the power structure, there was always danger to the democratic order in Nepal. On 10 June 2006, the Parliament scrapped the major powers of the King, including his right to veto laws. This ended the idea of a \"King in Parliament\", and he was reduced to a figurehead, though for a time he continued to offer felicitations and to receive diplomats. According to Article 167 of the constitution, all executive powers as well as those enjoyed by the King in the previous Constitution were now vested in the prime minister. All powers of the 239-year-old monarchy were stripped, making Gyanendra a civilian king.\n\nPrime Minister Koirala, who had previously supported the continuation of the monarchy, said in March 2007 that he thought Gyanendra should step down.<ref>{{cite news|last=Haviland |first=Charles |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6456145.stm |title=Nepal's king is made to cut staff |publisher=BBC News |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}</ref> In June, Koirala repeated his call for King Gyanendra to abdicate in favour of his grandson [[Prince Hridayendra of Nepal|Prince Hridayendra]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1977459.ece King urged to let boy, 5, be Nepal\u2019s saviour] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829161416/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1977459.ece |date=29 August 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn 23 August 2007 Nepal's transitional government nationalised all the properties Gyanendra inherited from his brother, including the [[Narayanhity Palace Museum|Narayanhity Royal Palace]].

He also dismissed the need for a referendum on bringing the institution of monarchy back into power. He asserted that since the politicians had not asked the people by a referendum to abolish the institution, a referendum to bring him back was not needed.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18743394 | work=BBC News | title=Former king Gyanendra of Nepal wants to be reinstated | date=6 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"asianews.it\">{{cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Economic-crisis-and-corruption-favour-the-return-of-former-Hindu-king-25268.html|title=Economic crisis and corruption favour the return of former Hindu king|first=|last=AsiaNews.it|website=www.asianews.it|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nGyanendra also stated in the interview with News24 that a written agreement existed between the politicians and himself that the constitutional monarchy would be returned when he gave up his powers to the politicians and restored the Parliament that he had sacked.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nOn July 8th 2019, the former king\u2019s birthday was observed by thousands of Nepalese who marked the occasion by marching to his private residence at Nirmal Niwas Palace. The rally was organized by The Main Civilian Birthday Celebration Committee, however, the former king refused to give audience to the crowd as he didn\u2019t celebrate his birthday in public due to the demise of his relatives.

{"title_page": "Photographic lens design", "text_new": "{{For|general lens design|Optical lens design}}\nThe design of [[photographic lens]]es for use in still or [[cine]] [[camera]]s is intended to produce a lens that yields the most acceptable rendition of the subject being [[photography|photographed]] within a range of constraints that include cost, weight and materials. For many other optical devices such as [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s and [[theodolite]]s where the visual image is observed but often not recorded the design can often be significantly simpler than is the case in a camera where every image is captured on [[film]] or [[image sensor]] and can be subject to detailed scrutiny at a later stage. Photographic lenses also include those used in [[enlarger]]s and projectors.\n\n==Design==\n\n===Design requirements===\n{{main article|Optical lens design}}\nFrom the perspective of the photographer, the ability of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to capture sufficient light so that the camera can operate over a wide range of lighting conditions is important. Designing a lens that reproduces colour accurately is also important as is the production of an evenly lit and sharp image over the whole of the film or sensor plane.\n\nFor the lens designer, achieving these objectives will also involve ensuring that internal [[Lens flare|flare]], optical  [[Optical aberration|aberrations]] and weight are all reduced to the minimum whilst [[zoom lens|zoom]], [[focus (optics)|focus]] and [[aperture]] functions all operate smoothly and predictably.\n\nHowever, because photographic films and electronic sensors have a finite and measurable resolution, photographic lenses are not always designed for maximum possible resolution since the recording medium would not be able to record the level of detail that the lens could resolve. For this, and many other reasons, camera lenses are unsuited  for use as [[Slide projector|projector]] or [[enlarger]] lenses.\n\nThe design of a [[Fixed focus|fixed focal length]] lens (also known as ''[[prime lens]]es'') presents fewer challenges than the design of a zoom lens. A high-quality prime lens whose [[focal length]] is about equal to the diameter of the film frame or sensor may be constructed from as few as four separate lens elements, often as pairs on either side of the aperture diaphragm. Good examples include the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] [[Tessar]] or the [[Esselte Leitz GmbH & Co KG|Leitz]] [[Tessar#Leitz Elmar|Elmar]].\n\n====Design constraints====\nTo be useful in photography any lens must be able to fit the camera for which it is intended and this will physically limit the size where the [[bayonet mount]]ing or [[Lens mount|screw mounting]] is to be located.\n\nPhotography is a highly competitive commercial business and both weight and cost constrain the production of lenses.\n\nRefractive materials such as glass have physical limitations which limit the performance of lenses. In particular the range of refractive indices available in commercial glasses span a very narrow range. Since it is the [[refractive index]] that determines how much the rays of light are bent at each interface and since it is the differences in refractive indices in paired plus and minus lenses that constrains the ability to minimise [[chromatic aberration]]s, having only a narrow spectrum of indices is a major design constraint.\n\n===Lens elements===\n[[File:Revuenon 28mm 1-3,5 dismantled.jpg|thumb|Elements of a cheap 28mm lens]]\n[[File:Objective Zeiss Cut.jpg|thumb|Photographic lens cut for demonstration]]\n{{main article|Lens (optics)}}\nExcept for the most simple and inexpensive lenses, each complete lens is made up from a number of separate lens elements arranged along a common axis. The use of many lens elements serves to minimise aberrations and to provide a sharp image free from visible imperfections. To do this requires lens elements of different compositions and different shapes. To minimise chromatic aberrations, e.&nbsp;g., in which different wavelengths of light are refracted to different degrees, requires, at a minimum, a doublet of lens elements with a positive element having a high [[Abbe number]] matched with a negative element of lower Abbe number. With this design one can achieve a good degree of convergence of different wavelengths in the [[visible spectrum]]. Most lens designs do not attempt to bring [[infrared]] wavelengths to the same common focus and it is therefore necessary to manually alter the focus when photographing in infrared light. Other kinds of aberrations like [[Coma (optics)|coma]] or [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]] can also be minimized by combining different lens elements. Complex photographic lenses can consist of more than 15 lens elements.\n\nMost lens elements are made with curved surfaces with a [[sphere|spherical]] profile. That is, the curved shape would fit on the surface of a sphere. This is partly to do with the history of lens making but also because grinding and manufacturing of spherical surface lenses is relatively simple and cheap. However, spherical surfaces also give rise to lens aberrations and can lead to complicated lens designs of great size. Higher-quality lenses with fewer elements and lower size can be achieved by using [[aspheric lens]]es in which the curved surfaces are not spherical, giving more degrees of freedom to correct aberrations.\n\n====Lens glass====\n{{main article|Refraction}}\nThe majority of photographic lenses have the lens elements made from glass although the use of high-quality plastics is becoming more common in high-quality lenses and has been common in inexpensive cameras for some time. The design of photographic lenses is very demanding as designers push the limits of existing materials to make more versatile, better-quality, and lighter lenses. As a consequence many exotic glasses have been used in modern lens manufacturing. [[Caesium]]<ref>http://specialmetals.chemetall.com/basic.jsp;jsessionid=E7EC988ACA791907FC590ED56D5376F8.ffms29?xml=14B7838C4C8EDCFEC1256EFC005FC3B7</ref> and [[lanthanum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3615762.html|title=THORIUM-FREE, LANTHANUM BORATE OPTICAL GLASS|author=|date=|website=freepatentsonline.com}}</ref> glass lenses are now in use because of their high [[refractive index]] and very low dispersion properties. It is also likely that a number of other transition element glasses are in use but manufacturers often prefer to keep their material specification secret to retain a commercial or performance edge over their rivals.\n\n===Focus===\n{{main article|Focus (optics)}}\nUntil recent years focusing of a camera lens to achieve a sharp image on the film plane was achieved by means of a very shallow [[Helix|helical]] thread in the lens mount through which the lens could be rotated moving it closer or further from the film plane. This arrangement, whilst simple to design and construct, has some limitations not least the rotation of the greater part of the lens assembly including the front element. This could be problematical if devices such as [[polarising filter]]s were in use that require maintaining an accurate vertical orientation irrespective of focus distance.\n\nLater developments adopted designs in which internal elements were moved to achieve focus without affecting the outer barrel of the lens or the orientation of the front element.\n\nMany modern cameras now use automatic focusing mechanisms which use [[ultrasonic motor]]s to move internal elements in the lens to achieve optimum focus.\n\n===Aperture control===\n{{main article|Aperture}}\nThe aperture control, usually a multi-leaf diaphragm, is critical to the performance of a lens. The role of the aperture is to control the amount of light passing through the lens to the film or sensor plane. An aperture placed outside of the lens, as in the case of some [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cameras, risks vignetting of the image in which the corners of the image are darker than the centre. A diaphragm too close to the image plane risks the diaphragm itself being recorded as a circular shape or at the very least causing diffraction patterns at small apertures. In most lens designs the aperture is positioned about midway between the front surface of the objective and the image plane. In some zoom lenses it is placed some distance away from the ideal location in order to accommodate the movement of floating lens elements needed to perform the zoom function.\n\nMost modern lenses for 35mm format rarely provide a stop smaller than f/22 because of the diffraction effects caused by light passing through a very small aperture. As diffraction is based on aperture width in absolute terms rather than the f-stop ratio, lenses for very small formats common in compact cameras rarely go above f/11 (1/1.8\") or f/8 (1/2.5\"), while lenses for medium- and large-format provide f/64 or f/128.\n\nVery-large-aperture lenses designed to be useful in very low light conditions with apertures ranging from f/1.2 to f/0.9 are generally restricted to lenses of standard focal length because of the size and weight problems that would be encountered in telephoto lenses and the difficulty of building a very wide aperture wide angle lens with the refractive materials currently available. Very-large-aperture lenses are commonly made for other types of optical instruments such as [[microscopes]] but in such cases the diameter of the lens is very small and weight is not an issue.\n\nMany very early cameras had diaphragms external to the lens often consisting of a rotating circular plate with a number of holes of increasing size drilled through the plate.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n| first= E.J.\n| last= Wall\n| title = Dictionary of Photography\n| publisher =Hassel, Watson and Viney\n| location = London\n| year= 1890\n}}\n</ref> Rotating the plate would bring an appropriate sized hole in front of the lens. All modern lenses use a multi-leaf diaphragm so that at the central intersection of the leaves a more or less circular aperture is formed. Either a manual ring, or an electronic motor controls the angle of the diaphragm leaves and thus the size of the opening.\n\nThe placement of the diaphragm within the lens structure is constrained by the need to achieve even illumination over the whole film plane at all apertures and the requirement to not interfere with the movement of any movable lens element. Typically the diaphragm is situated at about the level of the optical centre of the lens.\n\n===Shutter mechanism===\n{{main article|Shutter (photography)}}\nA [[shutter (photography)|shutter]] controls the length of time light is allowed to pass through the lens onto the film plane. For any given light intensity, the more sensitive the film or detector or the wider the aperture the shorter the [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] time need to be to maintain the optimal exposure.\nIn the earliest cameras, exposures were controlled by moving a rotating plate from in front of the lens and then replacing it. Such a mechanism only works effectively for exposures of several seconds or more and carries a considerable risk of inducing [[camera shake]]. By the end of the 19th century spring tensioned shutter mechanisms were in use operated by a lever or by a [[cable release]]. Some simple shutters continued to be placed in front of the lens but most were incorporated within the lens mount itself.\nSuch lenses with integral shutter mechanisms developed in the current [[Compur]] shutter as used in many non-reflex cameras such as [[Linhof]]. These shutters have a number of metal leaves that spring open and then close after a pre-determined interval. The material and design constraints limit the shortest speed to about 0.002 second. Although such shutters cannot yield as short an exposure time as [[focal-plane shutter]] they are able to offer [[Flash synchronization|flash synchronisation]] at all speeds.\n\nIncorporating a commercial made Compur type shutter required lens designers to accommodate the width of the shutter mechanism in the lens mount and provide for the means of triggering the shutter on the lens barrel or transferring this to the camera body by a series of levers as in the [[Minolta]] twin-lens cameras.\n\nThe need to accommodate the shutter mechanism within the lens barrel limited the design of wide-angle lenses and it was not until the widespread use of focal-plane shutters that extreme wide-angle lenses were developed.\n\n==Types of lenses==\n[[Image:Tessar.png|thumb|Example of a prime lens - Carl Zeiss [[Tessar]].]]\nThe type of lens being designed is significant in setting the key parameters.\n*[[Prime lens]] -  a photographic lens whose focal length is fixed, as opposed to a zoom lens, or that is the primary lens in a combination lens system.\n*[[Zoom lens]]es - variable focal length lenses. Zoom lenses cover a range of focal lengths by utilising movable elements within the barrel of the lens assembly. In early [[varifocal lens]] lenses, the focus also shifted as the lens focal length was changed. Varifocal lenses are also used in many modern autofocus cameras as the lenses are cheaper and simpler to construct and the autofocus can take care of the re-focussing requirements. Many modern zoom lenses are now ''confocal'', meaning that the focus is maintained throughout the zoom range. Because of the need to operate over a range of focal lengths and maintain confocality, zoom lenses typically have very many lens elements. More significantly, the front elements of the lens will always be a compromise in terms of its size, light-gathering capability and the angle of incidence of the incoming rays of light. For all these reasons, the optical performance of zoom lenses tends to be lower than fixed-focal-length lenses.\n*[[Normal lens]] - a lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format, or that reproduces perspective that generally looks \"normal\" to a human observer.\n[[Image:Symetrical.svg|thumb|Cross-section of a typical short-focus wide-angle lens.]]\n*[[Wide angle lens]] - a lens that reproduces perspective that generally looks \"wider\" than a normal lens. The problem posed by the design of wide-angle lenses is to bring to an accurate focus light from a wide area without causing internal flare. Wide-angle lenses therefore tend to have more elements than a normal lens to help refract the light sufficiently and still minimise aberrations whilst adding light-trapping baffles between each lens element.\n[[Image:Angenieux.png|thumb|Cross-section of a typical retrofocus wide-angle lens.]]\n:*Extreme or ultra-wide-angle lens - a wide-angle lens with an angle of view above 90 degrees.<ref>Sidney F. Ray, Applied photographic optics, page 314</ref> Extreme-wide-angle lenses share the same issues as ordinary wide-angle lenses but the focal length of such lenses may be so short that there is insufficient physical space in front of the film or sensor plane to construct a lens. This problem is resolved by constructing the lens as an inverted telephoto, or [[Ang\u00e9nieux retrofocus|retrofocus]] with the front element having a very short focal length, often with a highly exaggerated convex front surface and behind it a strongly negative lens grouping that extends the cone of focused rays so that they can be brought to focus at a reasonable distance.\n[[Image:Typtelelens.png|thumb|right|300px|Cross-section - typical telephoto lens. <br>'''L1''' - Tele positive lens group <br>'''L2''' - Tele negative lens group <br>'''D''' - Diaphragm]]\n*[[Fisheye lens]] - an extreme wide-angle lens with a strongly convex front element. Spherical aberration is usually pronounced and sometimes enhanced for special effect. Optically designed as a reverse telephoto to enable the lens to fit into a standard mount as the focal length can be less than the distance from lens mount to focal plane.\n*[[Long-focus lens]] - a lens with a focal length greater than the diagonal of the film frame or sensor. Long focus lenses are relatively simple to design, the challenges being comparable to the design of a prime lens. However, as the focal length increases the length of the lens and the size of the objective increase in size and length and weight quickly become significant design issues in retaining utility and practicality for the lens in use. In addition because the light path through the lens is long and glancing, the importance of baffles to control flare increases in importance.\n*[[Telephoto lens]] - an optically compressed version of the long-focus lens. The design of telephoto lenses reduces some of the problems encountered by designers of long-focus lenses. In particular, telephoto lenses are typically much shorter and may be lighter for equivalent focal length and aperture. However telephoto designs increase the number of lens elements and can introduce flare and exacerbate some optical aberrations.\n*[[Catadioptric system#Photographic catadioptric lenses|Catadioptric lens]] - catadioptric lenses are a form of telephoto lens but with a light path that doubles back on itself and with an objective that is a mirror combined with some form aberration correcting lens (a [[catadioptric system]]) rather than just a lens. A centrally-placed [[secondary mirror]] and usually an additional small lens group bring the light to focus. Such lenses are very lightweight and can easily deliver very long focal lengths but they can only deliver a fixed aperture and have none of the benefits of being able to stop down the aperture to increase depth of field.\n*[[Anamorphic lens]]es are used principally in [[cinematography]] to produce wide-screen films where the projected image has a substantially different ratio of height to width than the image recorded on the film plane. This is achieved by the use of a specialised lens design which compresses the image laterally at the recording stage and the film is then projected through a similar lens in the cinema to recreate the wide-screen effect. Although in some cases the anamorphic effect is achieved by using an anamorphising attachment as a supplementary element on the front of a normal lens, most films shot in anamorphic formats use specially designed anamorphic lenses, such as the Hawk lenses made by Vantage Film or [[Panavision|Panavision's]] anamorphic lenses. These lenses incorporate one or more [[aspheric lens|aspheric elements]] in their design.\n\n===Enlarger lenses===\nLenses used in photographic enlargers are required to focus light passing through a relatively small film area on a larger area of photographic paper or film. Requirements for such lenses include\n:*the ability to record even illumination over the whole field\n:*to record fine detail present in the film being enlarged\n:*to withstand frequent cycles of heating and cooling as the illumination lamp is turned on and off\n:*to be able to be operated in the dark - usually by means of click stops and some luminous controls\n\nThe design of the lens is required to work effectively with light passing from near focus to far focus - exactly the reverse of a camera lens. This demands that internal light baffling within the lens is designed differently and that the individual lens elements are designed to maximize performance for this change of direction of incident light.\n\n===Projector lenses===\nProjector lenses share many of the design constraints as enlarger lenses but with some critical differences. Projector lenses are always used at full aperture and must produce an acceptably illuminated and acceptably sharp image at full aperture.\n\nHowever, because projected images are almost always viewed at some distance, lack of very fine focus and slight unevenness of illumination is often acceptable. Projector lenses have to be very tolerant of prolonged high temperatures from the projector lamp and frequently have a focal length much longer than the taking lens. This allows the lens to be positioned at a greater distance from the illuminated film and allows an acceptable sized image with the projector some distance from the screen. It also permits the lens to be mounted in a relatively coarsely threaded focusing mount so that the projectionist can quickly correct any focusing errors.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of photographic lens design}}\n[[Image:Petzval-text.svg|thumb|right|200px|Diagram of Petzval's 1841 portrait lens<!-- - crown glass shaded pink, flint glass shaded blue -->]]\nThe lenses of the very earliest cameras were simple meniscus or simple bi convex lenses. It was not until 1840 that Chevalier in France introduced the achromatic lens formed by cementing a [[crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] bi-convex lens to a [[flint glass]] plano-concave lens.\nBy 1841 [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]] using the design of [[Joseph Petzval]]  manufactured the first commercially successful two element lens.\n\n[[Carl Zeiss]] was an [[entrepreneur]] who needed a competent designer to take his firm beyond just another optical workshop. In 1866, the service of Dr Ernst Abbe was enlisted. From then on novel products appeared in rapid succession which brought the Zeiss company to the forefront of optical technology.\n\nAbbe was instrumental in the development of the famous Jena optical glass. When he was trying to eliminate astigmatism from microscopes, he realised that the range of optical glasses available was insufficient. After some calculations, he realised that performance of optical instruments would dramatically improve, if optical glasses of appropriate properties were available. His challenge to glass manufacturers was finally answered by Dr Otto Schott, who established the famous glassworks at [[Jena]] from which new types of optical glass began to appear from 1888, and employed by Zeiss and other makers.\n\nThe new Jena optical glass also opened up the possibility of increased performance of photographic lenses. The first use of Jena glass in a photographic lens was by [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]], but as the lens was an old design its performance was not greatly improved. Subsequently, the new glasses would demonstrate their value in correcting  [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]], and in the production of  achromatic and [[apochromatic]] lenses. Abb\u00e9 started the design of a photographic lens of symmetrical design with five elements, but went no further.\n\nZeiss' innovative photographic lens design was due to Dr [[Paul Rudolph (physicist)|Paul Rudolph]]. In 1890, Rudolph designed an asymmetrical lens with a cemented group at each side of the diaphragm, and appropriately named \"Anastigmat\". This lens was made in three series: Series III, IV and V, with maximum apertures of f/7.2, f/12.5, and f/18 respectively. In 1891, Series I, II and IIIa appeared with respective maximum apertures of f/4.5, f/6.3, and f/9 and in 1893 came Series IIa of f/8 maximum aperture. These lenses are now better known by the trademark \"Protar\" which was first used in 1900.\n\nAt the time, single combination lenses, which occupy one side of the diaphragm only, were still popular. Rudolph designed one with three cemented elements in 1893, with the option of fitting two of them together in a lens barrel as a compound lens, but it was found to be the same as the Dagor by [[Goerz (company)|C.P. Goerz]], designed by [[Emil von H\u00f6egh]]. Rudolph then came up with a single combination with four cemented elements, which can be considered as having all the elements of the Protar stuck together in one piece. Marketed in 1894, it was called the Protarlinse Series VII, the most highly corrected single combination lens with maximum apertures between f/11 and f/12.5, depending on its focal length.\n\nBut the important thing about this Protarlinse is that two of these lens units can be mounted in the same lens barrel to form a compound lens of even greater performance and larger aperture, between f/6.3 and f/7.7. In this configuration it was called the Double Protar Series VIIa. An immense range of focal lengths can thus be obtained by the various combination of Protarlinse units.\n\nRudolph also investigated the [[Double-Gauss]] concept of a symmetrical design with thin positive menisci enclosing negative elements. The result was the Planar Series Ia of 1896, with maximum apertures up to f/3.5, one of the fastest lenses of its time. Whilst it was very sharp, it suffered from [[Coma (optics)|coma]] which limited its popularity. However, further developments of this configuration made it the design of choice for high-speed lenses of standard coverage.\n\nProbably inspired by the Stigmatic lenses designed by Hugh Aldis for [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer]] of London, Rudolph designed a new asymmetrical lens with four thin elements, the Unar Series Ib, with apertures up to f/4.5. Due to its high speed it was used extensively on hand cameras.\n\nThe most important Zeiss lens by Rudolph was the [[Tessar]], first sold in 1902 in its Series IIb f/6.3 form. It can be said as a combination of the front half of the Unar with the rear half of the Protar. This proved to be a most valuable and flexible design, with tremendous development potential. Its maximum aperture was increased to f/4.7 in 1917, and reached f/2.7 in 1930. It is probable that every lens manufacturer has produced lenses of the Tessar configuration.\n\nRudolph left Zeiss after the First World War, but many other competent designers such as Mert\u00e9, Wandersleb, etc. kept the firm at the leading edge of photographic lens innovations. One of the most significant designer was the ex-Ernemann man [[Ludwig Bertele|Dr Ludwig Bertele]], famed for his Ernostar high-speed lens.\n\nWith the advent of the [[Contax]] by Zeiss-Ikon, the first serious challenge to the [[Leica Camera|Leica]] in the field of professional 35&nbsp;mm cameras, both Zeiss-Ikon and Carl Zeiss decided to beat the Leica in every possible way. Bertele's [[Zeiss Sonnar|Sonnar]] series of lenses designed for the Contax were the match in every respect for the Leica for at least two decades. Other lenses for the Contax included the Biotar, Biogon, Orthometar, and various Tessars and Triotars.\n\nThe last important Zeiss innovation before the Second World War was the technique of applying anti-reflective coating to lens surfaces invented by [[Olexander Smakula]] in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeiss.com/corporate/en_de/history/company%20history/at-a-glance/at-a-glance-milestones.html#1895-_-1945|title=History of Camera Lenses from Carl Zeiss - 1935 - Alexander Smakula develops anti-reflection coating|author=|date=|website=zeiss.com}}</ref> A lens so treated was marked with a red \"T\", short for \"Transparent\". The technique of applying multiple layers of coating was also described in the original patent writings in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeiss.com/sports-optics/en_us/hunting/experience/competences/lens-coating.html|title=Lens Coating - ZEISS United States|author=|date=|website=www.zeiss.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the partitioning of Germany, a new Carl Zeiss optical company was established in [[Oberkochen]], while the original Zeiss firm in [[Jena]] continued to operate. At first both firms produced very similar lines of products, and extensively cooperated in product-sharing, but they drifted apart as time progressed. Jena's new direction was to concentrate on developing lenses for the 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex camera, and many achievements were made, especially in ultra-wide angle designs. In addition to that, Oberkochen also worked on designing lenses for large format cameras, interchangeable front element lenses such as for the 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex Contaflex, and other types of cameras.\n\nSince the beginning of Zeiss as a photographic lens manufacturer, it has had a licensing programme which allows other manufacturers to produce its lenses. Over the years its licensees included [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]], [[Bausch & Lomb]], Ross, Koristka, Krauss, [[Kodak]]. etc. In the 1970s, the western operation of Zeiss-Ikon got together with Yashica to produce the new [[Contax]] cameras, and many of the Zeiss lenses for this camera, among others, were produced by Yashica's optical arm, Tomioka. Yashica's owner [[Kyocera]] ended camera production in 2006. Yashica lenses were then made by [[Cosina]], who also manufactured most of the new Zeiss designs for the new Zeiss Ikon coupled rangefinder camera. Another licensee active today is [[Sony]] who uses the Zeiss name on lenses on its video and digital still cameras.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Photography}}\n\n* [[Camera lens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Design}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Photographic Lens Design}}\n[[Category:Industrial design]]\n[[Category:Photographic lenses]]\n[[Category:Photographic lens designs| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|general lens design|Optical lens design}}\nThe design of [[photographic lens]]es for use in still or [[cine]] [[camera]]s is intended to produce a lens that yields the most acceptable rendition of the subject being [[photography|photographed]] within a range of constraints that include cost, weight and materials. For many other optical devices such as [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s and [[theodolite]]s where the visual image is observed but often not recorded the design can often be significantly simpler than is the case in a camera where every image is captured on [[film]] or [[image sensor]] and can be subject to detailed scrutiny at a later stage. Photographic lenses also include those used in [[enlarger]]s and projectors.\n\n==Design==\n\n===Design requirements===\n{{main article|Optical lens design}}\nFrom the perspective of the photographer, the ability of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to capture sufficient light so that the camera can operate over a wide range of lighting conditions is important. Designing a lens that reproduces colour accurately is also important as is the production of an evenly lit and sharp image over the whole of the film or sensor plane.\n\nFor the lens designer, achieving these objectives will also involve ensuring that internal [[Lens flare|flare]], optical  [[Optical aberration|aberrations]] and weight are all reduced to the minimum whilst [[zoom lens|zoom]], [[focus (optics)|focus]] and [[aperture]] functions all operate smoothly and predictably.\n\nHowever, because photographic films and electronic sensors have a finite and measurable resolution, photographic lenses are not always designed for maximum possible resolution since the recording medium would not be able to record the level of detail that the lens could resolve. For this, and many other reasons, camera lenses are unsuited  for use as [[Slide projector|projector]] or [[enlarger]] lenses.\n\nThe design of a [[Fixed focus|fixed focal length]] lens (also known as ''[[prime lens]]es'') presents fewer challenges than the design of a zoom lens. A high-quality prime lens whose [[focal length]] is about equal to the diameter of the film frame or sensor may be constructed from as few as four separate lens elements, often as pairs on either side of the aperture diaphragm. Good examples include the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] [[Tessar]] or the [[Esselte Leitz GmbH & Co KG|Leitz]] [[Tessar#Leitz Elmar|Elmar]].\n\n====Design constraints====\nTo be useful in photography any lens must be able to fit the camera for which it is intended and this will physically limit the size where the [[bayonet mount]]ing or [[Lens mount|screw mounting]] is to be located.\n\nPhotography is a highly competitive commercial business and both weight and cost constrain the production of lenses.\n\nRefractive materials such as glass have physical limitations which limit the performance of lenses. In particular the range of refractive indices available in commercial glasses span a very narrow range. Since it is the [[refractive index]] that determines how much the rays of light are bent at each interface and since it is the differences in refractive indices in paired plus and minus lenses that constrains the ability to minimise [[chromatic aberration]]s, having only a narrow spectrum of indices is a major design constraint.\n\n===Lens elements===\n[[File:Revuenon 28mm 1-3,5 dismantled.jpg|thumb|Elements of a cheap 28mm lens]]\n[[File:Objective Zeiss Cut.jpg|thumb|Photographic lens cut for demonstration]]\n{{main article|Lens (optics)}}\nExcept for the most simple and inexpensive lenses, each complete lens is made up from a number of separate lens elements arranged along a common axis. The use of many lens elements serves to minimise aberrations and to provide a sharp image free from visible imperfections. To do this requires lens elements of different compositions and different shapes. To minimise chromatic aberrations, e.&nbsp;g., in which different wavelengths of light are refracted to different degrees, requires, at a minimum, a doublet of lens elements with a positive element having a high [[Abbe number]] matched with a negative element of lower Abbe number. With this design one can achieve a good degree of convergence of different wavelengths in the [[visible spectrum]]. Most lens designs do not attempt to bring [[infrared]] wavelengths to the same common focus and it is therefore necessary to manually alter the focus when photographing in infrared light. Other kinds of aberrations like [[Coma (optics)|coma]] or [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]] can also be minimized by combining different lens elements. Complex photographic lenses can consist of more than 15 lens elements.\n\nMost lens elements are made with curved surfaces with a [[sphere|spherical]] profile. That is, the curved shape would fit on the surface of a sphere. This is partly to do with the history of lens making but also because grinding and manufacturing of spherical surface lenses is relatively simple and cheap. However, spherical surfaces also give rise to lens aberrations and can lead to complicated lens designs of great size. Higher-quality lenses with fewer elements and lower size can be achieved by using [[aspheric lens]]es in which the curved surfaces are not spherical, giving more degrees of freedom to correct aberrations.\n\n====Lens glass====\n{{main article|Refraction}}\nThe majority of photographic lenses have the lens elements made from glass although the use of high-quality plastics is becoming more common in high-quality lenses and has been common in inexpensive cameras for some time. The design of photographic lenses is very demanding as designers push the limits of existing materials to make more versatile, better-quality, and lighter lenses. As a consequence many exotic glasses have been used in modern lens manufacturing.

It is also likely that a number of other transition element glasses are in use but manufacturers often prefer to keep their material specification secret to retain a commercial or performance edge over their rivals.\n\n===Focus===\n{{main article|Focus (optics)}}\nUntil recent years focusing of a camera lens to achieve a sharp image on the film plane was achieved by means of a very shallow [[Helix|helical]] thread in the lens mount through which the lens could be rotated moving it closer or further from the film plane. This arrangement, whilst simple to design and construct, has some limitations not least the rotation of the greater part of the lens assembly including the front element. This could be problematical if devices such as [[polarising filter]]s were in use that require maintaining an accurate vertical orientation irrespective of focus distance.\n\nLater developments adopted designs in which internal elements were moved to achieve focus without affecting the outer barrel of the lens or the orientation of the front element.\n\nMany modern cameras now use automatic focusing mechanisms which use [[ultrasonic motor]]s to move internal elements in the lens to achieve optimum focus.\n\n===Aperture control===\n{{main article|Aperture}}\nThe aperture control, usually a multi-leaf diaphragm, is critical to the performance of a lens. The role of the aperture is to control the amount of light passing through the lens to the film or sensor plane. An aperture placed outside of the lens, as in the case of some [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cameras, risks vignetting of the image in which the corners of the image are darker than the centre. A diaphragm too close to the image plane risks the diaphragm itself being recorded as a circular shape or at the very least causing diffraction patterns at small apertures. In most lens designs the aperture is positioned about midway between the front surface of the objective and the image plane. In some zoom lenses it is placed some distance away from the ideal location in order to accommodate the movement of floating lens elements needed to perform the zoom function.\n\nMost modern lenses for 35mm format rarely provide a stop smaller than f/22 because of the diffraction effects caused by light passing through a very small aperture. As diffraction is based on aperture width in absolute terms rather than the f-stop ratio, lenses for very small formats common in compact cameras rarely go above f/11 (1/1.8\") or f/8 (1/2.5\"), while lenses for medium- and large-format provide f/64 or f/128.\n\nVery-large-aperture lenses designed to be useful in very low light conditions with apertures ranging from f/1.2 to f/0.9 are generally restricted to lenses of standard focal length because of the size and weight problems that would be encountered in telephoto lenses and the difficulty of building a very wide aperture wide angle lens with the refractive materials currently available. Very-large-aperture lenses are commonly made for other types of optical instruments such as [[microscopes]] but in such cases the diameter of the lens is very small and weight is not an issue.\n\nMany very early cameras had diaphragms external to the lens often consisting of a rotating circular plate with a number of holes of increasing size drilled through the plate.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n| first= E.J.\n| last= Wall\n| title = Dictionary of Photography\n| publisher =Hassel, Watson and Viney\n| location = London\n| year= 1890\n}}\n</ref> Rotating the plate would bring an appropriate sized hole in front of the lens. All modern lenses use a multi-leaf diaphragm so that at the central intersection of the leaves a more or less circular aperture is formed. Either a manual ring, or an electronic motor controls the angle of the diaphragm leaves and thus the size of the opening.\n\nThe placement of the diaphragm within the lens structure is constrained by the need to achieve even illumination over the whole film plane at all apertures and the requirement to not interfere with the movement of any movable lens element. Typically the diaphragm is situated at about the level of the optical centre of the lens.\n\n===Shutter mechanism===\n{{main article|Shutter (photography)}}\nA [[shutter (photography)|shutter]] controls the length of time light is allowed to pass through the lens onto the film plane. For any given light intensity, the more sensitive the film or detector or the wider the aperture the shorter the [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] time need to be to maintain the optimal exposure.\nIn the earliest cameras, exposures were controlled by moving a rotating plate from in front of the lens and then replacing it. Such a mechanism only works effectively for exposures of several seconds or more and carries a considerable risk of inducing [[camera shake]]. By the end of the 19th century spring tensioned shutter mechanisms were in use operated by a lever or by a [[cable release]]. Some simple shutters continued to be placed in front of the lens but most were incorporated within the lens mount itself.\nSuch lenses with integral shutter mechanisms developed in the current [[Compur]] shutter as used in many non-reflex cameras such as [[Linhof]]. These shutters have a number of metal leaves that spring open and then close after a pre-determined interval. The material and design constraints limit the shortest speed to about 0.002 second. Although such shutters cannot yield as short an exposure time as [[focal-plane shutter]] they are able to offer [[Flash synchronization|flash synchronisation]] at all speeds.\n\nIncorporating a commercial made Compur type shutter required lens designers to accommodate the width of the shutter mechanism in the lens mount and provide for the means of triggering the shutter on the lens barrel or transferring this to the camera body by a series of levers as in the [[Minolta]] twin-lens cameras.\n\nThe need to accommodate the shutter mechanism within the lens barrel limited the design of wide-angle lenses and it was not until the widespread use of focal-plane shutters that extreme wide-angle lenses were developed.\n\n==Types of lenses==\n[[Image:Tessar.png|thumb|Example of a prime lens - Carl Zeiss [[Tessar]].]]\nThe type of lens being designed is significant in setting the key parameters.\n*[[Prime lens]] -  a photographic lens whose focal length is fixed, as opposed to a zoom lens, or that is the primary lens in a combination lens system.\n*[[Zoom lens]]es - variable focal length lenses. Zoom lenses cover a range of focal lengths by utilising movable elements within the barrel of the lens assembly. In early [[varifocal lens]] lenses, the focus also shifted as the lens focal length was changed. Varifocal lenses are also used in many modern autofocus cameras as the lenses are cheaper and simpler to construct and the autofocus can take care of the re-focussing requirements. Many modern zoom lenses are now ''confocal'', meaning that the focus is maintained throughout the zoom range. Because of the need to operate over a range of focal lengths and maintain confocality, zoom lenses typically have very many lens elements. More significantly, the front elements of the lens will always be a compromise in terms of its size, light-gathering capability and the angle of incidence of the incoming rays of light. For all these reasons, the optical performance of zoom lenses tends to be lower than fixed-focal-length lenses.\n*[[Normal lens]] - a lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format, or that reproduces perspective that generally looks \"normal\" to a human observer.\n[[Image:Symetrical.svg|thumb|Cross-section of a typical short-focus wide-angle lens.]]\n*[[Wide angle lens]] - a lens that reproduces perspective that generally looks \"wider\" than a normal lens. The problem posed by the design of wide-angle lenses is to bring to an accurate focus light from a wide area without causing internal flare. Wide-angle lenses therefore tend to have more elements than a normal lens to help refract the light sufficiently and still minimise aberrations whilst adding light-trapping baffles between each lens element.\n[[Image:Angenieux.png|thumb|Cross-section of a typical retrofocus wide-angle lens.]]\n:*Extreme or ultra-wide-angle lens - a wide-angle lens with an angle of view above 90 degrees.<ref>Sidney F.

In particular, telephoto lenses are typically much shorter and may be lighter for equivalent focal length and aperture. However telephoto designs increase the number of lens elements and can introduce flare and exacerbate some optical aberrations.\n*[[Catadioptric system#Photographic catadioptric lenses|Catadioptric lens]] - catadioptric lenses are a form of telephoto lens but with a light path that doubles back on itself and with an objective that is a mirror combined with some form aberration correcting lens (a [[catadioptric system]]) rather than just a lens.

This allows the lens to be positioned at a greater distance from the illuminated film and allows an acceptable sized image with the projector some distance from the screen. It also permits the lens to be mounted in a relatively coarsely threaded focusing mount so that the projectionist can quickly correct any focusing errors.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of photographic lens design}}\n[[Image:Petzval-text.svg|thumb|right|200px|Diagram of Petzval's 1841 portrait lens - crown glass shaded pink, flint glass shaded blue]]\nThe lenses of the very earliest cameras were simple meniscus or simple bi convex lenses. It was not until 1840 that Chevalier in France introduced the achromatic lens formed by cementing a [[crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] bi-convex lens to a [[flint glass]] plano-concave lens.\nBy 1841 [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]] using the design of [[Joseph Petzval]]  manufactured the first commercially successful two element lens.\n\n[[Carl Zeiss]] was an [[entrepreneur]] who needed a competent designer to take his firm beyond just another optical workshop. In 1866, the service of Dr Ernst Abbe was enlisted. From then on novel products appeared in rapid succession which brought the Zeiss company to the forefront of optical technology.\n\nAbbe was instrumental in the development of the famous Jena optical glass. When he was trying to eliminate astigmatism from microscopes, he realised that the range of optical glasses available was insufficient. After some calculations, he realised that performance of optical instruments would dramatically improve, if optical glasses of appropriate properties were available. His challenge to glass manufacturers was finally answered by Dr Otto Schott, who established the famous glassworks at [[Jena]] from which new types of optical glass began to appear from 1888, and employed by Zeiss and other makers.\n\nThe new Jena optical glass also opened up the possibility of increased performance of photographic lenses. The first use of Jena glass in a photographic lens was by [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]], but as the lens was an old design its performance was not greatly improved. Subsequently, the new glasses would demonstrate their value in correcting  [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|astigmatism]], and in the production of  achromatic and [[apochromatic]] lenses. Abb\u00e9 started the design of a photographic lens of symmetrical design with five elements, but went no further.\n\nZeiss' innovative photographic lens design was due to Dr [[Paul Rudolph (physicist)|Paul Rudolph]]. In 1890, Rudolph designed an asymmetrical lens with a cemented group at each side of the diaphragm, and appropriately named \"Anastigmat\". This lens was made in three series: Series III, IV and V, with maximum apertures of f/7.2, f/12.5, and f/18 respectively. In 1891, Series I, II and IIIa appeared with respective maximum apertures of f/4.5, f/6.3, and f/9 and in 1893 came Series IIa of f/8 maximum aperture. These lenses are now better known by the trademark \"Protar\" which was first used in 1900.\n\nAt the time, single combination lenses, which occupy one side of the diaphragm only, were still popular. Rudolph designed one with three cemented elements in 1893, with the option of fitting two of them together in a lens barrel as a compound lens, but it was found to be the same as the Dagor by [[Goerz (company)|C.P. Goerz]], designed by [[Emil von H\u00f6egh]]. Rudolph then came up with a single combination with four cemented elements, which can be considered as having all the elements of the Protar stuck together in one piece. Marketed in 1894, it was called the Protarlinse Series VII, the most highly corrected single combination lens with maximum apertures between f/11 and f/12.5, depending on its focal length.\n\nBut the important thing about this Protarlinse is that two of these lens units can be mounted in the same lens barrel to form a compound lens of even greater performance and larger aperture, between f/6.3 and f/7.7. In this configuration it was called the Double Protar Series VIIa. An immense range of focal lengths can thus be obtained by the various combination of Protarlinse units.\n\nRudolph also investigated the [[Double-Gauss]] concept of a symmetrical design with thin positive menisci enclosing negative elements. The result was the Planar Series Ia of 1896, with maximum apertures up to f/3.5, one of the fastest lenses of its time. Whilst it was very sharp, it suffered from [[Coma (optics)|coma]] which limited its popularity. However, further developments of this configuration made it the design of choice for high-speed lenses of standard coverage.\n\nProbably inspired by the Stigmatic lenses designed by Hugh Aldis for [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer]] of London, Rudolph designed a new asymmetrical lens with four thin elements, the Unar Series Ib, with apertures up to f/4.5. Due to its high speed it was used extensively on hand cameras.\n\nThe most important Zeiss lens by Rudolph was the [[Tessar]], first sold in 1902 in its Series IIb f/6.3 form. It can be said as a combination of the front half of the Unar with the rear half of the Protar. This proved to be a most valuable and flexible design, with tremendous development potential. Its maximum aperture was increased to f/4.7 in 1917, and reached f/2.7 in 1930. It is probable that every lens manufacturer has produced lenses of the Tessar configuration.\n\nRudolph left Zeiss after the First World War, but many other competent designers such as Mert\u00e9, Wandersleb, etc. kept the firm at the leading edge of photographic lens innovations. One of the most significant designer was the ex-Ernemann man [[Ludwig Bertele|Dr Ludwig Bertele]], famed for his Ernostar high-speed lens.\n\nWith the advent of the [[Contax]] by Zeiss-Ikon, the first serious challenge to the [[Leica Camera|Leica]] in the field of professional 35&nbsp;mm cameras, both Zeiss-Ikon and Carl Zeiss decided to beat the Leica in every possible way. Bertele's [[Zeiss Sonnar|Sonnar]] series of lenses designed for the Contax were the match in every respect for the Leica for at least two decades. Other lenses for the Contax included the Biotar, Biogon, Orthometar, and various Tessars and Triotars.\n\nThe last important Zeiss innovation before the Second World War was the technique of applying anti-reflective coating to lens surfaces invented by [[Olexander Smakula]] in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeiss.com/corporate/en_de/history/company%20history/at-a-glance/at-a-glance-milestones.html#1895-_-1945|title=History of Camera Lenses from Carl Zeiss - 1935 - Alexander Smakula develops anti-reflection coating|author=|date=|website=zeiss.com}}</ref> A lens so treated was marked with a red \"T\", short for \"Transparent\".

At first both firms produced very similar lines of products, and extensively cooperated in product-sharing, but they drifted apart as time progressed. Jena's new direction was to concentrate on developing lenses for the 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex camera, and many achievements were made, especially in ultra-wide angle designs. In addition to that, Oberkochen also worked on designing lenses for large format cameras, interchangeable front element lenses such as for the 35&nbsp;mm single-lens reflex Contaflex, and other types of cameras.\n\nSince the beginning of Zeiss as a photographic lens manufacturer, it has had a licensing programme which allows other manufacturers to produce its lenses. Over the years its licensees included [[Voigtl\u00e4nder]], [[Bausch & Lomb]], Ross, Koristka, Krauss, [[Kodak]]. etc. In the 1970s, the western operation of Zeiss-Ikon got together with Yashica to produce the new [[Contax]] cameras, and many of the Zeiss lenses for this camera, among others, were produced by Yashica's optical arm, Tomioka. Yashica's owner [[Kyocera]] ended camera production in 2006. Yashica lenses were then made by [[Cosina]], who also manufactured most of the new Zeiss designs for the new Zeiss Ikon coupled rangefinder camera. Another licensee active today is [[Sony]] who uses the Zeiss name on lenses on its video and digital still cameras.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Photography}}\n\n* [[Camera lens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Design}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Photographic Lens Design}}\n[[Category:Industrial design]]\n[[Category:Photographic lenses]]\n[[Category:Photographic lens designs| ]]\n", "name_user": "Runner1616", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_lens_design"}

However, the history of ecoterrorism precedes that. Although not referred to as ecoterrorism at the time, there have been incidents in history of people using terror to protect or defend the environment. It can be seen in the [[War of the Maidens|War of Desmoiselles]], or War of the Maidens. The War of the Demoiselles was a series of peasant revolts in response to the new forest codes implemented by the French government in 1827.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=February 1996|title=Peter Sahlins. <italic>Forest Rites: The War of the Demoiselles in Nineteenth-Century France</italic>. (Harvard Historical Studies, number 115.) Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 1994. Pp. xiv, 188. Cloth $29.95, paper $14.95|journal=The American Historical Review|doi=10.1086/ahr/101.1.192-a|issn=1937-5239}}</ref> In May 1829 groups of peasant men dressed in women's clothes and terrorized forest guards and charcoal-makers who they felt had wrongfully taken the land to exploit it. The revolts persisted for four years until May 1832.\n\nThis particular instance is considered an act of eco-terrorism due to the fact that the peasants used tactics similar to modern day eco-terrorist groups. The peasants of Ariege masked their identities and committed acts of terror. They specifically targeted government officials who infringed on the rights of the forest. However, this is considered a pre-history rather than an actual act of eco-terrorism due to the fact that the peasants weren\u2019t environmentalist. The peasants committed their acts to protect the environment because they felt they had a claim to it due to it being their main source of income and way of life for generations.\n\nInstances of pre-ecoterrorism can also be found in the age of colonialism and imperialism. Native and indigenous people didn\u2019t have the same view on land as property that Europeans did. When the Europeans colonized other foreign lands they believed that the natives were not using the land properly. Land was something that was meant to be profited and capitalized off of. Oftentimes natives would engage in warfare to protect their land. This is similar to the way that modern day environmentalists fight to protect land from major corporations aiming to deforest land to build factories. An example of Europeans infringing on the rights of natives can be found in the colonial administration of Algeria. When the French colonized Algeria they took the land from natives because they believed they were not using it properly. Claiming that their nomadic lifestyle as damaging to the environment in order to justify their usurping of the land.  However, the natives of Algeria engaged in battles in order to try and keep their land and lifestyle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stacey Renee Davis|date=2002|title=Turning French Convicts into Colonists: The Second Empire's Political Prisoners in Algeria, 1852-1858|journal=French Colonial History|volume=2|issue=1|pages=93\u2013113|doi=10.1353/fch.2011.0013|issn=1543-7787}}</ref>\n\n== Eco-terrorism, civil disobedience, and sabotage ==\nEco-terrorism is often defined as the use of violence carried out to further environmental policy change. Eco-terrorists are willing to inflict emotional and physical distress on their victims if they believe it will further their environmental goals. This more radical version of environmental action is illegal, as compared to its more moderate forerunner of eco-activism which is not illegal and would be classified as a form of [[civil disobedience]] and uses protests, sit ins and other civil actions to effect environmental change. Eco-terrorism can also include [[sabotage]] [[ecotage|in the name of the environment]], which is illegal as this includes crimes against property which could lead to harm to humans.  Noting that in the United States, the FBI's definition of terrorism includes acts of violence against property, which makes most acts of sabotage fall in the realm of [[domestic terrorism]].<ref name=\"fbi.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/the-threat-of-eco-terrorism|title=The Threat of Eco-Terrorism|website=FBI}}</ref>\n\nSabotage involves destroying, or threatening to destroy, property, and in this case is also known as [[monkeywrenching]]<ref name=\"Long\" /> or [[ecotage]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Plows|first1=A|last2=Wall|first2=D|last3=Doherty|first3=B|date=2004|title=Covert Repertoires: Ecotage in the UK|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=199\u2013219}}</ref> Many acts of sabotage involve the damage of equipment and unmanned facilities using [[arson]].\n<ref name=\"fbi.gov\"/>\n\n==Philosophy==\nThe thought behind eco-terrorism rises from the [[radical environmentalism]] movement, which gained currency during the 1960s.<ref name=\"Long\"/> Ideas that arose from radical environmentalism are \"based on the belief that capitalism, patriarchal society, and the industrial revolution and its subsequent innovations were responsible for the despoliation of nature\".<ref name=\"Long\"/> Radical environmentalism is also characterized by the belief that human society is responsible for the depletion of the environment and, if current society is left unchecked, will lead to the ultimate complete degradation of the environment.<ref name=\"Deep\">{{cite book |last=Dunlap |first=Riley E. |editor-last=Dunlap |editor-first=Riley E. |editor2-last=Mertig |editor2-first=Angela G. |contribution=Deep Ecology and Radical Environmentalism |title =American Environmentalism: The U.S. Environmental Movement, 1970-1990 |publisher =Taylor & Francis |year=1992 | location=Philadelphia |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanenvironm00dunl/page/52 52] |url=https://archive.org/details/americanenvironm00dunl|url-access=registration |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nLike [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]], eco-terrorists subscribe to the idea of [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} which is described as \"a belief that human beings are just an ordinary member of the biological community\" and that all living things should have rights and deserve protection under the law.<ref name=\"Eagan, S.P 1996\">Eagan, S.P. 1996.

However, the history of ecoterrorism precedes that. Although not referred to as ecoterrorism at the time, there have been incidents in history of people using terror to protect or defend the environment. It can be seen in the [[War of the Maidens|War of Desmoiselles]], or War of the Maidens. The War of the Demoiselles was a series of peasant revolts in response to the new forest codes implemented by the French government in 1827.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=February 1996|title=Peter Sahlins. <italic>Forest Rites: The War of the Demoiselles in Nineteenth-Century France</italic>.

Cloth $29.95, paper $14.95|journal=The American Historical Review|doi=10.1086/ahr/101.1.192-a|issn=1937-5239}}</ref> In May 1829 groups of peasant men dressed in women's clothes and terrorized forest guards and charcoal-makers who they felt had wrongfully taken the land to exploit it. The revolts persisted for four years until May 1832.\n\nThis particular instance is considered an act of eco-terrorism due to the fact that the peasants used tactics similar to modern day eco-terrorist groups. The peasants of Ariege masked their identities and committed acts of terror. They specifically targeted government officials who infringed on the rights of the forest. However, this is considered a pre-history rather than an actual act of eco-terrorism due to the fact that the peasants weren\u2019t environmentalist. The peasants committed their acts to protect the environment because they felt they had a claim to it due to it being their main source of income and way of life for generations.\n\nInstances of pre-ecoterrorism can also be found in the age of colonialism and imperialism. Native and indigenous people didn\u2019t have the same view on land as property that Europeans did. When the Europeans colonized other foreign lands they believed that the natives were not using the land properly. Land was something that was meant to be profited and capitalized off of. Oftentimes natives would engage in warfare to protect their land. This is similar to the way that modern day environmentalists fight to protect land from major corporations aiming to deforest land to build factories. An example of Europeans infringing on the rights of natives can be found in the colonial administration of Algeria. When the French colonized Algeria they took the land from natives because they believed they were not using it properly. Claiming that their nomadic lifestyle as damaging to the environment in order to justify their usurping of the land.  However, the natives of Algeria engaged in battles in order to try and keep their land and lifestyle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stacey Renee Davis|date=2002|title=Turning French Convicts into Colonists: The Second Empire's Political Prisoners in Algeria, 1852-1858|journal=French Colonial History|volume=2|issue=1|pages=93\u2013113|doi=10.1353/fch.2011.0013|issn=1543-7787}}</ref>\n\n== Eco-terrorism, civil disobedience, and sabotage ==\nEco-terrorism is often defined as the use of violence carried out to further environmental policy change. Eco-terrorists are willing to inflict emotional and physical distress on their victims if they believe it will further their environmental goals. This more radical version of environmental action is illegal, as compared to its more moderate forerunner of eco-activism which is not illegal and would be classified as a form of [[civil disobedience]] and uses protests, sit ins and other civil actions to effect environmental change. Eco-terrorism can also include [[sabotage]] [[ecotage|in the name of the environment]], which is illegal as this includes crimes against property which could lead to harm to humans.  Noting that in the United States, the FBI's definition of terrorism includes acts of violence against property, which makes most acts of sabotage fall in the realm of [[domestic terrorism]].<ref name=\"fbi.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/the-threat-of-eco-terrorism|title=The Threat of Eco-Terrorism|website=FBI}}</ref>\n\nSabotage involves destroying, or threatening to destroy, property, and in this case is also known as [[monkeywrenching]]<ref name=\"Long\" /> or [[ecotage]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Plows|first1=A|last2=Wall|first2=D|last3=Doherty|first3=B|date=2004|title=Covert Repertoires: Ecotage in the UK|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=199\u2013219}}</ref> Many acts of sabotage involve the damage of equipment and unmanned facilities using [[arson]].\n<ref name=\"fbi.gov\"/>\n\n==Philosophy==\nThe thought behind eco-terrorism rises from the [[radical environmentalism]] movement, which gained currency during the 1960s.<ref name=\"Long\"/> Ideas that arose from radical environmentalism are \"based on the belief that capitalism, patriarchal society, and the industrial revolution and its subsequent innovations were responsible for the despoliation of nature\".<ref name=\"Long\"/> Radical environmentalism is also characterized by the belief that human society is responsible for the depletion of the environment and, if current society is left unchecked, will lead to the ultimate complete degradation of the environment.<ref name=\"Deep\">{{cite book |last=Dunlap |first=Riley E. |editor-last=Dunlap |editor-first=Riley E. |editor2-last=Mertig |editor2-first=Angela G. |contribution=Deep Ecology and Radical Environmentalism |title =American Environmentalism: The U.S. Environmental Movement, 1970-1990 |publisher =Taylor & Francis |year=1992 | location=Philadelphia |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanenvironm00dunl/page/52 52] |url=https://archive.org/details/americanenvironm00dunl|url-access=registration |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nLike [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]], eco-terrorists subscribe to the idea of [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} which is described as \"a belief that human beings are just an ordinary member of the biological community\" and that all living things should have rights and deserve protection under the law.<ref name=\"Eagan, S.P 1996\">Eagan, S.P. 1996.

It was first proposed as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' response to [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s early explanation for the low-entropy state of our universe.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean |author-link= Sean M.

Theoretically over a period of time on the order of hundreds of billions of years, by sheer chance atoms in a void could spontaneously come together in such a way as to assemble a functioning human brain. Like any brain in such circumstances, it would almost immediately stop functioning and begin to deteriorate.<ref>{{cite podcast |url=https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/06/17/episode-51-anthony-aguirre-on-cosmology-zen-entropy-and-information/ |title=Sean Carroll's Mindscape |author-link=Sean M.

Toorak recorded a population of 12,909 at the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 Census]].\n\nThe name Toorak has become synonymous with wealth and privilege, the suburb long having the reputation of being Melbourne's most elite, and ranking among the most prestigious in Australia. It has the highest average property values in Melbourne, and is one of the most expensive suburbs in Australia.

The suburb's [[main street]] is considered to be Toorak Road, on which the commercial area of '''Toorak Village''' is located.\n\nToorak is named after [[Toorak House]], the 1849-built residence of James Jackson, a merchant.\n\nThe suburb has also been a preferred location for many consulate offices and their residences, including China, USA, Britain, Monaco, Sweden, Turkey, and Switzerland.\n\n==History==\n===Toponymy===\nToorak was named after Toorak House, an [[Italianate]] residence built by James Jackson, a merchant, in 1849. The name of the house may have originated from [[Woiwurrung language]], with words of similar pronunciation meaning ''black crow'' or ''reedy swamp''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~malvern/local_names.htm |title=Local Names |website=Malvern Historical Society |accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Toorak House===\n{{See also|Toorak House}}\nFrom 1854 Toorak House served as the residence of the first [[Governor of Victoria]], [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Sir]] [[Charles Hotham]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Royal Navy|RN]] and his successors, until the completion of the present [[Government House, Melbourne|Government House]] (1876) in the [[Kings Domain, Melbourne|Kings Domain]].\n\nToorak Post Office opened around June 1858.<ref name=\"a\">{{cite web |website=Premier Postal History |title=Post Office List |url=https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= |accessdate=11 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510053152/http://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= |archivedate=10 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===1880s land boom===\n[[File:Wombalano.jpg|thumb|right|\"Wombalano\", a thirty-room mansion built by [[John Munro Bruce]] in the 1880s]]\n[[File:Toorak House, Victoria, Australia.jpg|thumb|right|\"Chastelton\", characteristic of many 1880s Victorian houses built in the area]]\nDuring the land boom of the 1880s, many large and elaborate mansions were erected in Toorak, often in the [[Italianate]] style.

Nonetheless, the suburb remained and is still Melbourne's home of \"[[old money]]\". During the [[Interwar period]], many houses were built in the [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor revival]] style; many houses were also designed by society Architect [[Marcus Martin (architect)|Marcus Martin]] in the [[Moderne architecture|Moderne]] style over a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] building form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/5632|title=42 Wallace Avenue, Toorak, Statement of Significance|website=Heritage Council Victoria}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war era===\nIn the period of post-[[World War II]] prosperity, rising standards of living and land values caused Toorak to become highly sought after by a new generation of the wealthy, thought by some to be [[social climber]]s and [[Nouveau riche]]. For some of these people, the focus was simply to have the postcode of Toorak, which was SE 2 and now 3142. As a result, many of the larger mansions were demolished and large holdings were subdivided to make way for flats, townhouses and apartments.\n\nIn the 1980s, larger houses in [[Georgian architecture|Neo-Georgian]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] styles began to appear.\n\n===Contemporary Toorak===\nWhile large mansions have survived in neighbouring [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]], [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]] and [[Armadale, Victoria|Armadale]], only a few of the original 19th-century mansions in Toorak remain, due in part to the high land value.

Some of these homes are in the form of traditional [[mansion]]s or newer large residences on significant-sized estates, owned by Melbourne's wealthy and social elite. The architectural style of the mansions is predominantly Italianate and [[Colonial architecture|colonial]]. The premier residential streets of Toorak are generally considered by local real estate agents to be St. George's Road, Lansell Road, Hopetoun Road, Albany Road and Clendon Road. It is not unusual for Toorak houses to have extensive facilities, such as swimming pools and tennis courts behind solid gates and high walls to preserve the privacy of the residents.\n\nThere are also extant stands of semi-detached housing (20.1%), including terraces, which were traditionally fashionable with the middle class and later gentrified.<ref name=\"abs\"/>\n\n==Politics==\n\nToorak falls within the federal electorate of [[Division of Higgins|Higgins]]. The seat of Higgins was created in 1949 and held by [[Harold Holt]] [[Companion of Honour|CH]] 1949\u20131967, Sir [[John Gorton]] [[Privy Council|PC]] [[GCMG]] [[Order of Australia|AC]] [[Companion of Honour|CH]] 1968\u20131975, [[Roger Shipton]] [[Order of Australia|OAM]] 1975\u20131990, [[Peter Costello]] AC 1990\u20132009 and [[Kelly O'Dwyer]] since 2009 (all on behalf of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]). \n\nAt State level, it mostly falls within the [[Electoral district of Malvern|electorate of Malvern]] (currently held by the Liberals' [[Michael O'Brien (Victorian politician)|Michael O'Brien]]), with the western part of the suburb falling within the [[Electoral district of Prahran|electorate of Prahran]] (currently held by [[Sam Hibbins]] on behalf the [[Australian Greens]]). At local council level, Toorak falls within the City of Stonnington.\n\nToorak has historically voted for conservative political parties.  The Liberal Party retained the seat of Malvern in the 2018 State Election, although there was a 10.1% swing to the Australian Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic-election-2018/guide/malv/|title=Victoria Votes, Results, Electorate: Malvern|date=2018|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>\n\n==Toorak Village==\n[[File:VictorianBuilding0010.jpg|thumb|200px|A mock-Tudor shop in Toorak Village]]\n\nThe Toorak Village is a strip of shops and cafes, located centrally in Toorak Road.\n\n==Places of worship==\n* Saint John's Anglican Church, an 1862 [[Gothic Revival]] bluestone church, designed by [[William Wardell]], dominates the skyline of Toorak, with a large tower including a peal of bells and a distinctive sandstone broach spire.

[[Kooyong Stadium]], former home of the [[Australian Open]], is located on Glenferrie Road.\n\n==Transport ==\n[[File:Suburban Toorak.JPG|thumb|[[SUV]]s line a residential street in Toorak]]\n\nThe most popular form of transport in Toorak is the [[automobile]]. [[CityLink]] runs along north eastern Toorak, though there are no [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]] within the suburb, although there is access to the freeway via [[MacRobertson Bridge]] and interchanges at [[Burnley, Victoria|Burnley]]. Main arterials running north\u2013south are Williams Road (at the eastern boundary), Grange Road, Orrong Road, St Georges Road and Kooyong Road. The east\u2013west arterials include Alexandra Avenue (at the northern boundary), Toorak Road (which runs midway through the suburb) and Malvern Road (at the southern boundary). Alexandra Avenue becomes St Georges Road and both along with Grange Road feed onto the MacRobertson Bridge, Toorak's main river crossing. Toorak's road planning is an example of [[street hierarchy]]. As a result, there are numerous quiet pedestrian streets. However, traffic congestion is an increasing problem along Toorak Road and Williams Roads. There is limited street parking along the main roads with just a couple of [[multi-storey car park]]s and [[parking lot]]s within proximity of the main Toorak Road shopping strip. There are no [[level crossing]]s in Toorak. There is a perception in popular culture of the luxury [[Sport utility vehicle|4WD]] as a [[status symbol]], (controversial for their comfort rather than for their [[off-road]] abilities)<ref>{{cite news |last=Hale |first=Elini |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/most-drivers-want-a-city-4wd-ban/story-e6frf7kx-1111118418990 |title=Most drivers want a city 4WD ban |newspaper=Herald Sun |date=28 December 2008}}</ref> and this has been associated with the suburb of Toorak, such that in popular Australian culture, the term 'Toorak Tractor' has  become well established in [[Australian slang]].

Despite its name, [[Toorak railway station]] is located in Armadale. The [[Pakenham railway line|Pakenham]], [[Frankston railway line|Frankston]] and [[Cranbourne railway line]] group to which this station belongs runs close to Toorak's southern boundary. Other nearby stations include [[Hawksburn railway station|Hawksburn]], in South Yarra and [[Kooyong railway station|Kooyong]], in Kooyong.\n\nTrams have run down Toorak Road since 1888.

Toorak recorded a population of 12,909 at the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 Census]].\n\nThe name Toorak has become synonymous with wealth and privilege, the suburb long having the reputation of being Melbourne's most elite, and ranking among the most prestigious in Australia. It has the highest average property values in Melbourne, and is one of the most expensive suburbs in Australia. It is the nation's second highest earning postcode after [[Point Piper]] in Sydney.<ref>https://finance.nine.com.au/2018/04/27/11/51/the-top-10-richest-postcodes-in-australia</ref>\n\nLocated on a rise on the south side (or left bank) of a bend in the [[Yarra River]], Toorak is bordered by [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]], at Williams Road on the west, [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]], at Glenferrie Road on the east, [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]] and [[Armadale, Victoria|Armadale]], at Malvern Road to the south and the suburbs of [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]], [[Burnley, Victoria|Burnley]] and [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] on the north side of the river. The suburb's [[main street]] is considered to be Toorak Road, on which the commercial area of '''Toorak Village''' is located.\n\nToorak is named after [[Toorak House]], the 1849-built residence of James Jackson, a merchant.\n\nThe suburb has also been a preferred location for many consulate offices and their residences, including China, USA, Britain, Monaco, Sweden, Turkey, and Switzerland.\n\n==History==\n===Toponymy===\nToorak was named after Toorak House, an [[Italianate]] residence built by James Jackson, a merchant, in 1849. The name of the house may have originated from [[Woiwurrung language]], with words of similar pronunciation meaning ''black crow'' or ''reedy swamp''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~malvern/local_names.htm |title=Local Names |website=Malvern Historical Society |accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Toorak House===\n{{See also|Toorak House}}\nFrom 1854 Toorak House served as the residence of the first [[Governor of Victoria]], [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Sir]] [[Charles Hotham]] [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Royal Navy|RN]] and his successors, until the completion of the present [[Government House, Melbourne|Government House]] (1876) in the [[Kings Domain, Melbourne|Kings Domain]].\n\nToorak Post Office opened around June 1858.<ref name=\"a\">{{cite web |website=Premier Postal History |title=Post Office List |url=https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= |accessdate=11 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510053152/http://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= |archivedate=10 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===1880s land boom===\n[[File:Wombalano.jpg|thumb|right|\"Wombalano\", a thirty-room mansion built by [[John Munro Bruce]] in the 1880s]]\n[[File:Toorak House, Victoria, Australia.jpg|thumb|right|\"Chastelton\", characteristic of many 1880s Victorian houses built in the area]]\nDuring the land boom of the 1880s, many large and elaborate mansions were erected in Toorak, often in the [[Italianate]] style. Following [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]] and then [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], Toorak, along with [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], became the new favored location for the wealthy.\n\n===1890s depression===\nThe suburb was hit particularly hard by the 1890s economic depression and many wealthy landowners declared bankruptcy and were forced to sell. Nonetheless, the suburb remained and is still Melbourne's home of \"[[old money]]\". During the [[Interwar period]], many houses were built in the [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor revival]] style; many houses were also designed by society Architect [[Marcus Martin (architect)|Marcus Martin]] in the [[Moderne architecture|Moderne]] style over a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] building form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/5632|title=42 Wallace Avenue, Toorak, Statement of Significance|website=Heritage Council Victoria}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war era===\nIn the period of post-[[World War II]] prosperity, rising standards of living and land values caused Toorak to become highly sought after by a new generation of the wealthy, thought by some to be [[social climber]]s and [[Nouveau riche]]. For some of these people, the focus was simply to have the postcode of Toorak, which was SE 2 and now 3142. As a result, many of the larger mansions were demolished and large holdings were subdivided to make way for flats, townhouses and apartments.\n\nIn the 1980s, larger houses in [[Georgian architecture|Neo-Georgian]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] styles began to appear.\n\n===Contemporary Toorak===\nWhile large mansions have survived in neighbouring [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]], [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]] and [[Armadale, Victoria|Armadale]], only a few of the original 19th-century mansions in Toorak remain, due in part to the high land value. Two of the most notable are Illawarra House, which was acquired by the National Trust; and Coonac, the most expensive house in Melbourne.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/20/1037697739246.html |title=Toorak's grandest gets new owner |first=Deborah |last=Gough |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne |date=21 November 2002 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref> In Toorak, some of the old property names live on as street names or the names of blocks of flats, carved out of or built on their sites; Dunraven, Millicent, Iona, Woorigoleen, Myoora, and Scotsburn are examples.\n\n==Demographics==\nIn the 2016 Census, there were 12,909 people in Toorak\n* 63.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 3.6%, England 3.1%, New Zealand 2.2%, India 1.8% and Malaysia 1.2%.\n* 73.7% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 4.5%, Cantonese 1.8%, Italian 1.4%, Greek 1.3% and French 0.9%.\n* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 30.9%, Catholic 17.6% and Anglican 14.9%,\n* Of the employed people in Toorak 4.0% worked in Legal Services. Other major industries of employment included Hospitals 3.7%, Real Estate Services 3.1%, General Practice Medical Services 2.9% and Clothing Retailing 2.7%.\n* The proportion of Toorak residents with a [[Bachelor's degree]] or higher is 46.7%.<ref name=\"abs\"/>\n\n===Housing===\n[[File:RoyalTerrace-Toorak.jpg|thumb|280px|Victorian terrace housing (b. 1880s) in Williams Road]]\n\nToorak has an unusual mix of high, low and [[medium-density housing]], due to intense subdivision of larger lots in the 1880s, 1920s and 1960s. The predominant housing in Toorak (49.6%) is [[apartment]]s, particularly walk-up flats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://propertydata.realestateview.com.au/propertydata/suburb-profile/victoria/toorak/ |title=Toorak Suburb Profile & Demographics |work=propertyDATA.com.au |accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Single-family detached home]]s are also prevalent (30.2%). Some of these homes are in the form of traditional [[mansion]]s or newer large residences on significant-sized estates, owned by Melbourne's wealthy and social elite. The architectural style of the mansions is predominantly Italianate and [[Colonial architecture|colonial]]. The premier residential streets of Toorak are generally considered by local real estate agents to be St. George's Road, Lansell Road, Hopetoun Road, Albany Road and Clendon Road. It is not unusual for Toorak houses to have extensive facilities, such as swimming pools and tennis courts behind solid gates and high walls to preserve the privacy of the residents.\n\nThere are also extant stands of semi-detached housing (20.1%), including terraces, which were traditionally fashionable with the middle class and later gentrified.<ref name=\"abs\"/>\n\n==Politics==\n\nToorak falls within the federal electorate of [[Division of Higgins|Higgins]]. The seat of Higgins was created in 1949 and held by [[Harold Holt]] [[Companion of Honour|CH]] 1949\u20131967, Sir [[John Gorton]] [[Privy Council|PC]] [[GCMG]] [[Order of Australia|AC]] [[Companion of Honour|CH]] 1968\u20131975, [[Roger Shipton]] [[Order of Australia|OAM]] 1975\u20131990, [[Peter Costello]] AC 1990\u20132009 and [[Kelly O'Dwyer]] since 2009 (all on behalf of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]). \n\nAt State level, it mostly falls within the [[Electoral district of Malvern|electorate of Malvern]] (currently held by the Liberals' [[Michael O'Brien (Victorian politician)|Michael O'Brien]]), with the western part of the suburb falling within the [[Electoral district of Prahran|electorate of Prahran]] (currently held by [[Sam Hibbins]] on behalf the [[Australian Greens]]). At local council level, Toorak falls within the City of Stonnington.\n\nToorak has historically voted for conservative political parties.  The Liberal Party retained the seat of Malvern in the 2018 State Election, although there was a 10.1% swing to the Australian Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/vic-election-2018/guide/malv/|title=Victoria Votes, Results, Electorate: Malvern|date=2018|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>\n\n==Toorak Village==\n[[File:VictorianBuilding0010.jpg|thumb|200px|A mock-Tudor shop in Toorak Village]]\n\nThe Toorak Village is a strip of shops and cafes, located centrally in Toorak Road.\n\n==Places of worship==\n* Saint John's Anglican Church, an 1862 [[Gothic Revival]] bluestone church, designed by [[William Wardell]], dominates the skyline of Toorak, with a large tower including a peal of bells and a distinctive sandstone broach spire. Saint John's, Toorak is one of the most popular wedding venue churches in Australia.\n* Saint Peter's Roman Catholic Church, built in 1876 in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic style]]\n* Toorak Uniting Church (1876), in the Frenchified [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] style\n* Swedish Church\n\nThe [[Wesleyan]] Church (1877), formerly on the corner of Toorak and Williams Roads, was illegally demolished in 1990 by developers and later replaced by a block of flats.\n\n==Schools==\n\nSchools in Toorak include [[St Catherine's School, Toorak|St Catherine's School]], [[Loreto Mandeville Hall]], [[St Kevin's College, Melbourne|St Kevin's College]], Glamorgan (now Toorak Campus, the junior school of [[Geelong Grammar School]]) and Toorak Central School (1890).\n\n==Sport==\n\nThe Royal South Yarra Lawn Tennis Club was founded in 1884 and is located in Toorak. [[Kooyong Stadium]], former home of the [[Australian Open]], is located on Glenferrie Road.\n\n==Transport ==\n[[File:Suburban Toorak.JPG|thumb|[[SUV]]s line a residential street in Toorak]]\n\nThe most popular form of transport in Toorak is the [[automobile]]. [[CityLink]] runs along north eastern Toorak, though there are no [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]] within the suburb, although there is access to the freeway via [[MacRobertson Bridge]] and interchanges at [[Burnley, Victoria|Burnley]]. Main arterials running north\u2013south are Williams Road (at the eastern boundary), Grange Road, Orrong Road, St Georges Road and Kooyong Road. The east\u2013west arterials include Alexandra Avenue (at the northern boundary), Toorak Road (which runs midway through the suburb) and Malvern Road (at the southern boundary). Alexandra Avenue becomes St Georges Road and both along with Grange Road feed onto the MacRobertson Bridge, Toorak's main river crossing. Toorak's road planning is an example of [[street hierarchy]]. As a result, there are numerous quiet pedestrian streets. However, traffic congestion is an increasing problem along Toorak Road and Williams Roads. There is limited street parking along the main roads with just a couple of [[multi-storey car park]]s and [[parking lot]]s within proximity of the main Toorak Road shopping strip. There are no [[level crossing]]s in Toorak. There is a perception in popular culture of the luxury [[Sport utility vehicle|4WD]] as a [[status symbol]], (controversial for their comfort rather than for their [[off-road]] abilities)<ref>{{cite news |last=Hale |first=Elini |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/most-drivers-want-a-city-4wd-ban/story-e6frf7kx-1111118418990 |title=Most drivers want a city 4WD ban |newspaper=Herald Sun |date=28 December 2008}}</ref> and this has been associated with the suburb of Toorak, such that in popular Australian culture, the term 'Toorak Tractor' has  become well established in [[Australian slang]]. An example of this was an episode of the popular program ''[[Top Gear Australia]]'', aired on [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS TV]], in which the presenters, [[tongue-in-cheek]], drove a $200,000 [[tractor]] along Toorak Road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themotorreport.com.au/9220/top-gear-australias-take-on-the-toorak-tractor |title=Top Gear Australia's Take On The Toorak Tractor |first=Mike |last=Stevens |website=The Motor Report |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nToorak's only railway station is [[Heyington railway station|Heyington]], on the [[Glen Waverley railway line|Glen Waverley line]], which crosses the Yarra from [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] on the Heyington Railway Bridge, to the suburb's north. Despite its name, [[Toorak railway station]] is located in Armadale. The [[Pakenham railway line|Pakenham]], [[Frankston railway line|Frankston]] and [[Cranbourne railway line]] group to which this station belongs runs close to Toorak's southern boundary. Other nearby stations include [[Hawksburn railway station|Hawksburn]], in South Yarra and [[Kooyong railway station|Kooyong]], in Kooyong.\n\nTrams have run down Toorak Road since 1888. [[Melbourne tram route 58|Route 58]] runs along Toorak Road to Glenferrie Road, at the suburb's eastern boundary. [[Melbourne tram route 72|Route 72]] runs along Malvern Road, the suburb's southern boundary.\n\nCycling facilities are poor, with few marked on road lanes. MacRobertson Bridge and [[Gardiners Creek]] pedestrian bridge, however, the bridge provides pedestrians access to the [[Main Yarra Trail]] and [[segregated bicycle facilities|shared bicycle and pedestrian paths]] in nearby Burnley.

The Blanchards helped paddle her back to shore, then Alana's father fashioned a [[tourniquet]] out of a rash guard and wrapped it around the stump of her arm. She was rushed to [[Wilcox Health|Wilcox Memorial Hospital]]. By the time she arrived there she had lost over 60% of her blood and was in [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]]. A doctor living in a hotel nearby raced to the rescue. Her father, who was scheduled to have knee surgery that same morning, was already there, but she took his place in the operating room. During subsequent media interviews, she confirmed that she felt normal when she was bitten and did not feel much pain from the bite at the moment of the disaster, but felt numb on the way to the hospital.\n[[file:Bethany Hamilton 20070311.jpg|thumb|Hamilton surfing in March 2007]]\n\nWhen the news broke out of the shark attack, a family of fishermen led by Ralph Young presented to investigators photos of a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} tiger shark they had caught and killed about one mile from the attack site. It had surfboard debris in its mouth. When measurements of its mouth were compared with those of Hamilton's broken board, it matched. In late 2004, the police officially confirmed that it was the same one that had attacked her.\n\nDespite the trauma of the incident, Hamilton was determined to return to surfing.<ref name=\"home-school1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.home-school.com/Articles/soul-surfer.php|title=Homeschool World - Articles - Soul Survivor: The Bethany Hamilton Story - Practical Homeschooling Magazine|publisher=Home-school.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> One month after the attack, she returned to her board.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Mark |title=Soul Surfer Interview With Bethany Hamilton! |url=http://whatculture.com/film/soul-surfer-interview-with-bethany-hamilton.php |work=WhatCulture! |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |date=September 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204455/http://whatculture.com/film/soul-surfer-interview-with-bethany-hamilton.php |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nInitially, she adopted a custom-made board that was longer and slightly thicker than standard and had a handle for her right arm, making it easier to paddle, and she learned to kick more to make up for the loss of her left arm.

The Blanchards helped paddle her back to shore, then Alana's father fashioned a [[tourniquet]] out of a rash guard and wrapped it around the stump of her arm. She was rushed to [[Wilcox Health|Wilcox Memorial Hospital]]. By the time she arrived there she had lost over 60% of her blood and was in [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]]. A doctor living in a hotel nearby raced to the rescue. Her father, who was scheduled to have knee surgery that same morning, was already there, but she took his place in the operating room. During subsequent media interviews, she confirmed that she felt normal when she was bitten and did not feel much pain from the bite at the moment of the disaster, but felt numb on the way to the hospital.\n[[file:Bethany Hamilton 20070311.jpg|thumb|Hamilton surfing in March 2007]]\n\nWhen the news broke out of the shark attack, a family of fishermen led by Ralph Young presented to investigators photos of a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} tiger shark they had caught and killed about one mile from the attack site. It had surfboard debris in its mouth. When measurements of its mouth were compared with those of Hamilton's broken board, it matched.
