The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms.

{"title_page": "Taxicab number", "text_new": "[[File:Srinivasa Ramanujan - OPC - 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In an anecdote by [[G. H. Hardy]], a sick [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (''picture'') developed the idea of taxicab numbers.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the ''n''th '''taxicab number''', typically denoted Ta(''n'') or Taxicab(''n''), also called the ''n''th '''Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number''', is defined as the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two ''positive'' [[Cube (algebra)|integer cubes]] in ''n'' distinct ways. The most famous taxicab number is [[1729 (number)|1729]] = Ta(2) = 1<sup>3</sup> + 12<sup>3</sup> = 9<sup>3</sup> + 10<sup>3</sup>.\n\nThe name is derived from a conversation in about 1919 involving [[mathematician]]s [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. As told by Hardy:\n\n{{quote|I remember once going to see him [Ramanujan] when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi-cab No. [[1729 (number)|1729]], and remarked that the number seemed to be rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. \"No,\" he replied, \"it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two [positive] cubes in two different ways.\"<ref>[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Quotations/Hardy.html Quotations by G. H. Hardy, MacTutor History of Mathematics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716185939/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Quotations/Hardy.html |date=2012-07-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Silverman, Joseph H.|authorlink=Joseph H.

This particular example of 1729 was made famous in the early 20th century by a story involving [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. In 1938, [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[E. M. Wright]] proved that such numbers exist for all positive [[integer]]s ''n'', and their proof is easily converted into a program to generate such numbers. However, the proof makes no claims at all about whether the thus-generated numbers are ''the smallest possible'' and thus it cannot be used to find the actual value of Ta(''n'').\n\nThe taxicab numbers subsequent to 1729 were found with the help of computers. [[John Leech (mathematician)|John Leech]] obtained Ta(3) in 1957. E. Rosenstiel, J. A. Dardis and C. R. Rosenstiel found Ta(4) in 1989.<ref>Numbers Count column, Personal Computer World, page 234, November 1989</ref> J. A. Dardis found Ta(5) in 1994 and it was confirmed by David W. Wilson in 1999.<ref>Numbers Count column of Personal Computer World, page 610, Feb 1995</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050215201136/http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/wilson10.html \"The Fifth Taxicab Number is 48988659276962496\" by David W.

The concept of a [[cabtaxi number]] has been introduced to allow for alternative, less restrictive definitions of this nature.  In a sense, the specification of two summands and powers of three is also restrictive; a [[generalized taxicab number]] allows for these values to be other than two and three, respectively.\n\n==Known

H. Hardy]], a sick [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (''picture'') developed the idea of taxicab numbers.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the ''n''th '''taxicab number''', typically denoted Ta(''n'') or Taxicab(''n''), also called the ''n''th '''Hardy\u2013Ramanujan number''', is defined as the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two ''positive'' [[Cube (algebra)|integer cubes]] in ''n'' distinct ways. The most famous taxicab number is [[1729 (number)|1729]] = Ta(2) = 1<sup>3</sup> + 12<sup>3</sup> = 9<sup>3</sup> + 10<sup>3</sup>.\n\nThe name is derived from a conversation in about 1919 involving [[mathematician]]s [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. As told by Hardy:\n\n{{quote|I remember once going to see him [Ramanujan] when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi-cab No. [[1729 (number)|1729]], and remarked that the number seemed to be rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. \"No,\" he replied, \"it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two [positive] cubes in two different ways.\"<ref>[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Quotations/Hardy.html Quotations by G.

This particular example of 1729 was made famous in the early 20th century by a story involving [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. In 1938, [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[E. M. Wright]] proved that such numbers exist for all positive [[integer]]s ''n'', and their proof is easily converted into a program to generate such numbers. However, the proof makes no claims at all about whether the thus-generated numbers are ''the smallest possible'' and thus it cannot be used to find the actual value of Ta(''n'').\n\nThe taxicab numbers subsequent to 1729 were found with the help of computers. [[John Leech (mathematician)|John Leech]] obtained Ta(3) in 1957. E. Rosenstiel, J. A. Dardis and C. R. Rosenstiel found Ta(4) in 1989.<ref>Numbers Count column, Personal Computer World, page 234, November 1989</ref> J. A. Dardis found Ta(5) in 1994 and it was confirmed by David W.

The concept of a [[cabtaxi number]] has been introduced to allow for alternative, less restrictive definitions of this nature.  In a sense, the specification of two summands and powers of three is also restrictive; a [[generalized taxicab number]] allows for these values to be other than two and three, respectively.\n\n==Known

The first wave occurred directly after the revolution, followed by the [[Freedom Flights]] from 1965 to 1973. This was followed by the 1980 [[Mariel boatlift]] and after 1994 the flight of [[balseros (rafters)|balseros]] emigrating by raft.<ref name=NorthAmerica>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Powell |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VNCX6UsdZYkC&pg=PA68&dq=%22cubans+are+usually+considered+to+be+the+most+successful%22#v=onepage&q=%22cubans%20are%20usually%20considered%20to%20be%20the%20most%20successful%22&f=false|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of North American Immigration|pages=68\u201371|title=Cuban immigration |publisher=Facts on File |date=2005 |accessdate=30 November 2016|isbn=9781438110127 }}</ref>\n\n==History  ==\nThe majority of the 1,172,899 current Cuban exiles living in the United States live in [[Florida]] (917,033 in 2014), mainly in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], where more than a third of the population is Cuban. Other exiles have relocated to form substantial Cuban communities in [[New York City]] (16,416), [[Louisville, KY]] (6,662), [[Houston, TX]] (6,233), [[Los Angeles]] (6,056), [[Union City, NJ]] (4,970) and others.<ref name=\"statistical atlas\">{{cite web|url=http://statisticalatlas.com/United-States/Ancestry|website=statistical atlas|title=Ancestry|accessdate=2016-03-22}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Revolution exile and Bay of Pigs Invasion===\n{{Main|Golden exile}}\n{{See also|Aftermath of the Cuban Revolution|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}\nBefore the post-revolution exile around 50,000 [[Cuban Americans]] already resided in the United States. Immediately after the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] around 200,000 Cubans came to South Florida. Of these emigrants many were collaborators in the recently toppled [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] regime, of the middle or upper class, and of European descent. Many emigrants believed their exile was temporary since [[Fidel Castro]] would soon be toppled. Travel between the United States and Cuba was not heavily restricted even in the wake of the recent revolution. In 1960 [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] established the Cuban Refugee Emergency Center which offered public services to Cuban emigrants. Many immigration restrictions were specifically waived for Cubans entering the United States.<ref name=NorthAmerica></ref>\n\nMany of these original Cuban exiles were involved in the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] which failed to topple [[Fidel Castro]]. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 the Cuban government would restrict air traffic to the island, ending the first major wave of emigration.<ref name=NorthAmerica></ref>\n\n===Operation Peter Pans===\n{{Main|Operation Peter Pan}}\nTo destabilize the communist dictatorship, the CIA and [[Cuban dissident movement|Cubans dissidents]] began warning of a project by the castrist government, to remove the parents' custody of their children to indoctrinate them. This indeed happened later with the \"Escuelas al Campo\" project. Cuban children were separated from their parents and sent to labor camps known as IPUEC (Instituto Preuniversitario en el Campo), to be indoctrinated in Marxist ideals. Between November 1960 and October 1962, over 14,000 children were sent to the U.S. by their parents in [[Operation Peter Pan]]. These children were taken under the care of the Catholic Church and placed in foster homes throughout the U.S until they could be reunited with their parents. Their parents sent them into the U.S in order to keep them from communist indoctrination, with many boys being sent to avoid getting drafted into the [[Cuban armed forces]], and girls being put into the greatly politized [[Cuban Literacy Campaign|Alphabetization Campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/ancien-espion-cia-cuba-raconte-sa-vie-echecs-477961.html|title=Un ancien espion de la CIA \u00e0 Cuba raconte sa vie \"d'\u00e9checs\" - Outre-mer la 1\u00e8re|author=|date=|website=francetvinfo.fr}}</ref>\n\n===Camarioca boatlift===\nOn September 28, 1965, Fidel Castro announced that Cubans wishing to emigrate could do so beginning 10 October from the Cuban port of [[Camarioca]]. The administration of U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] tried to control the numbers it would admit to the U.S. and set some parameters for their qualifications, preferring those claiming political persecution and those with family members in the U.S. In negotiations with the Cuban government it set a target of 3,000 to 4,000 people to be transported by air. Despite those diplomatic discussions, [[Cuban Americans]] brought small leisure boats from the United States to Camarioca. In the resulting Camarioca boatlift, about 160 boats transported about 5,000 refugees to Key West for immigration processing by U.S. officials. The Johnson administration made only modest efforts to enforce restrictions on this boat traffic. Castro closed the port with little notice on November 15, stranding thousands. On November 6, the Cuban and U.S. governments agreed on the details on an emigration airlift based on family reunification and without reference to those the U.S. characterized as political prisoners and whom the Cubans termed counter-revolutionaries. To deal with the crowds at Camarioca, the U.S. added a maritime component to the airborne evacuation. Both forms of transport started operating on December 1.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engstrom|first1=David Wells|title=Presidential Decision Making Adrift: The Carter Administration and the Mariel Boatlift|year=1997|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=24ff|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JLhWkTUg5r0C&pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2016|isbn=9780847684144}}</ref><ref>\"Cuban Americans\", by Thomas D.

This is mainly due to Castro's restriction not allowing skilled laborers to leave the country.<ref name=NorthAmerica></ref>\n\n===Mariel boatlift===\n{{Main article|Mariel boatlift}}\n[[Image:Mariel Refugees.jpg|thumb|250px|Cuban refugees arriving in crowded boats during the Mariel boatlift crisis]]\nBetween April 26 and October 1, 1980, during the Carter administration, probably one of the most significant waves of exiles occurred during what became known as the [[Mariel Boatlift]]. The mass ''boatlift'' occurred after a number of Cubans drove a bus through the gates of the Havana Peruvian Embassy and requested asylum. One embassy guard died as a result of [[friendly fire]] when another guard machine gunned the incoming bus and hit the first one accidentally. When the Peruvian ambassador refused to return the exiled citizens to the authorities, Castro removed the Cuban guards from the embassy, basically opening the door to the 4,000 plus asylum seekers that came into the embassy within the next few days. Reacting to this sudden exodus, Castro stated, \"Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can do so\" and declared that those who were leaving the country were the \"escoria\" (scum).\n\nThis resulted in an even larger exodus through the port of [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]], where an improvised flotilla of Cuban exiles from Miami in small pleasure boats and commercial shrimping vessels brought Cuban citizens who wished to leave the island. Within weeks, 125,000 Cubans reached the United States despite [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] attempts to prevent boats from leaving U.S. waters for Cuba. As the exodus became international news and an embarrassment for the Cuban government, Castro emptied his hospitals and had prison inmates rounded up as \"social undesirables\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/e_exiles.html |title=American Experience &#124; Fidel Castro &#124; People & Events |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate= 18 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last= Cockburn |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/criminals-in-exodus-from-cuba-us-fears-castro-emptying-his-jails--into-florida-1386288.html |title=Criminals 'in exodus from Cuba': US fears Castro emptying his jails - into Florida |publisher=The Independent |date= 28 August 1994 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref> and included them among the other refugees. The Cuban Communist Party staged meetings at the homes of those known to be leaving the country.{{According to whom|date=October 2015}} People were intimidated by these \"repudiation meetings\" (mitines de repudio), where the participants screamed obscenities and defiled the facades of the homes, throwing eggs and garbage, for hours. Labeled as \"traitors to the revolution\" those who declared their wish to leave became the targeted victims of the attacks, their rationing cards were taken from them, their jobs were terminated, or they were expelled from schools or universities. Towards the end of the crisis, the repudiation meetings were ended. The scale of the exodus created political difficulties for the Cuban government, and an agreement was reached to end the boatlift after several months. Out of more than 125,000 refugees, a number from as low as 7,500 to as high as 40,000 were believed to have criminal records in Cuba, though many of their crimes would not qualify as crimes under U.S. law. Some 1,774 of the refugees were classified as serious or violent criminals under U.S. law and denied citizenship on that basis. The majority of refugees were young adult males, 20 to 34 years of age, from the working class: skilled craftsmen, semi-skilled tradesmen, and unskilled laborers. In 1984, the United States and Cuba negotiated an agreement to resume normal immigration and to return to Cuba those persons who had arrived during the boatlift who were \"excludable\" under U.S. law.\n\n===Balseros===\n{{Main|Balseros (rafters)}} {{Further|1994 Cuban rafter crisis|Wet feet, dry feet policy}}\nDuring the past years, exile waves have consisted of ''[[balseros (rafters)|balseros]]'', who travel in homemade rafts. On 18 August 1994, U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] said in a press release:<ref>{{cite web|title=Attorney General's Statement on Cuban Influx|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/Pre_96/August94/474.txt.html|website=[[United States Department of Justice]]|accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|To divert the Cuban people from seeking democratic change, the government of Cuba has resorted to an unconscionable tactic of letting people risk their lives by leaving in flimsy vessels through the treacherous waters of the Florida Straits. Many people have lost their lives in such crossings. We urge the people of Cuba to remain home and not to fall for this callous maneuver. I want to work with all concerned including the Cuban American community to make sure the message goes out to Cubans that putting a boat or raft to sea means putting life and limb at risk... To prevent this from happening again, the Coast Guard has mounted an aggressive public information campaign so people know that vessels... may be stopped and boarded and may be seized. Individuals who violate U.S. law will be prosecuted in appropriate circumstances.}}\n\nPresident Clinton, trying to stem the flow of Cuban rafters, pressed a dozen Latin American governments to provide internment camps that officials hoped would prove more attractive to refugees than the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Although the refugees at Guantanamo were held behind barbed wire, to many, the base was less forbidding than a foreign internment camp.\n\nAs a result of bilateral migration accords between the two governments, in September 1994 and May 1995, the status quo of U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants was altered significantly. The U.S. granted Cuba an annual minimum of 20,000 legal immigrant visas and, at the same time, determined that Cubans picked up at sea would be sent home just as any other group of illegal immigrants. President Clinton's agreement with Cuba resolved the dilemma of the approximately 33,000 Cubans then at Guantanamo. This new agreement had two new points. The United States agreed to take most of the Cubans detained at Guantanamo through the humanitarian parole provision. Cuba agreed to credit some of these admissions toward the minimum quota of 20,000 migrants from Cuba, with 5,000 charged annually over the years. Secondly, rather than placing Cubans intercepted at sea in a camp, the United States began sending them back to Cuba. Both governments promised to follow international agreements to ensure that no action would be taken against the people returned to Cuba.\n\nAs a result of these migration agreements and interdiction policy, a \"wet foot/dry foot\" practice toward Cuban immigrants has developed. Those who do not reach dry land are returned to Cuba unless they fear persecution there, but only those who meet the definition of asylum refugee are accepted for eventual resettlement in a third country. Those Cuban rafters who do reach land are inspected by [[Department of Homeland Security]] and usually are allowed to stay in the United States. From May 1995 through July 2003, about 170 Cuban refugees were resettled in eleven different countries, including Spain, Venezuela, Australia, and Nicaragua. Since March 2003  the State Department has not been allowed to monitor the treatment of the immigrants returned to Cuba. The wet foot/dry foot was abruptly ended by [[President Obama]] days before he ended his second term in 2017,<ref>{{cite web|first = Alan |last =Gomez|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/12/obama-ends-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy-cubans/96505172/|title=Obama ends 'wet foot, dry foot' policy for Cubans|date=12 January 2017|website=usatoday.com}}</ref> which sparked controversy for the Cuban Exile community <ref>NPR, \"Cuban-Americans React To Obama Ending Longstanding 'Wet Foot, Dry Foot' Policy\" [https://www.npr.org/2017/01/13/509722747/cuban-americans-react-to-obama-ending-longstanding-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy]</ref>\n\n===Cuban Thaw and aftermath===\n{{Main|Cuban Thaw}}\nPresident [[Barack Obama]] announced he would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2014.

He also states that as the Cuban exile progressed since 1959 more and more economically disenfranchised Cubans became part of the emigrant waves.

The acceptance of Cuban emigrants during the [[Freedom Flights]] was done in hopes of weakening the Cuban economy by draining it of workers. The United States also was generally able to paint a negative picture of Cuba by participating in the mass emigration of many who disliked Cuba and wished to flee the island. The [[Department of State]] painted Cuban emigrants in the 1960s as freedom seeking refugees. By the [[Mariel boatlift]] the United States had lost its total aggressive foreign policy towards Cuba and instead viewed the island as a nuisance rather than a security threat. The [[Mariel boatlift]] was soon canceled after it was initiated and received little public American support. Fidel Castro benefited from the exile because he was able to remove disloyalty by directly removing disloyal citizens from Cuba.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scanlan|first1=John|last2=Loescher|first2=John|title=U.

Immediately after the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] around 200,000 Cubans came to South Florida. Of these emigrants many were collaborators in the recently toppled [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] regime, of the middle or upper class, and of European descent. Many emigrants believed their exile was temporary since [[Fidel Castro]] would soon be toppled. Travel between the United States and Cuba was not heavily restricted even in the wake of the recent revolution. In 1960 [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] established the Cuban Refugee Emergency Center which offered public services to Cuban emigrants. Many immigration restrictions were specifically waived for Cubans entering the United States.<ref name=NorthAmerica></ref>\n\nMany of these original Cuban exiles were involved in the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] which failed to topple [[Fidel Castro]]. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 the Cuban government would restrict air traffic to the island, ending the first major wave of emigration.<ref name=NorthAmerica></ref>\n\n===Operation Peter Pans===\n{{Main|Operation Peter Pan}}\nTo destabilize the communist dictatorship, the CIA and [[Cuban dissident movement|Cubans dissidents]] began warning of a project by the castrist government, to remove the parents' custody of their children to indoctrinate them. This indeed happened later with the \"Escuelas al Campo\" project. Cuban children were separated from their parents and sent to labor camps known as IPUEC (Instituto Preuniversitario en el Campo), to be indoctrinated in Marxist ideals. Between November 1960 and October 1962, over 14,000 children were sent to the U.S. by their parents in [[Operation Peter Pan]]. These children were taken under the care of the Catholic Church and placed in foster homes throughout the U.S until they could be reunited with their parents. Their parents sent them into the U.S in order to keep them from communist indoctrination, with many boys being sent to avoid getting drafted into the [[Cuban armed forces]], and girls being put into the greatly politized [[Cuban Literacy Campaign|Alphabetization Campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/ancien-espion-cia-cuba-raconte-sa-vie-echecs-477961.html|title=Un ancien espion de la CIA \u00e0 Cuba raconte sa vie \"d'\u00e9checs\" - Outre-mer la 1\u00e8re|author=|date=|website=francetvinfo.fr}}</ref>\n\n===Camarioca boatlift===\nOn September 28, 1965, Fidel Castro announced that Cubans wishing to emigrate could do so beginning 10 October from the Cuban port of [[Camarioca]]. The administration of U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] tried to control the numbers it would admit to the U.S. and set some parameters for their qualifications, preferring those claiming political persecution and those with family members in the U.S. In negotiations with the Cuban government it set a target of 3,000 to 4,000 people to be transported by air. Despite those diplomatic discussions, [[Cuban Americans]] brought small leisure boats from the United States to Camarioca. In the resulting Camarioca boatlift, about 160 boats transported about 5,000 refugees to Key West for immigration processing by U.S. officials. The Johnson administration made only modest efforts to enforce restrictions on this boat traffic. Castro closed the port with little notice on November 15, stranding thousands. On November 6, the Cuban and U.S. governments agreed on the details on an emigration airlift based on family reunification and without reference to those the U.S. characterized as political prisoners and whom the Cubans termed counter-revolutionaries. To deal with the crowds at Camarioca, the U.S. added a maritime component to the airborne evacuation. Both forms of transport started operating on December 1.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engstrom|first1=David Wells|title=Presidential Decision Making Adrift: The Carter Administration and the Mariel Boatlift|year=1997|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=24ff|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JLhWkTUg5r0C&pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2016|isbn=9780847684144}}</ref><ref>\"Cuban Americans\", by Thomas D.

The mass ''boatlift'' occurred after a number of Cubans drove a bus through the gates of the Havana Peruvian Embassy and requested asylum. One embassy guard died as a result of [[friendly fire]] when another guard machine gunned the incoming bus and hit the first one accidentally. When the Peruvian ambassador refused to return the exiled citizens to the authorities, Castro removed the Cuban guards from the embassy, basically opening the door to the 4,000 plus asylum seekers that came into the embassy within the next few days. Reacting to this sudden exodus, Castro stated, \"Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can do so\" and declared that those who were leaving the country were the \"escoria\" (scum).\n\nThis resulted in an even larger exodus through the port of [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]], where an improvised flotilla of Cuban exiles from Miami in small pleasure boats and commercial shrimping vessels brought Cuban citizens who wished to leave the island. Within weeks, 125,000 Cubans reached the United States despite [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] attempts to prevent boats from leaving U.S. waters for Cuba. As the exodus became international news and an embarrassment for the Cuban government, Castro emptied his hospitals and had prison inmates rounded up as \"social undesirables\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/e_exiles.html |title=American Experience &#124; Fidel Castro &#124; People & Events |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate= 18 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last= Cockburn |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/criminals-in-exodus-from-cuba-us-fears-castro-emptying-his-jails--into-florida-1386288.html |title=Criminals 'in exodus from Cuba': US fears Castro emptying his jails - into Florida |publisher=The Independent |date= 28 August 1994 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref> and included them among the other refugees. The Cuban Communist Party staged meetings at the homes of those known to be leaving the country.{{According to whom|date=October 2015}} People were intimidated by these \"repudiation meetings\" (mitines de repudio), where the participants screamed obscenities and defiled the facades of the homes, throwing eggs and garbage, for hours. Labeled as \"traitors to the revolution\" those who declared their wish to leave became the targeted victims of the attacks, their rationing cards were taken from them, their jobs were terminated, or they were expelled from schools or universities. Towards the end of the crisis, the repudiation meetings were ended. The scale of the exodus created political difficulties for the Cuban government, and an agreement was reached to end the boatlift after several months. Out of more than 125,000 refugees, a number from as low as 7,500 to as high as 40,000 were believed to have criminal records in Cuba, though many of their crimes would not qualify as crimes under U.S. law. Some 1,774 of the refugees were classified as serious or violent criminals under U.S. law and denied citizenship on that basis. The majority of refugees were young adult males, 20 to 34 years of age, from the working class: skilled craftsmen, semi-skilled tradesmen, and unskilled laborers. In 1984, the United States and Cuba negotiated an agreement to resume normal immigration and to return to Cuba those persons who had arrived during the boatlift who were \"excludable\" under U.S. law.\n\n===Balseros===\n{{Main|Balseros (rafters)}} {{Further|1994 Cuban rafter crisis|Wet feet, dry feet policy}}\nDuring the past years, exile waves have consisted of ''[[balseros (rafters)|balseros]]'', who travel in homemade rafts. On 18 August 1994, U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] said in a press release:<ref>{{cite web|title=Attorney General's Statement on Cuban Influx|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/Pre_96/August94/474.txt.html|website=[[United States Department of Justice]]|accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|To divert the Cuban people from seeking democratic change, the government of Cuba has resorted to an unconscionable tactic of letting people risk their lives by leaving in flimsy vessels through the treacherous waters of the Florida Straits. Many people have lost their lives in such crossings. We urge the people of Cuba to remain home and not to fall for this callous maneuver. I want to work with all concerned including the Cuban American community to make sure the message goes out to Cubans that putting a boat or raft to sea means putting life and limb at risk... To prevent this from happening again, the Coast Guard has mounted an aggressive public information campaign so people know that vessels... may be stopped and boarded and may be seized. Individuals who violate U.S. law will be prosecuted in appropriate circumstances.}}\n\nPresident Clinton, trying to stem the flow of Cuban rafters, pressed a dozen Latin American governments to provide internment camps that officials hoped would prove more attractive to refugees than the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Although the refugees at Guantanamo were held behind barbed wire, to many, the base was less forbidding than a foreign internment camp.\n\nAs a result of bilateral migration accords between the two governments, in September 1994 and May 1995, the status quo of U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants was altered significantly. The U.S. granted Cuba an annual minimum of 20,000 legal immigrant visas and, at the same time, determined that Cubans picked up at sea would be sent home just as any other group of illegal immigrants. President Clinton's agreement with Cuba resolved the dilemma of the approximately 33,000 Cubans then at Guantanamo. This new agreement had two new points. The United States agreed to take most of the Cubans detained at Guantanamo through the humanitarian parole provision. Cuba agreed to credit some of these admissions toward the minimum quota of 20,000 migrants from Cuba, with 5,000 charged annually over the years. Secondly, rather than placing Cubans intercepted at sea in a camp, the United States began sending them back to Cuba. Both governments promised to follow international agreements to ensure that no action would be taken against the people returned to Cuba.\n\nAs a result of these migration agreements and interdiction policy, a \"wet foot/dry foot\" practice toward Cuban immigrants has developed. Those who do not reach dry land are returned to Cuba unless they fear persecution there, but only those who meet the definition of asylum refugee are accepted for eventual resettlement in a third country. Those Cuban rafters who do reach land are inspected by [[Department of Homeland Security]] and usually are allowed to stay in the United States. From May 1995 through July 2003, about 170 Cuban refugees were resettled in eleven different countries, including Spain, Venezuela, Australia, and Nicaragua. Since March 2003  the State Department has not been allowed to monitor the treatment of the immigrants returned to Cuba. The wet foot/dry foot was abruptly ended by [[President Obama]] days before he ended his second term in 2017,<ref>{{cite web|first = Alan |last =Gomez|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/12/obama-ends-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy-cubans/96505172/|title=Obama ends 'wet foot, dry foot' policy for Cubans|date=12 January 2017|website=usatoday.com}}</ref> which sparked controversy for the Cuban Exile community <ref>NPR, \"Cuban-Americans React To Obama Ending Longstanding 'Wet Foot, Dry Foot' Policy\" [https://www.npr.org/2017/01/13/509722747/cuban-americans-react-to-obama-ending-longstanding-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy]</ref>\n\n===Cuban Thaw and aftermath===\n{{Main|Cuban Thaw}}\nPresident [[Barack Obama]] announced he would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2014.

He states that many Cuban exiles face cultural and economic challenges resettling in the United States similar to many other American immigrant communities. He also states that as the Cuban exile progressed since 1959 more and more economically disenfranchised Cubans became part of the emigrant waves. These lower class Cuban exiles became noticeable in the [[Freedom Flights]] and especially so in the [[Mariel boatlift]] and [[Balseros (rafters)|balseros]] afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/plc/464|title=Cuban communities in the United States: migration waves, settlement patterns and socioeconomic diversity|author=Jorge Duany|date=1999|website=journals.openedition.org}}</ref>\n\nMaria Torres wrote in the Chicago Tribune that contrary to the Golden exile myth Cubans are not entirely racially white but from various racial backgrounds and at the time the article was written in 1986, Cuban American families statistically earned less money than the average white family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-11-15-8603250989-story.html|title=CUBAN EXILES ARE NOT A BIT GOLDEN|author=Maria Torres|date=1986|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Political motives ===\nAccording to authors John Scanlan and Gilburt Loescher, United States acceptance of Cuban emigrants after the 1959 Cuban Revolution was done in hopes they could help the United States forcibly remove the Fidel Castro government from Cuba. The acceptance of Cuban emigrants during the [[Freedom Flights]] was done in hopes of weakening the Cuban economy by draining it of workers. The United States also was generally able to paint a negative picture of Cuba by participating in the mass emigration of many who disliked Cuba and wished to flee the island. The [[Department of State]] painted Cuban emigrants in the 1960s as freedom seeking refugees. By the [[Mariel boatlift]] the United States had lost its total aggressive foreign policy towards Cuba and instead viewed the island as a nuisance rather than a security threat. The [[Mariel boatlift]] was soon canceled after it was initiated and received little public American support. Fidel Castro benefited from the exile because he was able to remove disloyalty by directly removing disloyal citizens from Cuba.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scanlan|first1=John|last2=Loescher|first2=John|title=U.

Critics also panned the film for portraying the Dinobots as mindless robots devoid of their personalities and reducing them to a [[deus ex machina]] appearing late in the film despite being a focal point in the film's marketing. Critics noted Nicola Peltz's character as a sexualized underage girl and damsel-in-distress with no sense of agency whose sole purpose in the story is to have the male leads fight over her. Her character's relationship with Jack Reynor's also drew backlash as critics accused the film of treating statutory rape as a joke and attempting to defend it with the [[Romeo and Juliet law]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/transformers-age-of-extinction-review-think-rape-culture-is-a-myth-think-again-1.1860595|title=Transformers: Age of Extinction review: Think rape culture is a myth?

As of 2017, nearly 25% of the population of the five metropolitan capitals (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide) were listening to DAB+ radio each week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://communications.gov.au/publications/digital-radio-report|title=Australian Government report on Digital Radio|access-date=1 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302090019/https://www.communications.gov.au/publications/digital-radio-report|archive-date=2 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over 3 million digital radios have been sold with listeners being able to receive over 380 DAB+ devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/australia|title=WorldDAB Country Report - Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Austria==\nDigital Radio Austria (Verein Digitalradio \u00d6sterreich) will apply for a DAB+ trial license. Two transmitters will operate as a single frequency network, with one transmitting a 10&nbsp;kW signal. This test mode is scheduled to last a year, with the possibility of an extension in to 2015. The twelve radio stations which will take part in the trial are being selected. Unlike earlier trials, consumers will receive more information on this new way of radio consumption and there will be a large volume of digital radios available in consumer electronic shops.\n\nAustria is committed to a digital radio future and a report by the regulators, the Austrian Communications Authority (KommAustria) and RTR-GmbH recommended DAB+ in Band III as the way forward. As planned, KommAustria completed a call for interest regarding DAB+ in August 2012. KommAustria intended to launch DAB+ by an open call for tender regarding the DAB+ network if enough parties showed believable and sustainable interest. A minimum limit of 12 possible programs (to fill one MUX coverage) was set. Unfortunately this limit was not reached as too few parties showed interest or failed to meet the criteria of the call for interest. Most remarkably, the public broadcaster ORF and the bigger players in the Austrian market did not show interest but strongly voiced their opposition against the launch of DAB+ in Austria. However, there is a group of broadcasters who are very outspoken in favour of DAB+, but the majority of radio stations remain unsure. The public broadcaster ORF has renewed its objection to any DAB+ plans. In the upcoming \"Digitalisation Concept\" which marks the authority's official strategy and schedule for the digitalisation of broadcasting, KommAustria plans to elaborate on the technical details of a possible DAB+ network. There will be no further calls for interest but the possibility for a call for tender upon request. Nevertheless, a working group that was created in 2009 to consider the countries digital future is still at work. Its members are stakeholders from the Austrian radio market who represent opponents and proponents of digital radio. It consists of the regulatory authority, the public broadcaster ORF, the commercial and non-commercial broadcasters associations, the electronic industry and consumer associations. The group is constantly watching and evaluating the progress of digital radio in other European countries. The success of digital radio in Germany will affect whether Austria decides to implement DAB+.\n\nThe Austrian Association of the Electrical and Electronic Industry (FEEI), and Austrian radio stations such as Radio Arabella and LoungeFM have founded the digital radio club, Digital Radio Austria. The aim of the new organisation is the promotion and development of digital radio in Austria, developing the media category \"Radio\" in the digital media world, the establishment of radio on new platforms and to promote the provision of information and support for education and training in the field of electronic and new media.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/austria|title=Austria &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Belgium==\n===French (Wallonia and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge de la Communaut\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise]] (RTBF) is the public broadcaster for the [[French Community of Belgium|Belgian French speaking community]]. Since 1998, RTBF has operated one DAB multiplex simulcasting its five FM radio stations and two [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] (the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Belgian German speaking]] public broadcaster) FM radio stations, covering of Brussels and Wallonia. On this multiplex, RTBF is also testing four DAB+ audio and data channels (indifferent bit rates and with slideshows) for itself and also for the private radio stations. The aim is to plan a roadmap for DAB+ in French speaking Belgium together with the private broadcasters, subject to approval from the French Community Government and the regulator, the [[Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Audiovisuel]] (CSA). In Spring 2011 a common vision of the main broadcasters, both private and public, was defined with a four-tier strategy for migration from analogue to digital radio (DAB+ broadcast; hybrid radio; single online radio player and radio on TV). In summer 2011 the Parliament of the French-speaking Community adopted unanimously a resolution asking the French-speaking Government to support the migration to digital radio from 2011 onwards.\n\nThe CSA (regulator) launched a public consultation about digital radio in autumn 2011 which provided positive feedback. In spring 2012, the CSA recommended to the Government a DAB+ rollout based mainly on two layers in Band III. In June 2012 the Government authorized RTBF to proceed with DAB+ trials for commercial and non-profit radio stations licensed by the CSA.\n\nThe next step is to achieve a public funding agreement to finance the investments needed for the technical DAB+ rollout, upgrade of the RTBF DAB network to DAB+ to ensure deep indoor coverage of Brussels and Wallonia, for a potential public launch in 2015 (to mark the 101st anniversary of the first radio broadcasting in Belgium). RTBF is testing Radio DNS interactive slideshows on its DAB+ channels.\n\n===Flemish (Flanders and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie]] (VRT) is the public broadcaster for the Belgian Flemish Community. VRT has one DAB multiplex in operation with eight radio stations: the 5 FM-also stations Radio 1, Radio 2, Klara, Studio Brussel and MNM and three digital-only channels: Nieuws+ (news), Klara Continuo (non-stop classic and older music) and MNM Hits (Top 40).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/aanbod/kijk-en-luister/radio-luisteren/dab-|title=DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/heb-je-een-vraag/vragen-over-dab-|title=Vragen over DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref> Norkring, which operates VRT's multiplex, also has a license for another multiplex and is wording on a DAB+ roll out. In February 2013 Norkring launched a \"call for interest\" for a DAB+ roll-out in the Northern part of Belgium. Based on the results of this call, Norkring has launched a second call to include a progressive deployment, with the Brussels DAB+ roll-out in the first phase.\n\nIn May 2016, the Flemish government announced the intent to have all nationwide Flemish radio stations broadcast exclusively in DAB+ by 2022.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio stations have until 2022 to prepare for DAB+ (in Dutch)|url=http://deredactie.be/permalink/1.2654705|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]|accessdate=13 May 2016|date=13 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe VRT was to switch from DAB to DAB+ on 17 October 2017 and to discontinue DAB service at the same time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/over-de-vrt/nieuws/2017/10/11/alle-vrt-radiozenders-op-dab--vanaf-17-oktober|title=VRT-radiozenders op DAB+ vanaf 17/10 &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be|language=nl}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2017/10/11/nieuwe-radio--kies-voor-dab-/|title=Nieuwe radio?

Nantes was already allowed until the end of the year. \nIn January 2012 it was reported by the French newspaper \u2018Les Echos\u2019 that the CSA had requested the Ministry of Industry to include DAB+ in the technical standard for France. The consultation for this closed in May 2012 and the technical decree was released 16 August 2013, including DAB+ to the list of permitted standards. At the end of 2007, France's Government announced that the official standard for digital radio in France would be DMB-A, to be marketed as Radio Num\u00e9rique Terrestre (RNT).\n\nAt the end of 2013, the French Parliament will examine an update of the 1986 law about radio and television. Then the CSA should publish a timetable for a call for applications for tenders for digital terrestrial licenses for France's next 20 biggest cities which will add up to 62% coverage. An additional tender will also allow to add DAB+ services to the 14 multiplexes in Paris, Marseille and Nice, as well as five more multiplexes in these towns.\n\nIn April 2012 the CSA re-launched a call of tender for three cities (Paris for seven multiplexes, Marseille and Nice for six multiplexes each). The four main commercial radio groups decided do not bid and the government did not allow the public service (Radio France) to pre-empt frequencies. At the beginning of October 2012 the CSA published the candidates selected for the three cities. At the beginning of 2014, six multiplexes will be on air in Paris, four in Marseille and four in Nice.\n\nRoll out of terrestrial digital radio was scheduled to start in December 2009 but was postponed amid opposition from several sources, including private radio operators. The Prime Minister commissioned a further report by David Kessler, former chief executive France Culture, which was published in mid-2011 and suggested that the conditions had not been met for the full scale deployment of digital radio in France. The report suggested a moratorium of two to three years during which time the French market would look at\nthe deployment of digital radio in the rest of Europe. The report also stated that the government approved the CSA's decision to allow further trials to continue.\n\nThe CSA is responsible for taking the findings of the Kessler report forward and in order to do this set up an \u2018Observatory\u2019 which includes all of the industry players. The publication of the Kessler report meant the market could move forward after a period of stagnation and to this end various trials were put on-air (Paris, Nantes, Marseille and Lyon).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|title=France &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220000457/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|archive-date=20 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Germany==\nBy the end of 2013 more than 120 national, regional and local programs will be broadcast in Germany. Also more than 90% of the German population can listen to at least one digital radio ensemble. This is considered to be a respectable success two years after the launch.\n\nDespite some changes in the national multiplex, the prospect for both commercial and public broadcasters is very positive as receiver sales are increasing. Furthermore, a stable ecosystem of private digital radio stations could be established in metropolitan areas such as Frankfurt, Berlin and Munich.\n\nThe current focus of broadcasters and network operators is to continue their marketing efforts in all media. For this reason the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019 was founded by the commercial broadcasters on the national multiplex (represented by DRD GmbH), the ARD group, Deutschlandradio and the network operator Media Broadcast. The goal is to coordinate the b2b and b2c marketing initiatives of all stakeholders to foster the evolution of digital radio in Germany by obtaining a reasonable market penetration by end of 2014.\n\nCoordination with the device industry is carried out via the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019, organised by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). Five working groups were created to guide all areas of digital radio development and roll out, such as receiver/devices, data and traffic services, networks or advertisements.\n\nThe initiative hired consumer electronics market professionals which significantly improved the communication with the retailers. Many stores are now equipped with in-house-coverage solutions. The German car manufacturers offer DAB+ receivers for nearly all models either as an option or line fit. Two commercial telematics service providers use data capacity on the national mux to transmit TPEG based traffic information via DAB. The impressive coverage of Germany's highways over the last two years was secured through market collaboration and support for the technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|title=Germany &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032907/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|archive-date=24 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Ghana==\nOn 14 May 2008 FonTV, Africa's first mobile phone enabled television content service, was launched via DMB.

The use of the digital radio platform has increased by 4.12% to 13% over the same period last year (January\u2013March 2012) and the use of FM has dropped by 7%.

The trials were not well received by northern Mexican radio stations, whose owners feared losing access to American audiences, as that country had already decided against DAB. While there was support for digital radio via the DAB family of standards among some Mexican broadcasters, the primary use of the L-band in Mexico is for maritime transmissions and space communications.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Cofetel|Federal Telecommunications Commission]] authorized IBOC for all stations within {{convert|320|km|mi}} of the US border.<ref>\"Mexico Authorizes Transmission of HD Radio Broadcasting\", ''Wireless News'' 27 May 2008</ref> In 2011, Cofetel allowed other stations in the country to use IBOC.\n\n==Monaco==\nA T-DMB test was carried out in VHF Band III on Channel 6A between July 2009 and September 2009. Monaco and the area around it has a transmitter, but due to some on-going technical issues, at present digital radio in Monaco is on hold.\n\nPrior to this, the principality of Monaco broadcast DAB digital radio services to 100% of its population of 32,000 people since 2005. Stations on air have included MFM, Radio Classique, Radio Monaco, Riviera Radio and RMC.

The conditions for the transition were:\n\n# Coverage (absolute condition for FM shutdown): Before 2015, the public broadcaster NRK must achieve coverage of 99.5%, the commercial broadcasters on the national network #1 are required to reach 90% of the population\n#Value added for the listeners (absolute condition for FM shutdown). There must be a value added for the listeners in going from FM to DAB, both in terms of available content and in terms of user experience.\n#Digital listening (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015 50% of the radio listeners must daily use a digital radio platform (currently this is 45%). This does not specify market share of listening, contrary to the UK requirement, only reach. \"Digital platform\" also includes listening via internet and via the digital TV network. This condition is set in order to measure the listeners' independence of the analogue FM-platform.\n#In-car solution (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015, there must be reasonably priced, well-functioning in-car adaptors on the market. In half of all Norwegian municipalities there must be an offer of in-car DAB-adaptor installation.\n\nAfter 2017, local stations, except for stations in major cities, will have the option to continue FM broadcasting. The report leaves it to the broadcasters to choose between DAB or DAB+ transmissions. By 2017, all DAB broadcasting in Norway is in DAB+ format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/norway|title=Norway &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\nThe switch-off of national FM broadcasting proved controversial and provoked a public backlash. NRK also faced a significant drop in listening figures following the switch-off.\n\n==Poland==\nAs of September 2016, Poland has one nationwide DAB+ multiplex, which consists of eight nationwide stations:\n* 4 FM-available stations ([[Polskie Radio Program I|Jedynka]], [[Polskie Radio Program II|Dw\u00f3jka]], [[Polskie Radio Program III|Tr\u00f3jka]], [[Polskie Radio 24|PR24]])\n* 3 DAB-only stations ([[Polskie Radio Program IV|Czw\u00f3rka]], Radio Dzieciom, Radio Rytm)\n* [[Polish Radio External Service|Radio Poland]] - DAB-only in Poland, but in some countries also on FM or SW.\nThe multiplex can include one or two regional stations (some of them also FM-available), but it differ between Polskie Radio regional stations. It can be received in many parts of the country thanks to twenty six transmitters, but due to very low listening figures and high costs plans for future extensions (also new stations) have been ceased and digital radio switch-off is proposed. \nThere are also two local test multiplexes in [[Siedlce]] and [[Rzesz\u00f3w]], which consist of local stations.\n\n==Portugal==\nExpansion of the DAB network awaits a decision by the Portuguese government.

Rediffusion Singapore launched its DAB service in July 2006. It was the first country in the world to introduce subscription based DAB+ digital radio service for the mass market. In April 2012, Rediffusion Singapore announced its service was under receivership and went off-air from 1 May 2012. Its branding and assets were brought over by Eduplus Holdings in June 2012.\n\nThere are no plans to turn on the DAB network in Singapore.

Test broadcasting on said frequency began on 2. September 2016 from Krvavec transmitter, shortly after that RTV Slovenia began nationwide regular transmission on 19. September 2016.\n\n==South Africa==\nThe Joint SADIBA/NAB Digital Radio DAB+ Trial Working group's application for a high\u2013powered DAB+ trial licence has been approved. The trial licence was granted to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (the applicant on behalf of the NAB radio members) by the regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). The trial will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, and Sentech will be the signal distributor for the duration of the trial.\n\nThe SADIBA/NAB Working group is encouraged by the commitment of all stakeholders in putting digital radio firmly on the South African broadcasting agenda.\n\nThe South African DAB+ trial will consist of two high power transmitting stations (10&nbsp;kW transmitter power) 100&nbsp;kW ERP situated in Johannesburg and Pretoria in the province of Gauteng. The trial will operate as a SFN in VHF band III on Channel 13F on a frequency of 239.200&nbsp;MHz. This will happen after coverage verification at transmitter powers of 2&nbsp;kW, 5&nbsp;kW, and 10&nbsp;kW. The total area covered by the trial is 21185km2 and the total gross population covered is 10 705 387 (21.5% of total SA population). It is envisaged that between 18 and 20 radio from the Public, Commercial and Community sectors will participate in the trial. The trial will allow the testing of:\nEnd-to-end technical functionality\nExtent of portable mobile coverage\nSignal permeability\nDemonstrate digital radio services and value-added services\nPerformance in the field using typical consumer equipment and professional test and measurement equipment.\nThe effects of vehicle penetration loss, building penetration loss and clutter (e.g. buildings and vegetation) on coverage.\nTesting of the various encoding methods (stereo, para stereo, mono) for different audio types and at different bit rates to get a good understanding of what bit rates/encoding to use for the different program types.\nInvestigate the delivery of PAD within these tests, synchronisation with the audio and rate of change of the images.  \nIn July 2013 over 200 radio industry representatives came together at the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) facility in Johannesburg to attend a landmark workshop on the rollout of DAB+ digital radio and to discuss plans for a high-powered DAB+ trial transmission extending from Pretoria to Johannesburg by end 2013. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), indicated that it stands ready to support broadcasting innovation in South Africa, which will be the first country to exploit opportunities for delivery of educational services via DAB+, as well as services for those with disabilities. Broadcasting radio via DAB+ will also allow ICASA to license new entrants where FM bandwidth is congested.\n\nMobileTV PTY performed technical tests of DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) and DAB+ in Gauteng from August 2011 until the end of July 2013 and plans to expand trials in South Africa. The prospective broadcaster will launch trials of DMB technology in the Free State and the Western Cape before the end of the 2013. In July 2012 they applied for a commercial license and expect to get an answer during 2013. ICASA has granted test licences for Cape and Bloemfontein, while assessing new applications for Port Eliazbeth, East London and Mpumalanga. MobileTV PTY aims to switch on the trials in Cape Town and Bloemfontein on 1 October and 1 November respectively. Their two transmitters will be relocated from Pretoria and Johannesburg Autumn 2013.\n\nMobileTV PTY ran two TV channels and one radio station on a test license. If a license is granted they would then cover 15-20 million of the 45 million people in South Africa and expand coverage in parallel to sales of devices and uptake of services. MobileTV PTY has teamed up with SABC, the public service broadcaster in South Africa. SABC reaches 76% of the population daily and is by far the biggest broadcaster and is partially financed by a TV license and partially by advertisements. MobileTV PTY is in dialogue with the Department of Education to evaluate whether the technology can be used for educational purposes, such as to reach rural schools and colleges in a cost-effective manner. The Department is primarily interested in the abilities of data transfer but an educational TV channel has not been ruled out. SABC will offer their 18 radio channels. MobileTV PTY wishes to also offer distribution for private radio stations following the launch.\n\nNo programmes are on air. Mobile TV PTY is awaiting a commercial license from the government. If licences are granted they will within the first year cover up to 50% of the population of South Africa, although they aim to increase this to between 80 and 90% within 2\u20133 years. Their plan is to broadcast 6-10 mobile TV channels and two radio stations. Additional services that combine broadcasting and the internet on the same device will be an essential part of their business model. Such services include traffic information, gambling, integration with social media and touch-screen shopping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-africa|title=South Africa &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==South Korea==\nAs the first country to commercially launch mobile TV, South Korea is the most successful DMB market in the world. More than 62 million DMB enabled devices have been sold, of which the most popular are mobile phones. This number is expected to rise even more with an increase in coverage; services already cover over 80% of the country. Hundreds of DMB devices are available in this market and usage of mobile TV increases year on year. Interactive services are also growing in popularity adding value to broadcasting services.\n\nThe Korean government has set up a digital audio project to recommend a digital audio broadcasting standard for Korea.  Following ETRI's investigation of various digital radio platforms, a major decision is expected regarding the adoption of a digital radio technology for South Korean broadcasters.\n\nKorea's latest innovation is an interactive mobile TV service, or Smart DMB, launched in May 2011 with six terrestrial-DMB operators (T-DMB). With Smart DMB, mobile TV viewers are able to search the internet, receive EPG information updates, and even enjoy \u2018TV Screen Capture and Share Service\u2019 through SNS while watching television. Moreover, hybrid DMB was launched in Aug 2013 for the high quality video service.\n\nA DAB+ trial has been on air in Seoul since December 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|title=South Korea &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710122752/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|archive-date=10 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nA total of 18 DAB audio services are on air. Population coverage is currently 20%. The Spanish DAB Association ([http://www.radiodigitaldab.com/index.htm Asociaci\u00f3n Foro de la Radio Digital]) comprising both national private and public broadcasters, is responsible for DAB/DAB+ in Spain.\n\nSpain first began broadcasting terrestrial digital radio in April 1998 covering Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. From 2002 to June 2011, 23 transmitters covered the 52% of the Spanish population through three national multiplexes (1 SFN and 2 MFN). In addition, in some Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas, DAB services were launched on additional regional multiplexes, but  they are currently switched off.\n\nThe Council of Ministers reached an agreement on Digital Radio in June 2011 and approved a Digitalisation Plan for Terrestrial Broadcasting with the following measures:\n\n#Reduction of DAB coverage from 52% to 20%, in order to facilitate a migration to DAB+\n#Flexibility for the broadcasters, in order to allow for  migration to DAB+\n#Study of a possible reassignment of the multiplexes\n#Promotional activities through the Spanish DAB Forum\n#DAB+ trials\n#A study of the necessary conditions to determine the date of  a possible analogue switch off<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/spain|title=Spain &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Sweden==\nDAB transmissions in Sweden started on 27 September 1995 and today the coverage (MUX1) is 35% of the population with services from public service broadcaster Swedish Radio (SR). The license under which SR operates is valid until 31 December 2019.\n\nDuring the years several propositions have been put forward to the Parliament suggesting a larger digital radio network roll-out for public service broadcaster SR. This is seen as the first step to a switchover from analogue FM to digital DAB/DAB+.\n\nIn 2009, trial transmissions of DAB+ started and the coverage (MUX 2) quickly reached 22% of the population with 16 services from public service radio, commercial radio and community local radio.\n\nIn 2010, the Radio and TV Act came into effect which, for the first time, allowed commercial radio companies to apply for digital licenses. This paved the way for a radio industry united behind DAB+, something for which both public and commercial services have been lobbying for. At the same time, the Swedish Government allocated spectrum for a total of four nationwide multiplexers in VHF band III to digital radio DAB/DAB+. Two multiplexers are reserved for SR and two multiplexers are reserved for commercial radio. Three of the multiplexers are regionally MFNs and one multiplexer is a nationwide SFN on channel 12B.\n\nIn 2012, the license regulator (MRTV) started the license process for commercial digital radio. All major commercial broadcasters, representing 91% of all listening not counting SR, applied for a total of 22 audio programme licenses spread over 2 commercial multiplexers.\n\nIn 2013, the Government appointed a Digital radio Industry Coordinator to put forward a Digital Switchover (DSO) plan at the latest in November 2014 after consultation with SR and the commercial radio broadcasters. The purpose of this plan is to put forward a proposition on DSO for a decision by the Swedish Parliament.\n \t\nIn 2014 the radio industry saw the commercial licenses issued. However the Switchover Plan put forward by the Digital Radio Industry Coordinator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/sweden|title=Sweden &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref> was rejected  by the government June 2015 after a negative consultation round which included the telecom authority (PTS). The government also received serious objections by the National Audit Office.

In the middle of October 2012 the standard DAB was switched to the standard DAB+. Two to three programs per region will remain on simulcast service DAB/DAB+ until 2015.\n\nThe original four multiplexes are run by the public broadcaster SRG SSR, the first commercial DAB+ multiplex which was launched on 13 October 2009 now broadcasts 14 commercial radio stations in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. A second local commercial DAB+ multiplex started in December 2012 in the German-speaking part with six commercial radio- and three public radio stations and a first regional commercial DAB+ multiplex in the French-speaking part will start at the end of 2013.\n\nSwitzerland first launched DAB digital radio services in 1999 when the public broadcaster, SRG SSR went on air.

In July 2010, the Government of the [[Republic of China]] announced plans for digital convergence by 2015. During the first stage of the program, from 2010 through 2012, a number of bills being formulated and sent to the legislature for review, including a radio and TV broadcast law. Taiwan has been a supporter of DAB and DAB+ broadcasting and planned for a full implementation of digital broadcasting (both TV and radio) by 2010. Lack of marketing, promotion and consumer awareness has slowed this digital expansion. The new laws being developed should set a firm timeline in place for digital conversion of all media and telecoms. DAB in Taiwan is solely operated by SuperFM on a trial basis. There are seven trial services available including one DMB.\n\nSuperFM broadcasts multiple foreign language programmes, for example in Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino aimed at foreign nationals living in Taiwan but who are unable to listen to their home nation's radio programmes via analogue radio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/chinese-taipei|title=Chinese Taipei &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Thailand==\nFollowing the successful licence auction for commercial digital TV channels in December 2013, the [[National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission]] (NBTC) is looking to auction about 4,000 similar licences for digital radio in early 2015.\n\nThe licences would be in the nationwide and region-wide categories. There are expected to about 20 nationwide licences. The auction will be held on a phase-by-phase basis.\n\nThe NBTC's broadcasting committee will sign a memorandum of understanding with MCOT, the Public Relations Department and the Royal Thai Army at the end of January 2014 to conduct a year-long trial of digital radio broadcasting.\n\nThe digital radio service will be provided on VHF (very high frequency) bands that will be returned to the NBTC by the state agencies that own existing analog TV concessions.\n\nThe existing analog AM and FM radio frequencies will be allocated for community and public radio. There are 525 AM and FM channels nationwide.\n\nThe estimated final price of a commercial digital radio licence would be around Bt100,000. About 10 licences to provide network services to the prospective digital radio operators will also be granted.\n\nThe first Thailand Broadcasting Master Plan (2012-2016) states strategies for digital terrestrial radio roll-out, roadmap and policy for digital terrestrial radio roll-out within two years, after the adoption of the Master Plan.\nDAB+ demonstrations started in Bangkok on 1 March 2013. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), jointly organised the \"NBTC/ITU Workshop on Digital Radio Technologies\" held in Bangkok, Thailand, 1\u20133 March 2013.

Two transmitters will operate as a single frequency network, with one transmitting a 10&nbsp;kW signal. This test mode is scheduled to last a year, with the possibility of an extension in to 2015. The twelve radio stations which will take part in the trial are being selected. Unlike earlier trials, consumers will receive more information on this new way of radio consumption and there will be a large volume of digital radios available in consumer electronic shops.\n\nAustria is committed to a digital radio future and a report by the regulators, the Austrian Communications Authority (KommAustria) and RTR-GmbH recommended DAB+ in Band III as the way forward. As planned, KommAustria completed a call for interest regarding DAB+ in August 2012. KommAustria intended to launch DAB+ by an open call for tender regarding the DAB+ network if enough parties showed believable and sustainable interest. A minimum limit of 12 possible programs (to fill one MUX coverage) was set. Unfortunately this limit was not reached as too few parties showed interest or failed to meet the criteria of the call for interest. Most remarkably, the public broadcaster ORF and the bigger players in the Austrian market did not show interest but strongly voiced their opposition against the launch of DAB+ in Austria. However, there is a group of broadcasters who are very outspoken in favour of DAB+, but the majority of radio stations remain unsure. The public broadcaster ORF has renewed its objection to any DAB+ plans. In the upcoming \"Digitalisation Concept\" which marks the authority's official strategy and schedule for the digitalisation of broadcasting, KommAustria plans to elaborate on the technical details of a possible DAB+ network. There will be no further calls for interest but the possibility for a call for tender upon request. Nevertheless, a working group that was created in 2009 to consider the countries digital future is still at work. Its members are stakeholders from the Austrian radio market who represent opponents and proponents of digital radio. It consists of the regulatory authority, the public broadcaster ORF, the commercial and non-commercial broadcasters associations, the electronic industry and consumer associations. The group is constantly watching and evaluating the progress of digital radio in other European countries. The success of digital radio in Germany will affect whether Austria decides to implement DAB+.\n\nThe Austrian Association of the Electrical and Electronic Industry (FEEI), and Austrian radio stations such as Radio Arabella and LoungeFM have founded the digital radio club, Digital Radio Austria. The aim of the new organisation is the promotion and development of digital radio in Austria, developing the media category \"Radio\" in the digital media world, the establishment of radio on new platforms and to promote the provision of information and support for education and training in the field of electronic and new media.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/austria|title=Austria &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Belgium==\n===French (Wallonia and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge de la Communaut\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise]] (RTBF) is the public broadcaster for the [[French Community of Belgium|Belgian French speaking community]]. Since 1998, RTBF has operated one DAB multiplex simulcasting its five FM radio stations and two [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] (the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Belgian German speaking]] public broadcaster) FM radio stations, covering of Brussels and Wallonia. On this multiplex, RTBF is also testing four DAB+ audio and data channels (indifferent bit rates and with slideshows) for itself and also for the private radio stations. The aim is to plan a roadmap for DAB+ in French speaking Belgium together with the private broadcasters, subject to approval from the French Community Government and the regulator, the [[Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Audiovisuel]] (CSA). In Spring 2011 a common vision of the main broadcasters, both private and public, was defined with a four-tier strategy for migration from analogue to digital radio (DAB+ broadcast; hybrid radio; single online radio player and radio on TV). In summer 2011 the Parliament of the French-speaking Community adopted unanimously a resolution asking the French-speaking Government to support the migration to digital radio from 2011 onwards.\n\nThe CSA (regulator) launched a public consultation about digital radio in autumn 2011 which provided positive feedback. In spring 2012, the CSA recommended to the Government a DAB+ rollout based mainly on two layers in Band III. In June 2012 the Government authorized RTBF to proceed with DAB+ trials for commercial and non-profit radio stations licensed by the CSA.\n\nThe next step is to achieve a public funding agreement to finance the investments needed for the technical DAB+ rollout, upgrade of the RTBF DAB network to DAB+ to ensure deep indoor coverage of Brussels and Wallonia, for a potential public launch in 2015 (to mark the 101st anniversary of the first radio broadcasting in Belgium). RTBF is testing Radio DNS interactive slideshows on its DAB+ channels.\n\n===Flemish (Flanders and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie]] (VRT) is the public broadcaster for the Belgian Flemish Community. VRT has one DAB multiplex in operation with eight radio stations: the 5 FM-also stations Radio 1, Radio 2, Klara, Studio Brussel and MNM and three digital-only channels: Nieuws+ (news), Klara Continuo (non-stop classic and older music) and MNM Hits (Top 40).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/aanbod/kijk-en-luister/radio-luisteren/dab-|title=DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/heb-je-een-vraag/vragen-over-dab-|title=Vragen over DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref> Norkring, which operates VRT's multiplex, also has a license for another multiplex and is wording on a DAB+ roll out.

Nantes was already allowed until the end of the year. \nIn January 2012 it was reported by the French newspaper \u2018Les Echos\u2019 that the CSA had requested the Ministry of Industry to include DAB+ in the technical standard for France. The consultation for this closed in May 2012 and the technical decree was released 16 August 2013, including DAB+ to the list of permitted standards. At the end of 2007, France's Government announced that the official standard for digital radio in France would be DMB-A, to be marketed as Radio Num\u00e9rique Terrestre (RNT).\n\nAt the end of 2013, the French Parliament will examine an update of the 1986 law about radio and television. Then the CSA should publish a timetable for a call for applications for tenders for digital terrestrial licenses for France's next 20 biggest cities which will add up to 62% coverage. An additional tender will also allow to add DAB+ services to the 14 multiplexes in Paris, Marseille and Nice, as well as five more multiplexes in these towns.\n\nIn April 2012 the CSA re-launched a call of tender for three cities (Paris for seven multiplexes, Marseille and Nice for six multiplexes each). The four main commercial radio groups decided do not bid and the government did not allow the public service (Radio France) to pre-empt frequencies. At the beginning of October 2012 the CSA published the candidates selected for the three cities. At the beginning of 2014, six multiplexes will be on air in Paris, four in Marseille and four in Nice.\n\nRoll out of terrestrial digital radio was scheduled to start in December 2009 but was postponed amid opposition from several sources, including private radio operators. The Prime Minister commissioned a further report by David Kessler, former chief executive France Culture, which was published in mid-2011 and suggested that the conditions had not been met for the full scale deployment of digital radio in France. The report suggested a moratorium of two to three years during which time the French market would look at\nthe deployment of digital radio in the rest of Europe. The report also stated that the government approved the CSA's decision to allow further trials to continue.\n\nThe CSA is responsible for taking the findings of the Kessler report forward and in order to do this set up an \u2018Observatory\u2019 which includes all of the industry players. The publication of the Kessler report meant the market could move forward after a period of stagnation and to this end various trials were put on-air (Paris, Nantes, Marseille and Lyon).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|title=France &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220000457/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|archive-date=20 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Germany==\nBy the end of 2013 more than 120 national, regional and local programs will be broadcast in Germany. Also more than 90% of the German population can listen to at least one digital radio ensemble. This is considered to be a respectable success two years after the launch.\n\nDespite some changes in the national multiplex, the prospect for both commercial and public broadcasters is very positive as receiver sales are increasing. Furthermore, a stable ecosystem of private digital radio stations could be established in metropolitan areas such as Frankfurt, Berlin and Munich.\n\nThe current focus of broadcasters and network operators is to continue their marketing efforts in all media. For this reason the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019 was founded by the commercial broadcasters on the national multiplex (represented by DRD GmbH), the ARD group, Deutschlandradio and the network operator Media Broadcast. The goal is to coordinate the b2b and b2c marketing initiatives of all stakeholders to foster the evolution of digital radio in Germany by obtaining a reasonable market penetration by end of 2014.\n\nCoordination with the device industry is carried out via the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019, organised by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). Five working groups were created to guide all areas of digital radio development and roll out, such as receiver/devices, data and traffic services, networks or advertisements.\n\nThe initiative hired consumer electronics market professionals which significantly improved the communication with the retailers. Many stores are now equipped with in-house-coverage solutions. The German car manufacturers offer DAB+ receivers for nearly all models either as an option or line fit. Two commercial telematics service providers use data capacity on the national mux to transmit TPEG based traffic information via DAB.

The sole DAB+ equipment (from head-end to transmitter) are owned and operated by the public broadcaster, Radio TV Malaysia (RTM).\n\nIn February 2013, RTM invited local agencies such as the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), various members of the local radio industry and Telecoms Malaysia to a joint field trial study. Some elements of the field trials included identifying minimum reception figures for in building reception loss, minimum figures for acceptable mobile reception and speed tests.\n\nConsidering the conservative power of the trial DAB+ transmitter of 1&nbsp;kW, the results of the field trial looks promising and are in line with figures already established by the ITU and in broadcasting agencies in Australia.\n15 FM radio programs are available on the DAB+ platform, nine from RTM and six from the commercial radio stations.\n\nEfforts are underway to study/familiarise staff with other aspects of the DAB+ system such as adding Slideshow (SLS) and text (DL) in order to maximize the full potential of DAB+.

The conditions for the transition were:\n\n# Coverage (absolute condition for FM shutdown): Before 2015, the public broadcaster NRK must achieve coverage of 99.5%, the commercial broadcasters on the national network #1 are required to reach 90% of the population\n#Value added for the listeners (absolute condition for FM shutdown). There must be a value added for the listeners in going from FM to DAB, both in terms of available content and in terms of user experience.\n#Digital listening (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015 50% of the radio listeners must daily use a digital radio platform (currently this is 45%). This does not specify market share of listening, contrary to the UK requirement, only reach. \"Digital platform\" also includes listening via internet and via the digital TV network. This condition is set in order to measure the listeners' independence of the analogue FM-platform.\n#In-car solution (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017.

The trial will operate as a SFN in VHF band III on Channel 13F on a frequency of 239.200&nbsp;MHz. This will happen after coverage verification at transmitter powers of 2&nbsp;kW, 5&nbsp;kW, and 10&nbsp;kW. The total area covered by the trial is 21185km2 and the total gross population covered is 10 705 387 (21.5% of total SA population). It is envisaged that between 18 and 20 radio from the Public, Commercial and Community sectors will participate in the trial. The trial will allow the testing of:\nEnd-to-end technical functionality\nExtent of portable mobile coverage\nSignal permeability\nDemonstrate digital radio services and value-added services\nPerformance in the field using typical consumer equipment and professional test and measurement equipment.\nThe effects of vehicle penetration loss, building penetration loss and clutter (e.g. buildings and vegetation) on coverage.\nTesting of the various encoding methods (stereo, para stereo, mono) for different audio types and at different bit rates to get a good understanding of what bit rates/encoding to use for the different program types.\nInvestigate the delivery of PAD within these tests, synchronisation with the audio and rate of change of the images.  \nIn July 2013 over 200 radio industry representatives came together at the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) facility in Johannesburg to attend a landmark workshop on the rollout of DAB+ digital radio and to discuss plans for a high-powered DAB+ trial transmission extending from Pretoria to Johannesburg by end 2013. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), indicated that it stands ready to support broadcasting innovation in South Africa, which will be the first country to exploit opportunities for delivery of educational services via DAB+, as well as services for those with disabilities. Broadcasting radio via DAB+ will also allow ICASA to license new entrants where FM bandwidth is congested.\n\nMobileTV PTY performed technical tests of DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) and DAB+ in Gauteng from August 2011 until the end of July 2013 and plans to expand trials in South Africa. The prospective broadcaster will launch trials of DMB technology in the Free State and the Western Cape before the end of the 2013. In July 2012 they applied for a commercial license and expect to get an answer during 2013. ICASA has granted test licences for Cape and Bloemfontein, while assessing new applications for Port Eliazbeth, East London and Mpumalanga. MobileTV PTY aims to switch on the trials in Cape Town and Bloemfontein on 1 October and 1 November respectively. Their two transmitters will be relocated from Pretoria and Johannesburg Autumn 2013.\n\nMobileTV PTY ran two TV channels and one radio station on a test license. If a license is granted they would then cover 15-20 million of the 45 million people in South Africa and expand coverage in parallel to sales of devices and uptake of services. MobileTV PTY has teamed up with SABC, the public service broadcaster in South Africa. SABC reaches 76% of the population daily and is by far the biggest broadcaster and is partially financed by a TV license and partially by advertisements. MobileTV PTY is in dialogue with the Department of Education to evaluate whether the technology can be used for educational purposes, such as to reach rural schools and colleges in a cost-effective manner. The Department is primarily interested in the abilities of data transfer but an educational TV channel has not been ruled out. SABC will offer their 18 radio channels. MobileTV PTY wishes to also offer distribution for private radio stations following the launch.\n\nNo programmes are on air. Mobile TV PTY is awaiting a commercial license from the government. If licences are granted they will within the first year cover up to 50% of the population of South Africa, although they aim to increase this to between 80 and 90% within 2\u20133 years. Their plan is to broadcast 6-10 mobile TV channels and two radio stations. Additional services that combine broadcasting and the internet on the same device will be an essential part of their business model. Such services include traffic information, gambling, integration with social media and touch-screen shopping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-africa|title=South Africa &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==South Korea==\nAs the first country to commercially launch mobile TV, South Korea is the most successful DMB market in the world. More than 62 million DMB enabled devices have been sold, of which the most popular are mobile phones. This number is expected to rise even more with an increase in coverage; services already cover over 80% of the country. Hundreds of DMB devices are available in this market and usage of mobile TV increases year on year. Interactive services are also growing in popularity adding value to broadcasting services.\n\nThe Korean government has set up a digital audio project to recommend a digital audio broadcasting standard for Korea.  Following ETRI's investigation of various digital radio platforms, a major decision is expected regarding the adoption of a digital radio technology for South Korean broadcasters.\n\nKorea's latest innovation is an interactive mobile TV service, or Smart DMB, launched in May 2011 with six terrestrial-DMB operators (T-DMB). With Smart DMB, mobile TV viewers are able to search the internet, receive EPG information updates, and even enjoy \u2018TV Screen Capture and Share Service\u2019 through SNS while watching television. Moreover, hybrid DMB was launched in Aug 2013 for the high quality video service.\n\nA DAB+ trial has been on air in Seoul since December 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|title=South Korea &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710122752/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|archive-date=10 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nA total of 18 DAB audio services are on air. Population coverage is currently 20%. The Spanish DAB Association ([http://www.radiodigitaldab.com/index.htm Asociaci\u00f3n Foro de la Radio Digital]) comprising both national private and public broadcasters, is responsible for DAB/DAB+ in Spain.\n\nSpain first began broadcasting terrestrial digital radio in April 1998 covering Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. From 2002 to June 2011, 23 transmitters covered the 52% of the Spanish population through three national multiplexes (1 SFN and 2 MFN). In addition, in some Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas, DAB services were launched on additional regional multiplexes, but  they are currently switched off.\n\nThe Council of Ministers reached an agreement on Digital Radio in June 2011 and approved a Digitalisation Plan for Terrestrial Broadcasting with the following measures:\n\n#Reduction of DAB coverage from 52% to 20%, in order to facilitate a migration to DAB+\n#Flexibility for the broadcasters, in order to allow for  migration to DAB+\n#Study of a possible reassignment of the multiplexes\n#Promotional activities through the Spanish DAB Forum\n#DAB+ trials\n#A study of the necessary conditions to determine the date of  a possible analogue switch off<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/spain|title=Spain &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Sweden==\nDAB transmissions in Sweden started on 27 September 1995 and today the coverage (MUX1) is 35% of the population with services from public service broadcaster Swedish Radio (SR). The license under which SR operates is valid until 31 December 2019.\n\nDuring the years several propositions have been put forward to the Parliament suggesting a larger digital radio network roll-out for public service broadcaster SR. This is seen as the first step to a switchover from analogue FM to digital DAB/DAB+.\n\nIn 2009, trial transmissions of DAB+ started and the coverage (MUX 2) quickly reached 22% of the population with 16 services from public service radio, commercial radio and community local radio.\n\nIn 2010, the Radio and TV Act came into effect which, for the first time, allowed commercial radio companies to apply for digital licenses. This paved the way for a radio industry united behind DAB+, something for which both public and commercial services have been lobbying for. At the same time, the Swedish Government allocated spectrum for a total of four nationwide multiplexers in VHF band III to digital radio DAB/DAB+. Two multiplexers are reserved for SR and two multiplexers are reserved for commercial radio. Three of the multiplexers are regionally MFNs and one multiplexer is a nationwide SFN on channel 12B.\n\nIn 2012, the license regulator (MRTV) started the license process for commercial digital radio. All major commercial broadcasters, representing 91% of all listening not counting SR, applied for a total of 22 audio programme licenses spread over 2 commercial multiplexers.\n\nIn 2013, the Government appointed a Digital radio Industry Coordinator to put forward a Digital Switchover (DSO) plan at the latest in November 2014 after consultation with SR and the commercial radio broadcasters. The purpose of this plan is to put forward a proposition on DSO for a decision by the Swedish Parliament.\n \t\nIn 2014 the radio industry saw the commercial licenses issued. However the Switchover Plan put forward by the Digital Radio Industry Coordinator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/sweden|title=Sweden &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref> was rejected  by the government June 2015 after a negative consultation round which included the telecom authority (PTS). The government also received serious objections by the National Audit Office. The rejection of the DSO plan was finally confirmed by a unanimous vote in the Parliament February 3, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/skrivelse/2015/10/skr.-20151625/|title=Riksrevisionens rapport om digitalradio|first=Regeringen och|last=Regeringskansliet|date=14 October 2015|website=Regeringskansliet}}</ref><ref>Riksrevisionens rapport om digitalradio, (RiR 2015:5)</ref>\n\n==Switzerland==\nThe Federal Office of Communications awarded a radio licence to the Digris AG company for the operation of DAB+ islands throughout Switzerland.\n\nToday there is one national (with four regional multiplexes for the four different languages) two regional and one local multiplexes, covering the German, French and Italian speaking areas of the country, with a mix of public and commercial services. In the middle of October 2012 the standard DAB was switched to the standard DAB+. Two to three programs per region will remain on simulcast service DAB/DAB+ until 2015.\n\nThe original four multiplexes are run by the public broadcaster SRG SSR, the first commercial DAB+ multiplex which was launched on 13 October 2009 now broadcasts 14 commercial radio stations in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. A second local commercial DAB+ multiplex started in December 2012 in the German-speaking part with six commercial radio- and three public radio stations and a first regional commercial DAB+ multiplex in the French-speaking part will start at the end of 2013.\n\nSwitzerland first launched DAB digital radio services in 1999 when the public broadcaster, SRG SSR went on air. Marketing activities started in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/switzerland|title=Switzerland &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2016, the stations regulated by public law will have fully migrated from DAB to DAB+,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dabplus.ch/|title=Radio zieht um|website=www.dabplus.ch}}</ref> while FM broadcasts will cease in 2024.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medienwoche.ch/2014/05/27/radio-ab-2024-nur-noch-digital/|title=Radio ab 2024 nur noch digital|date=27 May 2014|website=MEDIENWOCHE}}</ref>\n\n==Taiwan (Republic of China)==\nThe Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC), a private network with nationwide coverage, operates three FM and three AM channels as well as a digital audio broadcasting system. In July 2010, the Government of the [[Republic of China]] announced plans for digital convergence by 2015. During the first stage of the program, from 2010 through 2012, a number of bills being formulated and sent to the legislature for review, including a radio and TV broadcast law. Taiwan has been a supporter of DAB and DAB+ broadcasting and planned for a full implementation of digital broadcasting (both TV and radio) by 2010. Lack of marketing, promotion and consumer awareness has slowed this digital expansion. The new laws being developed should set a firm timeline in place for digital conversion of all media and telecoms. DAB in Taiwan is solely operated by SuperFM on a trial basis. There are seven trial services available including one DMB.\n\nSuperFM broadcasts multiple foreign language programmes, for example in Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino aimed at foreign nationals living in Taiwan but who are unable to listen to their home nation's radio programmes via analogue radio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/chinese-taipei|title=Chinese Taipei &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Thailand==\nFollowing the successful licence auction for commercial digital TV channels in December 2013, the [[National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission]] (NBTC) is looking to auction about 4,000 similar licences for digital radio in early 2015.\n\nThe licences would be in the nationwide and region-wide categories. There are expected to about 20 nationwide licences. The auction will be held on a phase-by-phase basis.\n\nThe NBTC's broadcasting committee will sign a memorandum of understanding with MCOT, the Public Relations Department and the Royal Thai Army at the end of January 2014 to conduct a year-long trial of digital radio broadcasting.\n\nThe digital radio service will be provided on VHF (very high frequency) bands that will be returned to the NBTC by the state agencies that own existing analog TV concessions.\n\nThe existing analog AM and FM radio frequencies will be allocated for community and public radio. There are 525 AM and FM channels nationwide.\n\nThe estimated final price of a commercial digital radio licence would be around Bt100,000. About 10 licences to provide network services to the prospective digital radio operators will also be granted.\n\nThe first Thailand Broadcasting Master Plan (2012-2016) states strategies for digital terrestrial radio roll-out, roadmap and policy for digital terrestrial radio roll-out within two years, after the adoption of the Master Plan.\nDAB+ demonstrations started in Bangkok on 1 March 2013. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), jointly organised the \"NBTC/ITU Workshop on Digital Radio Technologies\" held in Bangkok, Thailand, 1\u20133 March 2013. The Workshop was supported by WorldDMB, MCOT Public Co., LTd., the Government Public Relations Department, and the Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Station.\n\nNBTC is in the process of developing a policy document for digital radio services that will be published in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/thailand|title=Thailand &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Turkey==\nTRT, the Turkish Broadcasting Corporation, has aired DAB test transmissions broadcasting four simulcast services in Band III and covering the capital, Ankara.

The Safavid rule was characterised with active resettlement policies, aimed at securing Shia Muslim dominance in the conquered lands. In 1509, 500 Karamanli Turkic families from [[Tabriz]] settled in Derbent. An unknown number of Turkic-speakers from the Kurchi tribe were resettled her in 1540. Half a century later, 400 more families of the Turkic-speaking [[Bayat (name)|Bayat clan]] were relocated to Derbent on the orders of [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]]. Finally, in 1741, [[Nadir Shah]] relocated Turkic-speakers from the Mikri clan to Derbent.

During this period, the emirate became destination for the migration of numerous [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]].

The Safavid rule was characterised with active resettlement policies, aimed at securing Shia Muslim dominance in the conquered lands. In 1509, 500 Karamanli Turkic families from [[Tabriz]] settled in Derbent. An unknown number of Turkic-speakers from the Kurchi tribe were resettled her in 1540. Half a century later, 400 more families of the Turkic-speaking [[Bayat (name)|Bayat clan]] were relocated to Derbent on the orders of [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]]. Finally, in 1741, [[Nadir Shah]] relocated Turkic-speakers from the Mikri clan to Derbent. By 1870 the settlers were all regarded as speaking a common language, Azeri.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2tI6AQAAIAAJ Notes of the Caucasus Department of the Russian Imperial Geographical Society]; p. 24</ref> Due to their Shia adherence, the new migrants were referred to by contemporary historians as ''Persians'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0435}}), a term that was erroneously applied to Shia Azeris of Dagestan way into the twentieth century.<ref>Y.

In Dagestan, they are also sometimes referred to as Padars. The Tarakama originated in various parts of Shirvan and were resettled by Khan Muhammad of Kaitag to the north of the city of Derbent around 1600.

The growth and establishment of ethnic Azeris in this region has heavily depended on assimilation processes. In 1876, many [[Tabasaran people|Tabasarans]] were already in the process of switching from [[Tabasaran language|Tabasaran]] to Azeri as their first language.<ref>N. Dzhidalaev. ''Trends of Functional Language Development in Pre-Revolution Dagestan''. Makhachkala: RAS DSC, 2004.</ref> In addition, from the Middle Ages, the population of a number of villages in Tabasaran, namely Arablyar, Gimeidi, Darvag, Yersi, and Kemakh consisted of [[Arabs in the Caucasus|ethnic Arabs]] who were gradually being absorbed by the neighbouring population, mainly Azeri, such as in Yersi. In 1929, Kemakh was listed among Tat-populated villages, whereas Gimeidi (abandoned in 1976) was described as mixed Tat and Azeri. These Tats, in turn, were assimilated by Azeris in the following decades. Arablyar, which is now part of the [[Kurakhsky District|Kurakh Rayon]], currently has mixed [[Lezgian people|Lezgian]] and Azeri population.<ref name=\"miller\"/> Residents of Darvag retained the knowledge of [[Shirvani Arabic|Arabic]] as a first language until the 1930s, after which they also integrated linguistically and ethnically into the Azeri surrounding.<ref>Zelkina, Anna. Arabic as a Minority Language. Walter de Gruyter, 2000; p. 101.</ref>\n\nCurrently ethnic Azeris constitute majority in the villages of Maraga, Hili-Pendzhik (including the settlement of Yekrag), Tsanak, Arak, Yersi, Darvag, and Zil. The villages of Arkit and Khurvek, as well the district capital Khuchni are mixed Azeri and Tabasaran. Azeris of Tsanak, Arak, Yersi, and Khuchni are normally bilingual in Azeri and Tabasaran, showing preference for Tabasaran when talking to their Tabasaran neighbours even if the latter know Azeri.<ref name=\"mag1\"/>\n\n===Azerbaijanis in Rutul===\nNizhny Katrukh is the only Azeri village in the [[Rutulsky District|Rutul Rayon]]. Azeris of Nizhny Katrukh consider themselves descendants of the people of Shirvan who were captured by the mountaineers during one of their raids into the plains around 1700, taken to the [[Shamkhalate of Kazi-Kumukh]] (a [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Lak]] state of the time) and made subjects of the Shamkhal.
