This gave the site its name Ilbe, which is short for Ilgan Best, Korean for popular daily. As of February 2017, it is the most controversial site in South Korea by daily traffic.\n\n== Ilbe subculture ==\nIlbe's userbase has strong right tendencies. The website has very few rules, but it does prohibit users from mentioning each other by their username or getting too close to each other, in order to prevent new users or dissenters from being down-voted indiscriminately by existing users. This policy has effectively made everyone more anonymous (and equal), in contrast with other popular Korean forums where the old users are more respected and hold greater authority during discussions. The forums are largely unmoderated, with exceptions made for cases that may result in litigation or cases in response to complaints.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe lack of moderation, however, does result in problematic behaviors such as [[defamation]] or [[harassment]], which are criminal under Korean Law. The website routinely comes under criticism for its users' actions, the most notable of which was the Korea Communications Standards Commission's request that Ilbe regulate problematic contents that are harmful for teenagers.<ref>[http://news1.kr/articles/1426126] 'Ilbe is advised to enhance teenager protection activity by KCSC' (News1)</ref> On the other hand, the website has been praised for its anonymity and free spirit: a spokesman for the right-wing [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] mentioned Ilbe as \"free space where innocent people can speak their minds freely\".<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=10178596] (Joongang Ilbo)</ref>\n\nA large part of Ilbe's subculture comes from the users' collective identity as \"losers\" of a sort: until the founding of Ilbe, most of the large community forums on the Korean web were left-leaning to an extent where anyone with even a moderate right-wing opinion had to endure ridicule and name-calling by the majority including the moderators.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Thus, Ilbe's userbase has embraced many of the derogatory terms used by the left to show pride in their dissent.

The political parties have declared a war against the Ilbe Community, as they have been consecutively criticizing Roh Mu-Hyeon, and other political leaders through many forms of media, such as making jokes, [[parody music]] containing criticisms and people's discontent against political leaders such as [[Park Geun-hye]] and North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]], and spreading rumors on social media. Users make an Ilbe \"theme song\" every year, and they regularly parody popular songs with lyrics that criticize the leaders. Ilbe users compose their parody songs as a propaganda that attracts people who coincidentally listen to their songs, to join the community. Users are trying to add a sense of humor to their songs, such as exaggerating expressions of political leaders and colloquially referring them as \"MC Muhyeon\", \"DJ Daejung\", \"MC Jong-Un\" and \"MC Geunhye\".This makes their songs sound legitimate in some ways.\nRecently, following up the uprising criticisms and hostility against the Ilbe Community, Korean celebrities who accidentally use Ilbe terminology on social media make people misunderstand them as an Ilbe member. As a result, comic artists and companies are adding caution to their productions to avoid being misunderstood as an Ilbe member.\n\n=== Denial of Gwangju Democratic Uprising ===\nAlthough the South Korean government, judiciary and legislature officially concluded that the [[Gwangju Uprising]] was a justified civil movement by passing a special law, (also confirmed by [[UNESCO]] who registered records of the Gwangju Uprising as [[UNESCO World Heritage]]),<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/human-rights-documentary-heritage-1980-archives-for-the-may-18th-democratic-uprising-against-military-regime-in-gwangju-republic-of-korea/] UNESCO World Heritage</ref> Ilbe is propagating unverified conspiracy theories about Korean democratization.\n\nThe May 18 Memorial Foundation (5.18 \uae30\ub150\uc7ac\ub2e8), one of the Gwangju Uprising memorial organizations, announced that Ilbe is spreading questionable information like,<ref>[http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2013/05/21/0200000000AKR20130521117800054.HTML] '4 types of distorting 5.18 Gwangju Democratize Movement' (Yonhap News)</ref>\n*North Korean special forces were involved in the Gwangju Uprising.\n*The Gwangju Uprising was a heavily armed riot.\n*Military suppression against citizens was justifiable.\n*The 5.18 Special Law (5.18\ud2b9\ubcc4\ubc95), which pays respect to the Gwangju Uprising, is unconstitutional.\n\nClaims similar to Ilbe's were denied by the government multiple times.

This gave the site its name Ilbe, which is short for Ilgan Best, Korean for popular daily. As of February 2017, it is the most controversial site in South Korea by daily traffic.\n\n== Ilbe subculture ==\nIlbe's userbase has strong right tendencies. The website has very few rules, but it does prohibit users from mentioning each other by their username or getting too close to each other, in order to prevent new users or dissenters from being down-voted indiscriminately by existing users. This policy has effectively made everyone more anonymous (and equal), in contrast with other popular Korean forums where the old users are more respected and hold greater authority during discussions. The forums are largely unmoderated, with exceptions made for cases that may result in litigation or cases in response to complaints.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe lack of moderation, however, does result in problematic behaviors such as [[defamation]] or [[harassment]], which are criminal under Korean Law. The website routinely comes under criticism for its users' actions, the most notable of which was the Korea Communications Standards Commission's request that Ilbe regulate problematic contents that are harmful for teenagers.<ref>[http://news1.kr/articles/1426126] 'Ilbe is advised to enhance teenager protection activity by KCSC' (News1)</ref> On the other hand, the website has been praised for its anonymity and free spirit: a spokesman for the right-wing [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] mentioned Ilbe as \"free space where innocent people can speak their minds freely\".<ref>[http://article.joins.com/news/article/article.asp?total_id=10178596] (Joongang Ilbo)</ref>\n\nA large part of Ilbe's subculture comes from the users' collective identity as \"losers\" of a sort: until the founding of Ilbe, most of the large community forums on the Korean web were left-leaning to an extent where anyone with even a moderate right-wing opinion had to endure ridicule and name-calling by the majority including the moderators.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Thus, Ilbe's userbase has embraced many of the derogatory terms used by the left to show pride in their dissent.

The political parties have declared a war against the Ilbe Community, as they have been consecutively criticizing Roh Mu-Hyeon, and other political leaders through many forms of media, such as making jokes, [[parody music]] containing criticisms and people's discontent against political leaders such as [[Park Geun-hye]] and North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]], and spreading rumors on social media. Users make an Ilbe \"theme song\" every year, and they regularly parody popular songs with lyrics that criticize the leaders. Ilbe users compose their parody songs as a propaganda that attracts people who coincidentally listen to their songs, to join the community. Users are trying to add a sense of humor to their songs, such as exaggerating expressions of political leaders and colloquially referring them as \"MC Muhyeon\", \"DJ Daejung\", \"MC Jong-Un\" and \"MC Geunhye\".This makes their songs sound legitimate in some ways.\nRecently, following up the uprising criticisms and hostility against the Ilbe Community, Korean celebrities who accidentally use Ilbe terminology on social media make people misunderstand them as an Ilbe member.

In this sense, an organization that values good customer service may spend more money in training employees than the average organization or may proactively interview customers for feedback.\n\nFrom the point of view of an overall [[sales process engineering]] effort, customer service plays an important role in an organization's ability to generate income and [[revenue]].<ref name=\"Selden1998\">{{cite journal|author = Paul H.

In this case, it is called \"at home customer services\"'' or ''\" at home customer support.\"''\n\nRegarding technology, products such as mobile phones, televisions, computers, software products or other electronic or mechanical goods, it is termed [[technical support]].\n\n==Automated customer service==\nCustomer service may be provided by a person (e.g., [[sales representative|sales]] and service representative), or by automated means,{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} such as kiosks, [[Internet site]]s, and [[Application software|apps]]. An advantage with automated means is an increased ability to provide service 24-hours a day, which can, at least, be a complement to customer service by persons.<ref name=Kongthon/>\n\nAn increasingly popular type of automated customer service is conducted through [[artificial intelligence]] (\"AI\"). The customer benefit of AI is the feel for chatting with a live agent through improved speech technologies while giving customers the self-service benefit.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goebel |first1=Tobias |title=Google Duplex\u2019s Conversational AI Shows a Path to Better Customer Service |url=https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/google-duplexs-conversational-ai-shows-a-path-to-better-customer-service/ |website=CMSWire.com |publisher=Simpler Media Group |accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>  Another example of automated customer service is by [[push-button telephone|touch-tone phone]], which usually involves IVR (Interactive Voice Response) a main menu and the use of the keypad as options (e.g., \"Press 1 for English, Press 2 for Spanish\", etc.){{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nHowever, in the [[Internet era]], a challenge has been to maintain and/or enhance the personal experience while making use of the efficiencies of [[online commerce]]. \"Online customers are literally invisible to you (and you to them), so it's easy to shortchange them emotionally.
