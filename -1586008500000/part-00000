It is owned by [[Entercom]] and airs a [[Spanish-language]] [[Latin pop]] [[radio format]].  KLOL serves as the Spanish-language [[flagship (radio)|flagship station]] for the [[Houston Texans]] [[NFL|football]] team.\n\nThe studios and offices are in [[Greenway Plaza]] in Houston.<ref>[https://klol.radio.com/contacto/contacto KLOL.radio.com/contacto]</ref>  The [[transmitter]] is located off McHard Road in [[Missouri City, Texas]].<ref>[https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/finder?sr=Y&s=C&call=Klol&nav=&x=0&y=0 Radio-Locator.com/KLOL]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\n{{original research|section|date=December 2011}}\n===KTRH-FM===\nFor much of the early days of radio, [[KTRH]] had been one of Houston's top AM stations, co-owned with ''[[The Houston Chronicle]]''.  In 1947, an FM station was added, 101.1 '''KTRH-FM'''.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1960/B%202%20Radio%20Yearbook%201960.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-236]</ref>  It was the first FM station in Houston and mostly [[simulcast]] KTRH's programming when few people had FM radios.  KTRH-AM-FM aired the [[CBS]] Radio Network line-up of dramas, comedies, news, sports, [[soap opera]]s, [[game show]]s and [[big band]] broadcasts during the \"[[Golden Age of Radio]].\"\n\nIn the 1950s, as network programming moved from radio to TV, KTRH-AM-FM switched to a [[full service radio|full service]] [[middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] (MOR) format.  In 1965, KTRH-AM-FM were acquired by the Rusk Corporation.  Under Rusk ownership, KTRH-FM experimented with [[progressive rock]] programs at night while simulcasting AM 740 in the daytime.  In 1970, Rusk switched the station over to a full-time rock format as '''KLOL'''.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1971/B-2-Radio-YB-1971.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1971 page B-204]</ref>\n\n===101 KLOL===\nIn 1970, \"I'm Free\" by [[The Who]] ushered in a new format and [[call sign]] to the 101.1 frequency, and \"The KLOL Legend\" was born. In the early days, KLOL was known as \"Mother's Family\" and later \"K101\" and utilized what would be termed a [[free form radio]] format, where each [[disc jockey|DJ]] would choose which records he wanted to play. The \"Mother's Family\" name was a reference to KFMK-FM (97.9, now [[KBXX]]), Houston's original Progressive Rock radio station, known as \"Mother Radio.\"\n\nA major contributor to the early and ongoing success of KLOL was the laid back DJ Maurice \"Crash\" Collins.  KLOL played cuts from mostly rock albums in the early years, but it was also possible to hear [[Jazz]], [[Blues]], [[Folk music]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]].  In the mid-1970s the main rock competition to 101 KLOL was [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-owned 96.5 KAUM. KAUM eventually switched to [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] hits.  In addition, 100.3 [[KILT-FM]] was also playing rock music, another competitor for KLOL.  \n\n===Moving to AOR===\nBy the late 1970s, KLOL had moved from progressive rock to an [[album-oriented rock]] sound, with a structured [[playlist]] of only the top tracks from the best selling albums.  The station changed its moniker to \"101 KLOL.\"  KLOL achieved victory in early 1981 against format rival KILT-FM, which soon changed its format to [[country music]].  Shortly thereafter, KLOL had another rival in 97ROCK (96.5 KSRR) and one of the fiercest AOR battles of the 1980s commenced. KLOL once again won the battle as KSRR flipped to Top 40 as KKHT in 1986 (and is now [[KHMX]]).\n\nKLOL mellowed somewhat in the 1980s, as did many AORs, but the playlist remained quite wide.  The station's core artists were [[The Eagles]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Van Halen]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[The Police]] and [[Tom Petty]].\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, KLOL was one of the top rated AOR station in the [[United States]]. KLOL featured legendary morning hosts Mark Stevens and Jim Pruett and their \"Stevens and Pruett Show,\" chalking up both high ratings and several fines from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) for \"offensive content.\" Dayna Steele anchored mid-days, and the \"Steele-workers\" were numerous. And in the evenings it was \"Outlaw Radio\", an [[Active Rock]] show with \"a lot of attitude.\" KLOL was regularly in the Top 3 in that time frame.\n\n===Changes in ownership===\nIn 1993, Evergreen Media bought KTRH and KLOL for $49 million.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1995/B-Radio-NE-Ter-YB-1995.pdf Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1995 page B-403</ref>  Evergreen started to make changes to KLOL's sound.  The station started relying heavily on either [[classic rock]] product (KLOL would be almost all Classic Rock from 1996\u20131998) or current product from \"safe artists\" who were often not that popular.  KLOL virtually ignored the exploding [[grunge rock]] and [[alternative rock]] bands in the 1990s.\n\nIn late 1998, KLOL began playing more current material.  Some thought [[Active Rock]] was finally coming to Houston on KLOL.  [[Alternative rock]]-formatted [[KTBZ-FM]] had moved to a more pop-alternative sound to target listeners who had previously tuned in the now defunct 102.9 KKPN, a [[Modern AC]] station that is now [[KLTN]].  So the opportunity for a harder edged station was there.  But the station stopped short of going to an active rock sound.\n\n[[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]] became the owner of KLOL in 2000.  For several years, Clear Channel retained the rock format. Many thought Clear Channel would bring back the classic sound of the station during the previous decades. Instead, KLOL carried on in the same vein for another 4 years.\n\n===KLOL goes Spanish===\nRumors of a KLOL format change had been heard since at least 1999.  Some had speculated on a switch to [[urban oldies]] or Top 40 as \"KISS 101.\"  However, the November 10, 2004 edition of The Walton & Johnson Show on KLOL informed listeners that if they wanted to keep listening, they had better learn [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nOn November 12, 2004, after a rerun of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXeC4l6ciQc Walton & Johnson Show], KLOL segued into the \"10 O'Clock Rock Block\" as normal. Then, at 10:11&nbsp;a.m., the station changed its format to [[Hurban]] (Spanish-language [[hip hop music]]).<ref>Clifford Pugh, \"KLOL suddenly speaking Spanish; Venerable rock station switches to a new format\", ''The Houston Chronicle'', November 13, 2004.</ref><ref>Carol Christian, \"The day a music icon died; Houstonians mourn the loss of KLOL and its 34 on-air years\", ''The Houston Chronicle'', November 15, 2004.</ref><ref>http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=53662</ref><ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/2000s/2004/RR-2004-11-19.pdf</ref>  The 34 years of KLOL as a rock station had come to an end.\n\nThe final six songs that KLOL played as a Rock station were:\n*\"[[Hells Bells (song)|Hells Bells]]\" - [[AC/DC]]\n*\"[[Rooster (song)|Rooster]]\"  - [[Alice in Chains]]\n*\"[[Aqualung (song)|Aqualung]]\" - [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]\n*\"[[Who Are You (The Who song)|Who Are You]]\" - [[The Who]]\n*\"[[Sad But True]]\" - [[Metallica]]\n*\"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\" - [[The Who]] (also the first song played on Rock 101 KLOL)\n\nIn the fall of 2007, KLOL redesigned the station's entire look, changing the format to more contemporary [[Latin Pop]] sound under the direction of Clear Channel's Senior VP [[Alfredo Alonso]]. This design was made to better compete with other Spanish-language stations on the Houston radio dial. The name MEGA 101 was kept, while the [[logo]] was changed. The website was also redesigned.\n\n===CBS and Entercom acquisitions===\nOn December 15, 2008, Clear Channel and [[CBS Radio]] announced a multi-station swap: KLOL and co-owned 96.5 [[KHMX]] would go to CBS Radio, while CBS Radio-owned stations [[WQSR]] in [[Baltimore]], [[KBKS-FM]] in [[Seattle]], [[KLTH]] and [[KXJM]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[KYRV|KQJK]] in [[Sacramento, California]] would go to Clear Channel.

The People\u2019s Republic of China additionally claims [[Taiwan, China|Taiwan]], which remains governed by the [[Republic of China]] and has never been controlled by the PRC.\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of Hong Kong.svg}} '''[[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]] (Hong Kong SAR)''' \u2014 Hong Kong is a semi-independent city in [[South China]] that ultimately falls under the sovereignty of the PRC.\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of Macau.svg}} '''[[Macau|Macao (Macau) Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]] (Macau/Macao SAR)''' \u2014 Macau is a semi-independent city in South China that ultimately falls under the sovereignty of the PRC.\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of Taiwan.svg}} '''[[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (Taiwan or ROC)''' \u2014 Taiwan is an [[Island country|island state]] with [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|very limited official recognition of its sovereignty]] that is located to the southeast of China in the [[Pacific Ocean]], geographically separated from China by the approximately 180-kilometer-wide [[Taiwan Strait]]. Compared to China, Taiwan is approximately 265 times smaller by area (area comparable to [[Bhutan]]) and approximately 58 times less populous (population comparable to [[North Korea]]). The [[Constitution of the Republic of China|constitution of the ROC]] includes territorial claims to most of China, [[Mongolia]], and other relatively minor territories that are administered by other countries. However, the [[Government of the Republic of China|government of Taiwan (ROC)]] doesn't act on the majority of these territorial claims. The [[political status of Taiwan]] is highly ambiguous and controversial. [[Diplomacy|Diplomatic relations]] between China and Taiwan are formally known as [[Cross-Strait relations]] since neither country officially recognizes the other.\n\nThe most significant secessionist movement in China is the [[Taiwan independence movement]]. The movement is complicated by the fact that the Republic of China, which administers the territory known as \"[[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]]\" and [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|a few minor islands]] located in \"[[mainland China]]\", is currently engaged in a sovereignty dispute with the People's Republic of China over which government is the legitimate government of \"[[Greater China|all of China]]\", which is said to include both mainland China and Taiwan.\n\nThe second most significant secessionist movement in China is the [[Tibetan independence movement|Tibet independence movement]], which has historically received widespread attention across the [[Western world]] following the [[incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China]]. China (PRC) currently administers the [[Tibet|historical region of Tibet]] as two main subdivisions, which are [[Qinghai|Qinghai Province]] and the [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous Region]].\n\nThe third most significant secessionist movement in China is the [[Uyghur nationalism|East Turkestan independence movement]], which has recently come to the attention of foreign media following accusations that China (PRC) has established \"[[Xinjiang re-education camps|re-education camps]]\" in the [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Autonomous Region]], which are holding hundreds of thousands or even up to a million [[Islam in China|Muslims]] (especially [[Uyghurs|ethnic Uyghurs]]) without trial.\n\nThe fourth most significant secessionist movement in China is the [[Inner Mongolian independence movement|South Mongolia independence movement]], which primarily aims to achieve independence for the Chinese (PRC) [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]] as \"South Mongolia\" and which secondarily aims to incorporate South Mongolia into the currently existing sovereign state known as \"[[Mongolia]]\". This movement has much lower [[grassroots]] support compared to the other major secessionist movements in China.\n\nAdditionally, the regions of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], which are both administered as \"[[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]]\" of China (PRC), are hosts to their own independence movements. Currently, the two regions are already highly autonomous, but they are gradually being encroached on by China (PRC), and their autonomy officially ends in 2047 and 2049 respectively. The [[Hong Kong independence|independence movement in Hong Kong]] is stronger than the one in Macau.\n\nFurthermore, there are other minor secessionist movements in China, such as the [[Manchurian nationalism|Manchuria independence movement]], [[Shanghai]] independence movement, Cantonia ([[Guangdong]]) independence movement, etc. However, these movements are somewhat negligible compared to the aforementioned movements.\n\n==List of secessionist movements in People's Republic of China==\n==== Notes ====\n\n* {{flagdeco|Taiwan}} [[Taiwan]] is not included in this list because it has never been governed by the [[People's Republic of China]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"175\" |Claimed Territory\n! width=\"200\" |Currently Under\n! width=\"100\" |Capital City\n! width=\"100\" |Area\n! width=\"100\" |Population\n! width=\"125\" |Ethnic Group\n! width=\"175\" |Primary Independence Movement\n|-\n|'''{{flagdeco|East Turkestan}} [[East Turkestan]]''' ||[[Xinjiang]]\n||[[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]]|| align=\"center\" |1,700,000 || align=\"center\" |20,000,000 ||[[Uyghurs|Uyghur people]]||[[East Turkestan independence movement]]\n|-\n|'''Eastern Mongolia''' ||[[Inner Mongolia]]<br>\n* [[Hulunbuir]]\n|[[Hailar District|Hailar]]\n| align=\"center\" |263,953 || align=\"center\" |2,500,000 ||[[Daur people]]||Eastern Mongolia independence movement\n|-\n|'''[[File:Flag of the Zhuang people.svg|23px|border]] Gvangjsih''' ||[[Guangxi]]\n|[[Nanning]] (Namzningz)\n| align=\"center\" |236,700 || align=\"center\" |50,000,000 ||[[Zhuang people]]||Zhuang independence movement\n|-\n|'''{{flagdeco|Hong Kong}} Hong Kong'''||[[Hong Kong]]\n||[[Hong Kong]]|| align=\"center\" |1,110 || align=\"center\" |7,500,000 ||[[Hongkongers|Hong Kong people]]||[[Hong Kong independence|Hong Kong independence movement]]\n|-\n|'''[[File:Flag of the Inner Mongolian People's Party.svg|23px|border]] Inner Mongolia'''||[[Inner Mongolia]]\n||[[Hohhot]]|| align=\"center\" |1,183,000 || align=\"center\" |25,000,000 ||[[Mongols in China|Chinese Mongols]]||[[Inner Mongolian independence movement]]\n|-\n|'''[[File:Lahu flag.svg|23px|border]] Lahu Republic''' ||[[Yunnan]]<br>\n* [[Lancang Lahu Autonomous County]]\n|[[Pu'er City|Pu'er]]\n| align=\"center\" |8,807 || align=\"center\" |8,000,000 ||[[Lahu people]]||Lahu independence movement\n|-\n|'''{{flagdeco|Macau}} Macau''' ||[[Macau]]\n||[[Macau]]|| align=\"center\" |115 || align=\"center\" |700,000 ||[[Macau people]]||[[Macau independence|Macau independence movement]]\n|-\n|'''[[File:Ma clique flag kaiserreich.png|23px|border]] Ninghsia''' ||[[Ningxia]]\n|[[Yinchuan]] (Yinchwan)\n| align=\"center\" |66,400 || align=\"center\" |11,000,000 ||[[Hui people]]||Hui independence movement\n|-\n|'''Teoshan''' ||[[Guangdong]]<br>\n* [[Chaozhou]]\n* [[Shantou]]\n* [[Jieyang]]\n|[[Chaozhou]] (Teochew)\n| align=\"center\" |10,415 || align=\"center\" |14,000,000 ||[[Teochew people]]||Teoshan independence movement\n|-\n|'''{{flagdeco|Tibet}} [[Tibet]]''' ||[[Tibet Autonomous Region]]<br>[[Qinghai]]\n||[[Lhasa]]|| align=\"center\" |2,500,000 || align=\"center\" |10,000,000 ||[[Tibetan people]]||[[Tibetan independence movement]]\n|}\n\n== Taiwan (ROC) ==\n=== Overview of Taiwan (ROC) ===\n[[Image:Locator map of the ROC Taiwan.svg|thumb|right|ROC-controlled territories]]\n{{Main|Taiwan}}\n[[Taiwan|Taiwan (ROC)]] is a [[List of states with limited recognition|state with limited recognition]] located primarily on [[Geography of Taiwan|the main island of Taiwan]], as well as some satellite islands surrounding Taiwan, including the archipelagos of [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]. The political status of Kinmen and Matsu within Taiwan is disputed.\n\nTaiwan (ROC) was preceded by two [[State (polity)|states]] which have, essentially, been in the process of merging into a single state since 1945.\n\n* [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese Formosa (Taiwan)]] \u2014 This state was a [[colony]] of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] for fifty years. The Japanese Empire had acquired the territory of Taiwan from the [[Qing dynasty]] (of China) after winning the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895. Due to the fact that Japanese Formosa previously belonged to a Chinese [[regime]], future Chinese regimes would all lay claim to Japanese Formosa after winning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].\n* [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]] \u2014 This state once represented [[China and the United Nations|China in the United Nations]]. However, in 1949, the state lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] against the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] and was forced to flee from its own borders and into Japanese Formosa. The Republic of China had recently occupied and annexed Japanese Formosa four years earlier, in 1945. This left a unique situation wherein the [[Rump state|rump-state]] of the Republic of China was, essentially, overlapping with the remnants of a now-defunct Japanese Formosa. Note that this was not a perfect overlap since the Republic of China still managed to hold onto a few small pieces of China, namely Kinmen (including [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]]) and Matsu.\n\nIn modern times, the [[political status of Taiwan]] has developed into, perhaps, one of the most unique geopolitical anomalies currently in existence worldwide. The [[Revolution|revolutionary]] forces that drove the [[Republic of China on Taiwan|Republic of China out of China and into Taiwan]] established a new Chinese regime shortly before this occurred, and named it the \"[[China|People's Republic of China]]\". This regime not only lays claim to all of the Republic of China's previously-held territory in China but also the Republic of China's newly-acquired territory in Taiwan. To this day, the People's Republic of China is still laying claim to Taiwan, and the Republic of China still controls Taiwan.\n\n=== Ethnic groups of Taiwan (ROC) ===\n{{Main|Taiwanese people|Han Taiwanese|Taiwanese indigenous peoples}}\n[[Image:Map of Taiwan.jpg|thumb|right|Topography of Taiwan]]\n\nOfficially, Taiwan (ROC) is home to two main native ethnic groups, the [[Han Chinese]] (aka \"[[Han Taiwanese]]\") and the [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] (who are ethnically [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]]). Additionally, these two main native ethnic groups can be classified into several subdivisions. Regarding the Han Chinese, they can be divided into the [[Hoklo Taiwanese|Taiwanese Hoklo people]], the [[Taiwanese Hakka|Taiwanese Hakka people]], and the somewhat outdated term \"[[Mainland Chinese]] in Taiwan (ROC)\" (which refers to Mainland Chinese people who migrated to the territory of Taiwan during the late-1940s and early-1950s). Regarding the Taiwanese indigenous peoples, there are currently sixteen officially recognized tribes, and perhaps several more which are officially unrecognized. \n\nThe Taiwanese Hoklo and Taiwanese Hakka peoples, as well as, occasionally, the Taiwanese indigenous peoples, are often collectively referred to as \"Taiwanese Benshengren\" by the peoples of Taiwan (ROC), which roughly translates to \"Original Province Person(s)\". Meanwhile, the Mainland Chinese in Taiwan (ROC) (not to be confused with [[Chinese people|PRC citizens]] in Taiwan), who originate from various provinces of China, are often referred to as \"Taiwanese Waishengren\" by the peoples of Taiwan (ROC), which roughly translates to \"Outside Province Person(s)\".\n\nThese are the respective proportionate populations of these ethnic groups in Taiwan (ROC).\n\n* Taiwanese Benshengren people make up around 86% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n** Taiwanese Hoklo people make up around 70% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n** Taiwanese Hakka people make up around 14% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n** Taiwanese indigenous peoples make up around 2% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n* Taiwanese Waishengren people make up around 14% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n\n==== The peoples of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang) ====\n{{See also|Taiwan independence movement#The issue of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang)}}\nFurthermore, the peoples of Kinmen and Matsu may identify themselves as \"Kinmenese\" and \"Matsunese\", respectively. The Kinmenese and Matsunese peoples are mostly Hoklo (Han) people, but whether they identify as \"Taiwanese\" is inconsistent throughout their populations. Historically, Kinmen and Matsu were parts of [[Fujian|Fujian Province, China]], and were never parts of Japanese Formosa or other historical Taiwanese regimes. However, Kinmen and Matsu have been administered by Taiwan (ROC) ever since 1949 (and by the ROC since it ruled mainland China). As such, although Kinmen and Matsu are not technically parts of the territory of Taiwan, many people living in these territories or originating from them view themselves as \"Taiwanese\", in a variety of contexts. Conversely, many people living in these territories still identify as Mainland Chinese, distinct from \"Mainland Chinese in Taiwan (ROC)\" or \"Taiwanese Waishengren\".\n\n==== Ethnic groups of Taiwan Province, PRC ====\n{{See also|Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China}}\nChina (PRC) claims [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]] as its own province and hence has its own ethnic classifications for the native ethnic groups. However, most countries disregard these ethnic classifications in favour of the local ethnic classifications defined by Taiwan (ROC).\n\nAccording to China (PRC), Taiwan is divided into the Han Chinese and the Gaoshanren. \"Gaoshanren\" means \"High mountain person(s)\" and refers to the various Taiwanese indigenous peoples as a single ethnic group.\n\n=== Primary forces supporting Taiwan independence ===\n{{Main|Taiwan independence movement|Pan-Green Coalition}}\n\n==== Pan-Green Coalition support for Taiwan independence ====\n[[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]] is a complex movement with many different parties being involved. The party which is most commonly associated with the movement is the [[Pan-Green Coalition]], a collective of several [[Political party|political parties]] which advocate for the independence of a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] [[sovereign state]] on Taiwan and [[Penghu]] (and sometimes also the ROC-controlled territories of [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]) by the name of the \"Republic of Taiwan\". [[File:Flag of World Taiwanese Congress.svg|22px|border]] [[File:Flag of Taiwan proposed 1996.svg|22px|border]] [[File:908\u53f0\u7063\u570b\u904b\u52d5.svg|22px|border]] This movement is the most well-known one internationally since the most senior political party in the Pan-Green Coalition, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], has risen to power in Taiwan (ROC) twice within the past two decades. Notably, this has been achieved by [[Democracy|democratic]] [[Election|elections]], rather than by [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]]. This indicates that there is widespread support (or, at the very least, complacency) in Taiwan (ROC) regarding the Taiwan independence movement (as defined by the Pan-Green Coalition).\n\nOther major political parties associated with the Pan-Green Coalition include the [[New Power Party]] and the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]]. Additionally the organization [[World United Formosans for Independence]] is an ally of the Pan-Green Coalition.\n\n==== Indigenous independence movements ====\n\nWhile many [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese indigenous people(s)]] support the Pan-Green Coalition, many also support the [[Taiwan First Nations Party]], a political party in Taiwan (ROC) which specifically advocates for the autonomy or possible independence of the Taiwan indigenous peoples. The [[Council of Indigenous Peoples]] is also closely affiliated with the movement advocating for Taiwanese indigenous autonomy or independence. An autonomous or independent Taiwanese indigenous state might be named \"[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples#Aboriginal political movement|Aborigines of Taiwan's Autonomy]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/first-nations-taiwan-special-report-taiwans-indigenous|title=The First Nations of Taiwan: A Special Report on Taiwan's indigenous peoples|website=www.culturalsurvival.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>.\n\n=== Primary forces opposed to Taiwan independence ===\n{{Main|One-China policy|Anti-Secession Law|1992 Consensus}}\nThe relationship of China with Taiwan is confusing and convoluted. Simply put, Taiwan (ROC) is an independent country which is competing with China (PRC) for recognition as the sole legitimate government of China, and within Taiwan (ROC) there is a nationwide secessionist movement which has garnered the support of roughly half the country. The secessionist movement in Taiwan (ROC) is equally aimed at both the Taiwan (ROC) government itself as well as the China (PRC) government which is claiming the entirety of Taiwan (ROC) as its own territory.\n\nChina (PRC) is widely recognized as the legitimate government of both China and Taiwan. This means that the Taiwan (ROC) country is not only fighting against Taiwanese secessionists, but also against China (PRC) simultaneously. Compared to China (PRC), Taiwan (ROC) is at a severe disadvantage but isn't completely powerless, since most of the world isn't too supportive of the possible dissolving of the Taiwan (ROC) country. However, the sovereignty of Taiwan (ROC) is being critically threatened by the Taiwan independence movement, which essentially aims to overthrow Taiwan (ROC).\n\n==== China (PRC) opposition to Taiwan independence ====\n{{Main|Taiwan, China}}\nChina (PRC) considers Taiwan area, which is currently administered by Taiwan (ROC), as part of its own territory, and forces other countries to abide by a \"[[One-China policy]]\" as a prerequisite for establishing official diplomatic relations with China (PRC). The One-China policy is aimed at both the rival Chinese government known as the \"Republic of China\", as well as the localist Taiwan independence movement. In 2005, China (PRC) passed the \"[[Anti-Secession Law]]\" in an attempt to suppress the Taiwan independence movement.\n\n==== Pan-Blue Coalition opposition to Taiwan independence ====\n{{Main|Pan-Blue Coalition}}\nThe [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] of Taiwan (ROC) is an alliance of political parties which are loyal to the ROC, currently restricted to the territory of Taiwan and some minor islands of Fujian Province. The Pan-Blue Coalition asserts that the ROC is the sole legitimate government of all of China, which consists of \"both mainland China and Taiwan\", and that the ROC has never for a single day lost its sovereignty. The Pan-Blue Coalition is opposed to Taiwan independence but is also opposed to a PRC takeover of Taiwan.\n\n== China (PRC) (aka \"mainland China\") ==\n[[File:China autonomous regions numbered.svg|thumb]]\n\n\n{{further|Autonomous administrative divisions of China|Special administrative regions of China|One country, Two systems||}}\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China (China/PRC)]] considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of \"both mainland China area and Taiwan area\".\n\nThe territory controlled by the PRC consists of [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]. The PRC also claims all [[Taiwan|ROC]]-controlled territories as part of its own territory. The PRC has established \"[[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]]\" (SARs) in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] under the [[one country, two systems|One Country Two Systems]] policy. \n\n=== Tibet region (Qinghai, Xizang, etc) ===\n{{Main|Tibetan independence movement}}\n\nThe [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are an ethnic group in Tibet that is distinct from the [[Han Chinese]]. Their proposed state is Tibet. {{flagicon|Tibet}} Supporters of Tibetan independence believe that Tibet is a distinct country which is being occupied by China (PRC). The [[Tibet|Tibet region]] was independent before the [[Mongols]] invaded the Tibet region and incorporated it into the [[Mongol Empire]]. After this, Tibet became part of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (of China), then the [[Qing dynasty]] (of China), then experienced a few decades of ''de facto'' independence before it was incorporated into China (PRC). \n\nAfter the failed Tibetan uprising, some Tibetans followed the Dalai Lama into India, establishing a government-in-exile called the [[Central Tibetan Administration]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dalailama.com/page.99.htm|title=Speech of His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the European Parliament, Strasbourg|date=14 October 2001|publisher=The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325221348/http://www.dalailama.com/page.99.htm|archivedate=25 March 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=11 April 2009}}</ref>, a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]], in Dharmashala, Himachal Pradesh, India.

Their advocacy groups include the [[Students for a Free Tibet]], the [[Tibetan Youth Congress]], and the [[International Campaign for Tibet]].\n\n=== Xinjiang Autonomous Region ===\n{{Main|Uyghur independence}}\nXinjiang is home to several ethnic groups, including the [[Uyghurs]], the [[Kazakhs in China|Kazakhs]], the [[Tajiks of Xinjiang|Tajiks]], as well as the [[Han Chinese]]. \n\nThe ethnic Uyghur people view themselves as [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to Xinjiang, but the government of China (PRC) opposes this notion. Whether they are indigenous is very significant, because it defines whether Xinjiang \"belongs\" to the Uyghurs or to China (PRC). China (PRC) has been in the process of encouraging Han Chinese settlement in Xinjiang for several decades, which is a source of concern for the Uyghur secessionists of Xinjiang.\n\nThe Uyghur secessionists propose independence for Xinjiang as [[East Turkestan]]. [[File:Kokbayraq flag.svg|22px|border]] The borders of the proposed state will roughly match the borders of the Chinese autonomous region which currently occupies the territory. Uyghur secessionists have set up a government-in-exile called the [[East Turkistan Government in Exile|East Turkestan Government in Exile]]. \n\nThe main advocacy group of Uyghur independence is the [[World Uyghur Congress]], a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].\n\n==== Conflict in Xinjiang ====\n{{Main|Xinjiang conflict|Xinjiang re-education camps}}\nSeveral armed insurgency groups are fighting the Chinese (PRC) government in Xinjiang, namely the [[Turkistan Islamic Party|Turkestan Islamic Party]] and the [[East Turkestan Liberation Organization]], which some people consider to be associated with [[Al Qaeda|Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2017/03/al-qaeda-and-islamic-state-take-aim-at-china/|title=Al-Qaeda and Islamic State Take Aim at China.

Officially, Hong Kong is considered to be a [[Special administrative regions of China|'''Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China''']]. Geographically, Hong Kong is attached to [[mainland China]] via [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in the [[South China|south]] but lies mostly on a small [[peninsula]], of which [[Kowloon Peninsula]] is a part, as well as many small islands nearby to the peninsula, the most notable of which is [[Hong Kong Island]].\n\nHistorically, Hong Kong Island was ceded by the [[Qing dynasty]] to the [[British Empire]] in 1842 following the British victory in the [[First Opium War]] and was promptly developed into a [[Crown colony|British colony]]. The nearby Kowloon Peninsula was ceded in 1860 following the British victory in the [[Second Opium War]] and was incorporated into Hong Kong. Finally, the last major territorial acquisition was the nearby [[New Territories]], leased by the British for 99 years in 1898 by means of the [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory]]; this territorial change was made in the aftermath of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], which Hong Kong was not directly involved in.\n\nIn 1997, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] in order to [[Handover of Hong Kong|transfer Hong Kong]] from the United Kingdom to China. China agreed to govern Hong Kong under a so-called \"[[One country, two systems|One Country Two Systems]]\" framework, which would grant Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy whilst simultaneously granting China sovereignty over Hong Kong.\n\n==== Culture ====\n{{Main|Culture of Hong Kong}}\nThe three main regions of Hong Kong, consisting of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon Peninsula, and the New Territories, were all under British rule for different lengths of time, ranging from 99 to 155 years. Due to this lengthy period of British rule, Hong Kong's infrastructure, society, and culture became broadly British. Hong Kong also developed a distinct culture from mainland China because many [[Mainland Chinese]] immigrated to Hong Kong, often illegally, in order to escape persecution by the [[Communist Party of China]] or to seek better living standards. Most of the Mainland Chinese immigrants to Hong Kong were [[Cantonese people]], though there were also significant numbers of [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]], [[Teochew people|Teochew]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]], and [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] immigrants. In the present day, the vast majority of Hong Kong people can trace their ancestry, whether fully or partially, to these Cantonese immigrants or others who came to Hong Kong throughout the 20th century. Native Hong Kong people, that is, people who were living in Hong Kong prior to British rule, constitute a minority of the population. Hong Kong also hosts minority populations of [[South Asian ethnic groups|South Asians]], [[Ethnic groups of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asians]], [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], [[North America|North Americans]], and other broad ethnic groups.\n\n==== Independence movement ====\n{{main|Hong Kong independence}}The Hong Kong independence movement advocates for the full independence of Hong Kong as a \"[[city-state]]\", similar to [[Singapore]]. Related sovereign movements in Hong Kong include the movement to maintain Hong Kong's status as a \"Special Administrative Region\" indefinitely, the movement to return Hong Kong to [[British Hong Kong|British rule]], the movement to admit Hong Kong into the [[United States|United States of America]], and the movement to admit Hong Kong into the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]].\n\n=== Macau ===\n{{Empty section|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Related pages==\n* [[Demographics of China#Population density and distribution|Demographics of China]]\n* [[Template:Han Chinese subgroups]]\n* [[Ethnic minorities in China]]\n* [[Ethnic issues in China]]\n* [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history]]\n* [[Languages of China]]\n* [[Language Atlas of China]]\n* [[Standard Chinese]]\n* [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China]]\n* [[Administrative divisions of China]]\n* [[Autonomous regions of China]]\n* [[Anti-Secession Law]]\n* [[Xinjiang conflict]]\n* [[List of active separatist movements in Asia]]\n* [[Political status of Taiwan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Other websites==\n* {{YouTube|C4W5Rhg9wIk|China must stop the genocide in East Turkestan Special News Daily Voice News}}\n\n{{Secession in Countries}}\n\n[[Category:National liberation movements]]\n[[Category:Politics of China]]\n[[Category:Separatism in China]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Qing Empire circa 1820 EN.svg|thumb|Inner Mongolia and [[Outer Mongolia]] within the Qing dynasty, c. 1820]]\n[[File:Chine 1923-1924.png|thumb|[[Warlord Era]] of China, 1924]]\n\n'''Secession in China''' refers to several secessionist movements in [[Greater China]], which includes the following states and territories:\n* {{flagicon image|Flag of China.svg}} '''[[China|People's Republic of China]] (China or PRC)''' \u2014 China is a [[List of countries and dependencies by area|geographically very large]] (area comparable to the [[United States]]) and [[List of countries and dependencies by population|immensely populous]] (population comparable to [[India]]) country that is [[Administrative divisions of China|subdivided]] into 22 [[Provinces of China|provinces]], 5 [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], 4 [[Direct-administered municipalities of China|direct-administered municipalities]], and [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|1 claimed province (Taiwan)]]. The People\u2019s Republic of China additionally claims [[Taiwan, China|Taiwan]], which remains governed by the [[Republic of China]] and has never been controlled by the PRC.\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of Hong Kong.svg}} '''[[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]] (Hong Kong SAR)''' \u2014 Hong Kong is a semi-independent city in [[South China]] that ultimately falls under the sovereignty of the PRC.\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of Macau.svg}} '''[[Macau|Macao (Macau) Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]] (Macau/Macao SAR)''' \u2014 Macau is a semi-independent city in South China that ultimately falls under the sovereignty of the PRC.\n*{{flagicon image|Flag of Taiwan.svg}} '''[[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (Taiwan or ROC)''' \u2014 Taiwan is an [[Island country|island state]] with [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|very limited official recognition of its sovereignty]] that is located to the southeast of China in the [[Pacific Ocean]], geographically separated from China by the approximately 180-kilometer-wide [[Taiwan Strait]]. Compared to China, Taiwan is approximately 265 times smaller by area (area comparable to [[Bhutan]]) and approximately 58 times less populous (population comparable to [[North Korea]]). The [[Constitution of the Republic of China|constitution of the ROC]] includes territorial claims to most of China, [[Mongolia]], and other relatively minor territories that are administered by other countries. However, the [[Government of the Republic of China|government of Taiwan (ROC)]] doesn't act on the majority of these territorial claims. The [[political status of Taiwan]] is highly ambiguous and controversial. [[Diplomacy|Diplomatic relations]] between China and Taiwan are formally known as [[Cross-Strait relations]] since neither country officially recognizes the other.\n\nThe most significant secessionist movement in China is the [[Taiwan independence movement]]. The movement is complicated by the fact that the Republic of China, which administers the territory known as \"[[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]]\" and [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|a few minor islands]] located in \"[[mainland China]]\", is currently engaged in a sovereignty dispute with the People's Republic of China over which government is the legitimate government of \"[[Greater China|all of China]]\", which is said to include both mainland China and Taiwan.\n\nThe second most significant secessionist movement in China is the [[Tibetan independence movement|Tibet independence movement]], which has historically received widespread attention across the [[Western world]] following the [[incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China]]. China (PRC) currently administers the [[Tibet|historical region of Tibet]] as two main subdivisions, which are [[Qinghai|Qinghai Province]] and the [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous Region]].\n\nThe third most significant secessionist movement in China is the [[Uyghur nationalism|East Turkestan independence movement]], which has recently come to the attention of foreign media following accusations that China (PRC) has established \"[[Xinjiang re-education camps|re-education camps]]\" in the [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Autonomous Region]], which are holding hundreds of thousands or even up to a million [[Islam in China|Muslims]] (especially [[Uyghurs|ethnic Uyghurs]]) without trial.\n\nThe fourth most significant secessionist movement in China is the [[Inner Mongolian independence movement|South Mongolia independence movement]], which primarily aims to achieve independence for the Chinese (PRC) [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]] as \"South Mongolia\" and which secondarily aims to incorporate South Mongolia into the currently existing sovereign state known as \"[[Mongolia]]\". This movement has much lower [[grassroots]] support compared to the other major secessionist movements in China.\n\nAdditionally, the regions of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], which are both administered as \"[[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]]\" of China (PRC), are hosts to their own independence movements. Currently, the two regions are already highly autonomous, but they are gradually being encroached on by China (PRC), and their autonomy officially ends in 2047 and 2049 respectively. The [[Hong Kong independence|independence movement in Hong Kong]] is stronger than the one in Macau.\n\nFurthermore, there are other minor secessionist movements in China, such as the [[Manchurian nationalism|Manchuria independence movement]], [[Shanghai]] independence movement, Cantonia ([[Guangdong]]) independence movement, etc. However, these movements are somewhat negligible compared to the aforementioned movements.\n\n==List of secessionist movements in People's Republic of China==\n==== Notes ====\n\n* {{flagdeco|Taiwan}} [[Taiwan]] is not included in this list because it has never

(ROC) ==\n=== Overview of Taiwan (ROC) ===\n[[Image:Locator map of the ROC Taiwan.svg|thumb|right|ROC-controlled territories]]\n{{Main|Taiwan}}\n[[Taiwan|Taiwan (ROC)]] is a [[List of states with limited recognition|state with limited recognition]] located primarily on [[Geography of Taiwan|the main island of Taiwan]], as well as some satellite islands surrounding Taiwan, including the archipelagos of [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]. The political status of Kinmen and Matsu within Taiwan is disputed.\n\nTaiwan (ROC) was preceded by two [[State (polity)|states]] which have, essentially, been in the process of merging into a single state since 1945.\n\n* [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese Formosa (Taiwan)]] \u2014 This state was a [[colony]] of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] for fifty years. The Japanese Empire had acquired the territory of Taiwan from the [[Qing dynasty]] (of China) after winning the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895. Due to the fact that Japanese Formosa previously belonged to a Chinese [[regime]], future Chinese regimes would all lay claim to Japanese Formosa after winning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].\n* [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)]] \u2014 This state once represented [[China and the United Nations|China in the United Nations]]. However, in 1949, the state lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] against the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] and was forced to flee from its own borders and into Japanese Formosa. The Republic of China had recently occupied and annexed Japanese Formosa four years earlier, in 1945. This left a unique situation wherein the [[Rump state|rump-state]] of the Republic of China was, essentially, overlapping with the remnants of a now-defunct Japanese Formosa. Note that this was not a perfect overlap since the Republic of China still managed to hold onto a few small pieces of China, namely Kinmen (including [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu]]) and Matsu.\n\nIn modern times, the [[political status of Taiwan]] has developed into, perhaps, one of the most unique geopolitical anomalies currently in existence worldwide. The [[Revolution|revolutionary]] forces that drove the [[Republic of China on Taiwan|Republic of China out of China and into Taiwan]] established a new Chinese regime shortly before this occurred, and named it the \"[[China|People's Republic of China]]\". This regime not only lays claim to all of the Republic of China's previously-held territory in China but also the Republic of China's newly-acquired territory in Taiwan. To this day, the People's Republic of China is still laying claim to Taiwan, and the Republic of China still controls Taiwan.\n\n=== Ethnic groups of Taiwan (ROC) ===\n{{Main|Taiwanese people|Han Taiwanese|Taiwanese indigenous peoples}}\n[[Image:Map of Taiwan.jpg|thumb|right|Topography of Taiwan]]\n\nOfficially, Taiwan (ROC) is home to two main native ethnic groups, the [[Han Chinese]] (aka \"[[Han Taiwanese]]\") and the [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] (who are ethnically [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]]). Additionally, these two main native ethnic groups can be classified into several subdivisions. Regarding the Han Chinese, they can be divided into the [[Hoklo Taiwanese|Taiwanese Hoklo people]], the [[Taiwanese Hakka|Taiwanese Hakka people]], and the somewhat outdated term \"[[Mainland Chinese]] in Taiwan (ROC)\" (which refers to Mainland Chinese people who migrated to the territory of Taiwan during the late-1940s and early-1950s). Regarding the Taiwanese indigenous peoples, there are currently sixteen officially recognized tribes, and perhaps several more which are officially unrecognized. \n\nThe Taiwanese Hoklo and Taiwanese Hakka peoples, as well as, occasionally, the Taiwanese indigenous peoples, are often collectively referred to as \"Taiwanese Benshengren\" by the peoples of Taiwan (ROC), which roughly translates to \"Original Province Person(s)\". Meanwhile, the Mainland Chinese in Taiwan (ROC) (not to be confused with [[Chinese people|PRC citizens]] in Taiwan), who originate from various provinces of China, are often referred to as \"Taiwanese Waishengren\" by the peoples of Taiwan (ROC), which roughly translates to \"Outside Province Person(s)\".\n\nThese are the respective proportionate populations of these ethnic groups in Taiwan (ROC).\n\n* Taiwanese Benshengren people make up around 86% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n** Taiwanese Hoklo people make up around 70% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n** Taiwanese Hakka people make up around 14% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n** Taiwanese indigenous peoples make up around 2% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n* Taiwanese Waishengren people make up around 14% of the native population of Taiwan (ROC).\n\n==== The peoples of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang) ====\n{{See also|Taiwan independence movement#The issue of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang)}}\nFurthermore, the peoples of Kinmen and Matsu may identify themselves as \"Kinmenese\" and \"Matsunese\", respectively. The Kinmenese and Matsunese peoples are mostly Hoklo (Han) people, but whether they identify as \"Taiwanese\" is inconsistent throughout their populations. Historically, Kinmen and Matsu were parts of [[Fujian|Fujian Province, China]], and were never parts of Japanese Formosa or other historical Taiwanese regimes. However, Kinmen and Matsu have been administered by Taiwan (ROC) ever since 1949 (and by the ROC since it ruled mainland China). As such, although Kinmen and Matsu are not technically parts of the territory of Taiwan, many people living in these territories or originating from them view themselves as \"Taiwanese\", in a variety of contexts. Conversely, many people living in these territories still identify as Mainland Chinese, distinct from \"Mainland Chinese in Taiwan (ROC)\" or \"Taiwanese Waishengren\".\n\n==== Ethnic groups of Taiwan Province, PRC ====\n{{See also|Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China}}\nChina (PRC) claims [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Penghu]] as its own province and hence has its own ethnic classifications for the native ethnic groups. However, most countries disregard these ethnic classifications in favour of the local ethnic classifications defined by Taiwan (ROC).\n\nAccording to China (PRC), Taiwan is divided into the Han Chinese and the Gaoshanren. \"Gaoshanren\" means \"High mountain person(s)\" and refers to the various Taiwanese indigenous peoples as a single ethnic group.\n\n=== Primary forces supporting Taiwan independence ===\n{{Main|Taiwan independence movement|Pan-Green Coalition}}\n\n==== Pan-Green Coalition support for Taiwan independence ====\n[[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]] is a complex movement with many different parties being involved. The party which is most commonly associated with the movement is the [[Pan-Green Coalition]], a collective of several [[Political party|political parties]] which advocate for the independence of a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] [[sovereign state]] on Taiwan and [[Penghu]] (and sometimes also the ROC-controlled territories of [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]) by the name of the \"Republic of Taiwan\". [[File:Flag of World Taiwanese Congress.svg|22px|border]] [[File:Flag of Taiwan proposed 1996.svg|22px|border]] [[File:908\u53f0\u7063\u570b\u904b\u52d5.svg|22px|border]] This movement is the most well-known one internationally since the most senior political party in the Pan-Green Coalition, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], has risen to power in Taiwan (ROC) twice within the past two decades. Notably, this has been achieved by [[Democracy|democratic]] [[Election|elections]], rather than by [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]]. This indicates that there is widespread support (or, at the very least, complacency) in Taiwan (ROC) regarding the Taiwan independence movement (as defined by the Pan-Green Coalition).\n\nOther major political parties associated with the Pan-Green Coalition include the [[New Power Party]] and the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]]. Additionally the organization [[World United Formosans for Independence]] is an ally of the Pan-Green Coalition.\n\n==== Indigenous independence movements ====\n\nWhile many [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese indigenous people(s)]] support the Pan-Green Coalition, many also support the [[Taiwan First Nations Party]], a political party in Taiwan (ROC) which specifically advocates for the autonomy or possible independence of the Taiwan indigenous peoples. The [[Council of Indigenous Peoples]] is also closely affiliated with the movement advocating for Taiwanese indigenous autonomy or independence. An autonomous or independent Taiwanese indigenous state might be named \"[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples#Aboriginal political movement|Aborigines of Taiwan's Autonomy]]\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/first-nations-taiwan-special-report-taiwans-indigenous|title=The First Nations of Taiwan: A Special Report on Taiwan's indigenous peoples|website=www.culturalsurvival.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>.\n\n=== Primary forces opposed to Taiwan independence ===\n{{Main|One-China policy|Anti-Secession Law|1992 Consensus}}\nThe relationship of China with Taiwan is confusing and convoluted. Simply put, Taiwan (ROC) is an independent country which is competing with China (PRC) for recognition as the sole legitimate government of China, and within Taiwan (ROC) there is a nationwide secessionist movement which has garnered the support of roughly half the country. The secessionist movement in Taiwan (ROC) is equally aimed at both the Taiwan (ROC) government itself as well as the China (PRC) government which is claiming the entirety of Taiwan (ROC) as its own territory.\n\nChina (PRC) is widely recognized as the legitimate government of both China and Taiwan. This means that the Taiwan (ROC) country is not only fighting against Taiwanese secessionists, but also against China (PRC) simultaneously. Compared to China (PRC), Taiwan (ROC) is at a severe disadvantage but isn't completely powerless, since most of the world isn't too supportive of the possible dissolving of the Taiwan (ROC) country. However, the sovereignty of Taiwan (ROC) is being critically threatened by the Taiwan independence movement, which essentially aims to overthrow Taiwan (ROC).\n\n==== China (PRC) opposition to Taiwan independence ====\n{{Main|Taiwan, China}}\nChina (PRC) considers Taiwan area, which is currently administered by Taiwan (ROC), as part of its own territory, and forces other countries to abide by a \"[[One-China policy]]\" as a prerequisite for establishing official diplomatic relations with China (PRC). The One-China policy is aimed at both the rival Chinese government known as the \"Republic of China\", as well as the localist Taiwan independence movement. In 2005, China (PRC) passed the \"[[Anti-Secession Law]]\" in an attempt to suppress the Taiwan independence movement.\n\n==== Pan-Blue Coalition opposition to Taiwan independence ====\n{{Main|Pan-Blue Coalition}}\nThe [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] of Taiwan (ROC) is an alliance of political parties which are loyal to the ROC, currently restricted to the territory of Taiwan and some minor islands of Fujian Province. The Pan-Blue Coalition asserts that the ROC is the sole legitimate government of all of China, which consists of \"both mainland China and Taiwan\", and that the ROC has never for a single day lost its sovereignty. The Pan-Blue Coalition is opposed to Taiwan independence but is also opposed to a PRC takeover of Taiwan.\n\n== China (PRC) (aka \"mainland China\") ==\n[[File:China autonomous regions numbered.svg|thumb]]\n\n\n{{further|Autonomous administrative divisions of China|Special administrative regions of China|One country, Two systems||}}\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China (China/PRC)]] considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of \"both mainland China area and Taiwan area\".\n\nThe territory controlled by the PRC consists of [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]. The PRC also claims all [[Taiwan|ROC]]-controlled territories as part of its own territory. The PRC has established \"[[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]]\" (SARs) in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] under the [[one country, two systems|One Country Two Systems]] policy. \n\n=== Tibet region (Qinghai, Xizang, etc) ===\n{{Main|Tibetan independence movement}}\n\nThe [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are an ethnic group in Tibet that is distinct from the [[Han Chinese]]. Their proposed state is Tibet. {{flagicon|Tibet}} Supporters of Tibetan independence believe that Tibet is a distinct country which is being occupied by China (PRC). The [[Tibet|Tibet region]] was independent before the [[Mongols]] invaded the Tibet region and incorporated it into the [[Mongol Empire]]. After this, Tibet became part of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (of China), then the [[Qing dynasty]] (of China), then experienced a few decades of ''de facto'' independence before it was incorporated into China (PRC). \n\nAfter the failed Tibetan uprising, some Tibetans followed the Dalai Lama into India, establishing a government-in-exile called the [[Central Tibetan Administration]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dalailama.com/page.99.htm|title=Speech of His Holiness the Dalai Lama to the European Parliament, Strasbourg|date=14 October 2001|publisher=The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325221348/http://www.dalailama.com/page.99.htm|archivedate=25 March 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=11 April 2009}}</ref>, a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]], in Dharmashala, Himachal Pradesh, India.

Their advocacy groups include the [[Students for a Free Tibet]], the [[Tibetan Youth Congress]], and the [[International Campaign for Tibet]].\n\n=== Xinjiang Autonomous Region ===\n{{Main|Uyghur independence}}\nXinjiang is home to several ethnic groups, including the [[Uyghurs]], the [[Kazakhs in China|Kazakhs]], the [[Tajiks of Xinjiang|Tajiks]], as well as the [[Han Chinese]]. \n\nThe ethnic Uyghur people view themselves as [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to Xinjiang, but the government of China (PRC) opposes this notion. Whether they are indigenous is very significant, because it defines whether Xinjiang \"belongs\" to the Uyghurs or to China (PRC). China (PRC) has been in the process of encouraging Han Chinese settlement in Xinjiang for several decades, which is a source of concern for the Uyghur secessionists of Xinjiang.\n\nThe Uyghur secessionists propose independence for Xinjiang as [[East Turkestan]]. [[File:Kokbayraq flag.svg|22px|border]] The borders of the proposed state will roughly match the borders of the Chinese autonomous region which currently occupies the territory. Uyghur secessionists have set up a government-in-exile called the [[East Turkistan Government in Exile|East Turkestan Government in Exile]]. \n\nThe main advocacy group of Uyghur independence is the [[World Uyghur Congress]], a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].\n\n==== Conflict in Xinjiang ====\n{{Main|Xinjiang conflict|Xinjiang re-education camps}}\nSeveral armed insurgency groups are fighting the Chinese (PRC) government in Xinjiang, namely the [[Turkistan Islamic Party|Turkestan Islamic Party]] and the [[East Turkestan Liberation Organization]], which some people consider to be associated with [[Al Qaeda|Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2017/03/al-qaeda-and-islamic-state-take-aim-at-china/|title=Al-Qaeda and Islamic State Take Aim at China.

Officially, Hong Kong is considered to be a [[Special administrative regions of China|'''Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China''']]. Geographically, Hong Kong is attached to [[mainland China]] via [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in the [[South China|south]] but lies mostly on a small [[peninsula]], of which [[Kowloon Peninsula]] is a part, as well as many small islands nearby to the peninsula, the most notable of which is [[Hong Kong Island]].\n\nHistorically, Hong Kong Island was ceded by the [[Qing dynasty]] to the [[British Empire]] in 1842 following the British victory in the [[First Opium War]] and was promptly developed into a [[Crown colony|British colony]]. The nearby Kowloon Peninsula was ceded in 1860 following the British victory in the [[Second Opium War]] and was incorporated into Hong Kong. Finally, the last major territorial acquisition was the nearby [[New Territories]], leased by the British for 99 years in 1898 by means of the [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory]]; this territorial change was made in the aftermath of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], which Hong Kong was not directly involved in.\n\nIn 1997, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] signed the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] in order to [[Handover of Hong Kong|transfer Hong Kong]] from the United Kingdom to China. China agreed to govern Hong Kong under a so-called \"[[One country, two systems|One Country Two Systems]]\" framework, which would grant Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy whilst simultaneously granting China sovereignty over Hong Kong.\n\n==== Culture ====\n{{Main|Culture of Hong Kong}}\nThe three main regions of Hong Kong, consisting of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon Peninsula, and the New Territories, were all under British rule for different lengths of time, ranging from 99 to 155 years. Due to this lengthy period of British rule, Hong Kong's infrastructure, society, and culture became broadly British. Hong Kong also developed a distinct culture from mainland China because many [[Mainland Chinese]] immigrated to Hong Kong, often illegally, in order to escape persecution by the [[Communist Party of China]] or to seek better living standards. Most of the Mainland Chinese immigrants to Hong Kong were [[Cantonese people]], though there were also significant numbers of [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]], [[Teochew people|Teochew]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]], and [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] immigrants. In the present day, the vast majority of Hong Kong people can trace their ancestry, whether fully or partially, to these Cantonese immigrants or others who came to Hong Kong throughout the 20th century. Native Hong Kong people, that is, people who were living in Hong Kong prior to British rule, constitute a minority of the population. Hong Kong also hosts minority populations of [[South Asian ethnic groups|South Asians]], [[Ethnic groups of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asians]], [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], [[North America|North Americans]], and other broad ethnic groups.\n\n==== Independence movement ====\n{{main|Hong Kong independence}}The Hong Kong independence movement advocates for the full independence of Hong Kong as a \"[[city-state]]\", similar to [[Singapore]]. Related sovereign movements in Hong Kong include the movement to maintain Hong Kong's status as a \"Special Administrative Region\" indefinitely, the movement to return Hong Kong to [[British Hong Kong|British rule]], the movement to admit Hong Kong into the [[United States|United States of America]], and the movement to admit Hong Kong into the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]].\n\n=== Macau ===\n{{Empty section|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Related pages==\n* [[Demographics of China#Population density and distribution|Demographics of China]]\n* [[Template:Han Chinese subgroups]]\n* [[Ethnic minorities in China]]\n* [[Ethnic issues in China]]\n* [[Ethnic groups in Chinese history]]\n* [[Languages of China]]\n* [[Language Atlas of China]]\n* [[Standard Chinese]]\n* [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China]]\n* [[Administrative divisions of China]]\n* [[Autonomous regions of China]]\n* [[Anti-Secession Law]]\n* [[Xinjiang conflict]]\n* [[List of active separatist movements in Asia]]\n* [[Political status of Taiwan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Other websites==\n* {{YouTube|C4W5Rhg9wIk|China must stop the genocide in East Turkestan Special News Daily Voice News}}\n\n{{Secession in Countries}}\n\n[[Category:National liberation movements]]\n[[Category:Politics of China]]\n[[Category:Separatism in China]]\n", "name_user": "36.225.156.73", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eList of secessionist movements in People's Republic of China)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_China"}

{"title_page": "United States military ration", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n{{American cuisine}}\n[[Image:Mrepacket.jpg|thumb|Modern combat ration: [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat]]]]\nThe United States [[military rations|military ration]] refers to various preparations and packages of food provided to feed members of the [[United States armed forces|armed forces]]. U.S. military rations are often made for quick distribution, preparation, and eating in the field and tend to have long storage times in adverse conditions due to being thickly packaged and/or [[Shelf stable food|shelf-stable]].  The current ration is the [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat]] (MRE).\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of military nutrition in the United States}}\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n[[File:Civil War rations.jpg|thumb|A recreation of [[American Civil War]]-era ration storage]]\n\nFrom the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the United States army ration, as decreed by the [[Continental Congress]], was the [[garrison ration]], which consisted of [[meat]] or [[salt fish]], [[bread]] or [[hardtack]], and [[vegetable]]s.\n\nThere was also a [[distilled beverage|spirit]] ration. In 1785, it was set at four [[ounce]]s of [[rum]], reduced to two ounces of [[whisky|whiskey]], [[brandy]], or rum in 1790. In 1794, troops about to enter combat or who were engaged in frontier service could receive a double ration of four ounces of rum or whiskey; this was extended in 1799 to include troops engaged in [[fatigue duty|fatigue duties]]. It was discontinued in 1832 and replaced with a ration of [[coffee]] and [[sugar]], which was increased in 1836. In 1846, a spirit ration was reinstated for issue to troops engaged in construction or surveying duties; this was discontinued in 1865.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], both armies struggled to keep their soldiers adequately fed. Difficulties with [[Food logistics during the American Civil War|food logistics]] led to a [[Foods of the American Civil War|multitude of rations]].\n\n===World War I===\nIn World War I three types of rations came into usage by the American forces: ''the Reserve ration'', ''the Trench ration'', and ''the Emergency ration'' (also known as the ''Iron ration'').\n\n====\"Iron Ration\" (1907\u20131922)====\nThe first attempt to make an individual ration for issue to soldiers in the field was the \"iron ration\", first introduced in 1907. It consisted of three three-ounce cakes (made from a concoction of [[beef]] [[Bouillon cube|bouillon powder]] and [[Parched grain|parched]] and cooked [[wheat]]), three one-ounce bars of sweetened [[chocolate]], and packets of [[salt]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] that was issued in a sealed [[tin]] packet that weighed one pound. It was designed for emergency use when the troops were unable to be supplied with food. It was later discontinued by the adoption of the \"Reserve Ration\" but its findings went into the development of the emergency [[D-ration]].\n\n====\"Trench Ration\" (1914\u20131918)====\nThis ration was issued in the early part of the war to address a problem. Soldiers fighting in the front lines needed to be supplied with their daily rations, but cooked food prepared at field kitchens was sometimes spoiled by gas attacks. The trench ration was the answer. It was a variety of canned meats ([[salmon]], [[corned beef]], [[sardines]], etc.) that were commercially procured and sealed in a large tin box covered in canvas. It was bulky and heavy and the soldiers began to get weary of the limited menu and it was soon replaced by the Reserve Ration.\n\n====\"Reserve Ration\" (1917\u20131937)====\nThe reserve ration was first issued during the latter part of [[World War I]] to feed troops who were away from a garrison or field kitchen. It originally consisted of 12 ounces of fresh [[bacon]] or one pound of canned meat known as the ''Meat Ration''\u2014usually, [[corned beef]]. Additionally, two 8-ounce cans of hard bread or hardtack biscuits, a packet of 1.16 ounces of pre-ground coffee, a packet of 2.4 ounces of granulated sugar, and a packet of 0.16 ounces of salt were issued. There was also a separate \"[[tobacco]] ration\" of 0.4 ounces of tobacco and 10 [[cigarette]] [[rolling paper]]s, later replaced by brand-name machine-rolled cigarettes.\n \nAfter the war, there were attempts to improve the ration based on input from the field. In 1922, the ''Meat Ration'' was revised, consisting of one pound of meat (usually a combination of [[Jerky (food)|dried beef]] and canned corned beef). This was supplemented by hard chocolate, 14 ounces of hard [[bread]] or [[hardtack]] biscuits, coffee, and sugar. In 1925, the ''Meat Ration'' was changed, removing the dried beef in favor of canned [[pork and beans]], and reducing the bread component. The corned beef allowance was also reduced in size (older rations continued to be issued, however). In 1936, menu planners attempted to introduce more variety by developing an alternate ''Meat Ration'' consisting of an \"A\"-menu (canned corned beef) and a \"B\"-menu (canned pork & beans). The A & B Reserve or combat ration was canceled after being superseded in 1938 by the '''[[C-ration|Field Ration, Type C]]'''.\n\n===Field Rations during World War II===\nAfter 1918, the army ration system went through several revisions, eventually leading to the:\n\n* ''[[A-ration]]'': '''Garrison Ration.''' Fresh, refrigerated, or frozen food prepared in dining halls or field kitchens.  The most valued of all rations.\n* ''[[B-ration]]'': '''Field Ration.''' Canned, packaged, or preserved foods normally prepared in field kitchens without refrigeration.\n* ''[[C-ration]]'': '''Individual Ration'''. A complete pre-cooked, ready-to-eat canned individual meal.\n* ''[[K-ration]]'': '''Individual Ration'''. Designed as a short duration individual \"assault\" ration for paratroopers and other specialized light infantry forces.  Declared obsolete in 1948.\n* ''[[United States military chocolate|D-ration]]'': '''Emergency Ration.''' Bars of concentrated [[chocolate]] combined with other ingredients to provide high calorie content (intended as an emergency ration).\n\nA-rations were generally whatever meat and produce could be obtained locally, so there could be great variety from one theatre of operations to the next.  B-rations were generally used when there was inadequate refrigeration for perishable A-rations.  The composition of the D-ration did not change much throughout the war but the C-ration developed many variations.\n\n[[Image:Crations-museumdisplay.jpg#file|thumb|C-rations]]\nA- and B-rations were only served at bases or established camps in rear areas as they require cooking.

U.S. military rations are often made for quick distribution, preparation, and eating in the field and tend to have long storage times in adverse conditions due to being thickly packaged and/or [[Shelf stable food|shelf-stable]].  The current ration is the [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat]] (MRE).\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of military nutrition in the United States}}\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n[[File:Civil War rations.jpg|thumb|A recreation of [[American Civil War]]-era ration storage]]\n\nFrom the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the United States army ration, as decreed by the [[Continental Congress]], was the [[garrison ration]], which consisted of [[meat]] or [[salt fish]], [[bread]] or [[hardtack]], and [[vegetable]]s.\n\nThere was also a [[distilled beverage|spirit]] ration. In 1785, it was set at four [[ounce]]s of [[rum]], reduced to two ounces of [[whisky|whiskey]], [[brandy]], or rum in 1790. In 1794, troops about to enter combat or who were engaged in frontier service could receive a double ration of four ounces of rum or whiskey; this was extended in 1799 to include troops engaged in [[fatigue duty|fatigue duties]]. It was discontinued in 1832 and replaced with a ration of [[coffee]] and [[sugar]], which was increased in 1836. In 1846, a spirit ration was reinstated for issue to troops engaged in construction or surveying duties; this was discontinued in 1865.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], both armies struggled to keep their soldiers adequately fed. Difficulties with [[Food logistics during the American Civil War|food logistics]] led to a [[Foods of the American Civil War|multitude of rations]].\n\n===World War I===\nIn World War I three types of rations came into usage by the American forces: ''the Reserve ration'', ''the Trench ration'', and ''the Emergency ration'' (also known as the ''Iron ration'').\n\n====\"Iron Ration\" (1907\u20131922)====\nThe first attempt to make an individual ration for issue to soldiers in the field was the \"iron ration\", first introduced in 1907. It consisted of three three ounce cakes (made from a concoction of [[beef]] [[Bouillon cube|bouillon powder]] and [[Parched grain|parched]] and cooked [[wheat]]), three one ounce bars of sweetened [[chocolate]], and packets of [[salt]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] that was issued in a sealed [[tin]] packet that weighed one pound. It was designed for emergency use when the troops were unable to be supplied with food. It was later discontinued by the adoption of the \"Reserve Ration\" but its findings went into the development of the emergency [[D-ration]].\n\n====\"Trench Ration\" (1914\u20131918)====\nThis ration was issued in the early part of the war to address a problem. Soldiers fighting in the front lines needed to be supplied with their daily rations, but cooked food prepared at field kitchens was sometimes spoiled by gas attacks. The trench ration was the answer. It was a variety of canned meats ([[salmon]], [[corned beef]], [[sardines]], etc.) that were commercially procured and sealed in a large tin box covered in canvas. It was bulky and heavy and the soldiers began to get weary of the limited menu and it was soon replaced by the Reserve Ration.\n\n====\"Reserve Ration\" (1917\u20131937)====\nThe reserve ration was first issued during the latter part of [[World War I]] to feed troops who were away from a garrison or field kitchen. It originally consisted of 12 ounces of fresh [[bacon]] or one pound of canned meat known as the ''Meat Ration''\u2014usually, [[corned beef]]. Additionally, two 8-ounce cans of hard bread or hardtack biscuits, a packet of 1.16 ounces of pre-ground coffee, a packet of 2.4 ounces of granulated sugar, and a packet of 0.16 ounces of salt were issued. There was also a separate \"[[tobacco]] ration\" of 0.4 ounces of tobacco and 10 [[cigarette]] [[rolling paper]]s, later replaced by brand-name machine-rolled cigarettes.\n \nAfter the war, there were attempts to improve the ration based on input from the field. In 1922, the ''Meat Ration'' was revised, consisting of one pound of meat (usually a combination of [[Jerky (food)|dried beef]] and canned corned beef). This was supplemented by hard chocolate, 14 ounces of hard [[bread]] or [[hardtack]] biscuits, coffee, and sugar. In 1925, the ''Meat Ration'' was changed, removing the dried beef in favor of canned [[pork and beans]], and reducing the bread component. The corned beef allowance was also reduced in size (older rations continued to be issued, however). In 1936, menu planners attempted to introduce more variety by developing an alternate ''Meat Ration'' consisting of an \"A\"-menu (canned corned beef) and a \"B\"-menu (canned pork & beans). The A & B Reserve or combat ration was canceled after being superseded in 1938 by the '''[[C-ration|Field Ration, Type C]]'''.\n\n===Field Rations during World War II===\nAfter 1918, the army ration system went through several revisions, eventually leading to the:\n\n* ''[[A-ration]]'': '''Garrison Ration.''' Fresh, refrigerated, or frozen food prepared in dining halls or field kitchens.  The most valued of all rations.\n* ''[[B-ration]]'': '''Field Ration.''' Canned, packaged, or preserved foods normally prepared in field kitchens without refrigeration.\n* ''[[C-ration]]'': '''Individual Ration'''. A complete pre-cooked, ready-to-eat canned individual meal.\n* ''[[K-ration]]'': '''Individual Ration'''. Designed as a short duration individual \"assault\" ration for paratroopers and other specialized light infantry forces.  Declared obsolete in 1948.\n* ''[[United States military chocolate|D-ration]]'': '''Emergency Ration.''' Bars of concentrated [[chocolate]] combined with other ingredients to provide high calorie content (intended as an emergency ration).\n\nA-rations were generally whatever meat and produce could be obtained locally, so there could be great variety from one theatre of operations to the next.  B-rations were generally used when there was inadequate refrigeration for perishable A-rations.  The composition of the D-ration did not change much throughout the war but the C-ration developed many variations.\n\n[[Image:Crations-museumdisplay.jpg#file|thumb|C-rations]]\nA- and B-rations were only served at bases or established camps in rear areas as they require cooking.  C-rations could be eaten hot or cold and required no special preparation or storage, so these could be served almost anywhere.\n\nDuring the war a new ration for assault troops, the {{convert|2,830|Cal}} ''[[K-ration]]'', was developed.
