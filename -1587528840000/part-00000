Common live food ranges from [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s (used as an inexpensive form of feed for carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles such as [[bearded dragon]]s and commonly available in [[pet store]]s for this reason), [[waxworm]]s, [[mealworms]] and to a lesser extent [[cockroach]]es and [[locust]]s, to small [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s such as mice or [[chicken]]s. \n\n==Varieties==\nLive foods commonly available are [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] (both ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]'' and ''[[Acheta domesticus]]'' commonly), [[waxworm]]s (''[[Galleria mellonella]]''), [[mealworm]]s (''[[Tenebrio molitor]]''), [[Zophobas morio|Superworm]]s (''[[Zophobas morio]]'') and [[locusts]] (a number of species are seen commonly). There are however many more species used such as [[butter worm]]s, [[phoenix worms]], a variety of cockroach species, [[silkworms]] and more. [[Insect]] species are most commonly used to feed small [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s.\n\nAnother common form of live food, most commonly used to feed [[snake]]s, is small [[rodent]]s. The most commonly known small rodent used for live food is likely the [[mouse]]; many pet stores which carry snakes or cater to snake owners also carry \"feeder mice\" for this reason (see ''[[Fancy mouse]]''). It is also common to feed reptiles freshly killed or frozen/thawed rodents as most reptiles will readily accept them.\n\nCreatures that are the most common choices for live foods, ranging from feeder mice to crickets and mealworms, generally are bred and raised in captivity themselves, and can often be found both through local pet stores and from [[wholesaler]]s or \"farms\" that breed them specifically for live food sales.\n\n==Animals commonly fed live food==\nAnimals that are commonly fed live food include [[bearded dragon]]<ref>https://buddygenius.com/bearded-dragon-eat/</ref> and other lizards, various types of [[snake]], turtles, and carnivorous fish, though other animals, such as [[skunk]]s (which are sometimes kept [[pet skunk|as pets]]), being omnivorous, can also eat some live food, though it is unknown how common this is in practice.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Pet foods]]\n[[Category:Fishing equipment]]\n[[Category:Insects as feed]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=December 2007}}\n{{about||the practice of eating live food by humans|Eating live animals|and|Eating live seafood|the human dietary practice of live foodists|Raw food diet}}\n[[Image:Feeder mice.jpg|250px|thumb|\"Pinkie\" [[mouse|mice]] for sale as live food for [[reptile]]s]]\n'''Live food''' is [[life|living]] [[food]] for [[carnivore|carnivorous]] or [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[animal]]s kept in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]]; in other words, small animals such as [[insect]]s or [[mouse|mice]] fed to larger carnivorous or omnivorous species kept in either in a [[zoo]] or as [[pet]]. \n\nLive food is commonly used as feed for a variety of species of exotic pets and zoo animals, ranging from [[alligator]]s to various [[snake]]s, [[frog]]s and [[lizard]]s, but also including other, non-[[reptile]], non-[[amphibian]] carnivores and omnivores (for instance, [[pet skunk|skunks]], which are omnivorous [[mammal]]s, can be technically be fed a limited amount of live food, though this is not known to be a common practice).

VTV now is the largest television network in the nation, broadcast in nine FTA channels and available internationally via satellite. VTV also operates the largest cable network ([[VTVCab]]) and a DTH satellite service. These carry the nine FTA VTV channels: VTV1, VTV2, VTV3, VTV4, VTV5, VTV6, VTV7, VTV8, VTV9 ; twenty-three Vietnamese subscription channels: VTVCab1 ([[VIE Gi\u1ea3i Tr\u00ed]] ), VTVCab2 ([[Phim Vi\u1ec7t]]), VTVCab3 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV]]), VTVCab4 ([[V\u0103n Ho\u00e1/LOVE]]), VTVCab5 ([[E Channel]]), [[VTVCab6]] (Hay TV), VTVCab7 ([[O2TV]]), VTVCab8 ([[BiBi]]), VTVCab9 ([[Info TV]]), VTVCab10 ([[VIE Dramas]]), VTVCab11 ([[TV Shopping]], now Northern VGS SHOP), VTVCab12 ([[Style TV]]), VTVCab14 ([[Lotte \u0110\u1ea5t Vi\u1ec7t Homeshopping]], now VShopping), VTVCab15 ([[UM Channel]]), VTVCab16 ([[B\u00f3ng \u0110\u00e1 TV]]), VTVCab17 ([[Yeah1 TV]]), VTVCab 18 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV HD Tin t\u1ee9c]]), VTVCab19 ([[Film]]), VTVCab20 ([[V Family]]), VTVCab 21 (BiBi+), VTVCab 22 ([[Life TV]]), VTVCab 23 ([[Golf TV]]) & about 45 local & international channels.\n[[File:VTC logo 2018.svg|right|frameless|293x293px]]\n\n===Vietnam Multimedia Corporation (VTC)===\n\n{{Main|Vietnam Multimedia Corporation}}\n\nVTC operates five national channels and is the first provider of digital terrestrial television (DTT) in Vietnam.  VTC's DTT service is a subscription service though unauthorized cloning of the signal is rampant.\n\nVTC is a Vietnamese state-owned corporation under Ministry of Post and Telematics (currently the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]])  . It has 4 FTA channels, which is VTC1 - the generalist and news channel, VTC5 - the entertainment channel, TodayTV-VTC7 - the entertainment and series channel, and VTC9 -the Vietnamese entertainment channel, and a number of subscription channels including [[VTC2]] - the economic & ICT channel, [[VTC3]] - The sport & entertainment channel, [[VTC4]] - the fashion and style channel, [[VTC6]] - the movie channel. Three new channels broadcast for examination in 2008 are [[VTC8]] - the second VTC1, [[VTC13]] the music channel and [[VTC11]] - kids-oriented channel, and finally [[VTC12]] - concurrently the Korean-language channel. Since 2010 VTC also launching three channels under deposit appications from the government, these are [[VTC10 - NETVIET]], the cultural and foreign affairs channel, [[VTC14]], Weather and Natural Disaster, and [[VTC16]] (3NTV) - Agriculture-oriented channel\n\nIn 2006, [[VTC Mobile TV]], one of the world's first subscription TV services for mobile phones, became available using [[DVB-H]]. It is operated by [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation]], owners of VTC.\n\nFrom 1/1/2014, VTC Television Network separated from VTC Corporations and transferred to the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]]. From 27/6/2015 the network was transferred to the Radio the [[ Voice of Vietnam ]] and become the television enterprise agency of the network.\n\n===Local stations===\n{{Main|List of local stations in Vietnam}}\n\n[[File:Hanoitv.png|335\u00d7298px|right]]\n[[File:Logo of Ho Chi Minh Television.svg|252x252px|right]]\nThese include [[Hanoi Radio Television]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] (HTV). The latter is available over most of the [[Mekong Delta]].\n\n===Other subscription TV===\nSince 1991, hotels, restaurants, clubs, government offices and diplomatic organizations in Vietnam have been permitted under license to install and operate satellite dishes to bring in foreign programming. Nowadays, most of people in large cities (such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]]) subscribe to a cable network. The largest network is [[VCTV (Vietnam)|VCTV]]/[[VTVCab]] (a division of VTV), follows by that of [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] (HTVC), [[Hanoi TV]] (HCAtv/Hanoicab), and [[Saigontourist Cable Television Company|Saigon Tourist Cable Service]] (SCTV) - a joint venture between VTV and Saigon Tourist company. The latest payTV supplier is K+ which is a joint venture between Vietnam Cable Television (VTVCab) and [[Canal+]], first broadcast in later 2009 via [[Direct To Home]] (DTH), and An Vi\u00ean Television Service, owned by Audio Visual Global JSC, first broadcast in 2011 via both [[DVB-T2]] [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) and [[Direct To Home]] (DTH)\n\n==Radio==\n[[File:Vovlogo.png|270x270px|right]]\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] radio transmission was made on September 2, 1945, when [[Ho Chi Minh]] read out the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].\n\nPrior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the [[French Indochina|French colonial government]], which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s.\n\nVietnam's national radio station, now called the [[Voice of Vietnam]], started broadcasting from Hanoi just a week after the declaration of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Viet Nam]].\n\n[[South Vietnam]] set up its own network in Saigon in 1955.\n\nFollowing [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]], all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.\n\nToday, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media. It broadcasts on many channels, repeated on [[AM broadcasting|Medium wave (MW) AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[shortwave|shortwave (SW) AM]] bands throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world:\n* VOV1 (MW and SW) - news, current affairs and music\n* VOV2 (MW and SW) - cultural and artistic programs\n* VOV3 (FM) - music & entertainment\n* VOV4 (MW) - [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|ethnic minority language]] programming\n* VOV5 (MW) - world service broadcasts in 11 foreign languages\n* VOV Transportation (FM) - updating information during rush hours to help people travel smoothly through traffic jams.\n* VOV English 24/7 (FM) - English-language programs\n* VOV 89 (FM) - health and safety consumering\n* VOV News - a website containing news and other aspects\n* VOVTV( Television Channel)- nationally broadcast which aims at delivering update news every 30 minutes per program\n* VOV newspaper 'the Voice of Vietnam'- a printed version with more in-depth contents of VOVnews website\nAs of 2004, it was estimated that VOV's programs reached more than 90% of all households in Vietnam.\n\nIn addition, most cities and provinces has their own radio stations.\n* *[https://web.archive.org/web/20140201193140/http://www.delicest.com/2013/09/radio-stations-viet-nam-nghe-truc-tuyen.html Vietnam Radio Stations Online Full List Updated 2013 ] Listen all Vietnam AM / FM Radio Stations Online\n\n==Newspapers==\nAs Vietnam moves toward a free-market economy with its [[doi moi]] measures, the government has relied on the print media to keep the public informed about its policies. The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996.\n\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] newspaper was the French-sponsored ''Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Bao'', established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]]. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Nhan Dan]]'' (''The People''), established in 1951.\n\nCurrent large Vietnamese-language newspapers include ''[[Tuoi Tre]]'' (''Youth'', published in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], described as a \"reformist\" newspaper), ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' (''Youth''), ''[[Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng]]'' (''Labour'' or ''The Worker''), ''[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tien Phong]]'' (''Vanguard''), ''[[Sai Gon Giai Phong]]'' (''Liberated Saigon''), and ''[[H\u00e0n\u1ed9im\u1edbi]]'' (''New Hanoi'').

VTV now is the largest television network in the nation, broadcast in nine FTA channels and available internationally via satellite. VTV also operates the largest cable network ([[VTVCab]]) and a DTH satellite service. These carry the nine FTA VTV channels: VTV1, VTV2, VTV3, VTV4, VTV5, VTV6, VTV7, VTV8, VTV9 ; twenty-three Vietnamese subscription channels: VTVCab1 ([[VIE Gi\u1ea3i Tr\u00ed]] ), VTVCab2 ([[Phim Vi\u1ec7t]]), VTVCab3 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV]]), VTVCab4 ([[V\u0103n Ho\u00e1/LOVE]]), VTVCab5 ([[E Channel]]), [[VTVCab6]] (Hay TV), VTVCab7 ([[O2TV]]), VTVCab8 ([[BiBi]]), VTVCab9 ([[Info TV]]), VTVCab10 ([[VIE Dramas]]), VTVCab11 ([[TV Shopping]], now Northern VGS SHOP), VTVCab12 ([[Style TV]]), VTVCab14 ([[Lotte \u0110\u1ea5t Vi\u1ec7t Homeshopping]], now VShopping), VTVCab15 ([[UM Channel]]), VTVCab16 ([[B\u00f3ng \u0110\u00e1 TV]]), VTVCab17 ([[Yeah1 TV]]), VTVCab 18 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV HD Tin t\u1ee9c]]), VTVCab19 ([[Film]]), VTVCab20 ([[V Family]]), VTVCab 21 (BiBi+), VTVCab 22 ([[Life TV]]), VTVCab 23 ([[Golf TV]]) & about 45 local & international channels.\n[[File:VTC logo 2018.svg|right|frameless|293x293px]]\n\n===Vietnam Multimedia Corporation (VTC)===\n\n{{Main|Vietnam Multimedia Corporation}}\n\nVTC operates five national channels and is the first provider of digital terrestrial television (DTT) in Vietnam.  VTC's DTT service is a subscription service though unauthorized cloning of the signal is rampant.\n\nVTC is a Vietnamese state-owned corporation under Ministry of Post and Telematics (currently the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]])  . It has 4 FTA channels, which is VTC1 - the generalist and news channel, VTC5 - the entertainment channel, TodayTV-VTC7 - the entertainment and series channel, and VTC9 -the Vietnamese entertainment channel, and a number of subscription channels including [[VTC2]] - the economic & ICT channel, [[VTC3]] - The sport & entertainment channel, [[VTC4]] - the fashion and style channel, [[VTC6]] - the movie channel.

It is operated by [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation]], owners of VTC.\n\nFrom 1/1/2014, VTC Television Network separated from VTC Corporations and transferred to the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]].

The largest network is [[VCTV (Vietnam)|VCTV]]/[[VTVCab]] (a division of VTV), follows by that of [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] (HTVC), [[Hanoi TV]] (HCAtv/Hanoicab), and [[Saigontourist Cable Television Company|Saigon Tourist Cable Service]] (SCTV) - a joint venture between VTV and Saigon Tourist company.

During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Viet Nam]].\n\n[[South Vietnam]] set up its own network in Saigon in 1955.\n\nFollowing [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]], all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.\n\nToday, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media.

The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996.\n\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] newspaper was the French-sponsored ''Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Bao'', established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]]. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Nhan Dan]]'' (''The People''), established in 1951.\n\nCurrent large Vietnamese-language newspapers include ''[[Tuoi Tre]]'' (''Youth'', published in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], described as a \"reformist\" newspaper), ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' (''Youth''), ''[[Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng]]'' (''Labour'' or ''The Worker''), ''[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tien Phong]]'' (''Vanguard''), ''[[Sai Gon Giai Phong]]'' (''Liberated Saigon''), and ''[[H\u00e0n\u1ed9im\u1edbi]]'' (''New Hanoi''). Prominent French language newspapers included ''Saigon Eco'', the only that currently is published is ''[[Le Courrier du Vietnam]]''. There are other, smaller provincial newspapers such as the ''[[Ba Ria Vung Tau Daily Newspaper]]''.\n\nThe largest online newspapers are [[Zing.vn]], [[VnExpress]], [[VietNamNet]], [[Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb]], [[Thanh Ni\u00ean]], [[D\u00e2n Tr\u00ed]], [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation|VTC News]], and [[Vietnam News Agency|VietnamPlus]].

Less than 1,000 native speakers of Nahuatl remain in El Salvador.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/ppl|title=Did you know Pipil is critically endangered?|website=Endangered Languages}}</ref>\n\nIt is suggested that the Nahua peoples originated in [[Aridoamerica]], in regions of the present day northwestern Mexico. They split off from the other [[Uto-Aztecan|Uto-Aztecan speaking]] peoples and migrated into central Mexico around 500 CE. The Nahua then settled in and around the [[Basin of Mexico]] and spread out to become the dominant people in central Mexico. However, Nahuatl-speaking populations were present in smaller populations throughout Mesoamerica.\n\nNo unified Nahua identity existed in the Pre-Columbian period, and people instead identified based on tribe and [[altepetl]]. The name Nahua derives from the name of the language. For these reasons, it may be useful to view the Nahua people as a collection of ethnicities speaking similar languages, rather than one monolithic group.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name '''{{lang|nah|Nahua}}''' is derived from the [[Nahuatl]] word-root {{lang|nah|n\u0101hua-}} {{IPA-nah|\u02c8na\u02d0wa-|}},<ref>{{cite book |last1=Karttunen |first1=Frances |title=An analytical dictionary of Nahuatl |date=1992 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman |isbn=0806124210 |pages=156\u2013157 }}</ref> which generally means \"audible, intelligible, clear\" with different derivations including \"language\" (hence {{lang|nah|n\u0101huat(i)}} {{IPA-nah|\u02c8na\u02d0wat(i)|}} \"to speak clearly\" and {{lang|nah|n\u0101huatl}} {{IPA-nah|\u02c8na\u02d0wat\u0361\u026c|}} both \"something that makes an agreeble sound\" and \"someone who speaks well or speak one's own language\").<ref name=\"Kartunnen 1992, p. 157-158\">Kartunnen 1992, p. 157-158.</ref> It was used in contrast with {{lang|nah|popoloca}} {{IPA-nah|popo\u02c8loka|}}, \"to speak unintelligibly\" or \"speak a foreign language\".<ref>Kartunnen 1992, p. 203.</ref> Another, related term is '''{{lang|nah|N\u0101huatl\u0101catl}}''' {{IPA-nah|na\u02d0wa\u02c8t\u0361\u026ca\u02d0kat\u0361\u026c|}} (singular) or '''{{lang|nah|N\u0101huatl\u0101cah}}''' {{IPA-nah|na\u02d0wa\u02c8t\u0361\u026ca\u02d0ka\u0294|}} ([[plural]]) literally \"Nahuatl-speaking people\".<ref name=\"Kartunnen 1992, p. 157-158\"/>\n\nThe Nahuas are also sometimes referred to as [[Aztecs]]. Using this term for the Nahuas has generally fallen out of favor in scholarship, though it is still used for the [[Aztec Empire]]. They have also been called '''{{lang|nah|M\u0113xihcatl}}''' {{IPA-nah|me\u02d0\u02c8\u0283i\u0294kat\u0361\u026c|}} (singular), '''{{lang|nah|M\u0113xihcah}}''' {{IPA-nah|me\u02d0\u02c8\u0283i\u0294ka\u0294|}} (plural)<ref>Kartunnen 1992, p. 145.</ref> or in Spanish '''{{lang|es|Mexicano(s)}}''' {{IPA-es|mexi\u02c8kano(s)|}} \"[[:wikt:Mexican|Mexican]]s\", after the [[Mexica]], the Nahua tribe which founded the [[Aztec Empire]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nahuatl in Mexico.svg|thumb|left|Number of Nahuatl speakers per state, according to the 2000 [[Mexican census]]|alt=]]\n[[File:Nahuatl_dialects_map.png|thumb|Current distribution of Nahuatl dialects]]\nAt the turn of the 16th century, Nahua populations occupied territories ranging across Mesoamerica as far south as [[Panama]].<ref>Fowler (1985, p.38).</ref> However, their core area was [[Geography of Mesoamerica#Central Mexico|Central Mexico]], including the [[Valley of Mexico]], the [[Toluca Valley]], the eastern half of the [[Balsas River]] basin, and modern-day [[Tlaxcala]] and most of [[Puebla]], although other linguistic and ethnic groups lived in these areas as well. They were also present in large numbers in [[El Salvador]], southeastern [[Veracruz]], and [[Colima]] and coastal [[Michoacan]]. Classical Nahuatl was a lingua franca in Central Mexico before the Spanish conquest due to Aztec hegemony,<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Native Peoples of Colonial Central Mexico\" in ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas, Mesoamerica''. Volume II, Part 2. Edited by Richard E.W. Adams and Murdo J. MacLeod.  New York: Cambridge University Press 2000, p. 187.</ref> and its role was not only preserved but expanded in the initial stage of colonial rule, encouraged by the Spaniards as a literary language and tool to convert diverse Mesoamerican peoples. There are many Nahuatl place names in regions where Nahuas were not the most populous group (including the names of [[Guatemala]] and several Mexican states), due to pre-Hispanic Aztec expansion, Spanish invasions in which [[Tlaxcaltecs]] served as the main force, and the usage of Nahuatl as a lingua franca.\n\nThe last of the southern Nahua populations today are the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] of El Salvador. Nahua populations in Mexico are centered in the middle of the country, with most speakers in the states of [[Puebla]], [[Veracruz]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Guerrero]] and [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. However, smaller populations are spread throughout the country due to recent population movements within Mexico. Within the last 50 years, Nahua populations have appeared in the United States, particularly in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Houston]].<ref>Flores Farf\u00e1n (2002, p.229).</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Aztec|Mexica|Aztec codices}}\n\n===Pre-Columbian period===\n[[File:Nahua deity censer.jpg|thumb|Ceramic sculpture of Nahua deity from Puebla]]\n\nArchaeological, historical and linguistic evidence suggest that the Nahuas originally came from the deserts of northern Mexico ([[Aridoamerica]]) and migrated into central Mexico in several waves.<ref>Canger (1980, p.12)</ref> The presence of the [[Mexicanero people]] (who speak a Nahuatl dialect) in this area until the present day affirms this theory. \nBefore the Nahuas entered Mesoamerica, they were probably living for a while in northwestern Mexico alongside the [[Cora people|Cora]] and [[Huichol people|Huichol]] peoples.<ref>Kaufman (2001, p.12).</ref> The first group of Nahuas to split from the main group were the [[Pochutec]] who went on to settle on the Pacific coast of [[Oaxaca]] possibly as early as 400 BCE.<ref>Su\u00e1rez (1983, p.149).</ref> From c. 600 BCE the Nahua quickly rose to power in central Mexico and expanded into areas earlier occupied by [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], [[Totonacan languages|Totonacan]] and [[Wastek language|Huastec]] peoples.<ref>Kaufman (2001).</ref> Through their integration in [[Mesoamerican]] the Mesoamerican cultural area the Nahuas adopted many cultural traits including maize agriculture and urbanism, [[Aztec religion|religious practices]] including a [[Aztec calendar|ritual calendar of 260 days]] and the practice of [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifices]] and the construction of monumental architecture and the use of [[Aztec writing|logographic writing]].\n\n[[Image:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|\"[[Atlantean figures]]\" from the Nahua culture of the [[Toltec]]s at [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].|alt=]]\n\nAround 1000 CE the [[Toltec]] people, normally assumed to have been of Nahua ethnicity, established dominion over much of central Mexico which they ruled from [[Tula (Hidalgo)|Tollan Xicocotitlan]].<ref>Porter Weaver. 1993. pp. 388-412</ref>\n\nFrom this period on the Nahua were the dominant ethnic group in the Valley of Mexico and far beyond, and migrations kept coming in from the north. After the fall of the Toltecs a period of large population movements followed and some Nahua groups such as the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] and [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]] arrived as far south as Nicaragua. And in central Mexico different Nahua groups based in their different [[Altepetl|\"Altepetl\" city-states]] fought for political dominance. The Xochimilca, based in [[Xochimilco]] ruled an area south of [[Lake Texcoco]]; the [[Tepanec]]s ruled the area to the west and the [[Acolhua]] ruled an area to the east of the valley. One of the last of the Nahua migrations to arrive in the valley settled on an island in the [[Lake Texcoco]] and proceeded to subjugate the surrounding tribes. This group were the [[Mexica]] who during the next 300 years became the dominant ethnic group of [[Mesoamerica]] ruling from [[Tenochtitlan]] their island capital. They formed the [[Aztec Empire]] after allying with the Tepanecs and Acolhua people of Texcoco, spreading the political and linguistic influence of the Nahuas well into Central America.\n\n===Conquest period (1519\u20131523)===\n{{main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}\n[[File:LienzodeTlaxcalaLamina5.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Tlaxcaltec]] soldiers leading a  Spaniard to [[Chalco (alt\u00e9petl)|Chalco]] from  ''[[History of Tlaxcala|Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'']]\nIn 1519 an expedition of Spaniards sailing from Cuba under the leadership of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] arrived on the Mexican gulf coast near the [[Totonac]] city of [[Quiyahuiztlan]]. The Totonacs were one of the peoples that were politically subjugated by the Aztecs and word was immediately sent to the Aztec Emperor (in Nahuatl, [[Tlatoani]]) of Tenochtitlan [[Moctezuma II|Motecuhzoma II]]. Going inland the Spaniards encountered and fought with Totonac forces and Nahua forces from the independent [[Altepetl]] of [[Tlaxcala (altepetl)|Tlaxcallan]]. The [[Tlaxcaltec]]s were a Nahua group who had avoided being subjugated by the Aztecs. After being defeated in battle by the Spaniards, the Tlaxcalans entered into an alliance with Cortes that would be invaluable in the struggle against the Aztecs.<ref>Account of Bernal Diaz from Victors and Vanquished: Spanish and Nahua Views of the Conquest of Mexico.  edited by Stuart Schwartz (Boston: Bedford/ St. Martin's, 2000).</ref> The Spanish and Tlaxcaltec forces marched upon several cities that were under Aztec dominion and \"liberated\" them, before they arrived in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. There they were welcomed as guests by Motecuhzoma II, but after a while they took the ruler prisoner. When the Aztec nobility realized that their ruler had been turned into a Spanish puppet they attacked the Spaniards and chased them out of the city. The Spaniards sought refuge in Tlaxcala where they regrouped and awaited reinforcements. During the next year they cooperated with large Tlaxcaltec armies and undertook a siege campaign resulting in the final fall of Tenochtitlan. After the fall of Tenochtitlan Spanish forces now also allied with the Aztecs to incorporate all the previous Aztec provinces into the realm of [[New Spain]]. New Spain was founded as a state under Spanish rule but where Nahua people were recognized as allies of the rulers and as such were granted privileges and a degree of independence that other indigenous peoples of the area did not enjoy. Recently historians such as Stephanie Wood and [[Matthew Restall]] have argued that the Nahua did not experience the conquest as something substantially different from the sort of ethnic conflicts that they were used to, and that in fact they may have at first interpreted it as a defeat of one Nahua group by another.<ref>Restall, 2003</ref>\n\n==Colonial Period 1521-1821==\nWith the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] in Mesoamerica a new political situation ensued. The period has been extensively studied by historians, with [[Charles Gibson]] publishing a classic monograph entitled ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule:  A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519-1810. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964.</ref> Historian [[James Lockhart (Historian)|James Lockhart]] built on that work, publishing ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'' in 1992. He divides the colonial history of the Nahua into three stages largely based on linguistic evidence in local-level Nahuatl sources, which he posits are an index of the degree of interaction between Spaniards and Nahuas and changes in Nahua culture.<ref>James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest: A Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, Sixteenth Through Eighteenth Centuries''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref> An overview of the Nahuas of colonial Central Mexico can be found in the ''Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas''.<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Native Peoples of Colonial Central Mexico\" in ''Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas'' vol. II, Part II, Mesoamerica, 2000, pp. 187-222.</ref>\n\n===Stage one (1519\u2013c. 1550) Conquest and early colonial period===\n{{See also|Aztec codices}}\n[[File:Tlaxcala- Palacio de Gobierno - Vertrag Spanier - Tlaxcalteken.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Tlaxcaltec]]s and Spanish at the founding of the Colonial Province of [[Tlaxcala]] in 1545.]]\nThe early period saw the first stages of the establishment of churches by mendicant friars in large and important Indian towns, the assertion of crown control over New Spain by the high court (''Audiencia'') and then the establishment of the viceroyalty, and the heyday of conqueror power over the indigenous via the [[encomienda]]. In the initial stage of the colonial period, contact between Spaniards and the indigenous populations was limited. It consisted mostly in the mendicants who sought to convert the population to Catholicism, and the reorganization of the indigenous tributary system to benefit individual Spaniards. The indigenous system of smaller settlements' paying tribute and rendering labor service to dominant political entities was transformed into the ''[[Encomienda]]'' system. Indigenous of particular towns paid tribute to a Spanish ''encomendero'' who was awarded the labor and tribute of that town.<ref>James Lockhart, 1969, \"Encomienda and Hacienda: The Evolution of the Great Estate in the Spanish Indies\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 49:411-29</ref><ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain'', Austin: University of Texas Press 1991.</ref> In this early period, the hereditary indigenous ruler or ''tlatoani'' and noblemen continued to hold power locally and were key to mobilizing tribute and labor for encomenderos. They also continued to hold titles from the pre-conquest period. Most willing accepted baptism so that records for this period show Nahua elites with Christian given names (indicating baptism) and many holding the Spanish noble title ''don''. A set of censuses in alphabetic Nahuatl for the Cuernavaca region c. 1535 gives us a baseline for the impact of Spanish on Nahuatl, showing few Spanish loanwords taken into Nahuatl.<ref>Sarah Cline, ''The Book of Tributes: Sixteenth-Century Nahuatl Censuses from Morelos''. Los Angeles: UCLA Latin American Center 1993.</ref>\n\nAs the Spaniards sought to extend their political dominance into the most remote corners of Mesoamerica, the Nahua accompanied them as auxiliaries. In the early colonial period, new Nahua settlements were made in northern Mexico and far south into Central America. Nahua forces often formed the bulk of the Spanish military expeditions that conquered other Mesoamerican peoples, such as the [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]] and [[Mixtecs]].\n\nWith the arrival of Christian missionaries, the first priority of the colonial authorities was eradicating indigenous religious practices, something they achieved by a combination of violence and threats of violence, and patient education. Nahua were baptized with Spanish names. The few Nahua who did not willingly abandon their religious practices were severely punished or executed. The Nahua, however, often incorporated pre-Christian practices and beliefs into the Christian religion without the authorities' noticing it. Often they kept practicing their own religion in the privacy of their homes, especially in rural areas where Spanish presence was almost completely lacking and the conversion process was slow.\n\nThe Nahua quickly took the Latin alphabetic writing as their own. Within 20 years of the arrival of the Spanish, the Nahua were composing texts in their own language. In 1536 the first university of the [[Americas]], the ''[[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]]'' was inaugurated. It was established by the Franciscans whose aim was to educate young Nahua noblemen to be Catholic priests who were trilingual: literate in Spanish, Latin and Nahuatl.<ref>Mathes, Michael, 1985, ''The Americas' first academic library Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco'', Sacramento\" California State Library.</ref>\n\n===Stage two (c. 1550\u2013c. 1650)===\n\nThere are a large number of texts by and about Nahuas in this middle period and during this period Nahuatl absorbed a large number of loanwords from Spanish, particularly nouns for particular objects, indicating the closer contact between the European sphere and the indigenous. However, Nahuatl verbs and syntax show no evidence of the impact of Spanish contact.<ref>James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref> In the mid-sixteenth century, cultural change at the local level can be tracked through the production of Nahuatl alphabetic texts. The production of began a wide range of written documents in Nahuatl dates from this period, including legal documents for transactions (bills of sale), minutes of indigenous town council (''cabildo'') records, petitions to the crown, and others.\n\nInstitutionally, indigenous town government shifted from the rule of the tlatoani and noblemen to the establishment of Spanish-style town councils (''cabildos''), with officers holding standard Spanish titles. A classic study of sixteenth-century Tlaxcala, the main ally of the Spaniards in the conquest of the Mexica, shows that much of the prehispanic structure continued into the colonial period.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century''. New Haven: Yale University Press 1952.</ref> An important set of cabildo records in Nahuatl for Tlaxcala is extant and shows how local government functioned in for nearly a century.<ref>James Lockhart, Frances Berdan, and Arthur J.O. Anderson. ''The Tlaxcalan Actas: A Compendium of the Records of the Records of the Cabildo of Tlaxcala, 1545-1627.'' Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1986.</ref>\n\nRegarding religion, by the mid- to late 16th century, even the most zealous mendicants of the first generation doubted the capacity of Nahua men to become Christian priests so that the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]] ceased to function to that end and in 1555 Indians were barred from ordination to the priesthood. However, in local communities, stone-built church complexes continued to be built and elaborated, with murals in mixed indigenous-Spanish forms.<ref>Jeanette Favrot Peterson, ''The Paradise Garden Murals of Malinalco: Utopia and Empire in Sixteenth-Century Mexico''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1993.</ref> Confraternities (''cofrad\u00edas'') were established to support the celebrations of a particular Christian saint and functioned as burial societies for members. During this period, an expression of personal piety, the Church promoted the making of last wills and testaments, with many testators donating money to their local Church to say Masses for their souls.\n\nFor individual Nahua men and women dictating a last will and testament to a local Nahua notary (''escribano'') became standard. These wills provide considerable information about individuals' residence, kin relations, and property ownership provides a window into social standing, differences between the sexes, and business practices at the local level. showing not only that literacy of some elite men in alphabetic writing in Nahuatl was a normal part of everyday life at the local level<ref>Frances Karttunen, \"Nahuatl Literacy\" in George A. Collier et al. eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States, pp. 395-417. New York: Academic Press.</ref> and that the notion of making a final will was expected, even for those who had little property. A number of studies in the tradition of what is now called the [[New Philology]] extensively use Nahuatl wills as a source.<ref>S.L.

Lockhart suggests that this might mark a \"Stage 4\" of language change.</ref> Year-by-year accounts of major occurrences, a text known as an annal, no longer reference the prehispanic period.<ref name=\"Lockhart, p. 428\">Lockhart, ''Nahuas After the Conquest'', p. 428.</ref> Local level documentation for individual Nahuas continued to be produced, in particular last wills and testaments, but they are much more simplified than those produced in the late sixteenth century.<ref>Caterina Pizzigoni, ''Testaments of Toluca''.

Stanford University Press 2012.</ref>\n\nNahuas began to produce an entirely new type of text, known as \"primordial titles\" or simply \"titles\" (''t\u00edtulos''), that assert indigenous communities' rights to particular territory, often by recording local lore in an atemporal fashion. There is no known prehispanic precedent for this textual form and none appears before 1650.<ref>Lockhart, ''Nahuas After the Conquest'', pp. 410-11.</ref> Several factors might be at work for the appearance of titles. One might be a resurgence of indigenous population after decades recovering from devastating epidemics when communities might have been less concerned with Spanish encroachment. Another might be the crown's push to regularize defective land titles via a process known as ''composici\u00f3n''.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 285.</ref> The crown had mandated minimum land holdings for indigenous communities at 600 ''varas'', in property that was known as the ''fundo legal'', and to separate indigenous communities from Spanish lands by more than 1,100 varas. Towns were to have access to water, uplands for gathering firewood, and agricultural land, as well as common lands for pasturage.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', p. 285.</ref> Despite these mandated legal protections for Indian towns, courts continued to find in favor of Spaniards and the rules about minimum holdings for Indian towns were ignored in practice.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', pp. 285-287.</ref>\n\nLabor arrangements between Nahuas and Spaniards were largely informal, rather than organized through the mainly defunct [[encomienda]] and the poorly functioning [[repartimiento]]. Spanish landed estates needed a secure labor force, often a mixture of a small group of permanent laborers and part-time or seasonal laborers drawn from nearby indigenous communities. Individual Indians made arrangements with estate owners rather than labor being mobilized via the community. The indigenous communities continued to function as political entities, but there was greater fragmentation of units as dependent villages (''sujetos'') of the main settlement (''cabecera'') sought full, independent status themselves.<ref name=\"Lockhart, p. 428\"/> Indigenous officials were no longer necessarily noblemen.\n\n==National Period (1821-)==\nWith the achievement of [[Mexico|Mexican]] independence in 1821, the [[casta]] system, which divided the population into racial categories with differential rights, was eliminated and the term \"Indian\" (''indio'') was no longer used by government, although it continued to be used in daily speech.<ref>Frans J. Schreyer, \"Native Peoples of Central Mexico Since Independence\" in ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas'', Richard N. Adams and Murdo MacLeod, eds. Vol. II, part 2, 2000, p. 229.</ref> The creation of a republic in 1824 meant that Mexicans of all types were citizens rather than vassals of the crown. One important consequence for Nahuas and other indigenous was that documentation in the native languages generally ceased to be produced. Native towns did not cease to exist nor did indigenous populations speaking their own language, but the indigenous were far more marginalized in the post-independence period than during the colonial era. In the colonial era the crown had a paternalistic stance toward the Indians, in essence according them special rights, a [[fuero]], and giving support to structures in indigenous towns and giving natives a level of protection against non-Indians. This can be seen in the establishment of the General Indian Court where Indian towns and individual Indians could sue those making incursions on their land and other abuses.<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Native Peoples of Colonial Central Mexico\", p. 216-217.</ref> These protections disappeared in the national period. One scholar has characterized the early national period of Nahuas and other indigenous \"as the beginning of a systematic policy of cultural genocide and the increasing loss of native languages.\"<ref name=\"Schreyer p. 229\">Schreyer, \"Native Peoples of Central Mexico Since Independence\" p. 229.</ref> Lack of official recognition and both economic and cultural pressures meant that most indigenous peoples in Central Mexico became more Europeanized and many became Spanish speakers.<ref name=\"Schreyer p. 229\"/>\n\nIn nineteenth-century Mexico, the so-called \"Indian Question\" exercised politicians and intellectuals, who viewed the indigenous as backward, unassimilated to the Mexican nation, whose custom of communal rather than individual ownership of land was impediment to economic progress.<ref>Charles A. Hale, ''Mexican Liberalism in the Age of Mora'', New Haven: Yale University Press 1968, 224-225.</ref> Non-Indian landowners of estates had already encroached on indigenous ownership in the colonial era, but now liberal ideology sought to end communal protections on ownership with its emphasis on private property.<ref>Hale, ''Mexican Liberalism'', p. 225.</ref> Since land was the economic basis for Indians' ability to maintain a separate identity, land tenure became a central issue for liberal reformers. The liberal [[Reforma]] enshrined in the [[Constitution of 1857]] mandated the breakup of corporate-owned property, therefore targeting indigenous communities and the Roman Catholic Church, which also had significant holdings. This measure affected all indigenous communities, including Nahuas, holding land. Liberal [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], a Zapotec who became president of Mexico, was fully in support of laws to end corporate landholding. The outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in Morelos, which still had a significant Nahua population, was sparked by peasant resistance to the expansion of sugar estates. This was preceded in the nineteenth century by smaller indigenous revolts against encroachment, particularly during the civil war of the Reforma, foreign intervention, and a weak state following the exit of the French in 1867.<ref>Schreyer, \"Native Peoples of Central Mexico Since Independence\", p. 243.</ref>\n\nA number of indigenous men had made a place for themselves in post-independence Mexico, the most prominent being Benito Ju\u00e1rez. But an important nineteenth-century figure of Nahua was [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]] (1834\u201393), born in Tixtla, Guerrero who became a well respected liberal intellectual, man of letters, politician, and diplomat. Altamirano was a fierce anticlerical politician, and was known for a period as \"the [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]] of the Radicals\" and an admirer of the French Revolution.<ref>D.A. Brading, ''The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State 1492-1867''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 659, 663</ref> Altamirano, along with other liberals, saw universal primary public education as a key way to change Mexico, promoting for upward mobility. Altamirano's chief disciple in this view was [[Justo Sierra]].<ref>Brading, ''The First America'' p. 665</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n[[Image:Nahua man of Morelos.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Nahua man of Morelos ploughing a bean field by mule]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"right\"\n|-\n|+Speakers over 5 years of age in the ten states with most speakers (2000 census).

They split off from the other [[Uto-Aztecan|Uto-Aztecan speaking]] peoples and migrated into central Mexico around 500 CE. The Nahua then settled in and around the [[Basin of Mexico]] and spread out to become the dominant people in central Mexico. However, Nahuatl-speaking populations were present in smaller populations throughout Mesoamerica.\n\nNo unified Nahua identity existed in the Pre-Columbian period, and people instead identified based on tribe and [[altepetl]]. The name Nahua derives from the name of the language. For these reasons, it may be useful to view the Nahua people as a collection of ethnicities speaking similar languages, rather than one monolithic group.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name '''{{lang|nah|Nahua}}''' is derived from the [[Nahuatl]] word-root {{lang|nah|n\u0101hua-}} {{IPA-nah|\u02c8na\u02d0wa-|}},<ref>{{cite book |last1=Karttunen |first1=Frances |title=An analytical dictionary of Nahuatl |date=1992 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman |isbn=0806124210 |pages=156\u2013157 }}</ref> which generally means \"audible, intelligible, clear\" with different derivations including \"language\" (hence {{lang|nah|n\u0101huat(i)}} {{IPA-nah|\u02c8na\u02d0wat(i)|}} \"to speak clearly\" and {{lang|nah|n\u0101huatl}} {{IPA-nah|\u02c8na\u02d0wat\u0361\u026c|}} both \"something that makes an agreeble sound\" and \"someone who speaks well or speak one's own language\").<ref name=\"Kartunnen 1992, p. 157-158\">Kartunnen 1992, p. 157-158.</ref> It was used in contrast with {{lang|nah|popoloca}} {{IPA-nah|popo\u02c8loka|}}, \"to speak unintelligibly\" or \"speak a foreign language\".<ref>Kartunnen 1992, p. 203.</ref> Another, related term is '''{{lang|nah|N\u0101huatl\u0101catl}}''' {{IPA-nah|na\u02d0wa\u02c8t\u0361\u026ca\u02d0kat\u0361\u026c|}} (singular) or '''{{lang|nah|N\u0101huatl\u0101cah}}''' {{IPA-nah|na\u02d0wa\u02c8t\u0361\u026ca\u02d0ka\u0294|}} ([[plural]]) literally \"Nahuatl-speaking people\".<ref name=\"Kartunnen 1992, p. 157-158\"/>\n\nThe Nahuas are also sometimes referred to as [[Aztecs]]. Using this term for the Nahuas has generally fallen out of favor in scholarship, though it is still used for the [[Aztec Empire]]. They have also been called '''{{lang|nah|M\u0113xihcatl}}''' {{IPA-nah|me\u02d0\u02c8\u0283i\u0294kat\u0361\u026c|}} (singular), '''{{lang|nah|M\u0113xihcah}}''' {{IPA-nah|me\u02d0\u02c8\u0283i\u0294ka\u0294|}} (plural)<ref>Kartunnen 1992, p. 145.</ref> or in Spanish '''{{lang|es|Mexicano(s)}}''' {{IPA-es|mexi\u02c8kano(s)|}} \"[[:wikt:Mexican|Mexican]]s\", after the [[Mexica]], the Nahua tribe which founded the [[Aztec Empire]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nahuatl in Mexico.svg|thumb|left|Number of Nahuatl speakers per state, according to the 2000 [[Mexican census]]|alt=]]\n[[File:Nahuatl_dialects_map.png|thumb|Current distribution of Nahuatl dialects]]\nAt the turn of the 16th century, Nahua populations occupied territories ranging across Mesoamerica as far south as [[Panama]].<ref>Fowler (1985, p.38).</ref> However, their core area was [[Geography of Mesoamerica#Central Mexico|Central Mexico]], including the [[Valley of Mexico]], the [[Toluca Valley]], the eastern half of the [[Balsas River]] basin, and modern-day [[Tlaxcala]] and most of [[Puebla]], although other linguistic and ethnic groups lived in these areas as well. They were also present in large numbers in [[El Salvador]], southeastern [[Veracruz]], and [[Colima]] and coastal [[Michoacan]]. Classical Nahuatl was a lingua franca in Central Mexico before the Spanish conquest due to Aztec hegemony<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Native Peoples of Colonial Central Mexico\" in ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas, Mesoamerica''.

There are many Nahuatl place names in regions where Nahuas were not the most populous group (including the names of [[Guatemala]] and several Mexican states), due to pre-Hispanic Aztec expansion, Spanish invasions in which [[Tlaxcaltecs]] served as the main force, and the usage of Nahuatl as a lingua franca.\n\nThe last of the southern Nahua populations today are the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] of El Salvador. Nahua populations in Mexico are centered in the middle of the country, with most speakers in the states of [[Puebla]], [[Veracruz]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Guerrero]] and [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. However, smaller populations are spread throughout the country due to recent population movements within Mexico. Within the last 50 years, Nahua populations have appeared in the United States, particularly in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Houston]].<ref>Flores Farf\u00e1n (2002, p.229).</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Aztec|Mexica|Aztec codices}}\n\n===Pre-Columbian period===\n[[File:Nahua deity censer.jpg|thumb|Ceramic sculpture of Nahua deity from Puebla]]\n\nArchaeological, historical and linguistic evidence suggest that the Nahuas originally came from the deserts of northern Mexico ([[Aridoamerica]]) and migrated into central Mexico in several waves.<ref>Canger (1980, p.12)</ref> The presence of the [[Mexicanero people]] (who speak a Nahuatl dialect) in this area until the present day affirms this theory. \nBefore the Nahuas entered Mesoamerica, they were probably living for a while in northwestern Mexico alongside the [[Cora people|Cora]] and [[Huichol people|Huichol]] peoples.<ref>Kaufman (2001, p.12).</ref> The first group of Nahuas to split from the main group were the [[Pochutec]] who went on to settle on the Pacific coast of [[Oaxaca]] possibly as early as 400 BCE.<ref>Su\u00e1rez (1983, p.149).</ref> From c. 600 BCE the Nahua quickly rose to power in central Mexico and expanded into areas earlier occupied by [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], [[Totonacan languages|Totonacan]] and [[Wastek language|Huastec]] peoples.<ref>Kaufman (2001).</ref> Through their integration in [[Mesoamerican]] the Mesoamerican cultural area the Nahuas adopted many cultural traits including maize agriculture and urbanism, [[Aztec religion|religious practices]] including a [[Aztec calendar|ritual calendar of 260 days]] and the practice of [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifices]] and the construction of monumental architecture and the use of [[Aztec writing|logographic writing]].\n\n[[Image:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|\"[[Atlantean figures]]\" from the Nahua culture of the [[Toltec]]s at [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].|alt=]]\n\nAround 1000 CE the [[Toltec]] people, normally assumed to have been of Nahua ethnicity, established dominion over much of central Mexico which they ruled from [[Tula (Hidalgo)|Tollan Xicocotitlan]].<ref>Porter Weaver. 1993. pp. 388-412</ref>\n\nFrom this period on the Nahua were the dominant ethnic group in the Valley of Mexico and far beyond, and migrations kept coming in from the north. After the fall of the Toltecs a period of large population movements followed and some Nahua groups such as the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] and [[Nicarao people|Nicarao]] arrived as far south as Nicaragua. And in central Mexico different Nahua groups based in their different [[Altepetl|\"Altepetl\" city-states]] fought for political dominance. The Xochimilca, based in [[Xochimilco]] ruled an area south of [[Lake Texcoco]]; the [[Tepanec]]s ruled the area to the west and the [[Acolhua]] ruled an area to the east of the valley. One of the last of the Nahua migrations to arrive in the valley settled on an island in the [[Lake Texcoco]] and proceeded to subjugate the surrounding tribes. This group were the [[Mexica]] who during the next 300 years became the dominant ethnic group of [[Mesoamerica]] ruling from [[Tenochtitlan]] their island capital. They formed the [[Aztec Empire]] after allying with the Tepanecs and Acolhua people of Texcoco, spreading the political and linguistic influence of the Nahuas well into Central America.\n\n===Conquest period (1519\u20131523)===\n{{main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}\n[[File:LienzodeTlaxcalaLamina5.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Tlaxcaltec]] soldiers leading a  Spaniard to [[Chalco (alt\u00e9petl)|Chalco]] from  ''[[History of Tlaxcala|Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'']]\nIn 1519 an expedition of Spaniards sailing from Cuba under the leadership of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] arrived on the Mexican gulf coast near the [[Totonac]] city of [[Quiyahuiztlan]]. The Totonacs were one of the peoples that were politically subjugated by the Aztecs and word was immediately sent to the Aztec Emperor (in Nahuatl, [[Tlatoani]]) of Tenochtitlan [[Moctezuma II|Motecuhzoma II]]. Going inland the Spaniards encountered and fought with Totonac forces and Nahua forces from the independent [[Altepetl]] of [[Tlaxcala (altepetl)|Tlaxcallan]]. The [[Tlaxcaltec]]s were a Nahua group who had avoided being subjugated by the Aztecs. After being defeated in battle by the Spaniards, the Tlaxcalans entered into an alliance with Cortes that would be invaluable in the struggle against the Aztecs.<ref>Account of Bernal Diaz from Victors and Vanquished: Spanish and Nahua Views of the Conquest of Mexico.  edited by Stuart Schwartz (Boston: Bedford/ St. Martin's, 2000).</ref> The Spanish and Tlaxcaltec forces marched upon several cities that were under Aztec dominion and \"liberated\" them, before they arrived in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. There they were welcomed as guests by Motecuhzoma II, but after a while they took the ruler prisoner. When the Aztec nobility realized that their ruler had been turned into a Spanish puppet they attacked the Spaniards and chased them out of the city. The Spaniards sought refuge in Tlaxcala where they regrouped and awaited reinforcements. During the next year they cooperated with large Tlaxcaltec armies and undertook a siege campaign resulting in the final fall of Tenochtitlan. After the fall of Tenochtitlan Spanish forces now also allied with the Aztecs to incorporate all the previous Aztec provinces into the realm of [[New Spain]]. New Spain was founded as a state under Spanish rule but where Nahua people were recognized as allies of the rulers and as such were granted privileges and a degree of independence that other indigenous peoples of the area did not enjoy. Recently historians such as Stephanie Wood and [[Matthew Restall]] have argued that the Nahua did not experience the conquest as something substantially different from the sort of ethnic conflicts that they were used to, and that in fact they may have at first interpreted it as a defeat of one Nahua group by another.<ref>Restall, 2003</ref>\n\n==Colonial Period 1521-1821==\nWith the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] in Mesoamerica a new political situation ensued. The period has been extensively studied by historians, with [[Charles Gibson]] publishing a classic monograph entitled ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule:  A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519-1810. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964.</ref> Historian [[James Lockhart (Historian)|James Lockhart]] built on that work, publishing ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'' in 1992. He divides the colonial history of the Nahua into three stages largely based on linguistic evidence in local-level Nahuatl sources, which he posits are an index of the degree of interaction between Spaniards and Nahuas and changes in Nahua culture.<ref>James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest: A Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, Sixteenth Through Eighteenth Centuries''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref> An overview of the Nahuas of colonial Central Mexico can be found in the ''Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas''.<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Native Peoples of Colonial Central Mexico\" in ''Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas'' vol. II, Part II, Mesoamerica, 2000, pp. 187-222.</ref>\n\n===Stage one (1519\u2013c. 1550) Conquest and early colonial period===\n{{See also|Aztec codices}}\n[[File:Tlaxcala- Palacio de Gobierno - Vertrag Spanier - Tlaxcalteken.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Tlaxcaltec|Tlaxcaltecs]] and Spanish at the founding of the Colonial Province of [[Tlaxcala]] in 1545.]]\nThe early period saw the first stages of the establishment of churches by mendicant friars in large and important Indian towns, the assertion of crown control over New Spain by the high court (''Audiencia'') and then the establishment of the viceroyalty, and the heyday of conqueror power over the indigenous via the [[encomienda]]. In the initial stage of the colonial period, contact between Spaniards and the indigenous populations was limited. It consisted mostly in the mendicants who sought to convert the population to Catholicism, and the reorganization of the indigenous tributary system to benefit individual Spaniards. The indigenous system of smaller settlements' paying tribute and rendering labor service to dominant political entities was transformed into the ''[[Encomienda]]'' system. Indigenous of particular towns paid tribute to a Spanish ''encomendero'' who was awarded the labor and tribute of that town.<ref>James Lockhart, 1969, \"Encomienda and Hacienda: The Evolution of the Great Estate in the Spanish Indies\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 49:411-29</ref><ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain'', Austin: University of Texas Press 1991.</ref> In this early period, the hereditary indigenous ruler or ''tlatoani'' and noblemen continued to hold power locally and were key to mobilizing tribute and labor for encomenderos. They also continued to hold titles from the pre-conquest period. Most willing accepted baptism so that records for this period show Nahua elites with Christian given names (indicating baptism) and many holding the Spanish noble title ''don''. A set of censuses in alphabetic Nahuatl for the Cuernavaca region c. 1535 gives us a baseline for the impact of Spanish on Nahuatl, showing few Spanish loanwords taken into Nahuatl.<ref>Sarah Cline, ''The Book of Tributes: Sixteenth-Century Nahuatl Censuses from Morelos''. Los Angeles: UCLA Latin American Center 1993.</ref>\n\nAs the Spaniards sought to extend their political dominance into the most remote corners of Mesoamerica, the Nahua accompanied them as auxiliaries. In the early colonial period, new Nahua settlements were made in northern Mexico and far south into Central America. Nahua forces often formed the bulk of the Spanish military expeditions that conquered other Mesoamerican peoples, such as the [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]] and [[Mixtecs]].\n\nWith the arrival of Christian missionaries, the first priority of the colonial authorities was eradicating indigenous religious practices, something they achieved by a combination of violence and threats of violence, and patient education. Nahua were baptized with Spanish names. The few Nahua who did not willingly abandon their religious practices were severely punished or executed. The Nahua, however, often incorporated pre-Christian practices and beliefs into the Christian religion without the authorities' noticing it. Often they kept practicing their own religion in the privacy of their homes, especially in rural areas where Spanish presence was almost completely lacking and the conversion process was slow.\n\nThe Nahua quickly took the Latin alphabetic writing as their own. Within 20 years of the arrival of the Spanish, the Nahua were composing texts in their own language. In 1536 the first university of the [[Americas]], the ''[[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]]'' was inaugurated. It was established by the Franciscans whose aim was to educate young Nahua noblemen to be Catholic priests who were trilingual: literate in Spanish, Latin and Nahuatl.<ref>Mathes, Michael, 1985, ''The Americas' first academic library Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco'', Sacramento\" California State Library.</ref>\n\n===Stage two (c. 1550\u2013c. 1650)===\n\nThere are a large number of texts by and about Nahuas in this middle period and during this period Nahuatl absorbed a large number of loanwords from Spanish, particularly nouns for particular objects, indicating the closer contact between the European sphere and the indigenous. However, Nahuatl verbs and syntax show no evidence of the impact of Spanish contact.<ref>James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref> In the mid-sixteenth century, cultural change at the local level can be tracked through the production of Nahuatl alphabetic texts. The production of began a wide range of written documents in Nahuatl dates from this period, including legal documents for transactions (bills of sale), minutes of indigenous town council (''cabildo'') records, petitions to the crown, and others.\n\nInstitutionally, indigenous town government shifted from the rule of the tlatoani and noblemen to the establishment of Spanish-style town councils (''cabildos''), with officers holding standard Spanish titles. A classic study of sixteenth-century Tlaxcala, the main ally of the Spaniards in the conquest of the Mexica, shows that much of the prehispanic structure continued into the colonial period.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century''. New Haven: Yale University Press 1952.</ref> An important set of cabildo records in Nahuatl for Tlaxcala is extant and shows how local government functioned in for nearly a century.<ref>James Lockhart, Frances Berdan, and Arthur J.O. Anderson. ''The Tlaxcalan Actas: A Compendium of the Records of the Records of the Cabildo of Tlaxcala, 1545-1627.'' Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1986.</ref>\n\nRegarding religion, by the mid- to late 16th century, even the most zealous mendicants of the first generation doubted the capacity of Nahua men to become Christian priests so that the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]] ceased to function to that end and in 1555 Indians were barred from ordination to the priesthood. However, in local communities, stone-built church complexes continued to be built and elaborated, with murals in mixed indigenous-Spanish forms.<ref>Jeanette Favrot Peterson, ''The Paradise Garden Murals of Malinalco: Utopia and Empire in Sixteenth-Century Mexico''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1993.</ref> Confraternities (''cofrad\u00edas'') were established to support the celebrations of a particular Christian saint and functioned as burial societies for members. During this period, an expression of personal piety, the Church promoted the making of last wills and testaments, with many testators donating money to their local Church to say Masses for their souls.\n\nFor individual Nahua men and women dictating a last will and testament to a local Nahua notary (''escribano'') became standard. These wills provide considerable information about individuals' residence, kin relations, and property ownership provides a window into social standing, differences between the sexes, and business practices at the local level. showing not only that literacy of some elite men in alphabetic writing in Nahuatl was a normal part of everyday life at the local level<ref>Frances Karttunen, \"Nahuatl Literacy\" in George A. Collier et al. eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States, pp. 395-417. New York: Academic Press.</ref> and that the notion of making a final will was expected, even for those who had little property. A number of studies in the tradition of what is now called the [[New Philology]] extensively use Nahuatl wills as a source.<ref>S.L.

Stanford University Press 2012.</ref>\n\nNahuas began to produce an entirely new type of text, known as \"primordial titles\" or simply \"titles\" (''t\u00edtulos''), that assert indigenous communities' rights to particular territory, often by recording local lore in an atemporal fashion. There is no known prehispanic precedent for this textual form and none appears before 1650.<ref>Lockhart, ''Nahuas After the Conquest'', pp. 410-11.</ref> Several factors might be at work for the appearance of titles. One might be a resurgence of indigenous population after decades recovering from devastating epidemics when communities might have been less concerned with Spanish encroachment. Another might be the crown's push to regularize defective land titles via a process known as ''composici\u00f3n''.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 285.</ref> The crown had mandated minimum land holdings for indigenous communities at 600 ''varas'', in property that was known as the ''fundo legal'', and to separate indigenous communities from Spanish lands by more than 1,100 varas. Towns were to have access to water, uplands for gathering firewood, and agricultural land, as well as common lands for pasturage.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', p. 285.</ref> Despite these mandated legal protections for Indian towns, courts continued to find in favor of Spaniards and the rules about minimum holdings for Indian towns were ignored in practice.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', pp. 285-287.</ref>\n\nLabor arrangements between Nahuas and Spaniards were largely informal, rather than organized through the mainly defunct [[encomienda]] and the poorly functioning [[repartimiento]]. Spanish landed estates needed a secure labor force, often a mixture of a small group of permanent laborers and part-time or seasonal laborers drawn from nearby indigenous communities. Individual Indians made arrangements with estate owners rather than labor being mobilized via the community. The indigenous communities continued to function as political entities, but there was greater fragmentation of units as dependent villages (''sujetos'') of the main settlement (''cabecera'') sought full, independent status themselves.<ref name=\"Lockhart, p. 428\"/> Indigenous officials were no longer necessarily noblemen.\n\n==National Period (1821-)==\nWith the achievement of [[Mexico|Mexican]] independence in 1821, the [[casta]] system, which divided the population into racial categories with differential rights, was eliminated and the term \"Indian\" (''indio'') was no longer used by government, although it continued to be used in daily speech.<ref>Frans J. Schreyer, \"Native Peoples of Central Mexico Since Independence\" in ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas'', Richard N. Adams and Murdo MacLeod, eds. Vol. II, part 2, 2000, p. 229.</ref> The creation of a republic in 1824 meant that Mexicans of all types were citizens rather than vassals of the crown. One important consequence for Nahuas and other indigenous was that documentation in the native languages generally ceased to be produced. Native towns did not cease to exist nor did indigenous populations speaking their own language, but the indigenous were far more marginalized in the post-independence period than during the colonial era. In the colonial era the crown had a paternalistic stance toward the Indians, in essence according them special rights, a [[fuero]], and giving support to structures in indigenous towns and giving natives a level of protection against non-Indians. This can be seen in the establishment of the General Indian Court where Indian towns and individual Indians could sue those making incursions on their land and other abuses.<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Native Peoples of Colonial Central Mexico\", p. 216-217.</ref> These protections disappeared in the national period. One scholar has characterized the early national period of Nahuas and other indigenous \"as the beginning of a systematic policy of cultural genocide and the increasing loss of native languages.\"<ref name=\"Schreyer p. 229\">Schreyer, \"Native Peoples of Central Mexico Since Independence\" p. 229.</ref> Lack of official recognition and both economic and cultural pressures meant that most indigenous peoples in Central Mexico became more Europeanized and many became Spanish speakers.<ref name=\"Schreyer p. 229\"/>\n\nIn nineteenth-century Mexico, the so-called \"Indian Question\" exercised politicians and intellectuals, who viewed the indigenous as backward, unassimilated to the Mexican nation, whose custom of communal rather than individual ownership of land was impediment to economic progress.<ref>Charles A. Hale, ''Mexican Liberalism in the Age of Mora'', New Haven: Yale University Press 1968, 224-225.</ref> Non-Indian landowners of estates had already encroached on indigenous ownership in the colonial era, but now liberal ideology sought to end communal protections on ownership with its emphasis on private property.<ref>Hale, ''Mexican Liberalism'', p. 225.</ref> Since land was the economic basis for Indians' ability to maintain a separate identity, land tenure became a central issue for liberal reformers. The liberal [[Reforma]] enshrined in the [[Constitution of 1857]] mandated the breakup of corporate-owned property, therefore targeting indigenous communities and the Roman Catholic Church, which also had significant holdings. This measure affected all indigenous communities, including Nahuas, holding land. Liberal [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], a Zapotec who became president of Mexico, was fully in support of laws to end corporate landholding. The outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in Morelos, which still had a significant Nahua population, was sparked by peasant resistance to the expansion of sugar estates. This was preceded in the nineteenth century by smaller indigenous revolts against encroachment, particularly during the civil war of the Reforma, foreign intervention, and a weak state following the exit of the French in 1867.<ref>Schreyer, \"Native Peoples of Central Mexico Since Independence\", p. 243.</ref>\n\nA number of indigenous men had made a place for themselves in post-independence Mexico, the most prominent being Benito Ju\u00e1rez. But an important nineteenth-century figure of Nahua was [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]] (1834\u201393), born in Tixtla, Guerrero who became a well respected liberal intellectual, man of letters, politician, and diplomat. Altamirano was a fierce anticlerical politician, and was known for a period as \"the [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]] of the Radicals\" and an admirer of the French Revolution.<ref>D.A. Brading, ''The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State 1492-1867''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 659, 663</ref> Altamirano, along with other liberals, saw universal primary public education as a key way to change Mexico, promoting for upward mobility. Altamirano's chief disciple in this view was [[Justo Sierra]].<ref>Brading, ''The First America'' p. 665</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n[[Image:Nahua man of Morelos.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Nahua man of Morelos ploughing a bean field by mule]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"right\"\n|-\n|+Speakers over 5 years of age in the ten states with most speakers (2000 census).
