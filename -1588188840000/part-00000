His device was not the first vacuum cleaner, but it was the first that was practical for home use. It was the first to use both a cloth filter bag and cleaning attachments. Spangler improved this basic model and received a patent for it in 1908. He formed the Electric Suction Sweeper Company to manufacture his device. [[The Hoover Company|William H. Hoover]] was so impressed with the vacuum cleaner that he bought into Spangler's business and patents.ok and he had kids and siblings\n\n==Early years and personal life==\nSpangler was one of ten children born to Mr. William Spangler & Mrs. Elizabeth Lind Spangler on November 20, 1848. The Spangler family was originally from [[Plains Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Plains Township]], Pennsylvania and settled in [[Stark County, Ohio]].\n\nOn May 21, 1874, Spangler married Elista (Lettie) Amanda Holtz. They had three children, Clarence, Francis and Jennie. In 1880 they moved to Akron.\n\n==Careers, jobs and patents==\nAfter moving to Akron, Spangler was in business with his brother selling gent's furnishings. He also worked for the Aultman Company as a salesman.\n\nSpangler was granted a patent on a grain harvester in 1887. He invented certain new and boring improvements such as the sliding tailboard made of sheet metal. He removed a standard tailboard and provided the sliding tailboard to regulate the width of the platform and adjust it to grain of different length. He also installed guards that prevented straw or grain from wrapping around the roller. Spangler invented a combined [[hay rake]] and [[tedder (machine)|tedder]] which was patented in 1893. By his peculiar arrangement, he was able to provide a combined hay rake and tedder in one machine, thereby reducing the cost. He formed a company for its sale which was unsuccessful and short-lived.\n\nIn 1897 he was granted a patent for a [[velocipede]] wagon and sold his invention to a company in Springfield, Ohio. He claimed as new \u201cthe combination of the body or box, mounted upon traveling wheels\u201d.<ref>\"Velocipede-Wagon\" {{US patent|576746}}, issue date: Feb 1897</ref> The bicycle became quite popular at the same time and interfered with the sale of the wagon.\n\nHe later worked as a sweeper at the Zollinger Dept. Store located in the Folwell Building. located on the northwest corner of the public square in Canton, Ohio. (The top floor was occupied \u2013 in 1907 - by the Elks Club and the remaining floors occupied by the Wm. R. Zollinger Dept. Store.)\n\n==Invention of the portable electric vacuum cleaner==\nSpangler was an asthmatic. Almost 60 and cursed with strong disease, he grew frustrated at the tiring and dusty work of sweeping the carpet in the store where he worked. He suspected that the carpet sweeper he used on the job was the source of his cough. A tinkerer at heart, he set his mind to making an electric carpet sweeper.<ref>[https://books.google.cl/books?id=wGwj8UYt7g8C&pg=PT207 Mark Jackson. \"Asthma: The Biography\". Ed. Oxford University Press, 2009] {{ISBN|9780191622823}}. pp. 207\u2013208]</ref>\n\nWhile watching a rotary street sweeper in operation, Spangler got the idea to mount the motor from a ceiling fan onto a carpet sweeper and cut a hole in the back of the sweeper to attach fan blades which would blow dirt out of the rear of the cleaner into an attached dirt bag (a pillow case he borrowed from the store). He attached a leather belt from the motor shaft to the wood cylinder brush roll and a broom stick supplied the handle. In his next attempt he used a wooden soap box as the main body. He used his invention successfully in cleaning the Folwell Building. Bringing his ingenuity to bear on the problem, Spangler fashioned a tin box, a pillowcase, an electric fan, and a broom handle into something we might recognize today as a crude vacuum cleaner. Spangler called it a \"suction sweeper.\"\n\nDespite being primitive and unwieldy, it worked\u2014Spangler's asthma abated, and he received a patent for his troubles. He also realized that he might finally have a salable invention. Spangler first tested his invention in 1907. During the next year, he refined the vacuum numerous times, and on June 2, 1908, he received a patent for his sweeper.\n\nSpangler, with $5000.00 invested by a friend, formed the Electric Suction Sweeper Company. Ray Harned, nephew and financial representative of F.G. and W.H. Folwell, formed a partnership with Spangler in the fall of 1907. The Folwells had financed Zollingers and were financing Spangler who had filed an application for a patent in September 1907. However, in just a few months, finances were gone. Spangler didn't have the capital to mass-produce his gadget. So he showed the suction sweeper to his cousin Susan Hoover, who tried it, liked it, and extolled its virtues to her husband, [[The Hoover Company|William Hoover]], a leather-goods manufacturer.\n\nThe timing was fortuitous: With the automobile gaining popularity, William Hoover was concerned about the market for his horse collars and harnesses, and was eager to diversify. In 1908 he bought Spangler's patent, and he soon had a small staff toiling in the corner of his leather shop, turning out six suction sweepers a day. William Hoover made further improvements to the vacuum cleaner that resembled a bagpipe attached to a cake box, a novel look that was very functional. Sluggish sales of the Hoover vacuum cleaner were given a kick by Hoover\u2019s ten-day, free home trial. Hoover came up with the idea of door-to-door salesmen who gave home demonstrations of the new vacuum cleaners. Hoover's success means that most people today associate the vacuum cleaner with him, rather than with Spangler.\n\n==Later years==\nAfter Spangler sold the patents to William Hoover, he stayed on with the Hoover Company as the superintendent. Spangler's wife and daughter (Jennie Spangler Painter) made all the bags for the sweepers until 1914 when the bag making was taken to New Berlin. His son, Clarence, worked for about a year with The Electric Suction Sweeper Co. in New Berlin. He became very ill and died in December 1911.\n\nSpangler was planning the first vacation of his life, a trip to Florida. He died on January 22, 1915, the night before he was expected to leave for the trip at the age of 66. Spangler's family continued to receive royalties until his patent expired June 2, 1925.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vacuum cleaner]]\n* [[The Hoover Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Patents===\n* Spangler, {{US patent|356171}}, \"''Grain Harvester''\"\n* Spangler, {{US patent|492341}}, \"''Combined Hay Rake and Tedder''\"\n* Spangler, {{US patent|576746}}, \"''Velocipede Wagon''\"\n* Spangler, {{US patent|889823}}, \"''Carpet Sweeper and Cleaner''\"\n* Spangler, {{US patent|1073301}}, \"''Suction Carpet Sweeper''\"\n{{The Hoover Company}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spangler, James M.}}\n[[Category:American inventors]]\n[[Category:1848 births]]\n[[Category:1915 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at West Lawn Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Janitors]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox scientist\n| name              = James Murray Spangler\n| image             = {{#Property:P18}}\n| image_size        = 180px\n| birth_date        = {{birth date|mf=y|1848|11|20}}\n| birth_place       = [[Plains Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]]\n| death_date        = {{death date and age|mf=y|1915|01|22|1848|11|20}}\n| death_place       = [[Chicago, Illinois]]\n|restingplace=[[West Lawn Cemetery]], [[Canton, Ohio]]\n| residence         = Canton, Ohio\n| occupation = [[Inventor]], [[salesman]], [[janitor]]\n| known_for         = Invention of the portable electric vacuum cleaner\n| prizes            = [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] (2006)\n}}\n\n'''James Murray Spangler''' (November 20, 1848 \u2013 January 22, 1915) was an American inventor, salesman and janitor who invented the first commercially successful portable electric vacuum cleaner that revolutionized household carpet cleaning.

He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], where, while an undergraduate, he published several translations of [[Latin]] works, including [[Erasmus]]' ''[[In Praise of Folly]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nKennett was [[vicar]] of [[Ambrosden]], Oxfordshire from 1685 until 1708. During his incumbency he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, where he gave considerable impetus to the study of antiquities. [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]] gave him lessons in [[Old English]]. In 1695 he published ''Parochial Antiquities''. In 1700 he became rector of [[St Botolph's Aldgate]], London, and in 1701 [[List of Archdeacons of Huntingdon|Archdeacon of Huntingdon]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nFor a eulogistic [[sermon]] on the recently deceased [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]], Kennett was in 1707 recommended to the [[List of deans of Peterborough#18th century|deanery of Peterborough]]. He afterwards joined the Low Church party, strenuously opposed the [[Henry Sacheverell|Sacheverell]] movement, and in the [[Bangorian controversy]] supported with great zeal and considerable bitterness the side of [[Benjamin Hoadly|Bishop Hoadly]]. His intimacy with [[Charles Trimnell]], [[bishop of Norwich]], who was high in favour with [[George I of Great Britain]], secured for him in 1718 the [[bishopric of Peterborough]]. He died at Westminster in December 1728. White Kennett Street, near St Botolph, Aldgate, is named after him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Biography==\nWhite Kennett was born in the parish of St Mary, Dover, on 10 August 1660, the son of Basil Kennett, M.A., rector of Dimchurch and vicar of Postling, Kent, by his wife Mary, eldest daughter of Thomas White, a wealthy magistrate and master-shipwright of Dover. After receiving a preliminary education at Elham and Wye, he was placed at Westminster 'above the curtain,' or in the upper school; but as he was suffering from smallpox at the period of the election of scholars on the foundation, his father recalled him home. After his recovery he spent a year at Beaksbourne, in the family of Mr. Tolson, whose three sons he taught 'with great content and success.'<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Kennett, White|volume=31}}</ref> He was the older brother of [[Basil Kennett]], whose life and career he was considerably to influence.\n\nHe was entered a batler or semi-commoner of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in June 1678, being placed under the tuition of [[Andrew Allam]]. According to [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Hearne]] he 'sometimes waited on Dr. Wallis to church with his skarlett,' and performed other menial offices, but, on the other hand, he associated with the gentlemen-commoners. While an undergraduate he began his career as a writer by publishing anonymously, just before the assembling of parliament at Oxford on 21 March 1680\u20131, ''A Letter from a Student at Oxford to a Friend in the Country, concerning the approaching Parliament, in vindication of his Majesty, the Church of England, and the University''. The whig party endeavoured to discover the author, with a view to his punishment, but the sudden dissolution of the parliament put an end to the incident and occasioned the publication of Kennett's second piece, ''A Poem to Mr. E. L. on his Majesty's dissolving the late Parliament at Oxford'', 28 March 1681.\n\nAbout this period Kennett was introduced to [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]], who employed him in collecting epitaphs and notices of eminent Oxford men. In his diary, 2 March 1681\u20132, Wood notes that he had directed five shillings to be given to Kennett \"for pains he hath taken for me in Kent\". On 2 May 1682 Kennett graduated [[Bachelor of Arts#United Kingdom and Ireland|BA]], and next year published a version of [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus's]] [[In Praise of Folly|''The Praise of Folly|Mori\u00e6 Encomium'']], under the title of ''Wit against Wisdom: or a Panegyric upon Folly'', 1683, 8vo. In the following year he contributed the life of [[Chabrias]] to the edition of [[Cornelius Nepos]], \"done into English by several hands\". He commenced [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] on 22 January 1684, and having taken holy orders he became curate and assistant to Samuel Blackwell, B.D., vicar and schoolmaster of Bicester, Oxfordshire. [[Sir William Glynne, 1st Baronet|Sir William Glynne]] presented him in September 1685 to the neighbouring vicarage of [[Ambrosden]]. Soon afterwards he published ''An Address of Thanks to a good Prince; presented in the Panegyric of Pliny upon Trajan, the best of Roman Emperors'', London, 1686, 8vo, with a high-flown preface expressing his loyalty to the throne.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Political views===\nKennett's political views were quickly modified by dislike of the ecclesiastical policy of [[James II of England|James II]]. He preached a series of discourses against \"popery\", refused to read the 'Declaration for Liberty of Conscience' in 1688, and acted with the majority of the clergy in the diocese of Oxford when they rejected an address to the king recommended by Bishop Parker. Hearne relates that at the beginning of the [[Glorious Revolution]] Kennett lent Dodwell a manuscript treatise, composed by himself and never printed, offering arguments for taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to William and Mary. Subsequently, Kennett openly supported the cause of the revolution, and thereby exposed himself to much obloquy from his former friends, who called him 'Weathercock Kennett'. In January 1689, while shooting at Middleton Stoney, his gun burst and fractured his skull. The operation of trepanning was successfully performed, but he was obliged to wear a large black patch of velvet on his forehead during the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nAfter a few years' absence at Ambrosden he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], and in September 1691 was chosen lecturer of [[Carfax, Oxford|St Martin's, commonly called Carfax, Oxford]]. He was also appointed a public lecturer in the schools, and filled the office of pro-proctor for two successive years. He proceeded [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] on 5 May 1694. In February 1694\u20135 he was presented by William Cherry to the rectory of [[Shottesbrooke]], Berkshire. He was created [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] at Oxford on 19 July 1700, and in the same year was presented to the rectory of [[St Botolph's Aldgate]]. He resigned the vicarage of Ambrosden, and did not obtain possession of St Botolph's without a lawsuit. On 15 February 1701 he was installed in the [[Prebendary|prebend]] of Combe and Harnham, in the church of Salisbury.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Antiquarian reputation===\nKennett's historical and antiquarian researches had meanwhile procured him some reputation. From [[George Hickes (divine)|Dr George Hickes]] (afterwards [[Nonjuring schism|nonjuring]] bishop of Thetford), who lived for a time in seclusion with him at Ambrosden, he received instruction in the Anglo-Saxon and other northern tongues. For several years the two scholars were on the most friendly terms, but eventually there was an open rupture between them, owing to religious and political differences. Kennett contributed a life of [[William Somner]] to the [[James Brome]]'s edition of that antiquary's ''Treatise of the Roman Ports and Forts in Kent'' (1693), and the biography was enlarged and reissued in Somner's ''Treatise of Gavelkind'', 2nd edition 1726. His reputation as a [[Topography|topographer]] and [[Philology|philologist]] was enhanced by his ''Parochial Antiquities attempted in the History of Ambrosden, Burcester, and other adjacent parts in the counties of Oxford and Bucks, with a Glossary of Obsolete Terms'', Oxford, 1695, 4to, dedicated to his patron, Sir W. Glynne. A new edition, greatly enlarged from the author's manuscript notes, was issued at Oxford (2 vols. 1818, 4to) under the editorship of [[Bulkeley Bandinel]]. While engaged on this work the question of lay impropriations had come much under his notice, and he published \"for the terror of evil-doers\" the ''History and Fate of Sacrilege, discovered by examples of Scripture, of Heathens, of Christians'', London, 1698, 8vo, written by [[Henry Spelman|Sir Henry Spelman]] in 1632, but omitted from the edition of that author's ''Posthumous Works''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Chaplain to Bishop Gardiner===\nKennett was now chaplain to [[James Gardiner (bishop)|Bishop Gardiner of Lincoln]], and on 15 May 1701 became archdeacon of Huntingdon. Thereupon he entered into a controversy with [[Francis Atterbury]] about the rights of [[Convocation]], and ably supported [[William Wake|Dr Wake]] and [[Edmund Gibson]] in their contention that convocation had few inherent rights of independent action. In Warburton's view, Kennett's arguments were based on precedents, while Atterbury's rested on principles. On [[Thomas Tenison|Archbishop Tenison's]] recommendation he was appointed in 1701 one of the original members of the [[USPG|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]]. In a sermon preached in his parish church of Aldgate on 31 January 1703\u20134, the fast day for the martyrdom of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], Kennett acknowledged that there had been some errors in his reign, owing to a 'popish' queen and a corrupt ministry, whose policy tended in the direction of an absolute tyranny. To correct exaggerated statements made about this sermon, Kennett printed it under the title of ''A Compassionate Enquiry into the Causes of the Civil War'', London (three editions), 1704, 4to. It elicited many angry replies from his high-church opponents.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1704 he published ''The Case of Impropriations, and of the Augmentation of Vicarages, and other insufficient Cures, stated by History and Law, from the first Usurpations of the Popes and Monks, to her Majesty's Royal Bounty lately extended to the poorer Clergy of the Church of England''. A copy of this work, bound in two vols., with copious additions by the author, was formerly in the possession of [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]], and is now in the [[Bodleian Library]]. In 1705 some booksellers undertook a collection of the best works on English history down to the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and induced Kennett to write a continuation to the time of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Although it appeared anonymously as the third volume of the ''Compleat History of England'', 1706, fol., the author's name soon became known, and he was exposed to renewed attacks from his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] enemies. A new edition, with corrections, was published in 1719, but it was not until 1740 that there appeared [[Roger North (biographer)|Roger North's]] ''Examen, or an Inquiry into the Credit and Veracity of a pretended Complete History, viz. Dr. White Kennett's \"History of England\"''. His popularity at court was increased by the published denunciations of his views, and he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to her majesty. He was installed in the deanery of Peterborough 21 February 1707\u20138. A few days previously he had been collated to the prebend of Marston St Laurence, in the church of Lincoln.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nA sermon which he preached at the funeral of the first [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] on 5 September 1707, and which laid him open to the charge of encouraging a deathbed repentance, was published by Henry Hills, without a dedication, in 1707. To a second edition, published by John Churchill in 1708, with a dedication to [[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire|William, second duke of Devonshire]], was appended ''Memoirs of the Family of Cavendish'', a separate edition of which was published by Hills in the same year. A new edition of the sermon, with the author's manuscript corrections, was published by [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]] in 1797, but very few copies were sold, and the remainder were destroyed by fire. The imputation against Kennett was fresh in the memory of [[Alexander Pope]] when in the ''[[An Essay on Criticism|Essay on Criticism]]'' he wrote:<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n:''Then unbelieving priests reformed the nation,''\n:''And taught more pleasing methods of salvation''\n\nKennett's subsequent preferment was naturally connected by his enemies with the strain of adulatory reference to the second duke with which the sermon concludes.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===St Mary Aldermary, London===\nIn 1707, desiring more leisure for study, he resigned the rectory of St Botolph, Aldgate, and obtained the less remunerative rectory of [[St Mary Aldermary]], London. During this period he published numerous sermons, and his pen was actively engaged in support of his party. He zealously opposed the doctrine of the invalidity of lay baptism, and his answer to [[Henry Sacheverell]]'s sermon preached before the lord mayor on 5 November 1709 raised a storm of indignation. In 1710 he was severely censured for not joining in the congratulatory address of the London clergy to the queen, which was drawn up on the accession of the tories to office after Sacheverell's trial. Kennett and others who declined to subscribe it were represented as enemies to the crown and ministry.\n\n[[Richard Welton]], rector of [[St Mary Matfelon]], Whitechapel, introduced into an altar-piece in his church a portrait of Kennett to represent [[Judas Iscariot]]. It was stated that the rector had caused Kennett's figure to be substituted for that of [[Gilbert Burnet]] at the suggestion of the painter, who feared an action of [[Privilege of peerage#Scandalum magnatum|''scandalum magnatum'']] if Burnet were introduced. A print of the picture in the library of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] is accompanied with these manuscript lines by [[Michel Maittaire]]:\n\n:''To say the picture does to him belong,''\n:''Kennett does Judas and the Painter wrong.''\n:''False is the image, the resemblance faint:''\n:''Judas compared to Kennett is a Saint.''\n\nMultitudes of people visited the church daily to see the painting, but [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], bishop of London, soon ordered its removal. For many years afterwards it is said to have ornamented the high altar at [[St Albans Cathedral]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Society for the Propagation of the Gospel===\nTo advance the interests of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, Kennett made a collection of books, charts, maps, and documents, with the intention of composing a ''History of the Propagation of Christianity in the English-American Colonies'', and on the relinquishment of that project he presented his collections to the corporation, and printed a catalogue entitled ''Bibliothec\u00e6 American\u00e6 Primordia'', London, 1713, 4to, afterwards republished with additions by [[Henry Homer the elder]], 1789, 4to. He also founded an antiquarian and historical library at Peterborough, and enriched the library of that church with some scarce books, including an abstract of the manuscript collections made by Dr John Cosens, bishop of that see, and a copiously annotated copy of [[Simon Gunton|Gunton's]] ''History of Peterborough''. The collection, consisting of about fifteen hundred books and tracts, was placed in a private room at Peterborough, and a manuscript catalogue was drawn up and subscribed ''Index librorum aliquot vetustorum quos in commune bonum congessit W. K., Decan. Petriburg. MDCCXII''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Bishop of Peterborough===\nOn 25 July 1713 Kennett was installed prebendary of Farrendon-cum-Balderton at Lincoln. He preached vehemently against the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]], and in the two following years warmly advocated the repeal of the acts against occasional conformity. In the [[Bangorian controversy]] he opposed the proceedings of convocation against [[Benjamin Hoadly|Bishop Hoadly]]. By the influence of his friend [[Charles Trimnell|Dr Charles Trimnell]], bishop of Norwich and afterwards of Winchester, he was appointed bishop of Peterborough; he was consecrated at [[Lambeth Palace|Lambeth]] on 9 November 1718, and had permission to hold the archdeaconry of Huntingdon and a prebend in Salisbury in commendam. He died ten years later at his house in [[St James's Street]] Westminster, on 19 December 1728. He was buried in [[Peterborough Cathedral]], where a marble monument with a brief Latin inscription was erected to his memory.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Family===\nHe married first, on 6 June 1693, Sarah, only daughter of Robert and Mary Carver of Bicester (she died on 2 March 1693\u20134, sine prole); secondly, on 6 June 1695, Sarah, sister of Richard Smith, M.D., of London and Aylesbury (she died in August 1702); thirdly, in 1703, Dorcas, daughter of Thomas Fuller, D.D., rector of Wellinghale, Essex, and widow of Clopton Havers, M.D. (she died 9 July 1743). His second wife bore him a son, White Kennett, rector of Burton-le-Coggles, Lincolnshire, and prebendary of Peterborough, Lincoln, and London, who died on 6 May 1740; and a daughter Sarah, who married John Newman of Shottesbrook, Berkshire, and died on 22 February 1756. Hearne, writing on 26 April 1707, says that Kennett's 'present [his third] wife wears the breeches, as his haughty, insolent temper deserves'.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Character===\nHis biographer, the Rev. William Newton, admits that his zeal as a whig partisan sometimes carried him to extremes, but he was very charitable, and displayed great moderation in his relations with the dissenters. He is now remembered chiefly as a painstaking and laborious antiquary, especially in the department of ecclesiastical biography. The number of his works both in print and manuscript shows him to have been throughout his life a man of incredible diligence and application. He was always ready to communicate the results of his researches to fellow-students.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{abbreviations|section|cf. to. q.v. &c. etcetera|date=January 2015}}\n{{citation style|section|date=January 2015}}\n\nProbably his best-known work, apart from his ''Compleat History'', was his ''Register and Chronicle, Ecclesiastical and Civil: containing Matters of Fact delivered in the words of the most Authentick Books, Papers, and Records; digested in exact order of time. With papers, notes, and references towards discovering and connecting the true History of England from the Restauration of King Charles II'', vol. i. London, 1728, fol. The original materials for this valuable work are preserved in the [[British Museum]] among the [[Lansdowne manuscripts]]. 1002\u20131010. The manuscript volumes bring the register to 1679. The published volume begins with the Restoration, and only comes down to December 1662.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nKennett published more than twelve separate sermons preached on public occasions between 1694 and 1728, and others in support of charity schools (cf. ''The Excellent Daughter'', 1708; 11th edit. 1807) or of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (cf. sermon issued in 1712). His addresses to his clergy at Peterborough on his first visitation were issued in 1720.

Some manuscript verses by Kennett on ''Religious and Moral Subjects, translated from some of the chief Italian Poets'', belonged to S. W. Rix in 1855, and manuscript notes by Kennett, written in a Bible, were printed in ''Notes and Queries'' for 1885. Sir Walter Scott first printed, in his ''Life of Swift'', p.&nbsp;137, from a manuscript in the British Museum, the well-known description by Kennett of Swift's attendance in Queen Anne's antechamber (November 1713).<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nMany of Kennett's manuscripts, which once formed part of the library of James West, president of the Royal Society, were purchased in 1773 by the Earl of Shelburne (afterwards Marquis of Lansdowne), with whose collection they passed, in 1807, to the British Museum. They are now numbered 935\u20131041 in the Lansdowne collection.

He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], where, while an undergraduate, he published several translations of [[Latin]] works, including [[Erasmus]]' ''[[In Praise of Folly]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nKennett was [[vicar]] of [[Ambrosden]], Oxfordshire from 1685 until 1708. During his incumbency he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, where he gave considerable impetus to the study of antiquities. [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]] gave him lessons in [[Old English]]. In 1695 he published ''Parochial Antiquities''. In 1700 he became rector of [[St Botolph's Aldgate]], London, and in 1701 [[List of Archdeacons of Huntingdon|Archdeacon of Huntingdon]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nFor a eulogistic [[sermon]] on the recently deceased [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]], Kennett was in 1707 recommended to the [[List of deans of Peterborough#18th century|deanery of Peterborough]]. He afterwards joined the Low Church party, strenuously opposed the [[Henry Sacheverell|Sacheverell]] movement, and in the [[Bangorian controversy]] supported with great zeal and considerable bitterness the side of [[Benjamin Hoadly|Bishop Hoadly]]. His intimacy with [[Charles Trimnell]], [[bishop of Norwich]], who was high in favour with [[George I of Great Britain]], secured for him in 1718 the [[bishopric of Peterborough]]. He died at Westminster in December 1728. White Kennett Street, near St Botolph, Aldgate, is named after him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Biography==\nWhite Kennett was born in the parish of St Mary, Dover, on 10 August 1660, the son of Basil Kennett, M.A., rector of Dimchurch and vicar of Postling, Kent, by his wife Mary, eldest daughter of Thomas White, a wealthy magistrate and master-shipwright of Dover. After receiving a preliminary education at Elham and Wye, he was placed at Westminster 'above the curtain,' or in the upper school; but as he was suffering from smallpox at the period of the election of scholars on the foundation, his father recalled him home. After his recovery he spent a year at Beaksbourne, in the family of Mr. Tolson, whose three sons he taught 'with great content and success.'<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Kennett, White|volume=31}}</ref> He was the older brother of [[Basil Kennett]], whose life and career he was considerably to influence.\n\nHe was entered a batler or semi-commoner of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in June 1678, being placed under the tuition of [[Andrew Allam]]. According to [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Hearne]] he 'sometimes waited on Dr. Wallis to church with his skarlett,' and performed other menial offices, but, on the other hand, he associated with the gentlemen-commoners. While an undergraduate he began his career as a writer by publishing anonymously, just before the assembling of parliament at Oxford on 21 March 1680\u20131, ''A Letter from a Student at Oxford to a Friend in the Country, concerning the approaching Parliament, in vindication of his Majesty, the Church of England, and the University''. The whig party endeavoured to discover the author, with a view to his punishment, but the sudden dissolution of the parliament put an end to the incident and occasioned the publication of Kennett's second piece, ''A Poem to Mr. E. L. on his Majesty's dissolving the late Parliament at Oxford'', 28 March 1681.\n\nAbout this period Kennett was introduced to [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]], who employed him in collecting epitaphs and notices of eminent Oxford men. In his diary, 2 March 1681\u20132, Wood notes that he had directed five shillings to be given to Kennett \"for pains he hath taken for me in Kent\". On 2 May 1682 Kennett graduated [[Bachelor of Arts#United Kingdom and Ireland|BA]], and next year published a version of [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus's]] [[In Praise of Folly|''The Praise of Folly|Mori\u00e6 Encomium'']], under the title of ''Wit against Wisdom: or a Panegyric upon Folly'', 1683, 8vo. In the following year he contributed the life of [[Chabrias]] to the edition of [[Cornelius Nepos]], \"done into English by several hands\". He commenced [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] on 22 January 1684, and having taken holy orders he became curate and assistant to Samuel Blackwell, B.D., vicar and schoolmaster of Bicester, Oxfordshire. [[Sir William Glynne, 1st Baronet|Sir William Glynne]] presented him in September 1685 to the neighbouring vicarage of [[Ambrosden]]. Soon afterwards he published ''An Address of Thanks to a good Prince; presented in the Panegyric of Pliny upon Trajan, the best of Roman Emperors'', London, 1686, 8vo, with a high-flown preface expressing his loyalty to the throne.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Political views===\nKennett's political views were quickly modified by dislike of the ecclesiastical policy of [[James II of England|James II]]. He preached a series of discourses against \"popery\", refused to read the 'Declaration for Liberty of Conscience' in 1688, and acted with the majority of the clergy in the diocese of Oxford when they rejected an address to the king recommended by Bishop Parker. Hearne relates that at the beginning of the [[Glorious Revolution]] Kennett lent Dodwell a manuscript treatise, composed by himself and never printed, offering arguments for taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to William and Mary. Subsequently, Kennett openly supported the cause of the revolution, and thereby exposed himself to much obloquy from his former friends, who called him 'Weathercock Kennett'. In January 1689, while shooting at Middleton Stoney, his gun burst and fractured his skull. The operation of trepanning was successfully performed, but he was obliged to wear a large black patch of velvet on his forehead during the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nAfter a few years' absence at Ambrosden he returned to Oxford as tutor and vice-principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], and in September 1691 was chosen lecturer of [[Carfax, Oxford|St Martin's, commonly called Carfax, Oxford]]. He was also appointed a public lecturer in the schools, and filled the office of pro-proctor for two successive years. He proceeded [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] on 5 May 1694. In February 1694\u20135 he was presented by William Cherry to the rectory of [[Shottesbrooke]], Berkshire. He was created [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] at Oxford on 19 July 1700, and in the same year was presented to the rectory of [[St Botolph's Aldgate]]. He resigned the vicarage of Ambrosden, and did not obtain possession of St Botolph's without a lawsuit. On 15 February 1701 he was installed in the [[Prebendary|prebend]] of Combe and Harnham, in the church of Salisbury.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Antiquarian reputation===\nKennett's historical and antiquarian researches had meanwhile procured him some reputation. From [[George Hickes (divine)|Dr George Hickes]] (afterwards [[Nonjuring schism|nonjuring]] bishop of Thetford), who lived for a time in seclusion with him at Ambrosden, he received instruction in the Anglo-Saxon and other northern tongues. For several years the two scholars were on the most friendly terms, but eventually there was an open rupture between them, owing to religious and political differences. Kennett contributed a life of [[William Somner]] to the [[James Brome]]'s edition of that antiquary's ''Treatise of the Roman Ports and Forts in Kent'' (1693), and the biography was enlarged and reissued in Somner's ''Treatise of Gavelkind'', 2nd edition 1726. His reputation as a [[Topography|topographer]] and [[Philology|philologist]] was enhanced by his ''Parochial Antiquities attempted in the History of Ambrosden, Burcester, and other adjacent parts in the counties of Oxford and Bucks, with a Glossary of Obsolete Terms'', Oxford, 1695, 4to, dedicated to his patron, Sir W. Glynne. A new edition, greatly enlarged from the author's manuscript notes, was issued at Oxford (2 vols. 1818, 4to) under the editorship of [[Bulkeley Bandinel]]. While engaged on this work the question of lay impropriations had come much under his notice, and he published \"for the terror of evil-doers\" the ''History and Fate of Sacrilege, discovered by examples of Scripture, of Heathens, of Christians'', London, 1698, 8vo, written by [[Henry Spelman|Sir Henry Spelman]] in 1632, but omitted from the edition of that author's ''Posthumous Works''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Chaplain to Bishop Gardiner===\nKennett was now chaplain to [[James Gardiner (bishop)|Bishop Gardiner of Lincoln]], and on 15 May 1701 became archdeacon of Huntingdon. Thereupon he entered into a controversy with [[Francis Atterbury]] about the rights of [[Convocation]], and ably supported [[William Wake|Dr Wake]] and [[Edmund Gibson]] in their contention that convocation had few inherent rights of independent action. In Warburton's view, Kennett's arguments were based on precedents, while Atterbury's rested on principles. On [[Thomas Tenison|Archbishop Tenison's]] recommendation he was appointed in 1701 one of the original members of the [[USPG|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]]. In a sermon preached in his parish church of Aldgate on 31 January 1703\u20134, the fast day for the martyrdom of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], Kennett acknowledged that there had been some errors in his reign, owing to a 'popish' queen and a corrupt ministry, whose policy tended in the direction of an absolute tyranny. To correct exaggerated statements made about this sermon, Kennett printed it under the title of ''A Compassionate Enquiry into the Causes of the Civil War'', London (three editions), 1704, 4to. It elicited many angry replies from his high-church opponents.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1704 he published ''The Case of Impropriations, and of the Augmentation of Vicarages, and other insufficient Cures, stated by History and Law, from the first Usurpations of the Popes and Monks, to her Majesty's Royal Bounty lately extended to the poorer Clergy of the Church of England''. A copy of this work, bound in two vols., with copious additions by the author, was formerly in the possession of [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]], and is now in the [[Bodleian Library]]. In 1705 some booksellers undertook a collection of the best works on English history down to the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and induced Kennett to write a continuation to the time of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Although it appeared anonymously as the third volume of the ''Compleat History of England'', 1706, fol., the author's name soon became known, and he was exposed to renewed attacks from his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] enemies. A new edition, with corrections, was published in 1719, but it was not until 1740 that there appeared [[Roger North (biographer)|Roger North's]] ''Examen, or an Inquiry into the Credit and Veracity of a pretended Complete History, viz. Dr. White Kennett's \"History of England\"''. His popularity at court was increased by the published denunciations of his views, and he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to her majesty. He was installed in the deanery of Peterborough 21 February 1707\u20138. A few days previously he had been collated to the prebend of Marston St Laurence, in the church of Lincoln.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nA sermon which he preached at the funeral of the first [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] on 5 September 1707, and which laid him open to the charge of encouraging a deathbed repentance, was published by Henry Hills, without a dedication, in 1707. To a second edition, published by John Churchill in 1708, with a dedication to [[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire|William, second duke of Devonshire]], was appended ''Memoirs of the Family of Cavendish'', a separate edition of which was published by Hills in the same year. A new edition of the sermon, with the author's manuscript corrections, was published by [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]] in 1797, but very few copies were sold, and the remainder were destroyed by fire. The imputation against Kennett was fresh in the memory of [[Alexander Pope]] when in the ''[[An Essay on Criticism|Essay on Criticism]]'' he wrote:<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n:''Then unbelieving priests reformed the nation,''\n:''And taught more pleasing methods of salvation''\n\nKennett's subsequent preferment was naturally connected by his enemies with the strain of adulatory reference to the second duke with which the sermon concludes.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===St Mary Aldermary, London===\nIn 1707, desiring more leisure for study, he resigned the rectory of St Botolph, Aldgate, and obtained the less remunerative rectory of [[St Mary Aldermary]], London. During this period he published numerous sermons, and his pen was actively engaged in support of his party. He zealously opposed the doctrine of the invalidity of lay baptism, and his answer to [[Henry Sacheverell]]'s sermon preached before the lord mayor on 5 November 1709 raised a storm of indignation. In 1710 he was severely censured for not joining in the congratulatory address of the London clergy to the queen, which was drawn up on the accession of the tories to office after Sacheverell's trial. Kennett and others who declined to subscribe it were represented as enemies to the crown and ministry.\n\n[[Richard Welton]], rector of [[St Mary Matfelon]], Whitechapel, introduced into an altar-piece in his church a portrait of Kennett to represent [[Judas Iscariot]]. It was stated that the rector had caused Kennett's figure to be substituted for that of [[Gilbert Burnet]] at the suggestion of the painter, who feared an action of [[Privilege of peerage#Scandalum magnatum|''scandalum magnatum'']] if Burnet were introduced. A print of the picture in the library of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] is accompanied with these manuscript lines by [[Michel Maittaire]]:\n\n:''To say the picture does to him belong,''\n:''Kennett does Judas and the Painter wrong.''\n:''False is the image, the resemblance faint:''\n:''Judas compared to Kennett is a Saint.''\n\nMultitudes of people visited the church daily to see the painting, but [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Henry Compton]], bishop of London, soon ordered its removal. For many years afterwards it is said to have ornamented the high altar at [[St Albans Cathedral]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Society for the Propagation of the Gospel===\nTo advance the interests of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, Kennett made a collection of books, charts, maps, and documents, with the intention of composing a ''History of the Propagation of Christianity in the English-American Colonies'', and on the relinquishment of that project he presented his collections to the corporation, and printed a catalogue entitled ''Bibliothec\u00e6 American\u00e6 Primordia'', London, 1713, 4to, afterwards republished with additions by [[Henry Homer the elder]], 1789, 4to. He also founded an antiquarian and historical library at Peterborough, and enriched the library of that church with some scarce books, including an abstract of the manuscript collections made by Dr John Cosens, bishop of that see, and a copiously annotated copy of [[Simon Gunton|Gunton's]] ''History of Peterborough''. The collection, consisting of about fifteen hundred books and tracts, was placed in a private room at Peterborough, and a manuscript catalogue was drawn up and subscribed ''Index librorum aliquot vetustorum quos in commune bonum congessit W. K., Decan. Petriburg. MDCCXII''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Bishop of Peterborough===\nOn 25 July 1713 Kennett was installed prebendary of Farrendon-cum-Balderton at Lincoln. He preached vehemently against the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]], and in the two following years warmly advocated the repeal of the acts against occasional conformity. In the [[Bangorian controversy]] he opposed the proceedings of convocation against [[Benjamin Hoadly|Bishop Hoadly]]. By the influence of his friend [[Charles Trimnell|Dr Charles Trimnell]], bishop of Norwich and afterwards of Winchester, he was appointed bishop of Peterborough; he was consecrated at [[Lambeth Palace|Lambeth]] on 9 November 1718, and had permission to hold the archdeaconry of Huntingdon and a prebend in Salisbury in commendam. He died ten years later at his house in [[St James's Street]] Westminster, on 19 December 1728. He was buried in [[Peterborough Cathedral]], where a marble monument with a brief Latin inscription was erected to his memory.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Family===\nHe married first, on 6 June 1693, Sarah, only daughter of Robert and Mary Carver of Bicester (she died on 2 March 1693\u20134, sine prole); secondly, on 6 June 1695, Sarah, sister of Richard Smith, M.D., of London and Aylesbury (she died in August 1702); thirdly, in 1703, Dorcas, daughter of Thomas Fuller, D.D., rector of Wellinghale, Essex, and widow of Clopton Havers, M.D. (she died 9 July 1743). His second wife bore him a son, White Kennett, rector of Burton-le-Coggles, Lincolnshire, and prebendary of Peterborough, Lincoln, and London, who died on 6 May 1740; and a daughter Sarah, who married John Newman of Shottesbrook, Berkshire, and died on 22 February 1756. Hearne, writing on 26 April 1707, says that Kennett's 'present [his third] wife wears the breeches, as his haughty, insolent temper deserves'.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Character===\nHis biographer, the Rev. William Newton, admits that his zeal as a whig partisan sometimes carried him to extremes, but he was very charitable, and displayed great moderation in his relations with the dissenters. He is now remembered chiefly as a painstaking and laborious antiquary, especially in the department of ecclesiastical biography. The number of his works both in print and manuscript shows him to have been throughout his life a man of incredible diligence and application. He was always ready to communicate the results of his researches to fellow-students.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{abbreviations|section|cf. to. q.v. &c. etcetera|date=January 2015}}\n{{citation style|section|date=January 2015}}\n\nProbably his best-known work, apart from his ''Compleat History'', was his ''Register and Chronicle, Ecclesiastical and Civil: containing Matters of Fact delivered in the words of the most Authentick Books, Papers, and Records; digested in exact order of time. With papers, notes, and references towards discovering and connecting the true History of England from the Restauration of King Charles II'', vol. i. London, 1728, fol. The original materials for this valuable work are preserved in the [[British Museum]] among the [[Lansdowne manuscripts]]. 1002\u20131010. The manuscript volumes bring the register to 1679. The published volume begins with the Restoration, and only comes down to December 1662.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nKennett published more than twelve separate sermons preached on public occasions between 1694 and 1728, and others in support of charity schools (cf. ''The Excellent Daughter'', 1708; 11th edit. 1807) or of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (cf. sermon issued in 1712). His addresses to his clergy at Peterborough on his first visitation were issued in 1720. Kennett was also the author of the following, besides the works already discussed:<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n# ''Remarks on the Life, Death, and Burial of Henry Cornish'', London, 1699, 4to. \n# ''Ecclesiastical Synods, and Parliamentary Convocations in the Church of England, Historically stated, and justly Vindicated from the misrepresentations of Mr. Atterbury'', pt. i.

Some manuscript verses by Kennett on ''Religious and Moral Subjects, translated from some of the chief Italian Poets'', belonged to S. W. Rix in 1855, and manuscript notes by Kennett, written in a Bible, were printed in ''Notes and Queries'' for 1885. Sir Walter Scott first printed, in his ''Life of Swift'', p.&nbsp;137, from a manuscript in the British Museum, the well-known description by Kennett of Swift's attendance in Queen Anne's antechamber (November 1713).<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nMany of Kennett's manuscripts, which once formed part of the library of James West, president of the Royal Society, were purchased in 1773 by the Earl of Shelburne (afterwards Marquis of Lansdowne), with whose collection they passed, in 1807, to the British Museum. They are now numbered 935\u20131041 in the Lansdowne collection.
