However interest in closer relations started to rise as economic contacts increased and interest in a [[Polarity (international relations)#Multipolarity|multipolar]] system grew. Although initially imposing an arms embargo on China after Tiananmen (see ''arms embargo'' section below), European leaders eased off China's isolation. China's growing economy became the focus for many European visitors and in turn Chinese businessmen began to make frequent trips to Europe. Europe's interest in China led to the EU becoming unusually active with China during the 1990s with high-level exchanges. EU-Chinese trade increased faster than the Chinese economy itself, tripling in ten years from USD14.3 billion in 1985 to USD45.6 billion in 1994.<ref name=\"Sutter\">Sutter, Robert G. (2008) ''Chinese Foreign Relations'' Maryland, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p.340-342</ref>\n\nHowever political and security co-operation was hampered with China seeing little chance of headway there. Europe was leading the desire for [[NATO]] expansion and intervention in [[Kosovo]], which China opposed as it saw them as extending US influence. However, by 2001 China moderated its anti-US stance in the hopes that Europe would cancel its arms embargo but pressure from the US led to the embargo remaining in place. Due to this, China saw the EU as being too weak, divided and dependent on the US to be a significant power. Even in the economic sphere, China was angered at protectionist measures against its exports to Europe and the EU's opposition to giving China the status of [[market economy]] in order to join the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]].<ref name=\"Sutter\"/>\n\nHowever, economic cooperation continued, with the EU's \"New Asia Strategy\", the first [[Asia\u2013Europe Meeting (ASEM)|Asia\u2013Europe Meeting]] in 1996, the 1998 EU-China summit and frequent policy documents desiring closer partnerships with China. Although the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] dampened investors enthusiasm, China weathered the crisis well and continued to be a major focus of EU trade. Chinese leaders were anxious to return the European interest and made high level visits throughout the 1990s, visits that were accompanied by major EU sales to China. Trade in 1993 saw a 63% increase from the previous year. China became Europe's fourth largest trading partner at this time. Even following the financial crisis in 1997, EU-Chinese trade increased by 15% in 1998.<ref name=\"Sutter\"/>\n\nFrance was leading the EU's desire for closer ties in order to establish a multipolar world and was the first, along with Russia, to establish strategic partnerships with China.<ref name=\"Sutter\"/> Relations between the European Union and China have experienced a cool down after China canceled the EU-China yearly summit in November 2008. This was apparently caused due to French President Sarkozy's plans to meet with the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/107fbab4-bbf2-11dd-80e9-0000779fd18c.html Business fears over Chinese-French rift], Financial Times</ref>\n\nThe EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation, adopted in 2013, calls for cooperation in the areas of \"peace, prosperity, sustainable development and people-to-people exchanges.\"<ref name=\"EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation\"/><ref name=\"EEAS June 1, 2017\"/> In 2016, the EU adopted the \"Joint Communication on elements for a new EU strategy on China\" as its strategy on China.<ref name=\"EEAS June 1, 2017\"/><ref>[http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/china/docs/joint_communication_to_the_european_parliament_and_the_council_-_elements_for_a_new_eu_strategy_on_china.pdf  Joint Communication on elements for a new EU strategy on China].

The top five exports of China are computers, broadcasting equipment, telephones, office machine parts and integrated circuits. China's top five imports are crude petroleum, integrated circuits, iron ore, gold and cars.\nFor what concerns the EU imports of AMA/NAMA product groups  the part for industrial products counts for a value of \u20ac343.725 million and gets the impressive percentage of 98.1% (of a total of \u20ac350.535 million). The same applies for exports to China where industrial products keep the highest ranking in the list and count for \u20ac159,620 million (93.7% of the total export volume).\n\n====Trade in services====\nTrade of services play an important role in all modern economies. A resilient tertiary service sector, as well as an increased availability of services, may boost economic growth and enhance industrial performance. In an increasingly localised world, services such as finance, insurance, transport, logistics and communications deliver key intermediate inputs and thereby provide crucial support to the rest of the economy.\nThe European Union representing its 28 Member States and China are both members of the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] (WTO) and participate in the ongoing discussions about the [[Trade in Services Agreement]] (TiSA). The volume of trade in services of all participating countries corresponds to 70% of the world's total volume. TiSA is an important tool to increase the share of services trade by tackling the existing barriers. With TiSA new opportunities for service providers will be offered while fostering growth, jobs and prosperity at all participating Members.\nAccording to the latest statistical information from Eurostat, the EU trade in services balance with China in 2015 present a surplus of \u20ac10.3 billion due to a surge of exports (exports reached \u20ac36 billion while imports \u20ac25.7 billion).\n\n===Smart and Secure Trade Lanes (SSTL) project===\nThe SSTL project was launched in 2006 as a pilot project between the European Union and China as the first Asian country. The participating EU member states at the time were the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. As from 2010 (when the second phase of the project was launched) other EU member states joined: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain. This project tests safety and security related recommendations of the World Customs Organisation Framework of Standards applied to containers, facilitating the \"Customs-to-Customs\" data exchange, risk management cooperation, mutual recognition of customs controls and trade partnership programmes. The 120 trade lanes involving 200 economic operators between 16 maritime ports will undoubtedly facilitate trade between China and EU participating countries as loading and unloading of containers will require less controls and intervention of Customs authorities. \n\nThere have been some disputes, such as the dispute over textile imports into the EU (see below). China and the EU are increasingly seeking cooperation, for example China joined the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo project]] investing \u20ac230 million and has been buying Airbus planes in return for a construction plant to be built in China; in 2006 China placed an order for 150 planes during a visit by French [[Jacques Chirac|President Jacques Chirac]].<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/26/business/airbus.php With big order, China gives Airbus a boost] iht.com</ref> Also, despite the arms embargo, a leaked US diplomatic cable suggested that in 2003 the EU sold China \u20ac400 million of \"defence exports\" and later, other military grade submarine and radar technology.<ref name=\"leaked cable\"/>\n\n====Science and technology====\nChina and the EU launched their first science and technology cooperation program in 1983. They also drafted an Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation in 1998 which was renewed in 2004 with the aim of linking research organisations, industry, universities and individual researchers in specific projects supported by the EU budget.<ref>Casarini, N.

France viewed the ban as anachronistic and refused to consider attaching reforms in China as a condition, stating that \"China would not accept human rights conditionality.\" Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Greece, Italy and the UK were all broadly in the French camp. Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden wished to attach a lifting of the ban to \"specific Chinese steps on human rights.\" All agreed in principle that if certain conditions were met then the ban should be lifted.<ref name=\"leaked cable\"/> Various EU heads of state have objected to the embargo or supported its continued existence. German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] has previously indicated her opposition to a lifting of the embargo, whereas her predecessor, [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]], had been in favour.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1773563,00.html \"Hu meets Merkel As Germany Reaffirms EU Arms Ban\"], Deutsche Welle, November 11, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe [[European Parliament]] has been consistently against removing the embargo. However, [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]] [[Catherine Ashton]] put forward plans for lifting the embargo in 2010, arguing that \"The current arms embargo is a major impediment for developing stronger EU-China co-operation on foreign policy and security matters.\" Chinese ambassador to the EU [[Song Zhe]] agreed, noting that \"it doesn't make any sense to maintain the embargo.\"<ref>Rettman, Andrew (17 December 2010) [http://euobserver.com/884/31538 Ashton pragmatic on China in EU foreign policy blueprint], EU Observer</ref>\n\n=====Outside pressure=====\nThe [[United States]], which also has an arms embargo on China, states that lifting the embargo will create a [[technology transfer]] that will increase the capabilities of the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese army]]. The US has been influential in keeping the EU ban in place. The US sees China as a potential military threat{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and has pressured the EU in keeping it in place.

However interest in closer relations started to rise as economic contacts increased and interest in a [[Polarity (international relations)#Multipolarity|multipolar]] system grew. Although initially imposing an arms embargo on China after Tiananmen (see ''arms embargo'' section below), European leaders eased off China's isolation. China's growing economy became the focus for many European visitors and in turn Chinese businessmen began to make frequent trips to Europe. Europe's interest in China led to the EU becoming unusually active with China during the 1990s with high-level exchanges. EU-Chinese trade increased faster than the Chinese economy itself, tripling in ten years from USD14.3 billion in 1985 to USD45.6 billion in 1994.<ref name=\"Sutter\">Sutter, Robert G. (2008) ''Chinese Foreign Relations'' Maryland, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. p.340-342</ref>\n\nHowever political and security co-operation was hampered with China seeing little chance of headway there. Europe was leading the desire for [[NATO]] expansion and intervention in [[Kosovo]], which China opposed as it saw them as extending US influence. However, by 2001 China moderated its anti-US stance in the hopes that Europe would cancel its arms embargo but pressure from the US led to the embargo remaining in place. Due to this, China saw the EU as being too weak, divided and dependent on the US to be a significant power. Even in the economic sphere, China was angered at protectionist measures against its exports to Europe and the EU's opposition to giving China the status of [[market economy]] in order to join the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]].<ref name=\"Sutter\"/>\n\nHowever, economic cooperation continued, with the EU's \"New Asia Strategy\", the first [[Asia\u2013Europe Meeting (ASEM)|Asia\u2013Europe Meeting]] in 1996, the 1998 EU-China summit and frequent policy documents desiring closer partnerships with China. Although the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] dampened investors enthusiasm, China weathered the crisis well and continued to be a major focus of EU trade. Chinese leaders were anxious to return the European interest and made high level visits throughout the 1990s, visits that were accompanied by major EU sales to China. Trade in 1993 saw a 63% increase from the previous year. China became Europe's fourth largest trading partner at this time. Even following the financial crisis in 1997, EU-Chinese trade increased by 15% in 1998.<ref name=\"Sutter\"/>\n\nFrance was leading the EU's desire for closer ties in order to establish a multipolar world and was the first, along with Russia, to establish strategic partnerships with China.<ref name=\"Sutter\"/> Relations between the European Union and China have experienced a cool down after China canceled the EU-China yearly summit in November 2008. This was apparently caused due to French President Sarkozy's plans to meet with the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/107fbab4-bbf2-11dd-80e9-0000779fd18c.html Business fears over Chinese-French rift], Financial Times</ref>\n\nThe EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation, adopted in 2013, calls for cooperation in the areas of \"peace, prosperity, sustainable development and people-to-people exchanges.\"<ref name=\"EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation\"/><ref name=\"EEAS June 1, 2017\"/> In 2016, the EU adopted the \"Joint Communication on elements for a new EU strategy on China\" as its strategy on China.<ref name=\"EEAS June 1, 2017\"/><ref>[http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/china/docs/joint_communication_to_the_european_parliament_and_the_council_-_elements_for_a_new_eu_strategy_on_china.pdf  Joint Communication on elements for a new EU strategy on China].

The top five exports of China are computers, broadcasting equipment, telephones, office machine parts and integrated circuits. China's top five imports are crude petroleum, integrated circuits, iron ore, gold and cars.\nFor what concerns the EU imports of AMA/NAMA product groups  the part for industrial products counts for a value of \u20ac343.725 million and gets the impressive percentage of 98.1% (of a total of \u20ac350.535 million). The same applies for exports to China where industrial products keep the highest ranking in the list and count for \u20ac159,620 million (93.7% of the total export volume).\n\n====Trade in services====\nTrade of services play an important role in all modern economies. A resilient tertiary service sector, as well as an increased availability of services, may boost economic growth and enhance industrial performance. In an increasingly localised world, services such as finance, insurance, transport, logistics and communications deliver key intermediate inputs and thereby provide crucial support to the rest of the economy.\nThe European Union representing its 28 Member States and China are both members of the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] (WTO) and participate in the ongoing discussions about the [[Trade in Services Agreement]] (TiSA). The volume of trade in services of all participating countries corresponds to 70% of the world's total volume. TiSA is an important tool to increase the share of services trade by tackling the existing barriers. With TiSA new opportunities for service providers will be offered while fostering growth, jobs and prosperity at all participating Members.\nAccording to the latest statistical information from Eurostat, the EU trade in services balance with China in 2015 present a surplus of \u20ac10.3 billion due to a surge of exports (exports reached \u20ac36 billion while imports \u20ac25.7 billion).\n\n===Smart and Secure Trade Lanes (SSTL) project===\nThe SSTL project was launched in 2006 as a pilot project between the European Union and China as the first Asian country. The participating EU member states at the time were the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. As from 2010 (when the second phase of the project was launched) other EU member states joined: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain. This project tests safety and security related recommendations of the World Customs Organisation Framework of Standards applied to containers, facilitating the \"Customs-to-Customs\" data exchange, risk management cooperation, mutual recognition of customs controls and trade partnership programmes. The 120 trade lanes involving 200 economic operators between 16 maritime ports will undoubtedly facilitate trade between China and EU participating countries as loading and unloading of containers will require less controls and intervention of Customs authorities. \n\nThere have been some disputes, such as the dispute over textile imports into the EU (see below). China and the EU are increasingly seeking cooperation, for example China joined the [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo project]] investing \u20ac230 million and has been buying Airbus planes in return for a construction plant to be built in China; in 2006 China placed an order for 150 planes during a visit by French [[Jacques Chirac|President Jacques Chirac]].<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/26/business/airbus.php With big order, China gives Airbus a boost] iht.com</ref> Also, despite the arms embargo, a leaked US diplomatic cable suggested that in 2003 the EU sold China \u20ac400 million of \"defence exports\" and later, other military grade submarine and radar technology.<ref name=\"leaked cable\"/>\n\n====Science and technology====\nChina and the EU launched their first science and technology cooperation program in 1983. They also drafted an Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation in 1998 which was renewed in 2004 with the aim of linking research organisations, industry, universities and individual researchers in specific projects supported by the EU budget.<ref>Casarini, N.

France viewed the ban as anachronistic and refused to consider attaching reforms in China as a condition, stating that \"China would not accept human rights conditionality.\" Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Greece, Italy and the UK were all broadly in the French camp. Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden wished to attach a lifting of the ban to \"specific Chinese steps on human rights.\" All agreed in principle that if certain conditions were met then the ban should be lifted.<ref name=\"leaked cable\"/> Various EU heads of state have objected to the embargo or supported its continued existence. German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] has previously indicated her opposition to a lifting of the embargo, whereas her predecessor, [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]], had been in favour.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1773563,00.html \"Hu meets Merkel As Germany Reaffirms EU Arms Ban\"], Deutsche Welle, November 11, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe [[European Parliament]] has been consistently against removing the embargo. However, [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]] [[Catherine Ashton]] put forward plans for lifting the embargo in 2010, arguing that \"The current arms embargo is a major impediment for developing stronger EU-China co-operation on foreign policy and security matters.\" Chinese ambassador to the EU [[Song Zhe]] agreed, noting that \"it doesn't make any sense to maintain the embargo.\"<ref>Rettman, Andrew (17 December 2010) [http://euobserver.com/884/31538 Ashton pragmatic on China in EU foreign policy blueprint], EU Observer</ref>\n\n=====Outside pressure=====\nThe [[United States]], which also has an arms embargo on China, states that lifting the embargo will create a [[technology transfer]] that will increase the capabilities of the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese army]]. The US has been influential in keeping the EU ban in place. The US sees China as a potential military threat{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and has pressured the EU in keeping it in place.

In the succeeding 36 years he was to write over 500 items for this paper ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=230\u201336}}).\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the installation of a democratically elected president, [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], Ch\u00e1vez became one of the first exponents of Mexican nationalist music with ballets on [[Aztec]] themes {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn September 1922, Ch\u00e1vez married Otilia Ortiz and they went on honeymoon to Europe, from October 1922 until April 1923, spending two weeks in [[Vienna]], five months in Berlin, and eight or ten days in Paris {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=25\u201326}}. During the latter visit he met [[Paul Dukas]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. Some months later, in December 1923, Ch\u00e1vez visited the United States for the first time, returning in March 1924 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=26}}. Ch\u00e1vez again went to New York City in September 1926 and stayed there until June 1928 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=40}}. Upon his return to Mexico, Ch\u00e1vez became director of the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Mexicana (Mexican Symphonic Orchestra), later renamed Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico (Mexico's Symphonic Orchestra); the country's first permanent orchestra, started by a musicians' [[labor union]]. Ch\u00e1vez was instrumental in taking the orchestra on tour through Mexico's rural areas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn December 1928, Ch\u00e1vez was appointed director of Mexico's National Conservatory of Music\u2014a position he held for a total of five years (until March 1933, and again for eight months in 1934). In that capacity, Ch\u00e1vez spearheaded three ''academias de investigaci\u00f3n'', two concerned with collecting and cataloguing indigenous music and its literature, and the third to study the uses of old and new scales {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn 1937, Ch\u00e1vez published a book, ''Toward a New Music'', which is one of the first books in which a composer speaks about [[electronic music]]. In 1938, he conducted a series of concerts with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], during a period of absence by the orchestra's regular conductor, [[Arturo Toscanini]]. In 1940 he produced concerts at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], and by 1945, Ch\u00e1vez had come to be regarded as the foremost Mexican composer and conductor {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=230\u201331}}.\n\nFrom January 1947 until 1952, Ch\u00e1vez served as director-general of the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes|National Institute of Fine Arts]]. In his first year, he formed the [[National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)|National Symphony Orchestra]], which supplanted the older OSM as Mexico's premier orchestra and led to the disbanding of the older ensemble. Throughout all this time, Ch\u00e1vez maintained a busy international touring schedule {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n[[File:CarlosChaveztombDoloresDF.JPG|thumb|200px|Carlos Ch\u00e1vez's tomb in the [[Pante\u00f3n de Dolores]], Mexico City]]\n\nIn May 1953 he was commissioned by [[Lincoln Kirstein]], director of the New York City center of Music and Drama, for a three-act opera to a libretto by [[Chester Kallman]] based on a story by [[Boccaccio]], to be titled ''The Tuscan Players''. Intended to be finished in August 1954, it was first postponed to April 1955, but only finally completed in 1956, by which time the title had been changed twice, first to ''P\u00e1nfilo and Lauretta'', then to {{lang|es|El amor propiciado}}. The City Center waived its rights to the first performance, which was given under the title ''Panfilo and Lauretta'' in the Brander Matthews Theatre at [[Columbia University]] in New York on May 9, 1957, under the baton of [[Howard Shanet]]. Stage direction was by Bill Butler, scenic design by Herbert Senn and Helen Pond, and costumes by Sylvia Wintle. The principal singers were [[Sylvia Stahlman]], Frank Porretta, [[Craig Timberlake]], Mary McMurray, Michael Kermoyan, and [[Thomas Stewart (bass-baritone)|Thomas Stewart]] {{harv|Taubman|1957}}. The opera would be revised twice more and the title changed again to {{lang|es|Los visitantes}} (''[[The Visitors (opera)|The Visitors]]''), for productions in 1968 and 1973, in Mexico City and [[Aptos, California]], respectively ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=171}}). From 1958\u20131959 he was the Charles Eliot Norton professor at [[Harvard University]], and the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|public lectures]] he gave there were published as a book, ''Musical Thought'' {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961}}.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez served as the music director of the [[Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music]]. His orchestral composition ''Discovery'' (1969) had previously been commission by the Festival and was first performed there.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nFailing health and financial setbacks forced Ch\u00e1vez to sell his house{{when|date=June 2012}} in the [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] neighborhood of Mexico City and move in with his daughter Anita in [[Coyoac\u00e1n]], in the fringes of the Mexican capital, where he died quietly on 2 August 1978 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nCarlos Ch\u00e1vez's manuscripts and papers are housed in the Music Division of the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] and in the [[General National Archive (Mexico)|National Archive of Mexico]], in Mexico City.\n\n==Musical style==\nCh\u00e1vez's music does not fall into clear stylistic periods, but rather cumulates elements in a process of continual synthesis. The [[juvenilia]], up to 1921 and consisting primarily of piano compositions, is essentially [[Romantic music|Romantic]], with [[Robert Schumann]] as the main influence. A period of nationalistic leanings was initiated in 1921 with the [[Aztec]]-themed ballet {{lang|es|El fuego nuevo}} (The New Fire), followed by a second ballet, {{lang|es|Los cuatro soles}} (The Four Suns), in 1925 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nDuring his time in New York City between 1924 and 1928, Ch\u00e1vez acquired a taste for the then-fashionable abstract and quasi-scientific music, as is reflected in the titles of many of his compositions written between 1923 and 1934: {{lang|es|Pol\u00edgonos}} for piano (Polygons, 1923), {{lang|es|Ex\u00e1gonos}} for voice and piano (Hexagons, 1924), ''36'' for piano (1925), {{lang|es|Energ\u00eda}} for nine instruments (Energy, 1925), {{lang|es|Espiral}} for violin and piano (Spiral, 1934), and an unfinished orchestral score titled {{lang|es|Pir\u00e1mides}} (Pyramids).\n\nThe culmination of this period was the ballet ''[[Caballos de vapor|H. P.]]'' (i.e., Horse Power), also known by the Spanish title {{lang|es|Caballos de vapor}} (1926\u201331) {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=231}}. ''H. P.'' is a colorfully orchestrated score of ample dimensions and dense, compact atmosphere, notable for its dynamism and vitality, revealing the influence of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and at the same time returning to folkloric and popular elements, with dances such as the [[sandunga]], [[tango (dance)|tango]], [[huapango]], and [[foxtrot]] {{harv|Garcia_Morillo|1960|loc=49\u201351}}. Such nationalisms would appear through the 1930s, notably in the Second Symphony (the {{lang|es|Sinfon\u00eda \u00edndia}} of 1935\u201336, one of the few works by Ch\u00e1vez to quote actual Native-American themes), but only sporadically in later compositions {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nAlthough this early period saw the creation of the Sonatina for violin and piano (1924), it was only in the 1930s that Ch\u00e1vez returned to another of the main musical interests of his maturity, prefigured in the juvenilia: the traditional genres of the [[sonata]], [[String quartet|quartet]], [[symphony]], and [[concerto]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. He composed six numbered symphonies. The first, titled {{lang|es|[[Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona]]}} (1933), was reworked from incidental music for [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''Antigone'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' tragedy. In it, Ch\u00e1vez sought to create an archaic ambiance through the use of modal polyphony, harmonies built on fourths and fifths, and a predominant use of wind instruments {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn the fourth of his Norton lectures of 1958\u201359, titled \"Repetition in Music\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=55\u201384}}, he described a mode of composition already observable in many of his compositions since the 1920s, in which \"The idea of repetition and variation can be replaced by the notion of constant rebirth, of true derivation: a stream that never comes back to its source; a stream in eternal development, like a spiral&nbsp;\u2026\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=84}}. A notable early example of this method is ''Soli I'' (1933), the first work acknowledged by the composer to have been consciously organized according to this principle. It only became a regular feature, however, beginning with ''Invenci\u00f3n I'' for piano (1958), and subsequently in most of his instrumental compositions of the 1960s and 1970s: ''Invenci\u00f3n II'' for string trio (1965), ''Invenci\u00f3n III'' for harp (1967), ''Soli II'' for wind quintet (1961), ''Soli III'' for bassoon, trumpet, viola, timpani, and orchestra (1969), ''Soli IV'' for brass trio (1966), ''Cinco Caprichos'' for piano (1975), and the late orchestral works ''Resonancias'' (1964), ''Elatio'' (1967), ''Discovery'' (1969), ''Clio'' (1969), and ''Initium'' (1970\u201372) {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=41, 47, 98\u2013103, 123\u201324}}.\n\n==Recordings==\n\nCh\u00e1vez made more than a handful of recordings, conducting his own music as well as that of other composers. One of the earliest was made in the 1930s for Victor, containing Ch\u00e1vez's ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'' and ''Sinfon\u00eda india'', together with his orchestration of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]]'s Chaconne in E minor: 4-disc 78-rpm set, Victor Musical Masterpiece Series, Victor Red Seal M 503 (manual sequence) and DM 503 (automatic sequence). The best-known{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} of his discs was the [[Everest Records]] stereophonic recording of his ''Sinfon\u00eda India'', ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'', and ''Sinfon\u00eda Rom\u00e1ntica'', in which Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra|Stadium Symphony Orchestra]], the name given to the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for its summer performances in the [[Lewisohn Stadium]]. The album was originally issued in 1959 by [[Everest Records]] on LP SDBR 3029, and was reissued on CD in 1996 by Everest as EVC-9041, as well as at some point by [[Philips Records]]. In 1963 Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[Vienna State Opera|Vienna State Opera Orchestra]] in two recordings with pianist [[Eugene List]] for [[Westminster Records]], both released on LP: one of his own Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (Westminster WST 17030, reissued in 1976 as Westminster Gold WGS 8324) and one of the two piano concertos by [[Edward Macdowell]] (ABC Westminster Gold WGS 8156). In the 1950s he released two recordings on US Decca records, on which he conducted the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico. In 1951 a 10-inch mono LP was issued (Decca Gold Label DL 7512, reissued 1978 by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on side 2 of 12-inch LP ), containing his Suite from ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' (originally recorded in 1947 for the Mexican label Anfi\u00f3n and issued as a 3-disc 78 rpm set Anfi\u00f3n AM 4), and in 1956 they released an anthology, ''Music of Mexico'', on which he conducted three of his own works, plus [[Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo]]'s ''Huapango'' (Decca Gold Label LP, DL9527). He also made some recordings for [[Columbia Records]] which were issued on 78-rpm discs and on LP (Columbia 4-disc 78-rpm set M 414, reissued 1949 on Columbia 10-inch LP, Columbia ML 2080 and Mexican Columbia DCL 98, reissued on Columbia 12-inch LP, LL 1015; CBS Masterworks 3-LP set 32 31 0001 (mono)/ 32 31 002 (stereo); CBC Masterworks LP 32 11 0064; Columbia LP M32685; Odyssey LP Y 31534). In 1961 he recorded [[Sergey Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', with the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico and [[Carlos Pellicer]], narrator, released on Mexican CBS MC 1360.\n\n== List of works ==\n{{main|List of compositions by Carlos Ch\u00e1vez}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Daniel Ayala P\u00e9rez]]\n* [[Aaron Copland]]\n* [[Blas Galindo]]\n* [[Grupo de los cuatro]]\n* [[Silvestre Revueltas]]\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Ch\u00e1vez|1937}}|reference=Ch\u00e1vez, Carlos. 1937.

From 1958\u20131959 he was the Charles Eliot Norton professor at [[Harvard University]], and the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|public lectures]] he gave there were published as a book, ''Musical Thought'' {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961}}.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez served as the music director of the [[Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music]]. His orchestral composition ''Discovery'' (1969) had previously been commission by the Festival and was first performed there.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nFailing health and financial setbacks forced Ch\u00e1vez to sell his house{{when|date=June 2012}} in the [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] neighborhood of Mexico City and move in with his daughter Anita in [[Coyoac\u00e1n]], in the fringes of the Mexican capital, where he died quietly on 2 August 1978 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nCarlos Ch\u00e1vez's manuscripts and papers are housed in the Music Division of the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] and in the [[General National Archive (Mexico)|National Archive of Mexico]], in Mexico City.\n\n==Musical style==\nCh\u00e1vez's music does not fall into clear stylistic periods, but rather cumulates elements in a process of continual synthesis. The [[juvenilia]], up to 1921 and consisting primarily of piano compositions, is essentially [[Romantic music|Romantic]], with [[Robert Schumann]] as the main influence. A period of nationalistic leanings was initiated in 1921 with the [[Aztec]]-themed ballet {{lang|es|El fuego nuevo}} (The New Fire), followed by a second ballet, {{lang|es|Los cuatro soles}} (The Four Suns), in 1925 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nDuring his time in New York City between 1924 and 1928, Ch\u00e1vez acquired a taste for the then-fashionable abstract and quasi-scientific music, as is reflected in the titles of many of his compositions written between 1923 and 1934: {{lang|es|Pol\u00edgonos}} for piano (Polygons, 1923), {{lang|es|Ex\u00e1gonos}} for voice and piano (Hexagons, 1924), ''36'' for piano (1925), {{lang|es|Energ\u00eda}} for nine instruments (Energy, 1925), {{lang|es|Espiral}} for violin and piano (Spiral, 1934), and an unfinished orchestral score titled {{lang|es|Pir\u00e1mides}} (Pyramids).\n\nThe culmination of this period was the ballet ''[[Caballos de vapor|H. P.]]'' (i.e., Horse Power), also known by the Spanish title {{lang|es|Caballos de vapor}} (1926\u201331) {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=231}}. ''H. P.'' is a colorfully orchestrated score of ample dimensions and dense, compact atmosphere, notable for its dynamism and vitality, revealing the influence of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and at the same time returning to folkloric and popular elements, with dances such as the [[sandunga]], [[tango (dance)|tango]], [[huapango]], and [[foxtrot]] {{harv|Garcia Morillo|1960|loc=49\u201351}}. Such nationalisms would appear through the 1930s, notably in the Second Symphony (the {{lang|es|Sinfon\u00eda \u00edndia}} of 1935\u201336, one of the few works by Ch\u00e1vez to quote actual Native-American themes), but only sporadically in later compositions {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nAlthough this early period saw the creation of the Sonatina for violin and piano (1924), it was only in the 1930s that Ch\u00e1vez returned to another of the main musical interests of his maturity, prefigured in the juvenilia: the traditional genres of the [[sonata]], [[String quartet|quartet]], [[symphony]], and [[concerto]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. He composed six numbered symphonies. The first, titled {{lang|es|[[Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona]]}} (1933), was reworked from incidental music for [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''Antigone'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' tragedy. In it, Ch\u00e1vez sought to create an archaic ambiance through the use of modal polyphony, harmonies built on fourths and fifths, and a predominant use of wind instruments {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn the fourth of his Norton lectures of 1958\u201359, titled \"Repetition in Music\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=55\u201384}}, he described a mode of composition already observable in many of his compositions since the 1920s, in which \"The idea of repetition and variation can be replaced by the notion of constant rebirth, of true derivation: a stream that never comes back to its source; a stream in eternal development, like a spiral&nbsp;\u2026\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=84}}. A notable early example of this method is ''Soli I'' (1933), the first work acknowledged by the composer to have been consciously organized according to this principle. It only became a regular feature, however, beginning with ''Invenci\u00f3n I'' for piano (1958), and subsequently in most of his instrumental compositions of the 1960s and 1970s: ''Invenci\u00f3n II'' for string trio (1965), ''Invenci\u00f3n III'' for harp (1967), ''Soli II'' for wind quintet (1961), ''Soli III'' for bassoon, trumpet, viola, timpani, and orchestra (1969), ''Soli IV'' for brass trio (1966), ''Cinco Caprichos'' for piano (1975), and the late orchestral works ''Resonancias'' (1964), ''Elatio'' (1967), ''Discovery'' (1969), ''Clio'' (1969), and ''Initium'' (1970\u201372) {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=41, 47, 98\u2013103, 123\u201324}}.\n\n==Recordings==\n\nCh\u00e1vez made more than a handful of recordings, conducting his own music as well as that of other composers. One of the earliest was made in the 1930s for Victor, containing Ch\u00e1vez's ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'' and ''Sinfon\u00eda india'', together with his orchestration of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]]'s Chaconne in E minor: 4-disc 78-rpm set, Victor Musical Masterpiece Series, Victor Red Seal M 503 (manual sequence) and DM 503 (automatic sequence). The best-known{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} of his discs was the [[Everest Records]] stereophonic recording of his ''Sinfon\u00eda India'', ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'', and ''Sinfon\u00eda Rom\u00e1ntica'', in which Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra|Stadium Symphony Orchestra]], the name given to the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for its summer performances in the [[Lewisohn Stadium]]. The album was originally issued in 1959 by [[Everest Records]] on LP SDBR 3029, and was reissued on CD in 1996 by Everest as EVC-9041, as well as at some point by [[Philips Records]]. In 1963 Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[Vienna State Opera|Vienna State Opera Orchestra]] in two recordings with pianist [[Eugene List]] for [[Westminster Records]], both released on LP: one of his own Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (Westminster WST 17030, reissued in 1976 as Westminster Gold WGS 8324) and one of the two piano concertos by [[Edward Macdowell]] (ABC Westminster Gold WGS 8156). In the 1950s he released two recordings on US Decca records, on which he conducted the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico. In 1951 a 10-inch mono LP was issued (Decca Gold Label DL 7512, reissued 1978 by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on side 2 of 12-inch LP ), containing his Suite from ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' (originally recorded in 1947 for the Mexican label Anfi\u00f3n and issued as a 3-disc 78 rpm set Anfi\u00f3n AM 4), and in 1956 they released an anthology, ''Music of Mexico'', on which he conducted three of his own works, plus [[Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo]]'s ''Huapango'' (Decca Gold Label LP, DL9527). He also made some recordings for [[Columbia Records]] which were issued on 78-rpm discs and on LP (Columbia 4-disc 78-rpm set M 414, reissued 1949 on Columbia 10-inch LP, Columbia ML 2080 and Mexican Columbia DCL 98, reissued on Columbia 12-inch LP, LL 1015; CBS Masterworks 3-LP set 32 31 0001 (mono)/ 32 31 002 (stereo); CBC Masterworks LP 32 11 0064; Columbia LP M32685; Odyssey LP Y 31534). In 1961 he recorded [[Sergey Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', with the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico and [[Carlos Pellicer]], narrator, released on Mexican CBS MC 1360.\n\n== List of works ==\n{{main|List of compositions by Carlos Ch\u00e1vez}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Daniel Ayala P\u00e9rez]]\n* [[Aaron Copland]]\n* [[Blas Galindo]]\n* [[Grupo de los cuatro]]\n* [[Silvestre Revueltas]]\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Ch\u00e1vez|1937}}|reference=Ch\u00e1vez, Carlos. 1937.

{"title_page": "Case method", "text_new": "{{cleanup|reason=It's more of a bunch of lists than a descriptive article|date=January 2017}}\nThe '''case method''' is a [[Teaching method|teaching approach]] that uses decision-forcing cases to put students in the role of people who were faced with difficult decisions at some point in the past. It developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the [[casebook method]] of teaching law pioneered by Harvard legal scholar [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. In sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question.  Rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise, describe, and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=2257175 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065459/http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=2257175 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n== Comparison with the casebook method of teaching law ==\nThe case method evolved from the [[casebook method]], a mode of teaching based on [[Socratic method|Socratic principles]] pioneered at [[Harvard Law School]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. Like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem.\n\n== Decision-forcing cases ==\n\nA decision-forcing case is a kind of [[Decision Game | decision game]].  Like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the \"protagonist\") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem.  However, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events.\n\nA decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study.  That is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past.  However, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an \"interrupted narrative.\"  This is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision.  In other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively. <ref>[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/degree-programs/teaching/Contributed-Case-Packet.pdf]</ref>\n\n== Criticisms of decision-forcing cases ==\nIn recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bridgman|first1=Todd|title=Beyond the Manager's Moral Dilemma: Rethinking the 'Ideal Type' Business Ethics Case|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=2010|volume=94|page=311\u2013322|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0759-3}}</ref> It is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives. It has been suggested that different approaches to case writing, that do not put students in the \u2018shoes\u2019 of a manager, be encouraged to address these concerns. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bridgman|first=Todd|last2=Cummings|first2=Stephen|last3=McLaughlin|first3=Colm|date=2016-12-01|title=Restating the Case: How Revisiting the Development of the Case Method Can Help Us Think Differently About the Future of the Business School|url=http://amle.aom.org/content/15/4/724|journal=Academy of Management Learning & Education|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=724\u2013741|doi=10.5465/amle.2015.0291|issn=1537-260X}}</ref>\n\n== Role play ==\n\nEvery decision-forcing case has a protagonist, the historical person who was faced with the problem or problem that students are asked to solve.  Thus, in engaging these problems, students necessarily engage in some degree of role play.\n\nSome case teachers, such as those of the Marine Corps University, place a great deal of emphasis on role play, to the point of addressing each student with the name and titles of the protagonist of the case.  (A student playing the role of a king, for example, is asked \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\")  Other case teachers, such as those at the Harvard Business School, place less emphasis on role play, asking students \"what would you do if you were the protagonist of the case.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hbs.edu/teaching/case-method-in-practice/leading-in-the-classroom/openings.html | title=Openings - Christensen Center for Teaching and Learning - Harvard Business School}}</ref>\n\n== Historical solution ==\n\nAfter discussing student solutions to the problem at the heart of a decision-forcing case, a case teacher will often provide a description of the historical solution, that is, the decision made by the protagonist of the case.  Also known as \"the rest of the story\", \"the epilogue\", or (particularly at Harvard University) \"the 'B' case\", the description of the historical solution can take the form of a printed article, a video, a slide presentation, a short lecture, or even an appearance by the protagonist.\n\nWhatever the form of the description of the historical solution, the case teacher must take care to avoid giving the impression that the historical solution is the \"right answer.\"  Rather, he should point out that the historical solution to the problem serves primarily to provide students with a baseline to which they can compare their own solutions.\n\nSome case teachers will refrain from providing the historical solution to students.  One reason for not providing the historical solution is to encourage students to do their own research about the outcome of the case.  Another is to encourage students to think about the decision after the end of the class discussion. \"Analytic and problem-solving learning,\" writes Kirsten Lundgren of Columbia University, \"can be all the more powerful when the 'what happened' is left unanswered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009025732/https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid=3 |archivedate=2014-10-09 }}</ref>\n\n== Complex cases ==\n\nA classic decision-forcing case asks students to solve a single problem faced by a single protagonist at a particular time.  There are, however, decision-forcing cases in which students play the role of a single protagonist who is faced with a series of problems, two or more protagonists dealing with the same problem, or two or more protagonists dealing with two or more related problems.\n\n== Decision-forcing staff rides ==\n\nA decision-forcing case conducted in the place where the historical decisions at the heart of the case were made is called a \"decision-forcing staff ride.\"  Also known as an \"on-site decision-forcing case\", a decision-forcing staff ride should not be confused with the two very different exercises that are also known as \"[[staff ride |staff rides]]\": retrospective battlefield tours of the type practiced by the United States Army in the twentieth century and the on-site contingency planning exercises (Stabs Reisen, literally \"staff journeys\") introduced by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] in 1801 and made famous by [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder | the elder Hellmuth von Moltke]] in the middle years of the nineteenth century.\n\nTo avoid confusion between \"decision-forcing staff rides\" and staff rides of other sorts, the Case Method Project at the [[Marine Corps University]] in Quantico, Virginia, adopted the term \"Russell Ride\" to describe the decision-forcing staff rides that it conducts.  The term is an homage to Major General [[John Henry Russell Jr.]],USMC, the 16th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction. <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://onsitetoughcase.blogspot.com/2015/11/decision-forcing-staff-ride.html | title=The Decision-Forcing Staff Ride}}</ref>\n\n== Sandwich metaphors ==\n\nDecision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches.  In this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve.\n\nA decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a \"triple-decker case.\"  (The bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) Similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an [[Open sandwich|\"open-face\"]] or [[Open sandwich|\"sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d\"]] case.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-sandwich-metaphor.html | title=The Sandwich Simile}}</ref>  \n\nA decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions in a relatively short period of time is sometimes called a [[White Castle (restaurant)|\"White Castle\"]], [[Slider (sandwich)|\"slider\"]] case.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/white-castle-cases.html | title=The White Castle DFC}}</ref> or \"day in the life\" case.\n\n== Case materials ==\n\nCase materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs.\n\nCase materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting.  Materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (These are called \"the B-case\", \"the rest of the story\", or \"the reveal.\")  Materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting.  (These are often referred to as \"handouts.\") <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=4468541 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101448/http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=4468541 |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCase materials may be either \"refined\" or \"raw.\" Refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (Most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) Raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. These include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://som.yale.edu/our-programs/full-time-mba/curriculum/raw-case-approach | title=The 'Raw' Case Approach| date=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n== Published case materials ==\n\nA number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials.

This can lead to \"the narrative fallacy\", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story.  This, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students \"parse the case materials.\"  That is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-01-23/the-case-against-case-studies | title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?}}</ref>\n\nTechniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials;  awareness of tropes and clich\u00e9s; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of \"distractors\" - information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case.\n\n==Purpose of the case method==\n\nThe case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner. In the course of doing this, the case method also accomplishes a number of other things, each of which is valuable in its own right.  By exciting the interest of students, the case method fosters interest in professional matters.  By placing such things in a lively context, the case method facilitates the learning of facts, nomenclature, conventions, techniques, and procedures.  By providing both a forum for discussion and concrete topics to discuss, the case method encourages professional dialogue.  By providing challenging practice in the art of decision-making, the case method refines professional judgement.  By asking difficult questions, the case method empowers students to reflect upon the peculiar demands of their profession.<ref>[http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/loader.php?type=d&id=1246140]</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the case method (\"Because Wisdom Can't Be Told\"), Charles I.

These incompatible objectives include attempts to use decision-forcing cases to:\n\n* provide an example to be emulated \n* paint a particular person as a hero or a villain \n* encourage (or discourage) a particular type of behavior \n* illustrate a pre-existing theory \n\nThomas W. Shreeve, who uses the case method to teach people in the field of military intelligence, argues that \"Cases are not meant to illustrate either the effective or the ineffective handling of administrative, operational, logistic, ethical, or other problems, and the characters in cases should not be portrayed either as paragons of virtue or as archvillains. The instructor/casewriter must be careful not to tell the students what to think\u2014they are not empty vessels waiting to be filled with wisdom.

Here are some examples of such disclaimers:\n\n\n''<div style=\"text-indent: 2em\">This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation.</div>\n\n\n''<div style=\"text-indent: 2em\">This decision-forcing case is an exercise designed to foster empathy, creativity, a bias for action, and other martial virtues.

It developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the [[casebook method]] of teaching law pioneered by Harvard legal scholar [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. In sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question.  Rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise, describe, and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=2257175 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065459/http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=2257175 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n== Comparison with the casebook method of teaching law ==\nThe case method evolved from the [[casebook method]], a mode of teaching based on [[Socratic method|Socratic principles]] pioneered at [[Harvard Law School]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. Like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem.\n\n== Decision-forcing cases ==\n\nA decision-forcing case is a kind of [[Decision Game | decision game]].  Like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the \"protagonist\") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem.  However, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events.\n\nA decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study.  That is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past.  However, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an \"interrupted narrative.\"  This is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision.  In other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively. <ref>[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/degree-programs/teaching/Contributed-Case-Packet.pdf]</ref>\n\n== Criticisms of decision-forcing cases ==\nIn recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bridgman|first1=Todd|title=Beyond the Manager's Moral Dilemma: Rethinking the 'Ideal Type' Business Ethics Case|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=2010|volume=94|page=311\u2013322|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0759-3}}</ref> It is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives. It has been suggested that different approaches to case writing, that do not put students in the \u2018shoes\u2019 of a manager, be encouraged to address these concerns. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bridgman|first=Todd|last2=Cummings|first2=Stephen|last3=McLaughlin|first3=Colm|date=2016-12-01|title=Restating the Case: How Revisiting the Development of the Case Method Can Help Us Think Differently About the Future of the Business School|url=http://amle.aom.org/content/15/4/724|journal=Academy of Management Learning & Education|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=724\u2013741|doi=10.5465/amle.2015.0291|issn=1537-260X}}</ref>\n\n== Role play ==\n\nEvery decision-forcing case has a protagonist, the historical person who was faced with the problem or problem that students are asked to solve.  Thus, in engaging these problems, students necessarily engage in some degree of role play.\n\nSome case teachers, such as those of the Marine Corps University, place a great deal of emphasis on role play, to the point of addressing each student with the name and titles of the protagonist of the case.  (A student playing the role of a king, for example, is asked \"Your Majesty, what are your orders?\")  Other case teachers, such as those at the Harvard Business School, place less emphasis on role play, asking students \"what would you do if you were the protagonist of the case.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hbs.edu/teaching/case-method-in-practice/leading-in-the-classroom/openings.html | title=Openings - Christensen Center for Teaching and Learning - Harvard Business School}}</ref>\n\n== Historical solution ==\n\nAfter discussing student solutions to the problem at the heart of a decision-forcing case, a case teacher will often provide a description of the historical solution, that is, the decision made by the protagonist of the case.  Also known as \"the rest of the story\", \"the epilogue\", or (particularly at Harvard University) \"the 'B' case\", the description of the historical solution can take the form of a printed article, a video, a slide presentation, a short lecture, or even an appearance by the protagonist.\n\nWhatever the form of the description of the historical solution, the case teacher must take care to avoid giving the impression that the historical solution is the \"right answer.\"  Rather, he should point out that the historical solution to the problem serves primarily to provide students with a baseline to which they can compare their own solutions.\n\nSome case teachers will refrain from providing the historical solution to students.  One reason for not providing the historical solution is to encourage students to do their own research about the outcome of the case.  Another is to encourage students to think about the decision after the end of the class discussion. \"Analytic and problem-solving learning,\" writes Kirsten Lundgren of Columbia University, \"can be all the more powerful when the 'what happened' is left unanswered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009025732/https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid=3 |archivedate=2014-10-09 }}</ref>\n\n== Complex cases ==\n\nA classic decision-forcing case asks students to solve a single problem faced by a single protagonist at a particular time.  There are, however, decision-forcing cases in which students play the role of a single protagonist who is faced with a series of problems, two or more protagonists dealing with the same problem, or two or more protagonists dealing with two or more related problems.\n\n== Decision-forcing staff rides ==\n\nA decision-forcing case conducted in the place where the historical decisions at the heart of the case were made is called a \"decision-forcing staff ride.\"  Also known as an \"on-site decision-forcing case\", a decision-forcing staff ride should not be confused with the two very different exercises that are also known as \"[[staff ride |staff rides]]\": retrospective battlefield tours of the type practiced by the United States Army in the twentieth century and the on-site contingency planning exercises (Stabs Reisen, literally \"staff journeys\") introduced by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] in 1801 and made famous by [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder | the elder Hellmuth von Moltke]] in the middle years of the nineteenth century.\n\nTo avoid confusion between \"decision-forcing staff rides\" and staff rides of other sorts, the Case Method Project at the [[Marine Corps University]] in Quantico, Virginia, adopted the term \"Russell Ride\" to describe the decision-forcing staff rides that it conducts.  The term is an homage to Major General [[John Henry Russell Jr.]],USMC, the 16th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction. <ref>{{Cite web | url=http://onsitetoughcase.blogspot.com/2015/11/decision-forcing-staff-ride.html | title=The Decision-Forcing Staff Ride}}</ref>\n\n== Sandwich metaphors ==\n\nDecision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches.  In this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve.\n\nA decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a \"triple-decker case.\"  (The bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) Similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an [[Open sandwich|\"open-face\"]] or [[Open sandwich|\"sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d\"]] case.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-sandwich-metaphor.html | title=The Sandwich Simile}}</ref>  \n\nA decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions is sometimes called a [[White Castle (restaurant)|\"White Castle\"]] or [[Slider (sandwich)|\"slider\"]] case.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/white-castle-cases.html | title=The White Castle DFC}}</ref>\n\n== Case materials ==\n\nCase materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs.\n\nCase materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting.  Materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (These are called \"the B-case\", \"the rest of the story\", or \"the reveal.\")  Materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting.  (These are often referred to as \"handouts.\") <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=4468541 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101448/http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&sid=4468541 |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCase materials may be either \"refined\" or \"raw.\" Refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (Most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) Raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. These include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://som.yale.edu/our-programs/full-time-mba/curriculum/raw-case-approach | title=The 'Raw' Case Approach| date=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\n== Published case materials ==\n\nA number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials.

This can lead to \"the narrative fallacy\", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story.  This, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students \"parse the case materials.\"  That is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-01-23/the-case-against-case-studies | title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?}}</ref>\n\nTechniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials;  awareness of tropes and clich\u00e9s; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of \"distractors\" - information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case.\n\n==Purpose of the case method==\n\nThe case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner.

Initially a quick, skilful [[Midfielder#Winger|left winger]], he moved to central midfield later in his career. He won two league titles with Liverpool with whom he also won two [[FA Cup Final|cup finals]] at Wembley. He was also a [[FA Cup]] runner-up once each with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. He earned 79 caps for [[England national football team|England]].\n\nBarnes was born and initially raised in [[Jamaica]] as the son of a military officer from [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and a Jamaican mother. He moved to London with his family when he was 12 years old. Barnes joined Watford aged 17 in 1981 before playing 296 competitive games for them scoring 85 goals. He was a Watford [[1984 FA Cup Final]] runner-up. He debuted for England in 1983 and in 1987 joined Liverpool for \u00a3900,000. \n\nIn his 10 seasons there Liverpool won the then top-flight [[Football League First Division|First Division]] twice and the [[FA Cup]] twice. He scored 106 goals in 403 matches. By the time of his last cap in 1995, he had more caps than any other [[black people|black]] England player. After two years at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], he ended his playing career at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in 1999.\n\nBarnes was the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] once (in 1987\u201388) and the [[Football Writers' Association]] Footballer of the Year twice (in 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390). In the run-up to England's [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] campaign he [[John Barnes rap|recorded a rap]] for the official team song, [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s \"[[World in Motion]]\". In 2005, he was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]]. In 2006, in a poll of Liverpool fans' favourite players, Barnes came fifth; a year later, ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' magazine named him Liverpool's best all time player. In 2016, [[The Times]] readers voted him England's greatest ever left-footed player.<ref name=\"greatest left foot\">{{cite news | url= https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/barnes-finney-vote-for-englands-greatest-left-foot-rk69nmx2z | title= John Barnes wins vote for England's greatest left foot | work=The Times | date=6 October 2016 | accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nBarnes had 8 months as [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] head coach when his former Liverpool manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] was [[director of football]].

Ken Barnes hailed from [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] emigrating to Jamaica in 1956 as a member of the West India Regiment. He joined the Jamaica Defence Force when formed after the nation's 1962 independence when he was initially commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Jamaica Regiment. In 1973 he was promoted to colonel remaining in the army until retiring in 1989. While in the army, he was a semi-professional footballer for a Jamaican league club and also captained the Jamaican national team.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/colonel-ken-barnes-trinidadian-born-military-leader-and-father-of-the-footballer-john-barnes-1670450.html|title=Colonel Ken Barnes: Trinidadian-born military leader and father of the footballer of John Barnes|publisher=www.independent.co.uk|date=18 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"genealogist_article\">[http://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/featuredarticles/wdytya2012_barnes.php \"John Barnes\"], TheGenealogist.co.uk</ref> Barnes spent his early childhood living in Jamaica's biggest military base,<ref>{{cite journal|title=John Barnes Interview|journal=Soldier Magazine|issue=June 2005}}</ref> playing football and living a disciplined life.

Barnes debuted for the Reds along with Beardsley on 15 August 1987 in the 2\u20131 league win at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. After 9 minutes Barnes and Beardsley combined to set up Aldridge to score. Barnes' first Liverpool goal was on 12 September beating [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] 2\u20130 at Anfield.\n\nIn his first Liverpool season they won the League title, remaining undefeated for the first 29 games of the season. Barnes' 15 Liverpool league goals in his first season there was second only to John Aldridge. The 2 April 2-1 defeat at [[Nottingham Forest]] was the last of only two league defeats that season. 11 days later Barnes, Beardsley, Houghton and Aldridge were instrumental in Liverpool's 5\u20130 home win over Forest described by [[Tom Finney]] as \"One of the finest exhibition I've seen the whole time I've played and watched the game.

In April 1989, after the [[Hillsborough disaster]] took 96 Liverpool fans' lives, Barnes attended several funerals and visited the injured in hospital. He pulled out of an England international friendly in order to fulfil these public duties.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-days-after-the-disaster-1087185.html | location=London | work=The Independent|title=The days after the disaster| date=14 April 1999}}</ref> Liverpool won the [[1989 FA Cup Final]] with a 3\u20132 victory over [[Merseyside]] rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], with Barnes creating goals from the left wing for Rush. In the [[Liverpool 0\u20132 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|1988-89 title decider]] at Anfield, Arsenal's [[Michael Thomas (footballer born 1967)|Michael Thomas]]' 92nd minute, league winning goal occurred in their counter-attack 17 seconds after Barnes lost ball possession attempting to dribble past [[Kevin Richardson (footballer)|Kevin Richardson]].\n\nBarnes played in the 1990 title winning side at Liverpool and scored 22 league goals from the left wing \u2013 his personal best for the club times. [[Ian Rush]] scored four fewer league goals than Barnes. Barnes was voted Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year, and expectations from England manager Bobby Robson were also high, seeing Barnes as a key component in the buildup to Italia 90. Teammate Peter Beardsley has since said Barnes at the end of the 1980s was \"The best player I ever played with, bar none. For three or four years at the end of the '80s, John was possibly the best player in the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/perfectxi/210/article.aspx |title=Peter Beardsley \u2013 Perfect XI \u2013 Interviews |publisher=FourFourTwo |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nBarnes continued to play regularly for Liverpool and England into the 1990s. In 1990\u201391 he scored 16 league goals. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] were league champions in the season of Kenny Dalglish's resignation and his replacement by [[Graeme Souness]] as manager.\n\nLiverpool had qualified for the 1991-92 [[UEFA Cup]], being readmitted to European competitions a year after the ban on all other English clubs in European competitions since the [[Heysel disaster]] in 1985 had been lifted. This was the first time Barnes had played in European competitions since Watford's 1983-84 UEFA Cup campaign.\n\nHe played just 12 league games in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], scoring once, as Liverpool finished sixth in the league \u2013 their lowest finish in two decades and the first time since 1981 that they had failed to finish champions or runners-up. Liverpool won the [[1992 FA Cup Final]] but Barnes missed the game through unjury. The next month in June he was injured playing for England in [[Helsinki]] in a warm up game before Euro 92. Barnes was out injured for five months. He never recovered his explosive burst of speed that had been a key element of his play. He was now past his playing peak.<ref name=hel/>\n\nBarnes and several other senior players had frosty relationships with Souness during this period as the manager tried to impose new methods quickly. Many senior pros resented his hard discipline approach as well as the increased pressure in training.<ref name=\"Souness\">{{cite book | title=Souness: The Management Years | publisher=Andre Deutsch Ltd |author1=Souness, Graeme  |author2=Ellis, Mike Ellis | year=1999}}</ref> Barnes also once had to make a public apology to Souness after he gave an interview criticising the tactics employed by the manager before an important match.<ref name=\"Rush\">{{cite book | title=Rush: The Autobiography | publisher=Ebury Press | author=Rush, Ian | year=2009}}</ref> Young teammate Robbie Fowler also said in his autobiography that Souness felt at the time Barnes was past his best, but in Fowler's (and others') opinion he still had a lot to offer and was still one of the most talented players at the club.<ref name=\"Fowler\">{{cite book | title=Fowler: My Autobiography | publisher=Macmillan | author=Fowler, Robbie | year=2005}}</ref>\n\nSouness later stated in his autobiography that Barnes due to his injuries was now taking a \"less demanding\" central midfield playmaker's role as opposed to a goalscoring winger. Despite the effects of the injuries, Barnes was still regarded as one of club and country's best players and Souness noted that Barnes \"Retained his quality on the ball, using it well and rarely losing possession\".<ref name=\"Souness\" /> [[Mark Walters]] who had played for Souness at Glasgow Rangers had been purchased as cover/competition for Barnes but failed to displace him.\n\nHis improved form in season 1994\u201395 won an England recall. He scored 7 league goals (9 in all competitions) despite being now principally a central midfielder.\n\nAfter Liverpool's last league title in 1990 Liverpool were usurped by Arsenal, Leeds United, Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers each winning the league at least once. Under [[Roy Evans|Evans]], Barnes and younger players like [[Steve McManaman]], [[Jamie Redknapp]] and [[Robbie Fowler]] (who had been given their debuts by either Dalglish or Souness) won the [[1994-95 Football League Cup]] and were [[1996 FA Cup Final]] runners-up due to [[Eric Cantona]]'s Manchester United goal that gave United a second [[Double (association football)|league and FA Cup double]] in three seasons. Liverpool's [[Spice Boys (footballers)|Spice Boys team]] drew stinging criticism for wearing matching cream Armani suits to the final.<ref name=spice>[https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dominic-matteo-remembers-liverpool-fc-3360418]</ref>\n\nBarnes had been moved to a holding midfielder. He often captained the side in [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396]] when regular captain [[Ian Rush]] lost his place to new signing [[Stan Collymore]]. When Rush departed to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at the season's end Barnes became full-time captain.

He had missed just three Premier League games in his final season at Anfield, scoring four goals (including a memorable late winner against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] just after Christmas) as they had led the table for much of the first half of the season before being overhauled by eventual champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at the end of January and having to settle for a fourth-place finish. Paul Ince (4 years younger at 29), with a completely contrasting combative style signed to replace Barnes in central midfield.<ref name=\"Autobio\" />\n\n====Racism====\nAt one of his first appearances at Anfield, Barnes said that the tea lady had, intentionally or unintentionally, served tea to all the players in the lounge except him, and he made a joke about it by asking light heartedly, \"Is it because I'm black?\"<ref name=\"Autobio\">{{cite book | title=John Barnes: The Autobiography | publisher=Headline Book Publishing | author=Barnes, John | year=1999}}</ref> He also said Liverpool supporters had written to him not to join the club.

Barnes was racially abused by a section of Everton supporters in the [[Merseyside derby]] at Anfield, which led to Everton chairman [[Philip Carter]] disowning the offending supporters, branding them \"scum\". A photograph was once taken of Barnes, in full Liverpool kit and mid-match, casually backheeling away a banana which had been hurled at him during a match with Everton at Goodison Park.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/world_football/2399629.stm Society has to change \u2013 Barnes].

Although an approach had already been made by [[Harry Redknapp]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]], Barnes had agreed in principle to join them, until at the final moment Dalglish called him, and Barnes changed his mind. In the 1997\u201398 season Barnes played up front mostly, deputising for Alan Shearer after Shearer was injured for most of the season, and Barnes ended up Newcastle's top league scorer with six goals, highlighting the Magpies' lack of ability to score in the absence of Shearer and Ferdinand (who had been sold along with Beardsley). Former Liverpool colleague Ian Rush and England colleague Stuart Pearce were also drafted in around this time. Pearce has since stated in his autobiography, \"Psycho\", that he felt Barnes was overweight by the time he joined Newcastle and that both Barnes and Rush had less desire than himself to win at that stage in their careers as they had already won everything, and that they could have had more of an edge to them.<ref name=\"Pearce\">{{cite book | title=Psycho: The Autobiography | publisher=Headline | author=Pearce, Stuart | year=2001}}</ref>\n\nNewcastle (the previous season's [[Premier League]] runners-up) endured a disappointing league campaign and finished 13th, although they did reach the [[1998 FA Cup Final]], and Barnes went onto the field for the fourth [[FA Cup]] final of his career. However, Newcastle lost 2\u20130 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and following the sacking of Dalglish early in the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399 season]], he was left isolated and shunned along with a number of Kenny Dalglish and Kevin Keegan era players including Rob Lee and Stuart Pearce. Barnes with many others was dropped from the first team by new manager [[Ruud Gullit]] and spent several months in the reserves despite, in his opinion, \"excelling in training\" and showing he had lost none of his quality if some of his pace. He felt that himself and others were deliberately being cold shouldered to make it known Gullit wanted his own players in; Barnes had worked briefly with Gullit during the 1998 World Cup ITV commentary team, and they had played numerous international matches played against each other in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were not friends. Barnes knew it was the last straw when even his MBE from the Queen was overlooked by Gullit after a presentation had been given to Stuart Pearce for receiving one \u2013 this was in the winter of 1998 and he knew he was unwanted.<ref name=\"Autobio\" />  Barnes left the club on a free transfer to newly promoted Charlton on 10 February 1999.\n\n===Charlton Athletic===\nBarnes made his debut for Charlton on 13 February 1999, coming on as a substitute in a 1\u20130 home win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].<ref name=\"charl\">{{cite web|title=John Barnes - Charton|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/charlton-athletic-fc/john-barnes-7615/1998-99_a12778/|work=Sporting Heroes|accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref> He made a further 11 league appearances that season, mostly as a substitute, and did not score any goals.<ref name=\"charl\" />  Defeat on the final day of the season relegated the Addicks back to Division One, and Barnes announced his retirement as a player after 20 years.\n\n===Celtic===\nDuring his spell as [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] manager, Barnes would later register as a player although he did not make an appearance for the Scottish side.<ref name=\"charl\" />\n\n==International career==\n\nAlthough born in Jamaica, Barnes had no intention of representing Jamaica at international level as the \"[[Jamaica national football team|Reggae Boyz]] had not yet made a significant mark on world football and he was eager to get to the game's biggest stage\".<ref name=\"jam-star\">{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Gordon|title='I played for England with a Jamaican passport'|url=http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20081028/sports/sports3.html|publisher=Jamaica Star|accessdate=10 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603043909/http://jamaica-star.com/thestar/20081028/sports/sports3.html|archive-date=3 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of Barnes' international career, FIFA's national team eligibility criteria allowed British passport holders to represent one of the British football associations if they had no blood ties to the [[United Kingdom]].

He was not though selected for the final tournament squad despite England not having an established left sided alternative.\n\nBarnes' 79 caps (11 goals) made him England's record capped black player for a time. Compared to his club form, he was never seen as a player who peaked wearing an England shirt. Bobby Robson described him as the \"Greatest enigma\" of his career; whilst including him for his all time dream team England squad of all the players he had picked as manager in his 1990 book \"Against All Odds\" (placing him on the bench), he was baffled at Barnes's inconsistency. He described Barnes as being a player of \"the highest calibre\" but sometimes being unable to reach for that bit extra when he or Captain [[Bryan Robson]] shouted at him to take more players on.<ref name=\"Autobio\" />\n\nBarnes has since said he felt the systems England played were \"rigid\" focusing on speed, aggression, and attacking through the centre rather than patient, passing play. He also said he could receive the ball as few as six or seven times in a game whereas at Liverpool he may receive it more than twenty times, and he had more freedom under Kenny Dalglish who did not ask him to stay on the left wing all the time. England also had a very different system to Liverpool at the time who were much more free-flowing, and later said that to have got the best out of him, they would have needed a similar system to the one used by Dalglish, which was never likely to happen.

[[Ian Rush]] scored four fewer league goals than Barnes. Barnes was voted Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year, and expectations from England manager Bobby Robson were also high, seeing Barnes as a key component in the buildup to Italia 90. Teammate Peter Beardsley has since said Barnes at the end of the 1980s was \"The best player I ever played with, bar none. For three or four years at the end of the '80s, John was possibly the best player in the world.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/perfectxi/210/article.aspx |title=Peter Beardsley \u2013 Perfect XI \u2013 Interviews |publisher=FourFourTwo |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nBarnes continued to play regularly for Liverpool and England into the 1990s. In 1990\u201391 he scored 16 league goals. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] were league champions in the season of Kenny Dalglish's resignation and his replacement by [[Graeme Souness]] as manager.\n\nLiverpool had qualified for the 1991-92 [[UEFA Cup]], being readmitted to European competitions a year after the ban on all other English clubs in European competitions since the [[Heysel disaster]] in 1985 had been lifted. This was the first time Barnes had played in European competitions since Watford's 1983-84 UEFA Cup campaign.\n\nHe played just 12 league games in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], scoring once, as Liverpool finished sixth in the league \u2013 their lowest finish in two decades and the first time since 1981 that they had failed to finish champions or runners-up. Liverpool won the [[1992 FA Cup Final]] but Barnes missed the game through unjury. The next month in June he was injured playing for England in [[Helsinki]] in a warm up game before Euro 92. Barnes was out injured for five months. He never recovered his explosive burst of speed that had been a key element of his play. He was now past his playing peak.<ref name=hel/>\n\nBarnes and several other senior players had frosty relationships with Souness during this period as the manager tried to impose new methods quickly. Many senior pros resented his hard discipline approach as well as the increased pressure in training.<ref name=\"Souness\">{{cite book | title=Souness: The Management Years | publisher=Andre Deutsch Ltd |author1=Souness, Graeme  |author2=Ellis, Mike Ellis | year=1999}}</ref> Barnes also once had to make a public apology to Souness after he gave an interview criticising the tactics employed by the manager before an important match.<ref name=\"Rush\">{{cite book | title=Rush: The Autobiography | publisher=Ebury Press | author=Rush, Ian | year=2009}}</ref> Young teammate Robbie Fowler also said in his autobiography that Souness felt at the time Barnes was past his best, but in Fowler's (and others') opinion he still had a lot to offer and was still one of the most talented players at the club.<ref name=\"Fowler\">{{cite book | title=Fowler: My Autobiography | publisher=Macmillan | author=Fowler, Robbie | year=2005}}</ref>\n\nSouness later stated in his autobiography that Barnes due to his injuries was now taking a \"less demanding\" central midfield playmaker's role as opposed to a goalscoring winger. Despite the effects of the injuries, Barnes was still regarded as one of club and country's best players and Souness noted that Barnes \"Retained his quality on the ball, using it well and rarely losing possession\".<ref name=\"Souness\" /> [[Mark Walters]] who had played for Souness at Glasgow Rangers had been purchased as cover/competition for Barnes but failed to displace him.\n\nHis improved form in season 1994\u201395 won an England recall. He scored 7 league goals (9 in all competitions) despite being now principally a central midfielder.\n\nAfter Liverpool's last league title in 1990 Liverpool were usurped by Arsenal, Leeds United, Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers each winning the league at least once. Under [[Roy Evans|Evans]], Barnes and younger players like [[Steve McManaman]], [[Jamie Redknapp]] and [[Robbie Fowler]] (who had been given their debuts by either Dalglish or Souness) won the [[1994-95 Football League Cup]] and were [[1996 FA Cup Final]] runners-up due to [[Eric Cantona]]'s Manchester United goal that gave United a second [[Double (association football)|league and FA Cup double]] in three seasons. Liverpool's [[Spice Boys (footballers)|Spice Boys team]] drew stinging criticism for wearing matching cream Armani suits to the final.<ref name=spice>[https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/dominic-matteo-remembers-liverpool-fc-3360418]</ref>\n\nBarnes had been moved to a holding midfielder. He often captained the side in [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396]] when regular captain [[Ian Rush]] lost his place to new signing [[Stan Collymore]]. When Rush departed to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at the season's end Barnes became full-time captain. Barnes created the final goal after a dribble and passing movement for Stan Collymore during Liverpool's 4\u20133 win at Anfield against Newcastle.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Jamie Carragher]] debuted for the Liverpool first team in January 1997 and said that despite 33 year old Barnes' now being past his peak, Barnes was still the best player at the club. \"Technically, he's the best player I've ever trained or played with, he was great with both feet, they were both exactly the same. I'd say he's the best finisher I've ever played with (including Torres, Fowler, Owen). Barnes never used to blast his shots \u2013 they'd just get placed right in the corner.

He had missed just three Premier League games in his final season at Anfield, scoring four goals (including a memorable late winner against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] just after Christmas) as they had led the table for much of the first half of the season before being overhauled by eventual champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at the end of January and having to settle for a fourth-place finish. Paul Ince (4 years younger at 29), with a completely contrasting combative style signed to replace Barnes in central midfield.<ref name=\"Autobio\" />\n\n====Racism====\nAt one of his first appearances at Anfield, Barnes said that the tea lady had, intentionally or unintentionally, served tea to all the players in the lounge except him, and he made a joke about it by asking light heartedly, \"Is it because I'm black?\"<ref name=\"Autobio\">{{cite book | title=John Barnes: The Autobiography | publisher=Headline Book Publishing | author=Barnes, John | year=1999}}</ref> He also said Liverpool supporters had written to him not to join the club. The only other black player to have appeared for Liverpool at the time was [[Howard Gayle]], who played five games for the Reds at the beginning of the 1980s.\n\nAs well as being abused by opposition players, on occasion he overheard a teammate make a racist remark towards other black players in opposition teams. Barnes was racially abused by a section of Everton supporters in the [[Merseyside derby]] at Anfield, which led to Everton chairman [[Philip Carter]] disowning the offending supporters, branding them \"scum\". A photograph was once taken of Barnes, in full Liverpool kit and mid-match, casually backheeling away a banana which had been hurled at him during a match with Everton at Goodison Park.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/world_football/2399629.stm Society has to change \u2013 Barnes].

Although an approach had already been made by [[Harry Redknapp]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]], Barnes had agreed in principle to join them, until at the final moment Dalglish called him, and Barnes changed his mind. In the 1997\u201398 season Barnes played up front mostly, deputising for Alan Shearer after Shearer was injured for most of the season, and Barnes ended up Newcastle's top league scorer with six goals, highlighting the Magpies' lack of ability to score in the absence of Shearer and Ferdinand (who had been sold along with Beardsley). Former Liverpool colleague Ian Rush and England colleague Stuart Pearce were also drafted in around this time. Pearce has since stated in his autobiography, \"Psycho\", that he felt Barnes was overweight by the time he joined Newcastle and that both Barnes and Rush had less desire than himself to win at that stage in their careers as they had already won everything, and that they could have had more of an edge to them.<ref name=\"Pearce\">{{cite book | title=Psycho: The Autobiography | publisher=Headline | author=Pearce, Stuart | year=2001}}</ref>\n\nNewcastle (the previous season's [[Premier League]] runners-up) endured a disappointing league campaign and finished 13th, although they did reach the [[1998 FA Cup Final]], and Barnes went onto the field for the fourth [[FA Cup]] final of his career. However, Newcastle lost 2\u20130 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and following the sacking of Dalglish early in the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399 season]], he was left isolated and shunned along with a number of Kenny Dalglish and Kevin Keegan era players including Rob Lee and Stuart Pearce. Barnes with many others was dropped from the first team by new manager [[Ruud Gullit]] and spent several months in the reserves despite, in his opinion, \"excelling in training\" and showing he had lost none of his quality if some of his pace. He felt that himself and others were deliberately being cold shouldered to make it known Gullit wanted his own players in; Barnes had worked briefly with Gullit during the 1998 World Cup ITV commentary team, and they had played numerous international matches played against each other in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were not friends.

Barnes again rapped this time in [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s UK Number 1, \"[[World in Motion]]\", tie-in song.\n\nAt the 1990 World Cup he injured his [[groin]] against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] shortly after his volleyed goal was wrongly disallowed for offside.

Barnes later believed an article attributed to [[Jimmy Greaves]] in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' citing his supposed support for the [[West Indies cricket team]] questioning his loyalty to the England team, had influenced the crowd to boo.<ref name=\"Autobio\" />\n\nHe earned a surprise England recall in 1994 under [[Terry Venables]] and was in the squad in the run up to [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro '96]] after improved form for Liverpool. He was not though selected for the final tournament squad despite England not having an established left sided alternative.\n\nBarnes' 79 caps (11 goals) made him England's record capped black player for a time. Compared to his club form, he was never seen as a player who peaked wearing an England shirt. Bobby Robson described him as the \"Greatest enigma\" of his career; whilst including him for his all time dream team England squad of all the players he had picked as manager in his 1990 book \"Against All Odds\" (placing him on the bench), he was baffled at Barnes's inconsistency. He described Barnes as being a player of \"the highest calibre\" but sometimes being unable to reach for that bit extra when he or Captain [[Bryan Robson]] shouted at him to take more players on.<ref name=\"Autobio\" />\n\nBarnes has since said he felt the systems England played were \"rigid\" focusing on speed, aggression, and attacking through the centre rather than patient, passing play. He also said he could receive the ball as few as six or seven times in a game whereas at Liverpool he may receive it more than twenty times, and he had more freedom under Kenny Dalglish who did not ask him to stay on the left wing all the time. England also had a very different system to Liverpool at the time who were much more free-flowing, and later said that to have got the best out of him, they would have needed a similar system to the one used by Dalglish, which was never likely to happen. He also cited [[Glenn Hoddle]] and [[Chris Waddle]] who he felt England were unable to get the best out of.<ref name=\"Autobio\" />\n\nNewspapers at the time of his England career even queried whether his disciplinarian upbringing in Jamaica to a military family and rumoured beatings as a child from his parents had contributed to his underperformance as an England footballer.<ref name=\"Autobio\" />\n\n[[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] subsequently picked Barnes to be in his England dream team in his 1999 book ''Addicted'', citing that Barnes \"Could pass, move, dribble, had Brazilian style movement... what more could you want?\" He also backed Barnes's claims that England at times used rigid systems.<ref name=\"Adams\">{{cite book | title=Addicted | publisher=Willow | author=Adams, Tony | year=1999}}</ref> Nevertheless, Barnes was in the top ten most capped players list for eleven years until [[David Beckham]] and then [[Gary Neville]] edged him from ninth to 11th.\n\nAfter 12 years Barnes won his 79th and last cap on 6 September 1995 in a 0\u20130 friendly draw with [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] at Wembley that contained extrovert Colombian goalkeeper [[Ren\u00e9 Higuita]]'s 'Scorpion Kick.'{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Managerial career==\n===Celtic===\nIn a \"dream ticket\" style move, Barnes was appointed head coach of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] on 8 June 1999 working under Kenny Dalglish as director of football. After his appointment he later re-registered himself as a player but never played a competitive game for Celtic. He was sacked 8 months into his tenure following a home 3-1 [[1999-2000 Scottish Cup]] defeat by lower division [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] in February.

It was built in the winter of 1950 and opened on 13 July 1951.<ref name=\"Yle\">{{Cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/jarrumiehiksi_kelpasivat_vain_ilmavoimien_lentajat__linnanmaen_vuoristorata_avattiin_65_vuotta_sitten/9021525 |title=Jarrumiehiksi kelpasivat vain ilmavoimien lent\u00e4j\u00e4t \u2013 Linnanm\u00e4en vuoristorata avattiin 65 vuotta sitten |last=Rita |first=Mikko |date=2016-07-13 |website=Yle Uutiset |language=fi |access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Expected to last up to 15&nbsp;years, it was originally designed as a temporary attraction for the amusement park, opened in 1950. One of the main reasons for its construction was to attract tourists from the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] held in the city. Since then, its temporary status was renewed for extended periods, until it was eventually regarded as a permanent structure.\n\nSince its opening in 1951, Vuoristorata has been the most popular ride at Linnanm\u00e4ki every year. It is the most famous amusement ride in Finland, and a symbol of the Linnanm\u00e4ki park; even the old park logo had a shape representing the climbs and descents of Vuoristorata. Vuoristorata has never had a name differing from the general word used for [[roller coaster]] rides; \"Vuoristorata\" simply means \"roller coaster\" in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ({{literal translation}} vuoristo = mountain range, rata = track; mountain range track).\n\n[[File:Linnanrollerc.JPG|thumb|left|290px|Vuoristorata as seen from the [[Panoraama]] gyro tower]]\nVuoristorata is also notable for its features. It is actually a copy of another roller coaster, Rutschebanen, opened in 1932 in [[Dyrehavsbakken]], [[Denmark]]. Valdemar Lebech, the Danish builder who designed both of these tracks (and a few others), simply took the original blueprints of Rutschebanen, which had been downscaled due to changes in location, and designed Vuoristorata. Back in the 1950s, Rutschebanen and Vuoristorata were the two tallest roller coasters in Europe; Vuoristorata is slightly taller and longer of the two.

It was built in the winter of 1950 and opened on 13 July 1951.<ref name=\"Yle\">{{Cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/jarrumiehiksi_kelpasivat_vain_ilmavoimien_lentajat__linnanmaen_vuoristorata_avattiin_65_vuotta_sitten/9021525 |title=Jarrumiehiksi kelpasivat vain ilmavoimien lent\u00e4j\u00e4t \u2013 Linnanm\u00e4en vuoristorata avattiin 65 vuotta sitten |last=Rita |first=Mikko |date=2016-07-13 |website=Yle Uutiset |language=fi |access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> Expected to last up to 15&nbsp;years, it was originally designed as a temporary attraction for the amusement park, opened in 1950. One of the main reasons for its construction was to attract tourists from the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] held in the city. Since then, its temporary status was renewed for extended periods, until it was eventually regarded as a permanent structure.\n\nSince its opening in 1951, Vuoristorata has been the most popular ride at Linnanm\u00e4ki every year. It is the most famous amusement ride in Finland, and a symbol of the Linnanm\u00e4ki park; even the old park logo had a shape representing the climbs and descents of Vuoristorata. Vuoristorata has never had a name differing from the general word used for [[roller coaster]] rides; \"Vuoristorata\" simply means \"roller coaster\" in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ({{literal translation}} vuoristo = mountain range, rata = track; mountain range track).\n\n[[File:Linnanrollerc.JPG|thumb|left|290px|Vuoristorata as seen from the [[Panoraama]] gyro tower]]\nVuoristorata is also notable for its features. It is actually a copy of another roller coaster, Rutschebanen, opened in 1932 in [[Dyrehavsbakken]], [[Denmark]]. Valdemar Lebech, the Danish builder who designed both of these tracks (and a few others), simply took the original blueprints of Rutschebanen, which had been downscaled due to changes in location, and designed Vuoristorata. Back in the 1950s, Rutschebanen and Vuoristorata were the two tallest roller coasters in Europe; Vuoristorata is slightly taller and longer of the two. Furthermore, Vuoristorata is the last built roller coaster in the world to use [[Side friction roller coaster|side friction]] technology.\n\nVuoristorata is still operated by [[Brakeman#Scenic railways|brakemen]]\u2014as Rutschebanen at Dyrehavsbakken was until the end of the 2009 season, as well as a handful of other roller coasters around Europe and one in Australia.\n\nVuoristorata has been carefully maintained throughout the years.

The subsequent restorations have been done while carefully maintaining the original layout; all the wooden parts are replacements but are consistent with the coaster's original design and character.\n\nVuoristorata is among the few roller coasters in the world to have been given the ''[[American Coaster Enthusiasts#ACE Coasters Classics|Classic]]'' status by the [[American Coaster Enthusiasts]] (ACE) club.<ref name=\"Yle\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://rcdb.com/1073.htm The Roller Coaster Database's profile]\n\n{{Linnanm\u00e4ki Coasters}}\n{{ACE Coaster Classics}}\n\n[[Category:Roller coasters in Finland]]\n[[Category:Linnanm\u00e4ki]]\n[[Category:Roller coasters introduced in 1951]]\n\n{{Amusement-ride-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Zarex", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuoristorata"}
