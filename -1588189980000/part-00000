Oceans also contain [[Marine microorganism|microscopic marine life]], such as [[bacteria]] and [[phytoplankton]]}}]]\n{{marine life sidebar}}\n\n'''Marine life''', or '''sea life''' or '''ocean life''', is the [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and other [[organism]]s that live in the [[Saline water|salt water]] of the sea or ocean, or the [[brackish water]] of coastal [[estuaries]]. At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms [[Oxygen cycle|produce oxygen]] and [[Biosequestration|sequester carbon]]. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land. The term ''marine'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning sea or ocean.\n\nMost life forms evolved initially in [[marine habitats]]. By volume, oceans provide about 90 percent of the living space on the planet.<ref name=\"NOAA2019\" /> The earliest [[vertebrate]]s appeared in the form of [[fish]],<ref>[https://www.livescience.com/46262-fossil-ancestor-jawed-vertebrates.html Tiny Fish May Be Ancestor of Nearly All Living Vertebrates] ''Live Science'', 11 June 2014.</ref> which live exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into [[amphibian]]s which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as [[Pinniped|seals]], [[dolphin]]s or [[whale]]s. Plant forms such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] forms the general foundation of the ocean [[food chain]], particularly the [[#Phytoplankton|phytoplankton]] which are key [[primary producer]]s.\n\nMarine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters, including breathing tubes as in [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]. Fish have [[Fish gill|gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air.\n\nThere are over 200,000 documented marine [[species]] with perhaps two million marine species yet to be documented.<ref name=\"la.2009\">{{cite news |title=Mapping an ocean of species |last=Drogin |first=Bob |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/02/nation/na-fish2 |date=2 August 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times }}</ref> Marine species range in size from the microscopic, including [[phytoplankton]] which can be as small as 0.02 micrometres, to huge [[cetacean]]s (whales, dolphins and porpoises), including the [[blue whale]] &ndash; the largest known animal reaching {{convert|33|m|ft}} in length.<ref>{{cite book |last=Paul |first1=Gregory S. |title=The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs |chapter=The Evolution of Dinosaurs and their World |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2010 |page=19}}</ref><ref name=Bortolotti>{{cite book | last = Bortolotti | first  = Dan | title  = Wild Blue: A Natural History of the World's Largest Animal | year = 2008 | publisher  = St. Martin's Press}}</ref> [[Marine microorganism]]s, including [[protist]]s, [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es, constitute about 70% of the total marine [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].\n\n==Water==\n[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|right|300px|{{center|Elevation histogram showing the percentage of the Earth's surface above and below sea level}}]]\n{{See also|Hydrosphere}}\n\nThere is no life without water.<ref>Xiao-feng, Pang  (2014) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=O_26CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Water:+Molecular+Structure+And+Properties%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYiYX-x97iAhUYfH0KHQHTCAkQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Water%3A%20Molecular%20Structure%20And%20Properties%22&f=false ''Water: Molecular Structure And Properties''], chapter 5, pp. 390\u2013461, World Scientific. {{ISBN|9789814440448}}</ref> It has been described as the ''universal solvent'' for its ability to [[Solvent|dissolve]] many substances,<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=620}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Water, the Universal Solvent |url=http://water.usgs.gov/edu/solvent.html |website=[[USGS]] |access-date=27 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709141251/https://water.usgs.gov/edu/solvent.html |archive-date=9 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and as the ''solvent of life''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Campbell Biology |last=Reece |first=Jane B. |date=31 October 2013 |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]] |isbn=9780321775658 |edition=10 |location=|publication-date= |page=48 |via= }}</ref> Water is the only common substance to exist as a [[ice|solid]], liquid, and [[water vapor|gas]] under conditions normal to life on Earth.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Campbell Biology |last=Reece |first=Jane B. |date=31 October 2013 |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]] |isbn=9780321775658 |edition=10 |location=|publication-date= |page=44 |via= }}</ref> The [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi]] referred to water as the ''mater und matrix'': the mother and womb of life.<ref>Collins J.

The idea of body plans originated with [[vertebrate]]s, which were grouped into one phylum. But the vertebrate body plan is only one of many, and invertebrates consist of many phyla or body plans. The history of the discovery of body plans can be seen as a movement from a worldview centred on vertebrates, to seeing the vertebrates as one body plan among many. Among the pioneering [[zoologist]]s, Linnaeus identified two body plans outside the vertebrates; Cuvier identified three; and Haeckel had four, as well as the Protista with eight more, for a total of twelve.

Retrieved 18 August 2016.</ref>). They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like [[mesohyl]] sandwiched between two thin layers of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s. They have unspecialized cells that can [[cellular differentiation|transform into other types]] and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have [[nervous system|nervous]], [[digestive system|digestive]] or [[circulatory system]]s. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.\n\nSponges are similar to other animals in that they are [[multicellular]], [[heterotrophic]], lack [[cell wall]]s and produce [[sperm cell]]s. Unlike other animals, they lack true [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and have no [[body symmetry]]. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the [[osculum]]. Many sponges have internal skeletons of [[spongin]] and/or spicules of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[silicon dioxide]]. All sponges are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] aquatic animals.

They are solitary worm-shaped organisms rarely seen by humans because of their lifestyle. They include two main groups, the [[acorn worms]] and the [[Pterobranchia]]. Pterobranchia form a class containing about 30 species of small worm-shaped animals that live in secreted tubes on the ocean floor. Acorn worms form a class containing about 111 species that generally live in U-shaped burrows on the seabed, from the shoreline to a depth of 3000 metres. The worms lie there with the proboscis sticking out of one opening in the burrow, subsisting as deposit feeders or suspension feeders. It is supposed the ancestors of acorn worms used to live in tubes like their relatives, the Pterobranchia, but eventually started to live a safer and more sheltered existence in sediment burrows.<ref>[https://phys.org/news/2016-07-secret-oesia-life-prehistoric-worm.html#nRlv The secret to an Oesia life: Prehistoric worm built tube-like 'houses' on sea floor]</ref> Some of these worms may grow to be very long; one particular species may reach a length of 2.5 metres (8&nbsp;ft 2 in), although most acorn worms are much smaller.\n\nAcorn worms are more highly specialised and advanced than other worm-like organisms. They have a circulatory system with a heart that also functions as a kidney. Acorn worms have gill-like structures they use for breathing, similar to the gills of fish. Therefore, acorn worms are sometimes said to be a link between classical invertebrates and [[vertebrate]]s. Acorn worms continually form new gill slits as they grow in size, and some older individuals have more than a hundred on each side. Each slit consists of a branchial chamber opening to the pharynx through a U-shaped cleft. Cilia push water through the slits, maintaining a constant flow, just as in fish.<ref name=Barnes1982>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1018\u20131026|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}</ref> Some acorn worms also have a postanal tail which may be homologous to the post-anal tail of vertebrates.\n\nThe three-section body plan of the acorn worm is no longer present in the vertebrates, except in the anatomy of the frontal neural tube, later developed into a brain divided into three parts. This means some of the original anatomy of the early chordate ancestors is still present in vertebrates even if it is not always visible.

They are often called ''seabirds''. While marine birds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking [[convergent evolution]], as the same environmental problems and feeding [[ecological niche|niches]] have resulted in similar adaptations. Examples include [[albatross]], [[penguin]]s, [[gannet]]s, and [[auk]]s.\n\nIn general, marine birds live longer, [[mating|breed]] later and have fewer young than terrestrial birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most [[species]] nest in [[Bird colony|colonies]], which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual [[bird migration|migrations]], crossing the [[equator]] or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Marine birds can be highly [[pelagic]], coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely. Some marine birds plummet from heights, plunging through the water leaving vapour-like trails, similar to that of fighter planes.<ref name=\"baitball\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca/sardine-run-shark-feeding-frenzy-phenomenon-in-africa/miraculous-things |title=Sardine Run Shark Feeding Frenzy Phenomenon in Africa |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202092952/http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca/sardine-run-shark-feeding-frenzy-phenomenon-in-africa/miraculous-things |archivedate=2 December 2008 }}</ref> [[Gannet]]s plunge into the water at up to 100 kilometres per hour (60&nbsp;mph).

Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as [[mating]], [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] and [[molting]]. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well: some may eat [[zooplankton]]; others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, and sea-grass; and a few may eat other mammals.\n\nIn a process of [[convergent evolution]], marine mammals, especially cetaceans redeveloped their [[body plan]] to parallel the streamlined [[wiktionary:fusiform|fusiform]] body plan of [[pelagic fish]].

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny phytoplankton which tend to be [[r-strategists]] that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, are often [[K-strategists]] that grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the zooplankton that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, they  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea.

Coastlines typically have [[continental shelves]] extending some way from the shore. These provide extensive shallows sunlit down to the seafloor, allowing for photosynthesis and enabling habitats for seagrass meadows, coral reefs, kelp forests and other [[Benthos|benthic life]]. Further from shore the continental shelf slopes towards deep water. Wind [[Ekman transport|blowing at the ocean surface]] or [[deep ocean current]]s can result in cold and nutrient rich waters from [[abyssal depth]]s moving up the [[continental slope]]s. This can result in [[upwelling]]s along the outer edges of continental shelves, providing conditions for  [[phytoplankton bloom]]s.\n\nWater evaporated by the sun from the surface of the ocean can precipitate on land and eventually return to the ocean as [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or discharge from rivers, enriched with nutrients as well as [[Marine pollution|pollutants]]. As rivers discharge into [[estuaries]], [[freshwater]] mixes with [[saltwater]] and becomes [[brackish]]. This provides another shallow water habitat where [[mangrove forest]]s and [[estuarine fish]] thrive. Overall, life in inland lakes can evolve with greater diversity than happens in the sea, because freshwater habitats are themselves diverse and compartmentalised in a way marine habitats are not. Some aquatic life, such as [[salmon]] and [[eel]]s, [[Fish migration|migrate]] back and forth between freshwater and marine habitats. These migrations can result in exchanges of pathogens and have impacts on the way life evolves in the ocean.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Anthropogenic impacts==\n[[File:Global cumulative human impact on the ocean.png|thumb|400px| {{center|Global cumulative human impact on the ocean <ref name=Halpern2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Halpern | first1 = B.S. | last2 = Frazier | first2 = M. | last3 = Afflerbach | first3 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2019 | title = Recent pace of change in human impact on the world's ocean | url = | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 1| page = 11609 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-019-47201-9 | pmid = 31406130 | pmc = 6691109 | bibcode = 2019NatSR...911609H }}</ref>}}]]\n{{main|Human impact on marine life}}\n\nHuman activities affect marine life and [[marine habitat]]s through [[overfishing]], [[Marine pollution|pollution]], [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] and the introduction of [[invasive species]].

His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]], used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century.

He divided animals with blood into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish).

In biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land. Marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy. For this reason marine biology encompasses not only organisms that live only in a marine environment, but also other organisms whose lives revolve around the sea. Biological oceanography is the study of how organisms affect and are affected by the [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[geology]] of the [[ocean|oceanographic system]]. Biological oceanography mostly focuses on the [[microorganism]]s within the ocean; looking at how they are affected by their environment and how that affects larger marine creatures and their ecosystem.<ref name =\"Lalli Parsons\">Lalli, Carol M., and Timothy R.

Biological oceanography takes a bottom up approach in terms of the food web, while marine biology studies the ocean from a top down perspective. Biological oceanography mainly focuses on the ecosystem of the ocean with an emphasis on plankton: their diversity (morphology, nutritional sources, motility, and metabolism); their productivity and how that plays a role in the global carbon cycle; and their distribution (predation and life cycle).<ref name=\"Lalli Parsons\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Menden-Deuer |first=Susanne |title=Course Info, OCG 561 Biological Oceanography |url=http://www.gso.uri.edu/ocg561/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Charles B. |author2=Patricia A.

The idea of body plans originated with [[vertebrate]]s, which were grouped into one phylum. But the vertebrate body plan is only one of many, and invertebrates consist of many phyla or body plans. The history of the discovery of body plans can be seen as a movement from a worldview centred on vertebrates, to seeing the vertebrates as one body plan among many. Among the pioneering [[zoologist]]s, Linnaeus identified two body plans outside the vertebrates; Cuvier identified three; and Haeckel had four, as well as the Protista with eight more, for a total of twelve.

Retrieved 18 August 2016.</ref>). They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like [[mesohyl]] sandwiched between two thin layers of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s. They have unspecialized cells that can [[cellular differentiation|transform into other types]] and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have [[nervous system|nervous]], [[digestive system|digestive]] or [[circulatory system]]s. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.\n\nSponges are similar to other animals in that they are [[multicellular]], [[heterotrophic]], lack [[cell wall]]s and produce [[sperm cell]]s. Unlike other animals, they lack true [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and have no [[body symmetry]]. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the [[osculum]]. Many sponges have internal skeletons of [[spongin]] and/or spicules of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[silicon dioxide]]. All sponges are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding {{convert|8800|m|mi|abbr=on}}.

They are solitary worm-shaped organisms rarely seen by humans because of their lifestyle. They include two main groups, the [[acorn worms]] and the [[Pterobranchia]]. Pterobranchia form a class containing about 30 species of small worm-shaped animals that live in secreted tubes on the ocean floor. Acorn worms form a class containing about 111 species that generally live in U-shaped burrows on the seabed, from the shoreline to a depth of 3000 metres. The worms lie there with the proboscis sticking out of one opening in the burrow, subsisting as deposit feeders or suspension feeders. It is supposed the ancestors of acorn worms used to live in tubes like their relatives, the Pterobranchia, but eventually started to live a safer and more sheltered existence in sediment burrows.<ref>[https://phys.org/news/2016-07-secret-oesia-life-prehistoric-worm.html#nRlv The secret to an Oesia life: Prehistoric worm built tube-like 'houses' on sea floor]</ref> Some of these worms may grow to be very long; one particular species may reach a length of 2.5 metres (8&nbsp;ft 2 in), although most acorn worms are much smaller.\n\nAcorn worms are more highly specialised and advanced than other worm-like organisms. They have a circulatory system with a heart that also functions as a kidney. Acorn worms have gill-like structures they use for breathing, similar to the gills of fish. Therefore, acorn worms are sometimes said to be a link between classical invertebrates and [[vertebrate]]s. Acorn worms continually form new gill slits as they grow in size, and some older individuals have more than a hundred on each side. Each slit consists of a branchial chamber opening to the pharynx through a U-shaped cleft. Cilia push water through the slits, maintaining a constant flow, just as in fish.<ref name=Barnes1982>{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1018\u20131026|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}</ref> Some acorn worms also have a postanal tail which may be homologous to the post-anal tail of vertebrates.\n\nThe three-section body plan of the acorn worm is no longer present in the vertebrates, except in the anatomy of the frontal neural tube, later developed into a brain divided into three parts. This means some of the original anatomy of the early chordate ancestors is still present in vertebrates even if it is not always visible.

During the [[Mesozoic]] many groups of reptiles became adapted to life in the seas, including [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[nothosaur]]s, [[placodont]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[thalattosaur]]s and [[thalattosuchia]]ns. Marine reptiles were less numerous after [[mass extinction]] at the end of the [[Cretaceous]].\n\n====Birds====\n{{Main|Seabird}}\n[[File:Chesapeake Waterbird Food Web.jpg|thumb|300px| {{center|Waterbird food web in [[Chesapeake Bay]]}}]]\n\n[[Seabirds|Marine birds]] are [[adaptation|adapted]] to life within the [[marine (ocean)|marine]] environment. They are often called ''seabirds''. While marine birds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking [[convergent evolution]], as the same environmental problems and feeding [[ecological niche|niches]] have resulted in similar adaptations. Examples include [[albatross]], [[penguin]]s, [[gannet]]s, and [[auk]]s.\n\nIn general, marine birds live longer, [[mating|breed]] later and have fewer young than terrestrial birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most [[species]] nest in [[Bird colony|colonies]], which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual [[bird migration|migrations]], crossing the [[equator]] or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Marine birds can be highly [[pelagic]], coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely. Some marine birds plummet from heights, plunging through the water leaving vapour-like trails, similar to that of fighter planes.<ref name=\"baitball\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca/sardine-run-shark-feeding-frenzy-phenomenon-in-africa/miraculous-things |title=Sardine Run Shark Feeding Frenzy Phenomenon in Africa |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202092952/http://www.lifeinthefastlane.ca/sardine-run-shark-feeding-frenzy-phenomenon-in-africa/miraculous-things |archivedate=2 December 2008 }}</ref> [[Gannet]]s plunge into the water at up to 100 kilometres per hour (60&nbsp;mph).

Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as [[mating]], [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] and [[molting]]. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well: some may eat [[zooplankton]]; others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, and sea-grass; and a few may eat other mammals.\n\nIn a process of [[convergent evolution]], marine mammals, especially cetaceans redeveloped their [[body plan]] to parallel the streamlined [[wiktionary:fusiform|fusiform]] body plan of [[pelagic fish]]. Front legs became [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s and back legs disappeared, a [[dorsal fin]] reappeared and the tail morphed into a powerful horizontal [[Fluke (tail)|fluke]].

In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, are often [[K-strategists]] that grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the zooplankton that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, they  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea.

Coastlines typically have [[continental shelves]] extending some way from the shore. These provide extensive shallows sunlit down to the seafloor, allowing for photosynthesis and enabling habitats for seagrass meadows, coral reefs, kelp forests and other [[Benthos|benthic life]]. Further from shore the continental shelf slopes towards deep water. Wind [[Ekman transport|blowing at the ocean surface]] or [[deep ocean current]]s can result in cold and nutrient rich waters from [[abyssal depth]]s moving up the [[continental slope]]s. This can result in [[upwelling]]s along the outer edges of continental shelves, providing conditions for  [[phytoplankton bloom]]s.\n\nWater evaporated by the sun from the surface of the ocean can precipitate on land and eventually return to the ocean as [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or discharge from rivers, enriched with nutrients as well as [[Marine pollution|pollutants]]. As rivers discharge into [[estuaries]], [[freshwater]] mixes with [[saltwater]] and becomes [[brackish]]. This provides another shallow water habitat where [[mangrove forest]]s and [[estuarine fish]] thrive. Overall, life in inland lakes can evolve with greater diversity than happens in the sea, because freshwater habitats are themselves diverse and compartmentalised in a way marine habitats are not. Some aquatic life, such as [[salmon]] and [[eel]]s, [[Fish migration|migrate]] back and forth between freshwater and marine habitats. These migrations can result in exchanges of pathogens and have impacts on the way life evolves in the ocean.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Anthropogenic impacts==\n[[File:Global cumulative human impact on the ocean.png|thumb|400px| {{center|Global cumulative human impact on the ocean <ref name=Halpern2019>{{cite journal | last1 = Halpern | first1 = B.S. | last2 = Frazier | first2 = M. | last3 = Afflerbach | first3 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2019 | title = Recent pace of change in human impact on the world's ocean | url = | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 1| page = 11609 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-019-47201-9 | pmid = 31406130 | pmc = 6691109 | bibcode = 2019NatSR...911609H }}</ref>}}]]\n{{main|Human impact on marine life}}\n\nHuman activities affect marine life and [[marine habitat]]s through [[overfishing]], [[Marine pollution|pollution]], [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] and the introduction of [[invasive species]].

In biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land. Marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy. For this reason marine biology encompasses not only organisms that live only in a marine environment, but also other organisms whose lives revolve around the sea. Biological oceanography is the study of how organisms affect and are affected by the [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[geology]] of the [[ocean|oceanographic system]]. Biological oceanography mostly focuses on the [[microorganism]]s within the ocean; looking at how they are affected by their environment and how that affects larger marine creatures and their ecosystem.<ref name =\"Lalli Parsons\">Lalli, Carol M., and Timothy R.
