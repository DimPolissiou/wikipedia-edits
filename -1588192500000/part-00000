Selected as heir by his father in 672 BC despite not being the eldest son, Ashurbanipal ascended to the throne in 669 BC jointly with his elder brother [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], who became [[king of Babylon]]. Much of the early years of Ashurbanipal's reign was spent fighting rebellions in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], which had been conquered by his father. \n\nThe greatest campaigns of Ashurbanipal were those directed towards [[Elam]], an ancient enemy of Assyria, and against Shamash-shum-ukin, who had expected to be an equal to Ashurbanipal and began to resent the overbearing control his younger brother held over him. Elam was defeated in a series of campaigns in 665 BC and 647\u2013646 BC, after which the cities of Elam were destroyed, its people slaughtered, and the land was left barren and undefended. Shamash-shum-ukin rebelled in 652 BC and assembled a coalition of Assyria's enemies to fight against Ashurbanipal alongside him, but was defeated and committed suicide. \n\nAshurbanipal is most famous for the construction of the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]], the first systematically organized library in the world. The king himself considered the library, a collection of over 30,000 clay tablets with text of a variety of genres including religious documents, handbooks, and traditional Mesopotamian stories, as his greatest achievement. Ashurbanipal's library is the primary reason why texts such as the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' managed to survive to the present day.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Assurbanipal als hogepriester.jpg|left|thumb|Ashurbanipal depicted as king and [[high priest]] on a contemporary statue. Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nAshurbanipal was probably King [[Esarhaddon]]'s fourth eldest son, younger than the crown prince [[Sin-nadin-apli]] and the other two sons [[Shamash-shum-ukin]] and [[Shamash-metu-uballit]].'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=168}}''''' He also had an older sister, [[Serua-eterat]], and several younger brothers.'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=168\u2013173}}''''' Sin-nadin-apli died unexpectedly in 674 BC and Esarhaddon, who was keen to avoid a succession crisis as he himself had only ascended to the throne with great difficulty, soon started making new succession plans.{{sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=63}} Esarhaddon entirely bypassed the third eldest son, Shamash-metu-uballit, possibly because this prince suffered from poor health.'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=170}}'''''\n\nIn May 672 BC, Ashurbanipal was appointed by Esarhaddon as the heir to [[Assyria]] and Shamash-shum-ukin was appointed as the heir to [[Babylonia]].'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}''' The two princes arrived at the capital of [[Nineveh]] together and partook in a celebration with foreign representatives and Assyrian nobles and soldiers.{{sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=64}} Promoting one of his sons as the heir to Assyria and another as the heir to Babylon was a new idea, for the past decades the Assyrian king had simultaneously been the King of Babylon.'''{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=170}}'''\n\nThe choice to name a younger son as crown prince of Assyria, which was clearly Esarhaddon's primary title, and an older son as crown prince of Babylon might be explained by the mothers of the two sons. While Ashurbanipal's mother was likely Assyrian in origin, Shamash-shum-ukin was the son of a woman from Babylon (though this is uncertain, Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin may have shared the same mother)'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=174\u2013176}}''''' which would probably have had problematic consequences if Esarhaddon appointed Shamash-shum-ukin as the Assyrian heir. Since Ashubanipal was the next oldest son, he then was the superior candidate to the throne. Esarhaddon probably surmised that the Babylonians would be content with someone of Babylonian heritage as their king and as such set Shamash-shum-ukin to inherit Babylon and the southern parts of his empire instead.{{sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=65\u201366}} Treaties drawn up by Esarhaddon are somewhat unclear as to the relationship he intended his two sons to have. It is clear that Ashurbanipal was the primary heir to the empire and that Shamash-shum-ukin was to swear him an oath of allegiance, but other parts also specify that Ashurbanipal was not to interfere in Shamash-shum-ukin's affairs, which indicates a more equal standing.{{sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=68}}\n\nAfter Ashurbanipal was appointed as crown prince, he began preparing himself to be a king by observing his father, learning etiquette and studying military tactics. Ashurbanipal also worked as a spymaster, compiling reports for his father based on information gathered from agents throughout the Assyrian Empire.{{Sfn|British Museum||p=}} He was educated by the general Nabu-shar-usur and the scribe Nabu-ahi-eriba and developed an interest in literature and history. The crown prince mastered scribal and religious knowledge and became proficient in reading both his native [[Akkadian language]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. According to Ashurbanipal's own later accounts (his annals representing the major historical sources for his reign), Esarhaddon had favored him due to his intelligence and bravery.'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}'''\n\nBecause Esarhaddon was constantly ill, much of the administrative duties of the empire fell upon Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin during the last few years of their father's reign.'''{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=170}}''' When Esarhaddon left to campaign against Egypt, Ashurbanipal became responsible for the affairs of the court and upon his father's death in 669 BC, full power was transferred to Ashurbanipal without any incidents.'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}'''\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Early reign and Egyptian campaigns ===\n[[File:Map_of_Assyria.png|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 671 BC, after [[Esarhaddon]]'s (Ashurbanipal's father and predecessor) successful invasion of [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]].]]\nAfter Esarhaddon's death in late 669 BC, Ashurbanipal became the Assyrian king as per his father's succession plans. In the spring of the next year, Shamash-shum-ukin was inaugurated as the [[king of Babylon]] and returned the [[Statue of Marduk|statue of B\u00eal]] ([[Bel (mythology)|B\u00eal]], or [[Marduk]], being the patron deity of Babylon) to the city, stolen by his grandfather King [[Sennacherib]] twenty years prior. Shamash-shum-ukin would rule at [[Babylon]] for sixteen years, apparently mostly peacefully in regards to his younger brother, but there would be repeated disagreements on the exact extent of his control.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} Although Esarhaddon's inscriptions suggest that Shamash-shum-ukin should have been granted the entirety of Babylonia to rule, contemporary records only definitely prove that Shamash-shum-ukin held Babylon itself and its vicinity. The governors of some Babylonian cities, such as [[Nippur]], [[Uruk]] and [[Ur]], and the rulers in the Sea Land (the marshy lands in southern [[Sumer]], near the shores of the [[Persian Gulf]]), all ignored the existence of a king in Babylon and saw Ashurbanipal as their monarch.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=80}}\n\nAfter he and his brother had been properly inaugurated as monarchs, Ashurbanipal turned his attention towards Egypt.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}''' Egypt had been conquered by Esarhaddon in 671 BC, one of Ashurbanipal's father's greatest accomplishments. Though Esarhaddon had placed loyal governors in charge of the new Egyptian territories and had captured most of the Egyptian royal court, including the son and wife of the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] had escaped to [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] in the south.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2014|p=}}'''\n\nIn 669 BC, Taharqa had reappeared from the south and had inspired Egypt to attempt to free itself from Esarhaddon's control.'''{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=176\u2013177}}''' Esarhaddon had received word of this rebellion and learnt that even some of his own governors who he had appointed in Egypt had ceased to pay tribute to him and joined the rebels.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2014|p=}}''' Esarhaddon had marched to defeat this rebellion but had died before reaching the Egyptian border.'''{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=176\u2013177}}''' To quell the threat, Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt in {{Circa|}} 667 BC, marching the Assyrian army as far south as [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], one of Egypt's ancient capitals, and sacking numerous revolting cities. The rebellion was stopped and Ashurbanipal appointed as his vassal ruler in Egypt [[Necho I]], who had been king of the city Sais, and Necho's son [[Psamtik I]], who had been educated at the Assyrian capital of [[Nineveh]] during Esarhaddon's reign.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}'''\n\nAfter his victory, Ashurbanipal left Egypt. The country was thus seen as vulnerable and Taharqa's nephew and designated successor [[Tantamani]] invaded Egypt in hopes of restoring his family to the throne. He met the forces of Necho at Memphis, the Egyptian capital, and though Tantamani was defeated, Necho also died in the battle. The situation quickly turned in Tantamani's favor as the Egyptians themselves rose up alongside him against Psamtik, who escaped into hiding. Hearing of this, Ashurbanipal again marched his army to Egypt in 666 BC and defeated Tantamani. After Thebes, the stronghold of the Kushites in Egypt, was sacked for a third time in less than a decade, Tantamani abandoned the campaign and escaped back to Kush.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}'''\n\nVictorious, Ashurbanipal made Psamtik the full Pharaoh of Egypt in 665 BC and granted him Assyrian garrisons throughout Egypt. The next few years saw Ashurbanipal occupied elsewhere, leading his army in Anatolia against [[Tabal]], in the north against [[Urartu]] and in the south-east against [[Elam]]. With little attention given to Egypt, the kingdom would slowly slip away from Assyrian control without the need for a bloody conflict.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}'''\n\n=== First Elamite campaign ===\n[[File:Elamite archer. Alabaster. From Nineveh, Iraq. Reign of Ashurbanipal II, 668-627 BCE. The Burrell Collection, Glasgow, UK.jpg|thumb|[[Elam|Elamite]] archer depicted in one of Ashurbanipal's reliefs from [[Nineveh]]. Exhibited at the [[Burrell Collection]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nIn 665 BC, the Elamite king [[Urtak (king of Elam)|Urtak]] launched a surprise attack against Babylonia, but was successfully driven back into Elam, dying shortly thereafter. Urtak was succeeded as Elamite king by [[Teumman]], who was unrelated to the previous monarch and had to stabilize his rule by killing his political rivals. Three of Urtak's sons, chief rival claimants to the Elamite throne, escaped to Assyria and were harbored by Ashurbanipal, despite Teumman demanding them to be returned to Elam.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=50|1984}}\n\nFollowing his victory over the Elamites, Ashurbanipal had to deal with a series of revolts within his own borders. Bel-iqisha, chieftain of the [[Gambulians]] (an [[Arameans|Aramean]] tribe) in Babylonia, rebelled after he had been implicated as supporting the Elamite invasion and had been forced to relinquish some of his authority. Little is known of this revolt, but there is a letter preserved in which Ashurbanipal orders the governor of Uruk, Nabu-ushabshi, to attack Bel-iqisha. Nabu-ushabshi apparently claimed that Bel-iqisha was solely to blame for the Elamite invasion.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=79}} Bel-iqisha's revolt does not appear to have caused much damage and he was killed shortly after revolting by a boar. Shortly thereafter in 663 BC, Bel-iqisha's son Dunanu surrendered to Ashurbanipal.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=80}}\n\nShamash-shum-ukin appears to have tired of Ashurbanipal's rule by 653 BC; inscriptions from Babylon suggest that Ashurbanipal had been managing the affairs of Shamash-shum-ukin and had been essentially dictating his decrees. Shamash-shum-ukin sent diplomats to Teumann in Elam, hoping to use his army to destabilize Ashurbanipal's rule. Ashurbanipal appears to have been unaware of Shamash-shum-ukin's involvement, though he successfully defeated the Elamites in 653 BC and ravaged their cities and country.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} The final battle in this campaign took place near the Elamite capital of [[Susa]] and was a decisive Assyrian victory, partly due to defections in the Elamite army. King Teumann was killed in the battle, as was one of his vassals called Shutruk-Nahhunte, the king of the city [[Hidalu]]. In the aftermath of his victory, Ashurbanipal installed two of Urtak's sons as rulers, proclaiming [[Ummanigash (son of Urtak)|Ummanigash]] as king at [[Madaktu]] and Susa and [[Tammaritu I]] as king at Hidalu.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=50|1984}} In his inscriptions, Ashurbanipal describes his victory as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Like the onset of a terrible hurricane I overwhelmed Elam in its entirety. I cut off the head of Teumann, their king, \u2013 the haughty one, who plotted evil. Countless of his warriors I slew. Alive, with my hands, I seized his fighters. With their corpses I filled the plain about Susa as with ''baltu'' and ''ashagu''{{refn|''Baltu'' and ''ashagu'' were probably varieties of thorny shrub.|group=\"n\"}}. Their blood I let run down the [[Ulai]]; its water I dyed red like wool.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|pp=299\u2013300}}}}\n\nDunanu, who had joined the Elamites in the war, was captured alongside his family and executed and the Gambulians were attacked by Ashurbanipal's army and brutally punished, with their capital of [[Shapibel]] being flooded and many of its inhabitants slaughtered. In Dananu's stead, Ashurbanipal appointed a noble called Rimutu as the new Gambulian chieftain after he had agreed to pay a considerable sum in tribute to the Assyrian king.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=80}} Ashurbanipal described his vengeance against Dananu with these words:\n\n{{Quote| quote = On my return march I set my face against Dunanu, (king) of Gambulu, who had put his faith in Elam. Shapibel, the stronghold of Gambulu, I captured. I entered that city; its inhabitants I slaughtered like lambs. Dunanu and Sam'gunu, who had made difficult for me the exercising of sovereignty, \u2013 in shackles, fetters of iron, bonds of iron, I bound them hand and foot. The rest of the sons of Bel-iqisha, his family, the seed of his father's house, all there were, Nab\u00fb-n\u00e2'id, B\u00eal-\u00eatir, sons of Nab\u00fb-shum-\u00earesh, the proconsul, and the bones of the father who begot them, together with Urbi and Teb\u00ea, peoples of Gambulu, cattle, sheep, asses, horses, mules, I carried off from Gambulu to Assyria. Shapibel, his stronghold, I devastated, I destroyed, I laid waste to by flooding it.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=300}}}}\n\n=== Dealings with Lydia and the Cimmerians ===\n[[File:Palace relief from Nineveh - Pergamonmuseum - Berlin - Germany 2017.jpg|left|thumb|Assyrian spearmen depicted in a palace relief from Nineveh, 7th century BC. Exhibited at the [[Pergamon Museum]].]]\nThe [[Cimmerians]], a nomadic [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European people]] living in the southern [[Caucasus]] north of Assyria, had invaded Assyria during the reign of Ashurbanipal's father. After Esarhaddon defeated them, the Cimmerians had turned to attack the [[Lydia|Lydian kingdom]] in western [[Anatolia]], ruled by the king [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]]. After allegedly receiving advice from Assyria's god, [[Ashur (god)|Assur]], in a dream, Gyges sent his diplomats to ask Ashurbanipal for assistance. The Assyrians did not even know that Lydia existed and after the two states successfully established communication with the help of interpreters, the Cimmerian invasion of Lydia was defeated in {{Circa|}} 665 BC, with two Cimmerian chiefs being imprisoned in Nineveh and large amounts of spoils being secured by Ashurbanipal's forces. The extent to which the Assyrian army was involved in the Lydian campaign is unknown, but it appears that Gyges was disappointed with the help as he just twelve years later broke his alliance with Ashurbanipal, allying with [[Psamtik I]] of Egypt instead. After this, Ashurbanipal cursed Gyges and when Lydia was overrun by its enemies {{Circa|}} 652\u2013650 BC there was much rejoicing in Assyria.{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}\n\nWhile the Assyrian forces were on campaign in Elam, an alliance of [[Persians]], Cimmerians and [[Medes]] marched on the capital Nineveh and managed to reach the city's walls. To counteract this threat, Ashurbanipal called on his [[Scythians|Scythian]] allies and successfully defeated the enemy army. The Median king, [[Phraortes]], is generally held to have been killed in the fighting.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} This attack is poorly documented and it is possible that Phraortes wasn't present at all and his unfortunate death instead belongs to a Median campaign during the reign of one of Ashurbanipal's successors.{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}\n\nAfter his death {{Circa|}} 652 BC, Gyges was succeeded by his son [[Ardys of Lydia|Ardys]]. Because the Scythians had driven the Cimmerians from their homes, the Cimmerians invaded Lydia again and successfully captured most of the kingdom. As his father had before him, Ardys also sent for aid from Ashurbanipal, stating that \"You cursed my father and bad luck befell him; but bless me, your humble servant, and I will carry your yoke\". It is unknown if any Assyrian aid arrived, but Lydia was successfully freed from the Cimmerians. They would not be driven out of Lydia completely until the reign of Ardys's grandson [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]].{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}\n\n=== Revolt of Shamash-shum-ukin ===\n[[File:Detail of a stone monument of Shamash-shum-ukin as a basket-bearer. 668-655 BCE. From the temple of Nabu at Borsippa, Iraq and is currently housed in the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Detail of a stone monument of [[Shamash-shum-ukin]] as a basket-bearer. 668\u2013655 BCE. From the temple of [[Nabu]] at [[Borsippa]]. Currently housed in the [[British Museum]].]]\nBy the 650s BC, the hostility between Shamash-shum-ukin and Ashurbanipal would have been apparent to their vassals. A letter from Zakir, a courtier at Shamash-shum-ukin's court, to Ashurbanipal described how visitors from the Sea Land had publicly criticized Ashurbanipal in front of Shamash-shum-ukin, using the phrase \"this is not the word of a king!\". Zakir reported that though Shamash-shum-ukin was angered, he and his governor of Babylon, Ubaru, chose to not take action against the visitors.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=88}} Perhaps the most important factors behind Shamash-shum-ukin's revolt was his dissatisfaction with his position relative to that of his brother, the constant resentment of Assyria in general by the Babylonians and the constant willingness of the ruler of Elam to join anyone who waged war against Assyria.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=90}}\n\nShamash-shum-ukin rebelled against Ashurbanipal in 652 BC. This civil war would last for three years.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} Inscription evidence suggests that Shamash-shum-ukin addressed the citizens of Babylon to join him in his revolt. In Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, Shamash-shum-ukin is quoted to have said \"Ashurbanipal will cover with shame the name of the Babylonians\", which Ashurbanipal refers to as \"wind\" and \"lies\". Soon after Shamash-shum-ukin began his revolt, the rest of southern Mesopotamia rose up against Ashurbanipal alongside him.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=91}} The beginning of Ashurbanipal's inscriptions regarding Shamash-shum-ukin read as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = In these days Shamash-shum-ukin, the faithless brother of mine, whom I had treated well and had set up as king of Babylon, \u2013 every imaginable thing that kingship calls for, I made and gave him; soldiers, horses, chariots, I equipped and put into his hands; cities, fields, plantations, together with the people who live therein, I gave him in larger numbers than my father had ordered. But he forgot this kindness I had shown him and planned evil. Outwardly, with his lips, he was speaking fair words while inwardly his heart was designing murder. The Babylonians, who had been loyal to Assyria and faithful vassals of mine, he deceived, speaking lies to them.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=301}}}}\n\n[[File:Ashurbanipal II in a chariot, wall relief, 7th century BC, from Nineveh, the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal depicted in a chariot with a bow, from the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]''.]]\nAccording to the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, Shamash-shum-ukin was very successful in finding allies against the Assyrians. Ashurbanipal identifies three groups which aided his brother, first and foremost there were the [[Chaldea|Chaldeans]], [[Arameans]] and the other peoples of Babylonia, then there were the Elamites and lastly the kings of [[Gutium]], [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] and [[Meluhha]]. This last group of kings might refer to the Medes (as Gutium, Amurru and Meluhha no longer existed at this point) but this is uncertain. Meluhha might have referred to Egypt, which did not aid Shamash-shum-ukin in the war. Shamash-shum-ukin's ambassadors to the Elamites had offered gifts (called \"bribes\" by Ashurbanipal) and their king, Ummanigash, sent an army under the command of Undashe, the son of King Teumman, to aid in the conflict.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=93}}\n\nDespite the seemingly strong alliance of Assyrian enemies, Shamash-shum-ukin's situation looked grim by 650 BC, with Ashubanipal's forces having besieged Sippar, Borsippa, [[Kutha]] and Babylon itself. Having endured starvation and disease over the course of the siege, Babylon finally fell in 648 BC and was plundered by Ashurbanipal. Shamash-shum-ukin committed suicide by [[Self-immolation|setting himself and his family on fire]] in his palace.'''{{Sfn|Johns|1913|p=124\u2013125}}{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}}''' Ashurbanipal describes his victory and his vengeance against those that had supported Shamash-shum-ukin in his inscriptions as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Assur, [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], [[Shamash]], [[Adad]], B\u00eal, [[Nabu|Nab\u00fb]], [[Ishtar]] of Nineveh, the queen of Kidmuri, Ishtar of [[Erbil|Arbela]], [[Ninurta|Urta]], [[Nergal]] and [[Nusku]], who march before me, slaying my foes, cast Shamash-shum-ukin, my hostile brother, who became my enemy, into the burning flames of a conflagration and destroyed him. As for the people who hatched these plans for Shamash-shum-ukin, my hostile brother, and did the evil, but who were afraid of death and valued their lives highly, they did not cast themselves into the fire with Shamash-shum-ukin, their lord. Those of them who fled before the murderous iron dagger, famine, want and flaming fire, and found a refuge, \u2013 the net of the great gods, my lords, which cannot be eluded, brought them low. Not one escaped; not one sinner slipped through my hands, of those whom the gods had counted for my hands.<br>The chariots, coaches, palanquins, his concubines, the goods of his palace, they brought before me. As for those men and their vulgar mouths, who uttered vulgarity against Assur, my god, and plotted evil against me, the prince who fears him, \u2013 I slit their tongues and brought them low. The rest of the people, alive, by the colossi, between which they had cut down Sennacherib, the father of the father who begot me, \u2013 at that time, I cut down those people there, as an offering to his shade. Their dismembered bodies I fed to the dogs, swine, wolves and eagles, to the birds of heaven and the fish of the deep.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=|pp=303\u2013304}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nAfter Shamash-shum-ukin's defeat, Ashurbanipal appointed a new governor of the city, [[Kandalanu]], possibly one of his younger brothers. Kandalanu's realm was the same as Shamash-shum-ukin's with the exception of the city of Nippur, which Ashurbanipal converted into a powerful Assyrian fortress.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} The authority of Kandalanu is likely to have been very limited and few records survive of his reign at Babylon. If he wasn't one of Ashurbanipal's brothers, he was likely a Babylonian noble who had allied with Ashurbanipal in the civil war and had been rewarded with the rank of king. Kandalanu probably lacked any true political and military power, which was instead firmly in the hands of the Assyrians.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=254}}\n\n=== Second Elamite campaign ===\n[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|left|thumb|Ashurbanipal's campaign against Elam is triumphantly recorded in this relief showing the destruction of [[Susa]]. Here, flames rise from the city as Assyrian soldiers topple it with pickaxes and crowbars and carry off the spoils. Now exhibited at the [[Louvre]].]]\nThe Elamites under Ummanigash had joined Shamash-shum-ukin in the war, partly to restore control over the parts of Elam that Ashurbanipal had incorporated into the Assyrian Empire. Ummanigash's army was defeated near the city [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] and as a result, he was deposed in Elam by [[Tammaritu II]], who then ruled as king. Ummanigash fled to the Assyrian court and was granted asylum by Ashurbanipal. Tammaritu II's rule was brief and despite success in some battles alongside the Chaldean warlord Nabu-bel-shumati, he was deposed in another revolt in 649 BC. The new king, [[Indabibi]], had an extremely brief reign and was murdered after Ashurbanipal threatened to invade Elam again because of Elam's role in supporting his enemies.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=51|1984}}\n\nIn Indibibi's stead, [[Humban-haltash III]] became king in Elam. Nabu-bel-shumati continued fighting against Ashurbanipal from outposts within Elam and though Humban-haltash was in favor of giving up the Chaldean rebel, Nabu-bel-shumati had too many supporters in Elam in order for this to go through. As such, Ashurbanipal invaded Elam again in 647 BC and after his short-lived resistance failed, Humban-haltash abandoned his seat at Madaktu and fled into the mountains.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=51|1984}} Hamban-haltash was briefly replaced as king by Tammaritu II, who regained his throne. After the Assyrians had plundered the region of [[Khuzistan]] the Assyrian army returned home and Hamban-haltash returned and retook the throne.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=52|1984}}\n[[File:Feldzug Assurbanipal.JPG|thumb|Assyrian soldiers in a chariot depicted campaigning in [[Elam]], {{Circa|}} 650 BC. Exhibited at the [[Pergamon Museum]].]]\nAshurbanipal returned to Elam in 646 BC and Hamban-haltash again abandoned Madaktu, fleeing first to the city [[Dur-Untash]] and then into the mountains in eastern Elam. Ashurbanipal's forces pursued Hamban-haltash, plundering and razing cities on their way. All major political centers in Elam were crushed and nearby chiefdoms and petty kingdoms who had previously paid tribute to the Elamite king began paying tribute to Ashurbanipal instead. Among these kingdoms was [[Parsua]], possibly a predecessor of the empire that would be founded by the [[Achaemenids]] a century later.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=52|1984}} Parsua's king, Cyrus (possibly the same person as [[Cyrus I]], the grandfather of [[Cyrus the Great]]), had originally sided with the Elamites at the beginning of the campaign, and had thus been forced to supply his son [[Arukku]] as a hostage. Countries which had never previously had contact with the Assyrians, such as a kingdom ruled by a king called \u1e2audimiri which \"extended beyond Elam\", also began paying tribute to the Assyrians for the first time.{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}\n\nOn their way back from their campaign, the Assyrian forces brutally plundered Susa. In Ashurbanipal's triumphant inscriptions detailing the sack it is described in great detail, recounting how the Assyrians desecrated the royal tombs, looted and razed temples, stole the statues of the Elamite gods and sowed salt in the ground. The detail and length of these inscriptions suggest that the event was meant to shock the world through its proclamation of the defeat and eradication of the Elamites as a distinct cultural entity.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=52|1984}} Translated into English, a part of Ashurbanipal's inscription of the sack reads:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Susa, the great holy city, abode of their gods, seat of their mysteries, I conquered. I entered its palaces, I opened their treasuries where silver and gold, goods and wealth were amassed... I destroyed the [[ziggurat]] of Susa. I smashed its shining copper horns. I reduced the temples of Elam to naught; their gods and goddesses I scattered to the winds. The tombs of their ancient and recent kings I devastated, I exposed to the sun, and I carried away their bones toward the land of Ashur. I devastated the provinces of Elam and on their lands I sowed salt.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}}}\n\nDespite the thorough and brutal campaign, the Elamites endured as a political entity for some time. Hamban-haltash returned to rule at Madaktu and (belatedly) sent Nabu-bel-shumati to Ashurbanipal, though the Chaldean committed suicide on his way to Nineveh. After Hamban-haltash was deposed, captured and sent to the Assyrians in a revolt shortly thereafter, Assyrian records cease to speak of Elam.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|1984|pp=52\u201353}} Ashurbanipal appointed no new governors of the Elamite cities after his campaign and made no attempts to integrate the country as an Assyrian province, instead leaving it open and undefended. The fields were left empty and barren. In the decades following the campaign, the Persians would migrate into the region and rebuild the devastated cities.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}\n\n=== Arabian campaigns ===\n[[File:Assyrian_horsemen_arabs.png|thumb|Drawing of ancient Assyrian artwork depicting Assyrian horsemen pursuing Arabs, from the Russian book ''\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f (\u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0451\u0445 \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445) \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440'' (1904).]]\nAshurbanipal's war against tribes in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] has received relatively little attention from modern historians but is the campaign with the longest account in his own writings. The chronology of these campaigns is uncertain and based on the series of annals Ashurbanipal wrote, although the narrative appears to have been slightly altered over the course of a few years. Ashurbanipal's earliest account of his campaign against the Arabs was created in 649 BC and describes how the king Yauta, son of Hazael, king of the [[Qedarites]] (who had been a tributary of Ashurbanipal's father) revolted against Ashurbanipal, together with another Arabic king called Ammuladdin, and plundered the western lands of the Assyrian Empire. According to Ashurbanipal's account, his army, together with the army King [[Kamas\u1e25alta|Kamas-halta]] of [[Moab]], defeated the rebel forces. Ammuladdin was captured and sent in chains to Assyria and Yauta escaped. In the place of Yauta a loyal Arabian warlord called Abiyate was granted kingship of the Qedarites. This early narrative of the campaign is different from most of Ashurbanipal's other military accounts in that the phrase \"in my ''n''th campaign\" is missing, the king is not described as defeating the enemy in person and the enemy king survives and flees rather than being captured and executed.{{Sfn|Gerardi|1992|pp=67\u201374}} \n\nThe second version of the narrative, composed in 648 BC, also includes that Ashurbanipal defeated Adiya, a queen of the Arabs, and that Yauta fled to another chieftain, Natnu of the [[Nabayyate]], who refused him and remained loyal to Ashurbanipal. Even later versions of the narrative also include mentions of how Yauta also had revolted against Esarhaddon, years prior. These later accounts also explicitly connect Yauta's rebellion to the revolt of Shamash-shum-ukin, placing it at the same time and suggesting that the western raids by the Arabs were prompted by the instability caused by the Assyrian civil war.{{Sfn|Gerardi|1992|pp=79\u201381}}\n\nSometime after the conclusion of this first brief conflict, Ashurbanipal conducted a second campaign against the Arabs. Ashurbanipal's account of this conflict largely concerns the movements of his army through Syria in search of Uiate (conflated with Yauta but possibly a different person) and his Arabian soldiers. According to the account, the Assyrian army marched from Syria to Damascus and then on to Hulhuliti, after which they captured Abiyate and defeated U\u0161\u0161o and Akko. There is no mention of the reason behind Abiyate's rebellion. Furthermore, the Nabayyate, who had aided Ashurbanipal in the previous campaign, are mentioned as being defeated in his second war against the Arabs, without any further information on what had led to the change in their relationship between the two campaigns.{{Sfn|Gerardi|1992|pp=83\u201386}}\n\nThe latest version of the Arabian narrative specifies the two campaigns as composing Ashurbanipal's ninth campaign and further expands upon its contents. In this version, it is specified that the Abiyate who replaced Yauta as king of the Qedarites and the king Ammuladdin had been the chief Arabian generals joining Shamash-shum-ukin's war and that spoils brought back to Assyria from the campaigns caused inflation in Ashurbanipal's empire and famine in Arabia. It is also made clear that Ashurbanipal himself, not just his army, had been personally victorious in the conflict. This later version also states that Uiate was captured and paraded in Nineveh together with prisoners captured during the wars in Elam.{{Sfn|Gerardi|1992|pp=89\u201394}}\n\n=== Succession and chronology ===\n[[File:Delacroix - La Mort de Sardanapale (1827).jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'' by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] (1827), depicting an erroneous and romanticized version of Ashurbanipal known as [[Sardanapalus]], depicted as carelessly watching invaders plunder his city and slaughter his [[harem]], based on the work of ancient Greek writers.|alt=|left]]The end of Ashurbanipal's reign and the beginning of the reign of his successor, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], is shrouded in mystery on account of a lack of available sources. The annals kept by Ashurbanipal, the main sources to his reign, end in 636 BC, possibly because the king was ill. Inscriptions by Ashur-etil-ilani suggest that his father died a natural death, but do not shed light on when exactly this happened.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=121}} Before archaeological excavations and discoveries in the 1800s, Ashurbanipal was known by the name [[Sardanapalus]], based on the writings of the ancient Greeks, and had been misidentified as the last king of Assyria. One popular story of his end was that Sardanapalus had burnt himself, his concubines and servants alive, along with his entire palace at the [[Fall of Nineveh]] in 612 BC (almost twenty years after the actual Ashurbanipal died).{{Sfn|British Museum||p=}}\n[[File:Territorial_organization_of_the_Assyrian_Empire_in_times_of_Ashurbanipal.svg|alt=|thumb|The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] around the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, in dark green the ''pahitu''/''pahutu'' (provinces), in yellow the ''matu'' (subjects kingdoms), in cream color the [[Babylonia|Babylonian vassal kingdom]], the yellow points show other subjects kingdoms, the black points show the ''pahitu''/''pahutu'' (provinces) of Babylon kingdom, and the brown letters provinces that existed previously.]]\nAlthough Ashurbanipal's final year is often repeated as 627 BC,{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} this follows an inscription at Harran made by the mother of the [[Neo-Babylonian]] king [[Nabonidus]] nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of Nippur made in 631 BC.{{Sfn|Reade|1970|p=1}} To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, it is generally agreed that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 BC.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=263}} 631 BC is typically used as the year of his death.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} If Ashurbanipal's reign had ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors Ashur-etil-ilani and [[Sinsharishkun]] in Babylon would have been impossible, as the city was seized by [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC, and never again fell into Assyrian hands.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=246}}\n\nOne possible way to justify a 42-year reign of Ashurbanipal is by assuming there was a coregency between him and Ashur-etil-ilani, but there had never been a coregency in prior Assyrian history and the idea is explicitly contradicted by Ashur-etil-ilani's own inscriptions which describe him as ascending to the throne after the end of his father's reign. It is possible that the 42-year error came about in later Mesopotamian historiography on account of the knowledge that Ashurbanipal ruled concurrently with Babylonian rulers Shamash-shum-ukin and Kandalanu, whose reigns together amount to 42 years, but Kandalanu survived Ashurbanipal by three years, dying in 627 BC.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=250}}\n\nAnother once popular idea, for instance defended by Polish historian [[Stefan Zawadzki|Stefan Zawadski]] in his book ''The Fall of Assyria'' (1988), is that Ashubanipal and Kandalanu were the same person, \"Kandalanu\" simply being the name the king used in Babylon. This is considered unlikely for several reasons. No previous Assyrian king is known to have used an alternate name in Babylon. Inscriptions from Babylonia also show a difference in the lengths of the reigns of Ashurbanipal and Kandalanu; Ashurbanipal's reign is counted from his first full year as king (668 BC) and Kandalanu's is counted from his first full year as king (647 BC). All Assyrian kings who personally ruled Babylon used the title \"King of Babylon\" in their own inscriptions, but it is not used in Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, even those made after 648 BC. Most importantly, Babylonian documents treat Ashurbanipal and Kandalanu as two different people. No contemporary Babylonian sources describe Ashurbanipal as King of Babylon.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=|pp=251\u2013252}}\n\nAshurbanipal was succeeded as king by his son, Ashur-etil-ilani, and he seems to have been inspired by the succession plans of his father as another of his sons, Sinsharishkun, was granted the fortress-city of Nippur and was designated to be the successor of Kandalanu at Babylon once Kandalanu died.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}}\n\n== Family and children ==\n[[File:Ashurbanipal and his queen dining with city of gold emphasized.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal (right) and his queen Libbali-sharrat (left) depicted dining.]]\nThe name of Ashurbanipal's queen was '''Libbali-sharrat'''{{Sfn|Collins|2004|p=1}} (Akkadian: ''Libbali-\u0161arrat''{{Sfn|Kertai|2013|p=118}}). Not much is known of Libbali-sharrat, but she was already married to Ashurbanipal when he became king and might have married him as early as 673 BC, at around the time of the death of Esarhaddon's queen Esharra-hammat.{{Sfn|Kertai|2013|p=119}}\n\nThree of Ashurbanipal's children are known by name:\n\n* '''[[Ashur-etil-ilani]]''' (Akkadian: ''A\u0161\u0161ur-etil-il\u0101ni''){{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=248}} \u2013 son who ruled as king of Assyria 631\u2013627 BC.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=243}}\n* '''[[Sinsharishkun]]''' (Akkadian: ''S\u00een-\u0161ar-i\u0161kun''){{Sfn|Tallqvist|1914|p=201}} \u2013 son who ruled as king of Assyria 627\u2013612 BC.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=243}}\n*'''Ninurta-sharru-usur''' (Akkadian: ''Ninurta-\u0161arru-u\u1e63ur''){{Sfn|Frahm|1999|p=322}} \u2013 son born of a lower wife (i.e., not Libbali-sharrat), seems to have played no political role.{{Sfn|Frahm|1999|p=322}}\n\nThe inscriptions of Sinsharishkun which mention him being selected for the kingship \"from among his equals\" (i.e., brothers) suggests that Ashurbanipal had more sons in addition to Ashur-etil-ilani, Sinsharishkun and Ninurta-sharru-usur.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=255}}\n\nIt is possible that Ashurbanipal's lineage returned to power in Mesopotamia after the fall of Assyria in 612\u2013609 BC. The mother of the last of the Neo-Babylonian kings, Nabonidus ({{reign|556|539}} BC), was from Harran and had Assyrian ancestry. This woman, [[Addagoppe of Harran|Addagoppe]], was according to her own inscriptions born in the 20th year of Ashurbanipal's reign (648 BC, as years were counted from the king's first full year). British scholar [[Stephanie Dalley]] considers it \"almost certain\" that Addagoppe was a daughter of Ashurbanipal on account of her own inscriptions claiming that Nabonidus was of Ashurbanipal's dynastic line.{{Sfn|Dalley|2003|p=177}} American Professor of Biblical Studies Michael B. Dick have refuted this, pointing out that even though Nabonidus did go to some length to revive some old Assyrian symbols (such as wearing a wrapped cloak in his depictions, absent in those of other Neo-Babylonian kings but present in Assyrian art) and attempted to link himself to the [[Sargonid dynasty]], there is \"no evidence whatsoever that Nabonidus was related to the Sargonid Dynasty\".{{Sfn|Dick|2004|p=15}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Library of Ashurbanipal ===\n{{Main|Library of Ashurbanipal}}\n[[File:British Museum Flood Tablet.jpg|thumb|Tablet containing a part of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Now exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nThe [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] was the first systematically organized library in the world.{{Sfn|British Museum||p=}}{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}} The library is the best known of Ashurbanipal's accomplishments and the king himself considered it his greatest.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} The library was assembled at Ashurbanipal's command, with scribes being sent out throughout his empire to collect and copy texts of every type and genre from the libraries of the temples. Most of the collected texts were observations of events and omens, texts detailing the behaviour of certain men and of animals, texts on the movements of celestial objects and so forth. Present in the library were also dictionaries for Sumerian, Akkadian and other languages and many religious texts, such as rituals, fables, prayers and incantations.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}\n\nMost of the traditional Mesopotamian stories and tales known today, such as the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]'' (the Babylonian creation myth), ''[[Erra (god)|Erra]]'', the ''[[Etana|Myth of Etana]]'' and the ''[[Anz\u00fb|Epic of Anzu]]'', only survived until the modern era because they were included in Ashurbanipal's library. The library covered the entire spectrum of Ashurbanipal's literary interests and also included folk tales (such as ''[[Poor Man of Nippur|The Poor Man of Nippur]]'', a predecessor of one of the tales in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''), handbooks and scientific texts.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}\n\nAshurbanipal described the reasoning behind collecting such a vast library, amounting to over 30,000 clay tablets,{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} with these words:\n\n{{Quote| quote = I, Ashurbanipal, [[king of the universe]], on whom the gods have bestowed intelligence, who has acquired penetrating acumen for the most recondite details of scholarly erudition (none of my predecessors having any comprehension of such matters), I have placed these tablets for the future in the library at Nineveh for my life and for the well-being of my soul, to sustain the foundations of my royal name.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}}}\n\nNineveh was destroyed in 612 BC and the Library of Ashurbanipal was buried under the walls of Ashurbanipal's burning palace and lost to history for more than two thousand years. It was unearthed in the 19th century by [[Austen Henry Layard]] and [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and the translations of the contents within it by [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]] brought the ancient Mesopotamian texts to the modern world. Prior to its discovery, there was a widespread notion that the [[Bible]] was the oldest book and a work without precedent, an idea which was decisively disproven with the discovery of the library.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}\n\n=== Assessment by historians ===\n[[File:Ashurbanipal II, detail of a lion-hunt scene from Nineveh, 7th century BC, the British Museum.jpg|left|thumb|Ashurbanipal depicted in the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]''.]]\nAt the time of Ashurbanipal's reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was the largest empire the world had ever seen and its capital, Nineveh, at about 120,000 citizens,{{Sfn|Chandler|Fox|p=362|2013}} was probably the largest city on the planet.{{Sfn|British Museum||p=}} During his reign, the Assyrian Empire prospered economically, despite its continuing expansion.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}} He is often regarded as the last great king of Assyria{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} and is recognized, alongside his two predecessors Esarhaddon and Sennacherib, as one of the greatest Assyrian kings.{{Sfn|Budge|1880|p=xii}}\n\nAshurbanipal has sometimes been characterized as a zealot. The king rebuilt, repaired and expanded a majority of the major shrines throughout his empire and many of the actions he took during his reign were due to omen reports, something he was very interested in.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}} He appointed two of his younger brothers, [[Ashur-mukin-paleya]] and [[Ashur-etel-shame-erseti-muballissu]], as priests in the cities [[Assur]] and [[Harran]] respectively.''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=171}}'' He has also been seen as a patron of the arts due to the many sculptures and reliefs he erected in his palaces at Nineveh, depicting the most important events from his long reign. The style used in these works of art has an \"epic quality\" unlike the artwork produced under his predecessors.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}\n\nAssessment of Ashurbanipal has not solely been positive. In 639 BC, Ashurbanipal [[Eponym dating system|named the year]] (years were generally named after people in ancient Assyria, often military officials) after his chief musician, Bullu\u1e6du, which Assyriologist Julian E. Reade saw as the move of an \"irresponsible and self-indulgent\" king.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=263}} Though Assyria reached the apex of its power under Ashurbanipal's rule, the empire collapsed quickly after his death. Whether Ashurbanipal is partly to blame for Assyria's downfall is disputed. J. A. Delaunay, author of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' entry on the king writes that the Neo-Assyrian Empire under Ashurbanipal had already began \"exhibiting clear symptoms of impending dislocation and fall\",{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}} while [[Donald John Wiseman]], in the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'' article on the king, holds that \"It is no indictment of his rule that his empire fell within two decades after his death; this was due to external pressures rather than to internal strife\".{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}\n\n=== In art and popular culture ===\n[[File:San Francisco Civic Center Historic District 09.jpg|thumb|''[[Ashurbanipal (sculpture)|Ashurbanipal]]'', a bronze sculpture by [[Fred Parhad]] in the [[Civic Center, San Francisco|Civic Center]] of [[San Francisco]].]]\nDepictions of Ashurbanipal in artwork survive from his reign. The ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'', a set of [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] from Ashurbanipal's palace, can be seen at the [[British Museum]] in London. These reliefs depict the king hunting and killing [[Mesopotamian lion|Mesopotamian lions]].{{Sfn|Ashrafian|2011|pp=47\u201349}} The Assyrian king was tasked with protecting his own people, often being referred to as a \"shepherd\". This protection included defending against external enemies and defending citizens from dangerous wild animals. To the Assyrians, the most dangerous animal of all was the lion, used (similarly to foreign powers) as an example of chaos and disorder due to their aggressive nature. To prove themselves worthy of rule and illustrate that they were competent protectors, Assyrian kings engaged in ritual [[Lion hunting|lion hunts]]. Lion-hunting was reserved for Assyrian royalty and was a public event, staged at parks in or near the Assyrian cities.{{Sfn|Introducing the Assyrians||p=}}\n\nAshurbanipal has also been the subject of artwork created in modern times. In 1958, surrealist painter [[Leonora Carrington]] painted ''Assurbanipal Abluting Harpies'', an oil on canvas at the [[Israel Museum]] depicting Ashurbanipal pouring a white substance onto the heads of pigeon-like creatures with human faces.{{Sfn|Assurbanipal Abluting Harpies||p=}} A statue of the king, called ''[[Ashurbanipal (sculpture)|Ashurbanipal]]'', was created by sculptor [[Fred Parhad]] in 1988 and placed on a street near the [[San Francisco City Hall]]. The statue cost $100,000 and was described as the \"first sizable bronze statue of Ashurbanipal\". It was presented to the City of San Francisco as a gift from the [[Assyrian people]] on May 29, 1988, Parhad being of Assyrian descent. Some local Assyrians expressed fears that the statue resembled the legendary Mesopotamian hero [[Gilgamesh]] more than it resembled the actual Ashurbanipal. Parhad defended the statue as representing Ashurbanipal, though explained that he had taken some artistic liberties.{{Sfn|Fernandez|1987|p=}}\n\nAshurbanipal has also made occasional appearances in popular culture in various media. [[Robert E. Howard]] wrote a short story entitled ''The Fire of Asshurbanipal'', first published in the December 1936 issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine, about an \"accursed jewel belonging to a king of long ago, whom the Grecians called Sardanapalus and the Semitic peoples Asshurbanipal\".{{Sfn|Price|2001|pp=99\u2013118}} \"[[The Mesopotamians]]\", a 2007 song by [[They Might Be Giants]], mentions Ashurbanipal alongside Gilgamesh, [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]], and [[Hammurabi]].{{Sfn|Nardo|2012|p=88}} Ashurbanipal was used as the ruler of the Assyrians in the game ''[[Civilization V]]''.{{Sfn|Pitts|2013}}\n\n== Titles ==\n{{See also|Akkadian royal titulary}}\nIn an inscription on a cylinder dated to 648 BC,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=323}} Ashurbanipal uses the following titles:\n\n{{Quote| quote = I am Ashurbanipal, the great king, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, [[king of the four regions of the world]]; offspring of the loins of Esarhaddon, king of the universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, [[king of Sumer and Akkad]]; grandson of Sennacherib, king of the universe, king of Assyria.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=323}}}}\n\nA similar titulature is used on one of Ashurbanipal's many tablets:\n\n{{Quote| quote = I, Ashurbanipal, the great king, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, king of the four regions of the world, son of Esarhaddon, king of the universe, king of Assyria, grandson of Sennacherib, king of the universe, king of Assyria, eternal seed of royalty ...{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=356}}}}\n\nA longer variant is presented on one of Ashurbanipal's building inscriptions in Babylon:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Ashurbanipal, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, king of the four regions of the world, king of kings, unrivaled prince, who, from the Upper to the Lower Sea, holds sway and has brought in submission at his feet all rulers; son of Esarhaddon, the great king, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad; grandson of Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, am I.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=369}}}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of Assyrian kings]]\n* [[Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibF6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Sin-apla-iddina|title=Southern Mesopotamia in the time of Ashurbanipal|last=Ahmed|first=Sami Said|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|year=2018|isbn=978-3111033587|location=The Hague|pages=|ref=CITEREFAhmed2018}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Ashrafian|first=H.|date=2011|title=An extinct Mesopotamian lion subspecies|journal=Veterinary Heritage|volume=34|issue=2|pages=47\u201349|ref=CITEREFAshrafian2011|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2004-0-25603-8&isbn=9781315011660&format=googlePreviewPdf|title=The History of Esarhaddon|last=Budge|first=Ernest A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-1136373213|location=Oxford|pages=|ref=CITEREFBudge1880|orig-year=1880}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/elamsurveysofpol0000cart|url-access=registration|title=Elam: Surveys of Political History and Archaeology|last=Carter|first=Elizabeth|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|isbn=978-0520099500|location=Los Angeles|pages=|ref=CITEREFCarterStolper1984|last2=Stolper|first2=Matthew W.}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XiGLBQAAQBAJ|title=3000 Years of Urban Growth|last2=Fox|first2=Gerald|last=Chandler|first=Tertius|publisher=Elsevier|year=2013|isbn=978-1483248899|location=New York|pages=|ref=CITEREFChandlerFox2013|orig-year=1974}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Paul|date=2004|title=The Symbolic Landscape of Ashurbanipal|journal=Notes in the History of Art|volume=23|issue=3|pages=1\u20136|ref=CITEREFCollins2004|doi=10.1086/sou.23.3.23206845}}\n*{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.se/books?id=aBg8TqiCZb8C&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=%22daughter+of+Assurbanipal%22&source=bl&ots=Ywpp0AYrVA&sig=ACfU3U2C-75-fyZnMZ4GufpRRrUytzQkqg&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiqxaGGoY_mAhXHtYsKHQFzAkIQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Herodotus and His World: Essays from a Conference in Memory of George Forrest|last=Dalley|first=Stephanie|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0199253746|location=Oxford|pages=|ref=CITEREFDalley2003|chapter=The Hanging Gardens of Babylon?}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia | title = A\u0160\u0160URBANIPAL | last = Delaunay | first = J.

[[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] from the death of his father [[Esarhaddon]] in 668 BC to his own death in 631 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}}{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=243}}{{Sfn|British Museum||p=}} The fourth king of the [[Sargonid dynasty]], Ashurbanipal is generally remembered as the last great king of Assyria. \n\nAt the time of Ashurbanipal's reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was the largest empire that the world had ever seen and its capital, [[Nineveh]], was probably the largest city on the planet. Selected as heir by his father in 672 BC despite not being the eldest son, Ashurbanipal ascended to the throne in 669 BC jointly with his elder brother [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], who became [[king of Babylon]]. Much of the early years of Ashurbanipal's reign was spent fighting rebellions in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], which had been conquered by his father. \n\nThe greatest campaigns of Ashurbanipal were those directed towards [[Elam]], an ancient enemy of Assyria, and against Shamash-shum-ukin, who had expected to be an equal to Ashurbanipal and began to resent the overbearing control his younger brother held over him. Elam was defeated in a series of campaigns in 665 BC and 647\u2013646 BC, after which the cities of Elam were destroyed, its people slaughtered, and the land was left barren and undefended. Shamash-shum-ukin rebelled in 652 BC and assembled a coalition of Assyria's enemies to fight against Ashurbanipal alongside him, but was defeated and committed suicide. \n\nAshurbanipal is most famous for the construction of the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]], the first systematically organized library in the world. The king himself considered the library, a collection of over 30,000 clay tablets with text of a variety of genres including religious documents, handbooks, and traditional Mesopotamian stories, as his greatest achievement. Ashurbanipal's library is the primary reason why texts such as the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' managed to survive to the present day.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Assurbanipal als hogepriester.jpg|left|thumb|Ashurbanipal depicted as king and [[high priest]] on a contemporary statue. Exhibited at the [[British Museum]].]]\nAshurbanipal was probably King [[Esarhaddon]]'s fourth eldest son, younger than the crown prince [[Sin-nadin-apli]] and the other two sons [[Shamash-shum-ukin]] and [[Shamash-metu-uballit]].'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=168}}''''' He also had an older sister, [[Serua-eterat]], and several younger brothers.'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=168\u2013173}}''''' Sin-nadin-apli died unexpectedly in 674 BC and Esarhaddon, who was keen to avoid a succession crisis as he himself had only ascended to the throne with great difficulty, soon started making new succession plans.{{sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=63}} Esarhaddon entirely bypassed the third eldest son, Shamash-metu-uballit, possibly because this prince suffered from poor health.'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=170}}'''''\n\nIn May 672 BC, Ashurbanipal was appointed by Esarhaddon as the heir to [[Assyria]] and Shamash-shum-ukin was appointed as the heir to [[Babylonia]].'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}''' The two princes arrived at the capital of [[Nineveh]] together and partook in a celebration with foreign representatives and Assyrian nobles and soldiers.{{sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=64}} Promoting one of his sons as the heir to Assyria and another as the heir to Babylon was a new idea, for the past decades the Assyrian king had simultaneously been the King of Babylon.'''{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=170}}'''\n\nThe choice to name a younger son as crown prince of Assyria, which was clearly Esarhaddon's primary title, and an older son as crown prince of Babylon might be explained by the mothers of the two sons. While Ashurbanipal's mother was likely Assyrian in origin, Shamash-shum-ukin was the son of a woman from Babylon (though this is uncertain, Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin may have shared the same mother)'''''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=174\u2013176}}''''' which would probably have had problematic consequences if Esarhaddon appointed Shamash-shum-ukin as the Assyrian heir. Since Ashubanipal was the next oldest son, he then was the superior candidate to the throne. Esarhaddon probably surmised that the Babylonians would be content with someone of Babylonian heritage as their king and as such set Shamash-shum-ukin to inherit Babylon and the southern parts of his empire instead.{{sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=65\u201366}} Treaties drawn up by Esarhaddon are somewhat unclear as to the relationship he intended his two sons to have. It is clear that Ashurbanipal was the primary heir to the empire and that Shamash-shum-ukin was to swear him an oath of allegiance, but other parts also specify that Ashurbanipal was not to interfere in Shamash-shum-ukin's affairs, which indicates a more equal standing.{{sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=68}}\n\nAfter Ashurbanipal was appointed as crown prince, he began preparing himself to be a king by observing his father, learning etiquette and studying military tactics. Ashurbanipal also worked as a spymaster, compiling reports for his father based on information gathered from agents throughout the Assyrian Empire.{{Sfn|British Museum||p=}} He was educated by the general Nabu-shar-usur and the scribe Nabu-ahi-eriba and developed an interest in literature and history. The crown prince mastered scribal and religious knowledge and became proficient in reading both his native [[Akkadian language]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. According to Ashurbanipal's own later accounts (his annals representing the major historical sources for his reign), Esarhaddon had favored him due to his intelligence and bravery.'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}'''\n\nBecause Esarhaddon was constantly ill, much of the administrative duties of the empire fell upon Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin during the last few years of their father's reign.'''{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=170}}''' When Esarhaddon left to campaign against Egypt, Ashurbanipal became responsible for the affairs of the court and upon his father's death in 669 BC, full power was transferred to Ashurbanipal without any incidents.'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}'''\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Early reign and Egyptian campaigns ===\n[[File:Map_of_Assyria.png|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 671 BC, after [[Esarhaddon]]'s (Ashurbanipal's father and predecessor) successful invasion of [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]].]]\nAfter Esarhaddon's death in late 669 BC, Ashurbanipal became the Assyrian king as per his father's succession plans. In the spring of the next year, Shamash-shum-ukin was inaugurated as the [[king of Babylon]] and returned the [[Statue of Marduk|statue of B\u00eal]] ([[Bel (mythology)|B\u00eal]], or [[Marduk]], being the patron deity of Babylon) to the city, stolen by his grandfather King [[Sennacherib]] twenty years prior. Shamash-shum-ukin would rule at [[Babylon]] for sixteen years, apparently mostly peacefully in regards to his younger brother, but there would be repeated disagreements on the exact extent of his control.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} Although Esarhaddon's inscriptions suggest that Shamash-shum-ukin should have been granted the entirety of Babylonia to rule, contemporary records only definitely prove that Shamash-shum-ukin held Babylon itself and its vicinity. The governors of some Babylonian cities, such as [[Nippur]], [[Uruk]] and [[Ur]], and the rulers in the Sea Land (the marshy lands in southern [[Sumer]], near the shores of the [[Persian Gulf]]), all ignored the existence of a king in Babylon and saw Ashurbanipal as their monarch.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=80}}\n\nAfter he and his brother had been properly inaugurated as monarchs, Ashurbanipal turned his attention towards Egypt.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}''' Egypt had been conquered by Esarhaddon in 671 BC, one of Ashurbanipal's father's greatest accomplishments. Though Esarhaddon had placed loyal governors in charge of the new Egyptian territories and had captured most of the Egyptian royal court, including the son and wife of the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] had escaped to [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] in the south.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2014|p=}}'''\n\nIn 669 BC, Taharqa had reappeared from the south and had inspired Egypt to attempt to free itself from Esarhaddon's control.'''{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=176\u2013177}}''' Esarhaddon had received word of this rebellion and learnt that even some of his own governors who he had appointed in Egypt had ceased to pay tribute to him and joined the rebels.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2014|p=}}''' Esarhaddon had marched to defeat this rebellion but had died before reaching the Egyptian border.'''{{Sfn|Radner|2003|p=176\u2013177}}''' To quell the threat, Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt in {{Circa|}} 667 BC, marching the Assyrian army as far south as [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], one of Egypt's ancient capitals, and sacking numerous revolting cities. The rebellion was stopped and Ashurbanipal appointed as his vassal ruler in Egypt [[Necho I]], who had been king of the city Sais, and Necho's son [[Psamtik I]], who had been educated at the Assyrian capital of [[Nineveh]] during Esarhaddon's reign.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}'''\n\nAfter his victory, Ashurbanipal left Egypt. The country was thus seen as vulnerable and Taharqa's nephew and designated successor [[Tantamani]] invaded Egypt in hopes of restoring his family to the throne. He met the forces of Necho at Memphis, the Egyptian capital, and though Tantamani was defeated, Necho also died in the battle. The situation quickly turned in Tantamani's favor as the Egyptians themselves rose up alongside him against Psamtik, who escaped into hiding. Hearing of this, Ashurbanipal again marched his army to Egypt in 666 BC and defeated Tantamani. After Thebes, the stronghold of the Kushites in Egypt, was sacked for a third time in less than a decade, Tantamani abandoned the campaign and escaped back to Kush.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}'''\n\nVictorious, Ashurbanipal made Psamtik the full Pharaoh of Egypt in 665 BC and granted him Assyrian garrisons throughout Egypt. The next few years saw Ashurbanipal occupied elsewhere, leading his army in Anatolia against [[Tabal]], in the north against [[Urartu]] and in the south-east against [[Elam]]. With little attention given to Egypt, the kingdom would slowly slip away from Assyrian control without the need for a bloody conflict.'''{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}'''\n\n=== First Elamite campaign ===\n[[File:Elamite archer. Alabaster. From Nineveh, Iraq. Reign of Ashurbanipal II, 668-627 BCE. The Burrell Collection, Glasgow, UK.jpg|thumb|[[Elam|Elamite]] archer depicted in one of Ashurbanipal's reliefs from [[Nineveh]]. Exhibited at the [[Burrell Collection]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nIn 665 BC, the Elamite king [[Urtak (king of Elam)|Urtak]] launched a surprise attack against Babylonia, but was successfully driven back into Elam, dying shortly thereafter. Urtak was succeeded as Elamite king by [[Teumman]], who was unrelated to the previous monarch and had to stabilize his rule by killing his political rivals. Three of Urtak's sons, chief rival claimants to the Elamite throne, escaped to Assyria and were harbored by Ashurbanipal, despite Teumman demanding them to be returned to Elam.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=50|1984}}\n\nFollowing his victory over the Elamites, Ashurbanipal had to deal with a series of revolts within his own borders. Bel-iqisha, chieftain of the [[Gambulians]] (an [[Arameans|Aramean]] tribe) in Babylonia, rebelled after he had been implicated as supporting the Elamite invasion and had been forced to relinquish some of his authority. Little is known of this revolt, but there is a letter preserved in which Ashurbanipal orders the governor of Uruk, Nabu-ushabshi, to attack Bel-iqisha. Nabu-ushabshi apparently claimed that Bel-iqisha was solely to blame for the Elamite invasion.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=79}} Bel-iqisha's revolt does not appear to have caused much damage and he was killed shortly after revolting by a boar. Shortly thereafter in 663 BC, Bel-iqisha's son Dunanu surrendered to Ashurbanipal.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=80}}\n\nShamash-shum-ukin appears to have tired of Ashurbanipal's rule by 653 BC; inscriptions from Babylon suggest that Ashurbanipal had been managing the affairs of Shamash-shum-ukin and had been essentially dictating his decrees. Shamash-shum-ukin sent diplomats to Teumann in Elam, hoping to use his army to destabilize Ashurbanipal's rule. Ashurbanipal appears to have been unaware of Shamash-shum-ukin's involvement, though he successfully defeated the Elamites in 653 BC and ravaged their cities and country.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} The final battle in this campaign took place near the Elamite capital of [[Susa]] and was a decisive Assyrian victory, partly due to defections in the Elamite army. King Teumann was killed in the battle, as was one of his vassals called Shutruk-Nahhunte, the king of the city [[Hidalu]]. In the aftermath of his victory, Ashurbanipal installed two of Urtak's sons as rulers, proclaiming [[Ummanigash (son of Urtak)|Ummanigash]] as king at [[Madaktu]] and Susa and [[Tammaritu I]] as king at Hidalu.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=50|1984}} In his inscriptions, Ashurbanipal describes his victory as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Like the onset of a terrible hurricane I overwhelmed Elam in its entirety. I cut off the head of Teumann, their king, \u2013 the haughty one, who plotted evil. Countless of his warriors I slew. Alive, with my hands, I seized his fighters. With their corpses I filled the plain about Susa as with ''baltu'' and ''ashagu''{{refn|''Baltu'' and ''ashagu'' were probably varieties of thorny shrub.|group=\"n\"}}. Their blood I let run down the [[Ulai]]; its water I dyed red like wool.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|pp=299\u2013300}}}}\n\nDunanu, who had joined the Elamites in the war, was captured alongside his family and executed and the Gambulians were attacked by Ashurbanipal's army and brutally punished, with their capital of [[Shapibel]] being flooded and many of its inhabitants slaughtered. In Dananu's stead, Ashurbanipal appointed a noble called Rimutu as the new Gambulian chieftain after he had agreed to pay a considerable sum in tribute to the Assyrian king.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=80}} Ashurbanipal described his vengeance against Dananu with these words:\n\n{{Quote| quote = On my return march I set my face against Dunanu, (king) of Gambulu, who had put his faith in Elam. Shapibel, the stronghold of Gambulu, I captured. I entered that city; its inhabitants I slaughtered like lambs. Dunanu and Sam'gunu, who had made difficult for me the exercising of sovereignty, \u2013 in shackles, fetters of iron, bonds of iron, I bound them hand and foot. The rest of the sons of Bel-iqisha, his family, the seed of his father's house, all there were, Nab\u00fb-n\u00e2'id, B\u00eal-\u00eatir, sons of Nab\u00fb-shum-\u00earesh, the proconsul, and the bones of the father who begot them, together with Urbi and Teb\u00ea, peoples of Gambulu, cattle, sheep, asses, horses, mules, I carried off from Gambulu to Assyria. Shapibel, his stronghold, I devastated, I destroyed, I laid waste to by flooding it.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=300}}}}\n\n=== Dealings with Lydia and the Cimmerians ===\n[[File:Palace relief from Nineveh - Pergamonmuseum - Berlin - Germany 2017.jpg|left|thumb|Assyrian spearmen depicted in a palace relief from Nineveh, 7th century BC. Exhibited at the [[Pergamon Museum]].]]\nThe [[Cimmerians]], a nomadic [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European people]] living in the southern [[Caucasus]] north of Assyria, had invaded Assyria during the reign of Ashurbanipal's father. After Esarhaddon defeated them, the Cimmerians had turned to attack the [[Lydia|Lydian kingdom]] in western [[Anatolia]], ruled by the king [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]]. After allegedly receiving advice from Assyria's god, [[Ashur (god)|Assur]], in a dream, Gyges sent his diplomats to ask Ashurbanipal for assistance. The Assyrians did not even know that Lydia existed and after the two states successfully established communication with the help of interpreters, the Cimmerian invasion of Lydia was defeated in {{Circa|}} 665 BC, with two Cimmerian chiefs being imprisoned in Nineveh and large amounts of spoils being secured by Ashurbanipal's forces. The extent to which the Assyrian army was involved in the Lydian campaign is unknown, but it appears that Gyges was disappointed with the help as he just twelve years later broke his alliance with Ashurbanipal, allying with [[Psamtik I]] of Egypt instead. After this, Ashurbanipal cursed Gyges and when Lydia was overrun by its enemies {{Circa|}} 652\u2013650 BC there was much rejoicing in Assyria.{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}\n\nWhile the Assyrian forces were on campaign in Elam, an alliance of [[Persians]], Cimmerians and [[Medes]] marched on the capital Nineveh and managed to reach the city's walls. To counteract this threat, Ashurbanipal called on his [[Scythians|Scythian]] allies and successfully defeated the enemy army. The Median king, [[Phraortes]], is generally held to have been killed in the fighting.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} This attack is poorly documented and it is possible that Phraortes wasn't present at all and his unfortunate death instead belongs to a Median campaign during the reign of one of Ashurbanipal's successors.{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}\n\nAfter his death {{Circa|}} 652 BC, Gyges was succeeded by his son [[Ardys of Lydia|Ardys]]. Because the Scythians had driven the Cimmerians from their homes, the Cimmerians invaded Lydia again and successfully captured most of the kingdom. As his father had before him, Ardys also sent for aid from Ashurbanipal, stating that \"You cursed my father and bad luck befell him; but bless me, your humble servant, and I will carry your yoke\". It is unknown if any Assyrian aid arrived, but Lydia was successfully freed from the Cimmerians. They would not be driven out of Lydia completely until the reign of Ardys's grandson [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]].{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}\n\n=== Revolt of Shamash-shum-ukin ===\n[[File:Detail of a stone monument of Shamash-shum-ukin as a basket-bearer. 668-655 BCE.

From the temple of [[Nabu]] at [[Borsippa]]. Currently housed in the [[British Museum]].]]\nBy the 650s BC, the hostility between Shamash-shum-ukin and Ashurbanipal would have been apparent to their vassals. A letter from Zakir, a courtier at Shamash-shum-ukin's court, to Ashurbanipal described how visitors from the Sea Land had publicly criticized Ashurbanipal in front of Shamash-shum-ukin, using the phrase \"this is not the word of a king!\". Zakir reported that though Shamash-shum-ukin was angered, he and his governor of Babylon, Ubaru, chose to not take action against the visitors.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=88}} Perhaps the most important factors behind Shamash-shum-ukin's revolt was his dissatisfaction with his position relative to that of his brother, the constant resentment of Assyria in general by the Babylonians and the constant willingness of the ruler of Elam to join anyone who waged war against Assyria.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=90}}\n\nShamash-shum-ukin rebelled against Ashurbanipal in 652 BC. This civil war would last for three years.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} Inscription evidence suggests that Shamash-shum-ukin addressed the citizens of Babylon to join him in his revolt. In Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, Shamash-shum-ukin is quoted to have said \"Ashurbanipal will cover with shame the name of the Babylonians\", which Ashurbanipal refers to as \"wind\" and \"lies\". Soon after Shamash-shum-ukin began his revolt, the rest of southern Mesopotamia rose up against Ashurbanipal alongside him.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=91}} The beginning of Ashurbanipal's inscriptions regarding Shamash-shum-ukin read as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = In these days Shamash-shum-ukin, the faithless brother of mine, whom I had treated well and had set up as king of Babylon, \u2013 every imaginable thing that kingship calls for, I made and gave him; soldiers, horses, chariots, I equipped and put into his hands; cities, fields, plantations, together with the people who live therein, I gave him in larger numbers than my father had ordered. But he forgot this kindness I had shown him and planned evil. Outwardly, with his lips, he was speaking fair words while inwardly his heart was designing murder. The Babylonians, who had been loyal to Assyria and faithful vassals of mine, he decieved, speaking lies to them.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=301}}}}\n\n[[File:Ashurbanipal II in a chariot, wall relief, 7th century BC, from Nineveh, the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal depicted in a chariot with a bow, from the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]''.]]\nAccording to the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, Shamash-shum-ukin was very successful in finding allies against the Assyrians. Ashurbanipal identifies three groups which aided his brother, first and foremost there were the [[Chaldea|Chaldeans]], [[Arameans]] and the other peoples of Babylonia, then there were the Elamites and lastly the kings of [[Gutium]], [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] and [[Meluhha]]. This last group of kings might refer to the Medes (as Gutium, Amurru and Meluhha no longer existed at this point) but this is uncertain. Meluhha might have referred to Egypt, which did not aid Shamash-shum-ukin in the war. Shamash-shum-ukin's ambassadors to the Elamites had offered gifts (called \"bribes\" by Ashurbanipal) and their king, Ummanigash, sent an army under the command of Undashe, the son of King Teumman, to aid in the conflict.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=93}}\n\nDespite the seemingly strong alliance of Assyrian enemies, Shamash-shum-ukin's situation looked grim by 650 BC, with Ashubanipal's forces having besieged Sippar, Borsippa, [[Kutha]] and Babylon itself. Having endured starvation and disease over the course of the siege, Babylon finally fell in 648 BC and was plundered by Ashurbanipal. Shamash-shum-ukin committed suicide by [[Self-immolation|setting himself and his family on fire]] in his palace.'''{{Sfn|Johns|1913|p=124\u2013125}}{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}}''' Ashurbanipal describes his victory and his vengeance against those that had supported Shamash-shum-ukin in his inscriptions as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Assur, [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], [[Shamash]], [[Adad]], B\u00eal, [[Nabu|Nab\u00fb]], [[Ishtar]] of Nineveh, the queen of Kidmuri, Ishtar of [[Erbil|Arbela]], [[Ninurta|Urta]], [[Nergal]] and [[Nusku]], who march before me, slaying my foes, cast Shamash-shum-ukin, my hostile brother, who became my enemy, into the burning flames of a conflagration and destroyed him. As for the people who hatched these plans for Shamash-shum-ukin, my hostile brother, and did the evil, but who were afraid of death and valued their lives highly, they did not cast themselves into the fire with Shamash-shum-ukin, their lord. Those of them who fled before the murderous iron dagger, famine, want and flaming fire, and found a refuge, \u2013 the net of the great gods, my lords, which cannot be eluded, brought them low. Not one escaped; not one sinner slipped through my hands, of those whom the gods had counted for my hands.<br>The chariots, coaches, palanquins, his concubines, the goods of his palace, they brought before me. As for those men and their vulgar mouths, who uttered vulgarity against Assur, my god, and plotted evil against me, the prince who fears him, \u2013 I slit their tongues and brought them low. The rest of the people, alive, by the colossi, between which they had cut down Sennacherib, the father of the father who begot me, \u2013 at that time, I cut down those people there, as an offering to his shade. Their dismembered bodies I fed to the dogs, swine, wolves and eagles, to the birds of heaven and the fish of the deep.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=|pp=303\u2013304}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nAfter Shamash-shum-ukin's defeat, Ashurbanipal appointed a new governor of the city, [[Kandalanu]], possibly one of his younger brothers. Kandalanu's realm was the same as Shamash-shum-ukin's with the exception of the city of Nippur, which Ashurbanipal converted into a powerful Assyrian fortress.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} The authority of Kandalanu is likely to have been very limited and few records survive of his reign at Babylon. If he wasn't one of Ashurbanipal's brothers, he was likely a Babylonian noble who had allied with Ashurbanipal in the civil war and had been rewarded with the rank of king. Kandalanu probably lacked any true political and military power, which was instead firmly in the hands of the Assyrians.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=254}}\n\n=== Second Elamite campaign ===\n[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|left|thumb|Ashurbanipal's campaign against Elam is triumphantly recorded in this relief showing the destruction of [[Susa]]. Here, flames rise from the city as Assyrian soldiers topple it with pickaxes and crowbars and carry off the spoils. Now exhibited at the [[Louvre]].]]\nThe Elamites under Ummanigash had joined Shamash-shum-ukin in the war, partly to restore control over the parts of Elam that Ashurbanipal had incorporated into the Assyrian Empire. Ummanigash's army was defeated near the city [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] and as a result, he was deposed in Elam by [[Tammaritu II]], who then ruled as king. Ummanigash fled to the Assyrian court and was granted asylum by Ashurbanipal. Tammaritu II's rule was brief and despite success in some battles alongside the Chaldean warlord Nabu-bel-shumati, he was deposed in another revolt in 649 BC. The new king, [[Indabibi]], had an extremely brief reign and was murdered after Ashurbanipal threatened to invade Elam again because of Elam's role in supporting his enemies.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=51|1984}}\n\nIn Indibibi's stead, [[Humban-haltash III]] became king in Elam. Nabu-bel-shumati continued fighting against Ashurbanipal from outposts within Elam and though Humban-haltash was in favor of giving up the Chaldean rebel, Nabu-bel-shumati had too many supporters in Elam in order for this to go through. As such, Ashurbanipal invaded Elam again in 647 BC and after his short-lived resistance failed, Humban-haltash abandoned his seat at Madaktu and fled into the mountains.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=51|1984}} Hamban-haltash was briefly replaced as king by Tammaritu II, who regained his throne. After the Assyrians had plundered the region of [[Khuzistan]] the Assyrian army returned home and Hamban-haltash returned and retook the throne.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=52|1984}}\n[[File:Feldzug Assurbanipal.JPG|thumb|Assyrian soldiers in a chariot depicted campaigning in [[Elam]], {{Circa|}} 650 BC. Exhibited at the [[Pergamon Museum]].]]\nAshurbanipal returned to Elam in 646 BC and Hamban-haltash again abandoned Madaktu, fleeing first to the city [[Dur-Untash]] and then into the mountains in eastern Elam. Ashurbanipal's forces pursued Hamban-haltash, plundering and razing cities on their way. All major political centers in Elam were crushed and nearby chiefdoms and petty kingdoms who had previously paid tribute to the Elamite king began paying tribute to Ashurbanipal instead. Among these kingdoms was [[Parsua]], possibly a predecessor of the empire that would be founded by the [[Achaemenids]] a century later.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=52|1984}} Parsua's king, Cyrus (possibly the same person as [[Cyrus I]], the grandfather of [[Cyrus the Great]]), had originally sided with the Elamites at the beginning of the campaign, and had thus been forced to supply his son [[Arukku]] as a hostage. Countries which had never previously had contact with the Assyrians, such as a kingdom ruled by a king called \u1e2audimiri which \"extended beyond Elam\", also began paying tribute to the Assyrians for the first time.{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}\n\nOn their way back from their campaign, the Assyrian forces brutally plundered Susa. In Ashurbanipal's triumphant inscriptions detailing the sack it is described in great detail, recounting how the Assyrians desecrated the royal tombs, looted and razed temples, stole the statues of the Elamite gods and sowed salt in the ground. The detail and length of these inscriptions suggest that the event was meant to shock the world through its proclamation of the defeat and eradication of the Elamites as a distinct cultural entity.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|p=52|1984}} Translated into English, a part of Ashurbanipal's inscription of the sack reads:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Susa, the great holy city, abode of their gods, seat of their mysteries, I conquered. I entered its palaces, I opened their treasuries where silver and gold, goods and wealth were amassed... I destroyed the [[ziggurat]] of Susa. I smashed its shining copper horns. I reduced the temples of Elam to naught; their gods and goddesses I scattered to the winds. The tombs of their ancient and recent kings I devastated, I exposed to the sun, and I carried away their bones toward the land of Ashur. I devastated the provinces of Elam and on their lands I sowed salt.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}}}\n\nDespite the thorough and brutal campaign, the Elamites endured as a political entity for some time. Hamban-haltash returned to rule at Madaktu and (belatedly) sent Nabu-bel-shumati to Ashurbanipal, though the Chaldean committed suicide on his way to Nineveh. After Hamban-haltash was deposed, captured and sent to the Assyrians in a revolt shortly thereafter, Assyrian records cease to speak of Elam.{{Sfn|Carter|Stolper|1984|pp=52\u201353}} Ashurbanipal appointed no new governors of the Elamite cities after his campaign and made no attempts to integrate the country as an Assyrian province, instead leaving it open and undefended. The fields were left empty and barren. In the decades following the campaign, the Persians would migrate into the region and rebuild the devastated cities.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}\n\n=== Arabian campaigns ===\n[[File:Assyrian_horsemen_arabs.png|thumb|Drawing of ancient Assyrian artwork depicting Assyrian horsemen pursuing Arabs, from the Russian book ''\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f (\u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0451\u0445 \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445) \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440'' (1904).]]\nAshurbanipal's war against tribes in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] has received relatively little attention from modern historians but is the campaign with the longest account in his own writings. The chronology of these campaigns is uncertain and based on the series of annals Ashurbanipal wrote, although the narrative appears to have been slightly altered over the course of a few years. Ashurbanipal's earliest account of his campaign against the Arabs was created in 649 BC and describes how the king Yauta, son of Hazael, king of the [[Qedarites]] (who had been a tributary of Ashurbanipal's father) revolted against Ashurbanipal, together with another Arabic king called Ammuladdin, and plundered the western lands of the Assyrian Empire. According to Ashurbanipal's account, his army, together with the army King [[Kamas\u1e25alta|Kamas-halta]] of [[Moab]], defeated the rebel forces. Ammuladdin was captured and sent in chains to Assyria and Yauta escaped. In the place of Yauta a loyal Arabian warlord called Abiyate was granted kingship of the Qedarites. This early narrative of the campaign is different from most of Ashurbanipal's other military accounts in that the phrase \"in my ''n''th campaign\" is missing, the king is not described as defeating the enemy in person and the enemy king survives and flees rather than being captured and executed.{{Sfn|Gerardi|1992|pp=67\u201374}} \n\nThe second version of the narrative, composed in 648 BC, also includes that Ashurbanipal defeated Adiya, a queen of the Arabs, and that Yauta fled to another chieftain, Natnu of the [[Nabayyate]], who refused him and remained loyal to Ashurbanipal. Even later versions of the narrative also include mentions of how Yauta also had revolted against Esarhaddon, years prior. These later accounts also explicitly connect Yauta's rebellion to the revolt of Shamash-shum-ukin, placing it at the same time and suggesting that the western raids by the Arabs were prompted by the instability caused by the Assyrian civil war.{{Sfn|Gerardi|1992|pp=79\u201381}}\n\nSometime after the conclusion of this first brief conflict, Ashurbanipal conducted a second campaign against the Arabs. Ashurbanipal's account of this conflict largely concerns the movements of his army through Syria in search of Uiate (conflated with Yauta but possibly a different person) and his Arabian soldiers. According to the account, the Assyrian army marched from Syria to Damascus and then on to Hulhuliti, after which they captured Abiyate and defeated U\u0161\u0161o and Akko. There is no mention of the reason behind Abiyate's rebellion. Furthermore, the Nabayyate, who had aided Ashurbanipal in the previous campaign, are mentioned as being defeated in his second war against the Arabs, without any further information on what had led to the change in their relationship between the two campaigns.{{Sfn|Gerardi|1992|pp=83\u201386}}\n\nThe latest version of the Arabian narrative specifies the two campaigns as composing Ashurbanipal's ninth campaign and further expands upon its contents. In this version, it is specified that the Abiyate who replaced Yauta as king of the Qedarites and the king Ammuladdin had been the chief Arabian generals joining Shamash-shum-ukin's war and that spoils brought back to Assyria from the campaigns caused inflation in Ashurbanipal's empire and famine in Arabia. It is also made clear that Ashurbanipal himself, not just his army, had been personally victorious in the conflict. This later version also states that Uiate was captured and paraded in Nineveh together with prisoners captured during the wars in Elam.{{Sfn|Gerardi|1992|pp=89\u201394}}\n\n=== Succession and chronology ===\n[[File:Delacroix - La Mort de Sardanapale (1827).jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'' by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] (1827), depicting an erroneous and romanticized version of Ashurbanipal known as [[Sardanapalus]], depicted as carelessly watching invaders plunder his city and slaughter his [[harem]], based on the work of ancient Greek writers.|alt=|left]]The end of Ashurbanipal's reign and the beginning of the reign of his successor, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], is shrouded in mystery on account of a lack of available sources. The annals kept by Ashurbanipal, the main sources to his reign, end in 636 BC, possibly because the king was ill. Inscriptions by Ashur-etil-ilani suggest that his father died a natural death, but do not shed light on when exactly this happened.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=121}} Before archaeological excavations and discoveries in the 1800s, Ashurbanipal was known by the name [[Sardanapalus]], based on the writings of the ancient Greeks, and had been misidentified as the last king of Assyria. One popular story of his end was that Sardanapalus had burnt himself, his concubines and servants alive, along with his entire palace at the [[Fall of Nineveh]] in 612 BC (almost twenty years after the actual Ashurbanipal died).{{Sfn|British Museum||p=}}\n[[File:Territorial_organization_of_the_Assyrian_Empire_in_times_of_Ashurbanipal.svg|alt=|thumb|The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] around the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, in dark green the ''pahitu''/''pahutu'' (provinces), in yellow the ''matu'' (subjects kingdoms), in cream color the [[Babylonia|Babylonian vassal kingdom]], the yellow points show other subjects kingdoms, the black points show the ''pahitu''/''pahutu'' (provinces) of Babylon kingdom, and the brown letters provinces that existed previously.]]\nAlthough Ashurbanipal's final year is often repeated as 627 BC,{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} this follows an inscription at Harran made by the mother of the [[Neo-Babylonian]] king [[Nabonidus]] nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of Nippur made in 631 BC.{{Sfn|Reade|1970|p=1}} To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, it is generally agreed that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 BC.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=263}} 631 BC is typically used as the year of his death.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} If Ashurbanipal's reign had ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors Ashur-etil-ilani and [[Sinsharishkun]] in Babylon would have been impossible, as the city was seized by [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC, and never again fell into Assyrian hands.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=246}}\n\nOne possible way to justify a 42-year reign of Ashurbanipal is by assuming there was a coregency between him and Ashur-etil-ilani, but there had never been a coregency in prior Assyrian history and the idea is explicitly contradicted by Ashur-etil-ilani's own inscriptions which describe him as ascending to the throne after the end of his father's reign. It is possible that the 42-year error came about in later Mesopotamian historiography on account of the knowledge that Ashurbanipal ruled concurrently with Babylonian rulers Shamash-shum-ukin and Kandalanu, whose reigns together amount to 42 years, but Kandalanu survived Ashurbanipal by three years, dying in 627 BC.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=250}}\n\nAnother once popular idea, for instance defended by Polish historian [[Stefan Zawadzki|Stefan Zawadski]] in his book ''The Fall of Assyria'' (1988), is that Ashubanipal and Kandalanu were the same person, \"Kandalanu\" simply being the name the king used in Babylon. This is considered unlikely for several reasons. No previous Assyrian king is known to have used an alternate name in Babylon. Inscriptions from Babylonia also show a difference in the lengths of the reigns of Ashurbanipal and Kandalanu; Ashurbanipal's reign is counted from his first full year as king (668 BC) and Kandalanu's is counted from his first full year as king (647 BC). All Assyrian kings who personally ruled Babylon used the title \"King of Babylon\" in their own inscriptions, but it is not used in Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, even those made after 648 BC. Most importantly, Babylonian documents treat Ashurbanipal and Kandalanu as two different people. No contemporary Babylonian sources describe Ashurbanipal as King of Babylon.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=|pp=251\u2013252}}\n\nAshurbanipal was succeeded as king by his son, Ashur-etil-ilani, and he seems to have been inspired by the succession plans of his father as another of his sons, Sinsharishkun, was granted the fortress-city of Nippur and was designated to be the successor of Kandalanu at Babylon once Kandalanu died.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}}\n\n== Family and children ==\n[[File:Ashurbanipal and his queen dining with city of gold emphasized.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal (right) and his queen Libbali-sharrat (left) depicted dining.]]\nThe name of Ashurbanipal's queen was '''Libbali-sharrat'''{{Sfn|Collins|2004|p=1}} (Akkadian: ''Libbali-\u0161arrat''{{Sfn|Kertai|2013|p=118}}). Not much is known of Libbali-sharrat, but she was already married to Ashurbanipal when he became king and might have married him as early as 673 BC, at around the time of the death of Esarhaddon's queen Esharra-hammat.{{Sfn|Kertai|2013|p=119}}\n\nThree of Ashurbanipal's children are known by name:\n\n* '''[[Ashur-etil-ilani]]''' (Akkadian: ''A\u0161\u0161ur-etil-il\u0101ni''){{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=248}} \u2013 son who ruled as king of Assyria 631\u2013627 BC.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=243}}\n* '''[[Sinsharishkun]]''' (Akkadian: ''S\u00een-\u0161ar-i\u0161kun''){{Sfn|Tallqvist|1914|p=201}} \u2013 son who ruled as king of Assyria 627\u2013612 BC.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=243}}\n*'''Ninurta-sharru-usur''' (Akkadian: ''Ninurta-\u0161arru-u\u1e63ur''){{Sfn|Frahm|1999|p=322}} \u2013 son born of a lower wife (i.e., not Libbali-sharrat), seems to have played no political role.{{Sfn|Frahm|1999|p=322}}\n\nThe inscriptions of Sinsharishkun which mention him being selected for the kingship \"from among his equals\" (i.e., brothers) suggests that Ashurbanipal had more sons in addition to Ashur-etil-ilani, Sinsharishkun and Ninurta-sharru-usur.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=255}}\n\nIt is possible that Ashurbanipal's lineage returned to power in Mesopotamia after the fall of Assyria in 612\u2013609 BC. The mother of the last of the Neo-Babylonian kings, Nabonidus ({{reign|556|539}} BC), was from Harran and had Assyrian ancestry. This woman, [[Addagoppe of Harran|Addagoppe]], was according to her own inscriptions born in the 20th year of Ashurbanipal's reign (648 BC, as years were counted from the king's first full year). British scholar [[Stephanie Dalley]] considers it \"almost certain\" that Addagoppe was a daughter of Ashurbanipal on account of her own inscriptions claiming that Nabonidus was of Ashurbanipal's dynastic line.{{Sfn|Dalley|2003|p=177}} American Professor of Biblical Studies Michael B. Dick have refuted this, pointing out that even though Nabonidus did go to some length to revive some old Assyrian symbols (such as wearing a wrapped cloak in his depictions, absent in those of other Neo-Babylonian kings but present in Assyrian art) and attempted to link himself to the [[Sargonid dynasty]], there is \"no evidence whatsoever that Nabonidus was related to the Sargonid Dynasty\".{{Sfn|Dick|2004|p=15}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Library of Ashurbanipal ===\n{{Main|Library of Ashurbanipal}}\n[[File:British Museum Flood Tablet.jpg|thumb|Tablet containing a part of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]].

Most of the collected texts were observations of events and omens, texts detailing the behaviour of certain men and of animals, texts on the movements of celestial objects and so forth. Present in the library were also dictionaries for Sumerian, Akkadian and other languages and many religious texts, such as rituals, fables, prayers and incantations.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}\n\nMost of the traditional Mesopotamian stories and tales known today, such as the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]'' (the Babylonian creation myth), ''[[Erra (god)|Erra]]'', the ''[[Etana|Myth of Etana]]'' and the ''[[Anz\u00fb|Epic of Anzu]]'', only survived until the modern era because they were included in Ashurbanipal's library. The library covered the entire spectrum of Ashurbanipal's literary interests and also included folk tales (such as ''[[Poor Man of Nippur|The Poor Man of Nippur]]'', a predecessor of one of the tales in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''), handbooks and scientific texts.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}\n\nAshurbanipal described the reasoning behind collecting such a vast library, amounting to over 30,000 clay tablets,{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} with these words:\n\n{{Quote| quote = I, Ashurbanipal, [[king of the universe]], on whom the gods have bestowed intelligence, who has acquired penetrating acumen for the most recondite details of scholarly erudition (none of my predecessors having any comprehension of such matters), I have placed these tablets for the future in the library at Nineveh for my life and for the well-being of my soul, to sustain the foundations of my royal name.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}}}\n\nNineveh was destroyed in 612 BC and the Library of Ashurbanipal was buried under the walls of Ashurbanipal's burning palace and lost to history for more than two thousand years. It was unearthed in the 19th century by [[Austen Henry Layard]] and [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and the translations of the contents within it by [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]] brought the ancient Mesopotamian texts to the modern world. Prior to its discovery, there was a widespread notion that the [[Bible]] was the oldest book and a work without precedent, an idea which was decisively disproven with the discovery of the library.{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}\n\n=== Assessment by historians ===\n[[File:Ashurbanipal II, detail of a lion-hunt scene from Nineveh, 7th century BC, the British Museum.jpg|left|thumb|Ashurbanipal depicted in the ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]''.]]\nAt the time of Ashurbanipal's reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was the largest empire the world had ever seen and its capital, Nineveh, at about 120,000 citizens,{{Sfn|Chandler|Fox|p=362|2013}} was probably the largest city on the planet.{{Sfn|British Museum||p=}} During his reign, the Assyrian Empire prospered economically, despite its continuing expansion.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}} He is often regarded as the last great king of Assyria{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}}{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}} and is recognized, alongside his two predecessors Esarhaddon and Sennacherib, as one of the greatest Assyrian kings.{{Sfn|Budge|1880|p=xii}}\n\nAshurbanipal has sometimes been characterized as a zealot. The king rebuilt, repaired and expanded a majority of the major shrines throughout his empire and many of the actions he took during his reign were due to omen reports, something he was very interested in.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}} He appointed two of his younger brothers, [[Ashur-mukin-paleya]] and [[Ashur-etel-shame-erseti-muballissu]], as priests in the cities [[Assur]] and [[Harran]] respectively.''{{Sfn|Novotny|Singletary|2009|p=171}}'' He has also been seen as a patron of the arts due to the many sculptures and reliefs he erected in his palaces at Nineveh, depicting the most important events from his long reign. The style used in these works of art has an \"epic quality\" unlike the artwork produced under his predecessors.{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}\n\nAssessment of Ashurbanipal has not solely been positive. In 639 BC, Ashurbanipal [[Eponym dating system|named the year]] (years were generally named after people in ancient Assyria, often military officials) after his chief musician, Bullu\u1e6du, which Assyriologist Julian E. Reade saw as the move of an \"irresponsible and self-indulgent\" king.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=263}} Though Assyria reached the apex of its power under Ashurbanipal's rule, the empire collapsed quickly after his death. Whether Ashurbanipal is partly to blame for Assyria's downfall is disputed. J. A. Delaunay, author of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' entry on the king writes that the Neo-Assyrian Empire under Ashurbanipal had already began \"exhibiting clear symptoms of impending dislocation and fall\",{{Sfn|Delaunay|1987|pages=805-806}} while [[Donald John Wiseman]], in the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'' article on the king, holds that \"It is no indictment of his rule that his empire fell within two decades after his death; this was due to external pressures rather than to internal strife\".{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}\n\n=== In art and popular culture ===\n[[File:San Francisco Civic Center Historic District 09.jpg|thumb|''[[Ashurbanipal (sculpture)|Ashurbanipal]]'', a bronze sculpture by [[Fred Parhad]] in the [[Civic Center, San Francisco|Civic Center]] of [[San Francisco]].]]\nDepictions of Ashurbanipal in artwork survive from his reign. The ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'', a set of [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] from Ashurbanipal's palace, can be seen at the [[British Museum]] in London. These reliefs depict the king hunting and killing [[Mesopotamian lion|Mesopotamian lions]].{{Sfn|Ashrafian|2011|pp=47\u201349}} The Assyrian king was tasked with protecting his own people, often being referred to as a \"shepherd\". This protection included defending against external enemies and defending citizens from dangerous wild animals. To the Assyrians, the most dangerous animal of all was the lion, used (similarly to foreign powers) as an example of chaos and disorder due to their aggressive nature. To prove themselves worthy of rule and illustrate that they were competent protectors, Assyrian kings engaged in ritual [[Lion hunting|lion hunts]]. Lion-hunting was reserved for Assyrian royalty and was a public event, staged at parks in or near the Assyrian cities.{{Sfn|Introducing the Assyrians||p=}}\n\nAshurbanipal has also been the subject of artwork created in modern times. In 1958, surrealist painter [[Leonora Carrington]] painted ''Assurbanipal Abluting Harpies'', an oil on canvas at the [[Israel Museum]] depicting Ashurbanipal pouring a white substance onto the heads of pigeon-like creatures with human faces.{{Sfn|Assurbanipal Abluting Harpies||p=}} A statue of the king, called ''[[Ashurbanipal (sculpture)|Ashurbanipal]]'', was created by sculptor [[Fred Parhad]] in 1988 and placed on a street near the [[San Francisco City Hall]]. The statue cost $100,000 and was described as the \"first sizable bronze statue of Ashurbanipal\". It was presented to the City of San Francisco as a gift from the [[Assyrian people]] on May 29, 1988, Parhad being of Assyrian descent. Some local Assyrians expressed fears that the statue resembled the legendary Mesopotamian hero [[Gilgamesh]] more than it resembled the actual Ashurbanipal. Parhad defended the statue as representing Ashurbanipal, though explained that he had taken some artistic liberties.{{Sfn|Fernandez|1987|p=}}\n\nAshurbanipal has also made occasional appearances in popular culture in various media. [[Robert E. Howard]] wrote a short story entitled ''The Fire of Asshurbanipal'', first published in the December 1936 issue of ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine, about an \"accursed jewel belonging to a king of long ago, whom the Grecians called Sardanapalus and the Semitic peoples Asshurbanipal\".{{Sfn|Price|2001|pp=99\u2013118}} \"[[The Mesopotamians]]\", a 2007 song by [[They Might Be Giants]], mentions Ashurbanipal alongside Gilgamesh, [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]], and [[Hammurabi]].{{Sfn|Nardo|2012|p=88}} Ashurbanipal was used as the ruler of the Assyrians in the game ''[[Civilization V]]''.{{Sfn|Pitts|2013}}\n\n== Titles ==\n{{See also|Akkadian royal titulary}}\nIn an inscription on a cylinder dated to 648 BC,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=323}} Ashurbanipal uses the following titles:\n\n{{Quote| quote = I am Ashurbanipal, the great king, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, [[king of the four regions of the world]]; offspring of the loins of Esarhaddon, king of the universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, [[king of Sumer and Akkad]]; grandson of Sennacherib, king of the universe, king of Assyria.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=323}}}}\n\nA similar titulature is used on one of Ashurbanipal's many tablets:\n\n{{Quote| quote = I, Ashurbanipal, the great king, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, king of the four regions of the world, son of Esarhaddon, king of the universe, king of Assyria, grandson of Sennacherib, king of the universe, king of Assyria, eternal seed of royalty ...{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=356}}}}\n\nA longer variant is presented on one of Ashurbanipal's building inscriptions in Babylon:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Ashurbanipal, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, king of the four regions of the world, king of kings, unrivaled prince, who, from the Upper to the Lower Sea, holds sway and has brought in submission at his feet all rulers; son of Esarhaddon, the great king, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad; grandson of Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the universe, king of Assyria, am I.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=369}}}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of Assyrian kings]]\n* [[Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibF6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Sin-apla-iddina|title=Southern Mesopotamia in the time of Ashurbanipal|last=Ahmed|first=Sami Said|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|year=2018|isbn=978-3111033587|location=The Hague|pages=|ref=CITEREFAhmed2018}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Ashrafian|first=H.|date=2011|title=An extinct Mesopotamian lion subspecies|journal=Veterinary Heritage|volume=34|issue=2|pages=47\u201349|ref=CITEREFAshrafian2011|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2004-0-25603-8&isbn=9781315011660&format=googlePreviewPdf|title=The History of Esarhaddon|last=Budge|first=Ernest A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-1136373213|location=Oxford|pages=|ref=CITEREFBudge1880|orig-year=1880}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/elamsurveysofpol0000cart|url-access=registration|title=Elam: Surveys of Political History and Archaeology|last=Carter|first=Elizabeth|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|isbn=978-0520099500|location=Los Angeles|pages=|ref=CITEREFCarterStolper1984|last2=Stolper|first2=Matthew W.}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XiGLBQAAQBAJ|title=3000 Years of Urban Growth|last2=Fox|first2=Gerald|last=Chandler|first=Tertius|publisher=Elsevier|year=2013|isbn=978-1483248899|location=New York|pages=|ref=CITEREFChandlerFox2013|orig-year=1974}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Paul|date=2004|title=The Symbolic Landscape of Ashurbanipal|journal=Notes in the History of Art|volume=23|issue=3|pages=1\u20136|ref=CITEREFCollins2004|doi=10.1086/sou.23.3.23206845}}\n*{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.se/books?id=aBg8TqiCZb8C&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=%22daughter+of+Assurbanipal%22&source=bl&ots=Ywpp0AYrVA&sig=ACfU3U2C-75-fyZnMZ4GufpRRrUytzQkqg&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiqxaGGoY_mAhXHtYsKHQFzAkIQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Herodotus and His World: Essays from a Conference in Memory of George Forrest|last=Dalley|first=Stephanie|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0199253746|location=Oxford|pages=|ref=CITEREFDalley2003|chapter=The Hanging Gardens of Babylon?}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia | title = A\u0160\u0160URBANIPAL | last = Delaunay | first = J.

{"title_page": "Mean absolute percentage error", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\nThe '''mean absolute percentage error''' ('''MAPE'''), also known as '''mean absolute percentage deviation''' ('''MAPD'''), is a measure of prediction accuracy of a forecasting method in [[statistics]], for example in [[trend estimation]], also used as a [[loss function]] for regression problems in [[machine learning]]. It usually expresses the accuracy as a ratio defined by the formula:\n\n: <math>\\mbox{M} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^n  \\left|\\frac{A_t-F_t}{A_t}\\right|, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''A''<sub>''t''</sub>}} is the actual value and {{math|''F''<sub>''t''</sub>}} is the forecast value. The MAPE is also sometimes reported as a percentage, which is the above equation multiplied by 100. The difference between {{math|''A''<sub>''t''</sub>}} and {{math|''F''<sub>''t''</sub>}} is divided by the actual value {{math|''A''<sub>''t''</sub>}} again.  The absolute value in this calculation is summed for every forecasted point in time and divided by the number of fitted points&nbsp;{{math|''n''}}. Multiplying by 100% makes it a percentage error.\n\n==MAPE in regression problems==\n\nMean absolute percentage error is commonly used as a loss function for [[Regression analysis|regression problems]] and in model evaluation, because of its very intuitive interpretation in terms of relative error.\n\n===Definition===\n\nConsider a standard regression setting in which the data are fully described by a random pair <math>Z=(X,Y)</math> with values in <math>\\mathbb{R}^d\\times\\mathbb{R}</math>, and {{math|''n''}} i.i.d. copies <math>(X_1, Y_1), ..., (X_n, Y_n)</math> of <math>(X,Y)</math>. Regression models aims at finding a good model for the pair, that is a [[measurable function]] {{math|''g''}} from <math>\\mathbb{R}^d</math> to <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> such that <math>g(X)</math> is close to {{math|''Y''}}.\n\nIn the classical regression setting, the closeness of <math>g(X)</math> to {{math|''Y''}} is measured via the {{math|''L''<sub>2</sub>}} risk, also called the [[mean squared error]] (MSE). In the MAPE regression context,<ref name=\"demyttenaere2016\"/> the closeness of <math>g(X)</math> to {{math|''Y''}} is measured via the MAPE, and the aim of MAPE regressions is to find a model <math>g_{MAPE}</math> such that:\n\n<math>g_{MAPE}(x) = \\arg\\min_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left|\\frac{g(X) - Y}{Y}\\right||X = x\\right]</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> is the class of models considered (e.g. linear models).\n\n'''In practice''' \n\nIn practice <math>g_{MAPE}(x)</math> can be estimated by the [[empirical risk minimization]] strategy, leading to\n\n<math> \\widehat{g}_{MAPE}(x) = \\arg\\min_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left|\\frac{g(X_i) - Y_i}{Y_i}\\right|</math>\n\nFrom a practical point of view, the use of the MAPE as a quality function for regression model is equivalent to doing weighted [[mean absolute error]] (MAE) regression, also known as [[quantile regression]]. This property is trivial since\n\n<math> \\widehat{g}_{MAPE}(x) = \\arg\\min_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega(Y_i) \\left|g(X_i) - Y_i\\right| \\mbox{ with } \\omega(Y_i) = \\left|\\frac{1}{Y_i}\\right|</math>\n\nAs a consequence, the use of the MAPE is very easy in practice, for example using existing libraries for quantile regression allowing weights.\n\n===Consistency===\n\nThe use of the MAPE as a loss function for regression analysis is feasible both on a practical point of view and on a theoretical one, since the existence of an optimal model and the [[consistency (statistics)|consistency]] of the empirical risk minimization can be proved.<ref name=\"demyttenaere2016\">de Myttenaere, B Golden, B Le Grand, F Rossi (2015). \"Mean absolute percentage error for regression models\", Neurocomputing 2016 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02541.pdf archived preprint]</ref>\n\n==Alternative MAPE definitions==\n\nProblems can occur when calculating the MAPE value with a series of small denominators. A singularity problem of the form 'one divided by zero' and/or the creation of very large changes in the Absolute Percentage Error, caused by a small deviation in error, can occur.\n\nAs an alternative, each actual value ({{math|''A''<sub>''t''</sub>}}) of the series in the original formula can be replaced by the average of all actual values ({{math|''\u0100''<sub>''t''</sub>}}) of that series. This alternative is still being used for measuring the performance of models that forecast spot electricity prices.<ref>Jorrit Vander Mynsbrugge (2010). \"Bidding Strategies Using Price Based Unit Commitment in a Deregulated Power Market\", K.U.Leuven</ref> \n\nNote that this is the same as dividing the sum of absolute differences by the sum of actual values, and is sometimes referred to as WAPE (weighted absolute percentage error).\n\n==Issues==\nAlthough the concept of MAPE sounds very simple and convincing, it has major drawbacks in practical application,<ref name=\"tofallis2015\">Tofallis (2015). \"A Better Measure of Relative Prediction Accuracy for Model Selection and Model Estimation\", ''Journal of the Operational Research Society'', 66(8):1352-1362. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2635088 archived preprint]</ref> and there are many studies on shortcomings and misleading results from MAPE.<ref>Hyndman, Rob J., and Anne B. Koehler (2006). \"Another look at measures of forecast accuracy.\" ''International Journal of Forecasting'', 22(4):679-688 [[doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2006.03.001]].</ref><ref name=\"Kim2016\">Kim, Sungil and Heeyoung Kim (2016). \"A new metric of absolute percentage error for intermittent demand forecasts.\" ''International Journal of Forecasting'', 32(3):669-679 [[doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2015.12.003]].</ref>\n*It cannot be used if there are zero values (which sometimes happens for example in demand data) because there would be a division by zero.\n*For forecasts which are too low the percentage error cannot exceed 100%, but for forecasts which are too high there is no upper limit to the percentage error. \n*MAPE puts a heavier penalty on negative errors, <math>A_t < F_t</math> than on positive errors.<ref>Makridakis, Spyros (1993) \"Accuracy measures: theoretical and practical concerns.\" ''International Journal of Forecasting'', 9(4):527-529 [[doi:10.1016/0169-2070(93)90079-3]]</ref> As a consequence, when MAPE is used to compare the accuracy of prediction methods it is biased in that it will systematically select a method whose forecasts are too low.

It usually expresses the accuracy as a ratio defined by the formula:\n\n: <math>\\mbox{M} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^n  \\left|\\frac{A_t-F_t}{A_t}\\right|, </math>\n\nwhere ''A''<sub>''t''</sub> is the actual value and ''F''<sub>''t''</sub> is the forecast value. Note that the MAPE is also sometimes reported as a percentage, which is the above equation multiplied by 100. The difference between ''A''<sub>''t''</sub> and ''F''<sub>''t''</sub> is divided by the actual value ''A''<sub>''t''</sub> again.  The absolute value in this calculation is summed for every forecasted point in time and divided by the number of fitted points&nbsp;''n''. Multiplying by 100% makes it a percentage error.\n\n==MAPE Regressions==\n\nMean absolute percentage error is commonly used as a loss function for regression problems and in model evaluation, because of its very intuitive interpretation in terms of relative error.\n\n'''Definition'''\n\nConsider a standard regression setting in which the data are fully described by a random pair <math>Z=(X,Y)</math> with values in <math>\\mathbb{R}^d\\times\\mathbb{R}</math>, and n i.i.d. copies <math>(X_1, Y_1), ..., (X_n, Y_n)</math> of <math>(X,Y)</math>. Regression models aims at finding a good model for the pair, that is a [[measurable function]] <math>g</math> from <math>\\mathbb{R}^d</math> to <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> such that <math>g(X)</math> is \u201cclose to\u201d <math>Y</math> . \n\nIn the classical regression setting, the closeness of <math>g(X)</math> to <math>Y</math> is measured via the L2 risk, also called the [[Mean squared error]] (MSE). In the MAPE regression context<ref name=\"demyttenaere2016\"/>, the closeness of <math>g(X)</math> to <math>Y</math> is measured via the MAPE, and the aim of MAPE regressions is to find a model <math>g_{MAPE}</math> such that:\n\n<math>g_{MAPE}(x) = \\arg\\min_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\left|\\frac{g(X) - Y}{Y}\\right||X = x\\right]</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> is the class of models considered (e.g. linear models).\n\n'''In practice''' \n\nIn practice <math>g_{MAPE}(x)</math> can be estimated by the Empirical Risk Minimization strategy, leading to\n\n<math> \\widehat{g}_{MAPE}(x) = \\arg\\min_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left|\\frac{g(X_i) - Y_i}{Y_i}\\right|</math>\n\nFrom a practical point of view, the use of the MAPE as a quality function for regression model is equivalent to doing weighted [[Mean absolute error]] (MAE) regression, also known as [[quantile regression]]. This property is trivial since\n\n<math> \\widehat{g}_{MAPE}(x) = \\arg\\min_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega(Y_i) \\left|g(X_i) - Y_i\\right| \\mbox{ with } \\omega(Y_i) = \\left|\\frac{1}{Y_i}\\right|</math>\n\nAs a consequence, the use of the MAPE is very easy in practice, for example using existing libraries for quantile regression allowing weights.\n\n'''Consistency''' \n\nThe use of the MAPE as a loss function for [[Regression analysis]] is feasible both on a practical point of view and on a theoretical one, since the existence of an optimal model and the [[consistency]] of the [[Empirical risk minimization]] can be proved <ref name=\"demyttenaere2016\">de Myttenaere, B Golden, B Le Grand, F Rossi (2015). \"Mean absolute percentage error for regression models\", Neurocomputing 2016 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02541.pdf archived preprint]</ref>.\n\n==Alternative MAPE definitions==\n\nProblems can occur when calculating the MAPE value with a series of small denominators. A singularity problem of the form 'one divided by zero' and/or the creation of very large changes in the Absolute Percentage Error, caused by a small deviation in error, can occur.\n\nAs an alternative, each actual value (A<sub>t</sub>) of the series in the original formula can be replaced by the average of all actual values (\u0100<sub>t</sub>) of that series. This alternative is still being used for measuring the performance of models that forecast spot electricity prices.<ref>Jorrit Vander Mynsbrugge (2010). \"Bidding Strategies Using Price Based Unit Commitment in a Deregulated Power Market\", K.U.Leuven</ref> \n\nNote that this is the same as dividing the sum of absolute differences by the sum of actual values, and is sometimes referred to as WAPE (weighted absolute percentage error).\n\n==Issues==\nAlthough the concept of MAPE sounds very simple and convincing, it has major drawbacks in practical application <ref name=\"tofallis2015\">Tofallis (2015). \"A Better Measure of Relative Prediction Accuracy for Model Selection and Model Estimation\", ''Journal of the Operational Research Society'', 66(8):1352-1362. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2635088 archived preprint]</ref>, and there are many studies on shortcomings and misleading results from MAPE.<ref>Hyndman, Rob J., and Anne B. Koehler (2006). \"Another look at measures of forecast accuracy.\" ''International Journal of Forecasting'', 22(4):679-688 [[doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2006.03.001]].</ref><ref name=\"Kim2016\">Kim, Sungil and Heeyoung Kim (2016). \"A new metric of absolute percentage error for intermittent demand forecasts.\" ''International Journal of Forecasting'', 32(3):669-679 [[doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2015.12.003]].</ref>\n*It cannot be used if there are zero values (which sometimes happens for example in demand data) because there would be a division by zero.\n*For forecasts which are too low the percentage error cannot exceed 100%, but for forecasts which are too high there is no upper limit to the percentage error. \n*MAPE puts a heavier penalty on negative errors, <math>A_t < F_t</math> than on positive errors.<ref>Makridakis, Spyros (1993) \"Accuracy measures: theoretical and practical concerns.\" ''International Journal of Forecasting'', 9(4):527-529 [[doi:10.1016/0169-2070(93)90079-3]]</ref>. As a consequence, when MAPE is used to compare the accuracy of prediction methods it is biased in that it will systematically select a method whose forecasts are too low. This little-known but serious issue can be overcome by using an accuracy measure based on the logarithm of the accuracy ratio (the ratio of the predicted to actual value), given by <math>\\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{predicted}}{\\text{actual}}\\right) </math>.

The station airs an [[Alternative rock]] music format branded as \"FM 102.1\".   Its studios are located in [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|Menomonee Falls]] and the transmitter site is in Milwaukee's North Side at Lincoln Park.\n\nThe station is owned by the estate of former [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packer]] [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]] and his company, All-Pro Broadcasting. All-Pro has owned the station since 1979. WLUM is run as a partnership with co-owned [[WZTI]] and Shamrock Broadcasting's [[WLDB]] as a group called the Milwaukee Radio Alliance.\n\n==History==\nThis frequency is one of the oldest FM stations in Milwaukee. The owner of the [[Journal Communications|Milwaukee Journal]] was an early pioneer of FM broadcasting. Experimental station '''W9XAO''' went on the air in early 1940. By 1942, the station had become '''W55M''', with programming separate from sister AM station [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] and with its own 50&nbsp;kW transmitter site in [[Richfield, Washington County, Wisconsin|Richfield]] northwest of the city. The station made the transition to the 88-108&nbsp;Mc. band after the war (at 102.1 FM) but struggled for many years, especially as the company had begun focusing on their [[WTMJ-TV|new television station]]. WTMJ-FM signed off the air in 1950, but later returned to the air at [[WKTI|94.5 FM]] in 1959 from WTMJ-TV's Radio City tower to more centrally serve the market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/sites/2006/site-060324.html|title=A selection from a decade of visits to tower and studio sites in the Northeast and beyond|website=www.fybush.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}</ref>\n\n===WAWA-FM===\n'''WMKE''' (102.1 FM) launched in September 1960, broadcasting from studios located on North Avenue in Milwaukee with a format consisting primarily of [[Broadway musicals|Broadway show tunes]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QgEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1971-03-13|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> The owners boasted that they were the nation's first \"all-tape radio station\", meaning that all programming would originate from [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape]] or other tape formats, rather than [[phonograph records]], as they believed tape delivered higher quality.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSEEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1961-06-19|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe station was later sold and became '''WAWA-FM''' in 1964. The new format featured black [[gospel music]] and also simulcast the [[rhythm and blues]] format of then-sister station [[WAWA (defunct)|WAWA (1590 AM)]] throughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s.<ref>[http://hitsjustkeeponcomin.blogspot.com/2006/12/top-5-steppin-up-in-class.html The Hits Just Keep On Comin': Top 5: Steppin' Up in Class<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nFormer [[Green Bay Packers|Packer]] legend [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]] purchased and split the programming of the two stations on February 14, 1979, switching WAWA-FM to '''WLUM''' (short for '''W'''e '''L'''ove Yo'''U''' '''M'''ilwaukee!), and giving 102.1 FM its own distinct format focusing on [[Disco|disco music]].<ref>[http://www.1290wmcs.com/wmcs_history.shtml 1290 WMCS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProEngine.php?sCurrentService=FM&tabSearchType=Appl&sAppIDNumber=1134968|title=FCCInfo Results|last=Inc.|first=Cavell, Mertz & Associates|website=www.fccinfo.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}</ref> At the time that WAWA-FM became WLUM, they also became the second station in Milwaukee to adopt the Disco format, as [[WMYX|WNUW]] had already beat them to it in October 1978, even though their success would be short lived by August 1979.\n\nThe daytime-only 1590 AM, still WAWA, later picked up the WLUM call letters. The AM station was long hampered by a weak signal, and when All Pro Broadcasting purchased stronger station WMVP (1290 AM), the format and programming moved there. As a result, 1590 AM went dark in 1988, and its broadcast license turned in to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].\n\n===The \"Hot 102\" era===\nWLUM has gone through many changes and tweaks over the years since its debut in 1979. In all incarnations since, they have carried the WLUM [[call sign]]. In the beginning, WLUM played [[Disco]] and [[Soul music|Soul]] hits, though a different format than its AM sister station. In 1982, the station began adding more [[Urban contemporary|Urban]] music, and by the summer of 1983, the station's format morphed into a [[Rhythmic Contemporary Hit Radio|Rhythmic Contemporary Hits]] presentation with the brandings \"WLUM FM 102\", \"WLUM 102 Milwaukee's Hot FM\", \"Club 102 WLUM\", \"Power 102 WLUM\", \"WLUM 102 FM\", and then following later as \"Hot 102 WLUM\" as they aired a mix of dance music (including Freestyle, House and Club Imports) and [[Mainstream Top 40|Top 40]] hits (including Rock and Modern/Alternative tracks). By 1989, WLUM was featuring shows like \"[[Casey's Top 40]]\" and \"[[American Dance Traxx]]\" as it began to shift further towards a Dance-leaning direction that was loosely patterned after [[KPWR|Power 106]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] under the guidance of veteran Rhythmic PD and future consultant Rick Thomas before moving on to launch [[XHITZ-FM|XHITZ]]/[[San Diego, California|San Diego]]'s Rhythmic format in April 1990. It was also during this period that [[Bubba the Love Sponge]] briefly did an airshift at Hot 102.\n\nBy late 1991, Hot 102 evolved into a straightforward [[Contemporary Hit Radio|CHR]] presentation. More [[hip-hop]] was added to the playlist by the following year, to better compete with upstart rival [[WKKV-FM|V100.7]] for the urban audience. But by late 1993, it began shifting back to a Dance-leaning direction, billing themselves as \"Hot 102 WLUM, Milwaukee's Party Station\". This lasted until the Summer of 1994, when it shifted back to mainstream Top 40.\n\n===\"102ONE\" and various rock incarnations===\nBy 1994, WLUM began tweaking their on-air presentation. Hip-hop was slowly being phased out and more [[modern rock]] was added to the playlist, due to Davis' desire to distance his station from the violent image of most rap and hip-hop music, after finding out that the station had begun to carry a nightly hour of uncensored music after the FCC's \"[[Watershed (broadcasting)#United States|safe harbor]]\" regulations were not in effect (a record homicide count in Milwaukee and several area violent crimes also played into the re-shift).<ref>[http://djfreshg.blogspot.com/2009/05/hot-102-unedited-1993.html \"Hot 102:Unedited (1993)\"] DJ Ernie's Blog (posted May 1, 2009)</ref> This began to occur in earnest on December 1, 1993, when [[Wauwatosa West High School]] assistant principal Dale Breitlow was murdered by a former student, and the station immediately pulled [[Dr. Dre]]'s \"[[Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')|Dre Day]]\" and [[Eazy-E]]'s \"[[Real Muthaphuckkin G's|Real Compton City G's]]\" in reaction, dropping their usual music and allowing those affected to call-in about how the shooting affected them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=jvrRlaHg2sAC&dat=19931202&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Station bans 2 violent rap songs, hosts call-in session|author=Staff report|date=2 December 1993|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> The modern rock music was well received by listeners, and by October of that year, the station adopted modern rock full-time, as \"New Rock 102ONE\".\n\nOver the years, the format underwent much tweaking. After adding more [[classic rock]] tracks to the playlist, the station began a brief run with an [[adult album alternative]] format on June 23, 1998.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-06-26.pdf</ref> The move was unsuccessful, so in December, WLUM switched to [[active rock|hard rock]] with the [[radio syndication|syndicated]] [[Mancow Muller]] in the morning. They initially avoided much of the then-popular [[nu metal]] music that WLZR played, but added a great deal to the playlist by 2001. Nonetheless, they were consistently a distant second to market leader [[WHQG|WLZR]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=jvrRlaHg2sAC&dat=19931202&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Station bans 2 violent rap songs, hosts call-in session|author=Staff report|date=2 December 1993|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]|page=A19|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===\"Independent. Alternative. Radio.\"===\nAs a straight-ahead rock station, WLUM was consistently trounced by WLZR and experienced some of its lowest ratings levels ever, with the bottom coming after the [[September 11 attacks]], which caused many rock stations to shift quickly from hard rock tracks inappropriate for play in the aftermath and change away from aggressive formats. In March 2002, WLUM began making more changes. Mancow's morning show was dropped,<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=24922 JS Online: Chicago jock 'Mancow' ends three-year run<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> along with most of the hard rock music on the playlist, and modern rock music returned to the playlist. By September, the station was once again a full-time reporter to alternative rock airplay charts for radio industry trade magazines. The station still experienced low ratings, as it worked to shake its male-oriented hard rock image. The station made heavy use of consultants who crafted a rather tight playlist. In March 2003, the [[Indianapolis]]-based ''[[Bob and Tom]]'' was added in morning drive to compete against ''Bob & Brian'' up the dial on WLZR, but its older target audience was wholly incompatible for the rest of WLUM's younger-skewing broadcast day.\n\nThe ''Bob and Tom'' agreement ran out in 2005, and a locally oriented morning show, \"Kramp and Adler\", debuted on St. Patrick's Day. This was a sign of more changes to come. On July 10, 2006, WLUM began [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] as \"Quick 102\" and started playing five second song clips back-to-back. At the same time, via on-air promos, they poked fun at themselves and their many failed on-air tweaks and changes over the years. At 5:00 PM the next day, the modern rock format was relaunched with a new programming and on-air staff in place. The station admitted past mistakes, then announced their \"independence\", stating they were now free from corporate practices and radio consultants, and pledged a stronger dedication to their listeners and the local community. As part of the new direction, Program Director Jacent Jackson rolled out a modified [[alternative rock]] format with a more diverse playlist, featuring, among other things, more [[indie rock]]. The first song after the relaunch was \"[[Guerrilla Radio]]\" by [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Jackson also added new DJs to the airstaff such as Michelle Rutkowski from [[WKQX (FM)|WKQX]] in [[Chicago]], and changed the name of the station to \"FM 102.1\" with the slogan, 'Independent. Alternative. Radio.' The station also removed their last remaining [[Radio syndication|syndicated]] show, [[Loveline]], vowing to be 100% local in their on-air presentation. Later, the station sponsored a contest to name a new alternative rock festival on the [[Summerfest]] grounds that took place in June 2010. It became known as the \"Verge Music Festival\".\n\nCurrent specialty shows consist of \"Smells Like the '90s Lunch\", and \"Indie Soundcheck\" with Ryan Miller.  Current full-time line-up includes, Jacent Jackson, Michelle Rutkowski, Ian McCain, and John Schroeder.  Current part-time line-up includes Nate Imig, Jack Strebel, Dan Gonzalez, and Mike Ruby.\n\n===Slogans and Timeline===\n*1960-1964: [[Adult standards]], [[Broadway Musicals|Showtunes]] (as '''WMKE''')\n*1964-1979: [[Rhythm and Blues]], [[Gospel Music|Gospel]], [[Jazz]] (as '''WAWA-FM''')\n*1979-1982: \"WLUM Stereo 102, The Station With A Heart\" ([[Jazz]]/[[Disco]]/[[Soul music|Soul]])\n*1982-1983: \"LOVE 102 WLUM Stereo\" ([[Urban Contemporary]])\n*1983-1988: \"WLUM FM 102, Milwaukee's Hot FM\" ([[Rhythmic Top 40|CHUrban]])\n*1988-1991: \"More Music, Better Variety, WLUM Power 102 FM\" ([[Rhythmic Top 40|CHUrban]])\n*1991-1992: \"The All New Hot 102 WLUM\" ([[Contemporary Hit Radio|CHR]])\n*1992-1994: \"Hot 102 WLUM\" ([[Rhythmic Top 40|CHUrban]])\n*Mid-1994: \"Hot 102 WLUM, Milwaukee's Party Station\" ([[Contemporary Hit Radio|CHR]])\n*September 1994-June 1998: \"New Rock 102ONE\" ([[Modern Rock]])\n*June 1998-December 1998: \"102ONE WLUM\" (\"Great Rock, Real Variety\") ([[Adult Album Alternative]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newrock.com/ |title=WELCOME TO WLUM ONLINE |date=1998-12-12 |access-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981212031354/http://www.newrock.com/ |archivedate=December 12, 1998 }}</ref>\n*December 1998 - August 2001: \"ROCK 102ONE\" ([[Album-oriented rock]])\n*August 2001 - June 2002: \"ROCK 102ONE\" ([[Active Rock]])\n*June 2002 to April 2005: \"ROCK 102ONE\" (\"Milwaukee's Rock Alternative\") ([[alternative rock]])\n*April 2005 - July 10, 2006: \"102ONE\" (\"Milwaukee's Alternative Station\") ([[alternative rock]])\n*July 11, 2006 \u2013 present:  \"FM 102.1\" (\"Independent.

The station airs an [[Alternative rock]] music format branded as \"FM 102.1\".   Its studios are located in [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|Menomonee Falls]] and the transmitter site is in Milwaukee's North Side at Lincoln Park.\n\nThe station is owned by the estate of former [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packer]] [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]] and his company, All-Pro Broadcasting. All-Pro has owned the station since 1979. WLUM is run as a partnership with co-owned [[WZTI]] and Shamrock Broadcasting's [[WLDB]] as a group called the Milwaukee Radio Alliance.\n\n==History==\nThis frequency is one of the oldest FM stations in Milwaukee. The owner of the [[Journal Communications|Milwaukee Journal]] was an early pioneer of FM broadcasting. Experimental station '''W9XAO''' went on the air in early 1940. By 1942, the station had become '''W55M''', with programming separate from sister AM station [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] and with its own 50&nbsp;kW transmitter site in [[Richfield, Washington County, Wisconsin|Richfield]] northwest of the city. The station made the transition to the 88-108&nbsp;Mc. band after the war (at 102.1 FM) but struggled for many years, especially as the company had begun focusing on their [[WTMJ-TV|new television station]]. WTMJ-FM signed off the air in 1950, but later returned to the air at [[WKTI|94.5 FM]] in 1959 from WTMJ-TV's Radio City tower to more centrally serve the market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/sites/2006/site-060324.html|title=A selection from a decade of visits to tower and studio sites in the Northeast and beyond|website=www.fybush.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}</ref>\n\n===WAWA-FM===\n'''WMKE''' (102.1 FM) launched in September 1960, broadcasting from studios located on North Avenue in Milwaukee with a format consisting primarily of [[Broadway musicals|Broadway show tunes]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QgEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1971-03-13|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> The owners boasted that they were the nation's first \"all-tape radio station\", meaning that all programming would originate from [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape]] or other tape formats, rather than [[phonograph records]], as they believed tape delivered higher quality.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSEEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1961-06-19|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe station was later sold and became '''WAWA-FM''' in 1964. The new format featured black [[gospel music]] and also simulcast the [[rhythm and blues]] format of then-sister station [[WAWA (defunct)|WAWA (1590 AM)]] throughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s.<ref>[http://hitsjustkeeponcomin.blogspot.com/2006/12/top-5-steppin-up-in-class.html The Hits Just Keep On Comin': Top 5: Steppin' Up in Class<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nFormer [[Green Bay Packers|Packer]] legend [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]] purchased and split the programming of the two stations on February 14, 1979, switching WAWA-FM to '''WLUM''' (short for '''W'''e '''L'''ove Yo'''U''' '''M'''ilwaukee!), and giving 102.1 FM its own distinct format focusing on [[Disco|disco music]].<ref>[http://www.1290wmcs.com/wmcs_history.shtml 1290 WMCS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProEngine.php?sCurrentService=FM&tabSearchType=Appl&sAppIDNumber=1134968|title=FCCInfo Results|last=Inc.|first=Cavell, Mertz & Associates|website=www.fccinfo.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}</ref> At the time that WAWA-FM became WLUM, they also became the second station in Milwaukee to adopt the Disco format, as [[WMYX|WNUW]] had already beat them to it in October 1978, even though their success would be short lived by August 1979.\n\nThe daytime-only 1590 AM, still WAWA, later picked up the WLUM call letters. The AM station was long hampered by a weak signal, and when All Pro Broadcasting purchased stronger station WMVP (1290 AM), the format and programming moved there. As a result, 1590 AM went dark in 1988, and its broadcast license turned in to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].\n\n===The \"Hot 102\" era===\nWLUM has gone through many changes and tweaks over the years since its debut in 1979. In all incarnations since, they have carried the WLUM [[call sign]]. In the beginning, WLUM played [[Disco]] and [[Soul Music|Soul]] hits, though a different format than its AM sister station. In 1982, the station began adding more [[Urban contemporary|Urban]] music, and by the summer of 1983, the station's format morphed into a [[Rhythmic Contemporary Hit Radio|Rhythmic Contemporary Hits]] presentation with the brandings \"WLUM FM 102\", \"WLUM 102 Milwaukee's Hot FM\", \"Club 102 WLUM\", \"Power 102 WLUM\", \"WLUM 102 FM\", and then following later as \"Hot 102 WLUM\" as they aired a mix of dance music (including Freestyle, House and Club Imports) and [[Mainstream Top 40|Top 40]] hits (including Rock and Modern/Alternative tracks). By 1989, WLUM was featuring shows like \"[[Casey's Top 40]]\" and \"[[American Dance Traxx]]\" as it began to shift further towards a Dance-leaning direction that was loosely patterned after [[KPWR|Power 106]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] under the guidance of veteran Rhythmic PD and future consultant Rick Thomas before moving on to launch [[XHITZ-FM|XHITZ]]/[[San Diego, California|San Diego]]'s Rhythmic format in April 1990. It was also during this period that [[Bubba the Love Sponge]] briefly did an airshift at Hot 102.\n\nBy late 1991, Hot 102 evolved into a straightforward [[Contemporary Hit Radio|CHR]] presentation. More [[hip-hop]] was added to the playlist by the following year, to better compete with upstart rival [[WKKV-FM|V100.7]] for the urban audience. But by late 1993, it began shifting back to a Dance-leaning direction, billing themselves as \"Hot 102 WLUM, Milwaukee's Party Station\". This lasted until the Summer of 1994, when it shifted back to mainstream Top 40.\n\n===\"102ONE\" and various rock incarnations===\nBy 1994, WLUM began tweaking their on-air presentation. Hip-hop was slowly being phased out and more [[modern rock]] was added to the playlist, due to Davis' desire to distance his station from the violent image of most rap and hip-hop music, after finding out that the station had begun to carry a nightly hour of uncensored music after the FCC's \"[[Watershed (broadcasting)#United States|safe harbor]]\" regulations were not in effect (a record homicide count in Milwaukee and several area violent crimes also played into the re-shift).<ref>[http://djfreshg.blogspot.com/2009/05/hot-102-unedited-1993.html \"Hot 102:Unedited (1993)\"] DJ Ernie's Blog (posted May 1, 2009)</ref> This began to occur in earnest on December 1, 1993, when [[Wauwatosa West High School]] assistant principal Dale Breitlow was murdered by a former student, and the station immediately pulled [[Dr. Dre]]'s \"[[Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')|Dre Day]]\" and [[Eazy-E]]'s \"[[Real Muthaphuckkin G's|Real Compton City G's]]\" in reaction, dropping their usual music and allowing those affected to call-in about how the shooting affected them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=jvrRlaHg2sAC&dat=19931202&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Station bans 2 violent rap songs, hosts call-in session|author=Staff report|date=2 December 1993|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref> The modern rock music was well received by listeners, and by October of that year, the station adopted modern rock full-time, as \"New Rock 102ONE\".\n\nOver the years, the format underwent much tweaking. After adding more [[classic rock]] tracks to the playlist, the station began a brief run with an [[adult album alternative]] format on June 23, 1998.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-06-26.pdf</ref> The move was unsuccessful, so in December, WLUM switched to [[active rock|hard rock]] with the [[radio syndication|syndicated]] [[Mancow Muller]] in the morning. They initially avoided much of the then-popular [[nu metal]] music that WLZR played, but added a great deal to the playlist by 2001. Nonetheless, they were consistently a distant second to market leader [[WHQG|WLZR]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=jvrRlaHg2sAC&dat=19931202&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Station bans 2 violent rap songs, hosts call-in session|author=Staff report|date=2 December 1993|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]]|page=A19|accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===\"Independent. Alternative. Radio.\"===\nAs a straight-ahead rock station, WLUM was consistently trounced by WLZR and experienced some of its lowest ratings levels ever, with the bottom coming after the [[September 11 attacks]], which caused many rock stations to shift quickly from hard rock tracks inappropriate for play in the aftermath and change away from aggressive formats. In March 2002, WLUM began making more changes. Mancow's morning show was dropped,<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=24922 JS Online: Chicago jock 'Mancow' ends three-year run<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> along with most of the hard rock music on the playlist, and modern rock music returned to the playlist. By September, the station was once again a full-time reporter to alternative rock airplay charts for radio industry trade magazines. The station still experienced low ratings, as it worked to shake its male-oriented hard rock image. The station made heavy use of consultants who crafted a rather tight playlist. In March 2003, the [[Indianapolis]]-based ''[[Bob and Tom]]'' was added in morning drive to compete against ''Bob & Brian'' up the dial on WLZR, but its older target audience was wholly incompatible for the rest of WLUM's younger-skewing broadcast day.\n\nThe ''Bob and Tom'' agreement ran out in 2005, and a locally oriented morning show, \"Kramp and Adler\", debuted on St. Patrick's Day. This was a sign of more changes to come. On July 10, 2006, WLUM began [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] as \"Quick 102\" and started playing five second song clips back-to-back. At the same time, via on-air promos, they poked fun at themselves and their many failed on-air tweaks and changes over the years. At 5:00 PM the next day, the modern rock format was relaunched with a new programming and on-air staff in place. The station admitted past mistakes, then announced their \"independence\", stating they were now free from corporate practices and radio consultants, and pledged a stronger dedication to their listeners and the local community. As part of the new direction, Program Director Jacent Jackson rolled out a modified [[alternative rock]] format with a more diverse playlist, featuring, among other things, more [[indie rock]]. The first song after the relaunch was \"[[Guerrilla Radio]]\" by [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Jackson also added new DJs to the airstaff such as Michelle Rutkowski from [[WKQX (FM)|WKQX]] in [[Chicago]], and changed the name of the station to \"FM 102.1\" with the slogan, 'Independent. Alternative. Radio.' The station also removed their last remaining [[Radio syndication|syndicated]] show, [[Loveline]], vowing to be 100% local in their on-air presentation. Later, the station sponsored a contest to name a new alternative rock festival on the [[Summerfest]] grounds that took place in June 2010. It became known as the \"Verge Music Festival\".\n\nCurrent specialty shows consist of \"Smells Like the '90s Lunch\", and \"Indie Soundcheck\" with Ryan Miller.  Current full-time line-up includes, Jacent Jackson, Michelle Rutkowski, Ian McCain, and John Schroeder.  Current part-time line-up includes Nate Imig, Jack Strebel, Dan Gonzalez, and Mike Ruby.\n\n===Slogans and Timeline===\n*1960-1964: [[Adult standards]], [[Broadway Musicals|Showtunes]] (as '''WMKE''')\n*1964-1979: [[Rhythm and Blues]], [[Gospel Music|Gospel]], [[Jazz]] (as '''WAWA-FM''')\n*1979-1982: \"WLUM Stereo 102, The Station With A Heart\" ([[Jazz]]/[[Disco]]/[[Soul Music|Soul]])\n*1982-1983: \"LOVE 102 WLUM Stereo\" ([[Urban Contemporary]])\n*1983-1988: \"WLUM FM 102, Milwaukee's Hot FM\" ([[Rhythmic Top 40|CHUrban]])\n*1988-1991: \"More Music, Better Variety, WLUM Power 102 FM\" ([[Rhythmic Top 40|CHUrban]])\n*1991-1992: \"The All New Hot 102 WLUM\" ([[Contemporary Hit Radio|CHR]])\n*1992-1994: \"Hot 102 WLUM\" ([[Rhythmic Top 40|CHUrban]])\n*Mid-1994: \"Hot 102 WLUM, Milwaukee's Party Station\" ([[Contemporary Hit Radio|CHR]])\n*September 1994-June 1998: \"New Rock 102ONE\" ([[Modern Rock]])\n*June 1998-December 1998: \"102ONE WLUM\" (\"Great Rock, Real Variety\") ([[Adult Album Alternative]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newrock.com/ |title=WELCOME TO WLUM ONLINE |date=1998-12-12 |access-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981212031354/http://www.newrock.com/ |archivedate=December 12, 1998 }}</ref>\n*December 1998 - August 2001: \"ROCK 102ONE\" ([[Album-oriented rock]])\n*August 2001 - June 2002: \"ROCK 102ONE\" ([[Active Rock]])\n*June 2002 to April 2005: \"ROCK 102ONE\" (\"Milwaukee's Rock Alternative\") ([[alternative rock]])\n*April 2005 - July 10, 2006: \"102ONE\" (\"Milwaukee's Alternative Station\") ([[alternative rock]])\n*July 11, 2006 \u2013 present:  \"FM 102.1\" (\"Independent.
