It is thought that the WRN helicase activity is important not only for DNA repair and recombination, but also for maintaining telomere length and stability. Thus, WRN helicase is important for preventing catastrophic telomere loss during DNA replication.<ref name=Crabbe>{{cite journal | vauthors = Crabbe L, Jauch A, Naeger CM, Holtgreve-Grez H, Karlseder J | title = Telomere dysfunction as a cause of genomic instability in Werner syndrome | journal = Proc.

While evidence shows that telomere dysfunction is consistent with the premature aging in WS, it has yet to be determined if it is the actual cause of the genomic instability observed in cells and the high rate of cancer in WS patients.<ref name=Crabbe />\n\nWithout the WRN protein, the interwoven pathways of DNA repair and telomere maintenance fail to suppress cancer and the aging symptoms seen in patients with WS. Events such as rapid telomere shortening cause Werner syndrome cells to exhibit low responses to overall cellular stress. In addition to telomere dysfunction, over-expression of [[oncogenes]] and [[oxidation]] can induce this type of response. High stress causes a synergistic effect, where WS cells become even more sensitive to agents that increase cell stress and agents that damage DNA. As a result, WS cells show a drastic reduction in replicative lifespan and enter into a stage of aging prematurely. The accumulation of these damaged cells due to telomere shortening over many years may be indicative of why Werner syndrome symptoms only appear after an individual is about twenty years old.<ref name=Multani>{{cite journal | vauthors = Multani AS, Chang S | title = WRN at telomeres: implications for aging and cancer | journal = J.

Topical treatments can be used for minor ulcers, but are not effective in preventing new ulcers from occurring. In the most severe cases, surgery may be required to implant a [[skin graft]] or amputate a limb if necessary. Diseases commonly associated with Werner syndrome such as diabetes and cancer are treated in generally the same ways as they would be for a non-Werner syndrome individual.

This drug targets the [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38]] signaling pathway, which may become activated as a result of genomic instability and stalled replication forks that are characteristic mutations in WS. This activation of p38 may play a role in the onset of premature cell aging, skin aging, cataracts, and graying of the hair. The p38 pathway has also been implicated in the anti-inflammatory response that causes atherosclerosis, diabetes, and osteoporosis, all of which are associated with Werner's syndrome. This drug has shown to revert the aged characteristics of young WS cells to those seen in normal, young cells and improve the lifespan of WS cells ''in vitro''.

As a German [[ophthalmologist]], Werner described several progeria-like features and juvenile [[cataract]]s in many of his patients. He noticed these symptoms particularly in a family with four sequential children who all showed the characteristics of the syndrome at around the same age. He assumed the cause to be genetic, though most of his evidence was clinical. Between 1934 and 1941, two internists from New York, Oppenheimer and Kugel, coined the term \"Werner Syndrome,\" igniting a wave of interest and research on the disease.<ref name=Goto>{{cite book|last=Goto|first=Makoto|title=Clinical Aspects of Werner's Syndrome: Its Natural History and the Genetics of the Disease|year=2004|publisher=Eurekah.com and Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishing|page=1}}</ref>\nDuring that time, Agatson and Gartner suggested a possible link between Werner's syndrome and cancer. However, it was not until 1966 that there was a general consensus on the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for the syndrome. By 1981, [[geneticist]]s had located the WRN gene on chromosome 8, leading to its cloning in 1996. This cloning of the WRN was significant because it revealed the predicted WRN protein was made from a family of DNA [[helicase]]s.<ref name=\"Goto\"/> Prior to 1996, Werner syndrome was thought to be a model for accelerated aging. Since the discovery of the gene, it has become clear that the premature aging displayed in Werner syndrome is not the same, on a cellular level, as normal aging. The role of WRN in DNA repair and its exonuclease and helicase activities have been the subject of many studies in recent years.<ref name=\"L. Chen\" />\n\nSince the initial discovery in 1904, several other cases of Werner syndrome have been recorded. Many of these cases have occurred in Japan, where a [[founder effect]] has caused a higher incidence rate than in other populations. The incidence rate of Werner syndrome in Japan is approximately 1 case per 100 thousand people (1:100,000), a large contrast with the rate of incidence for the rest of the world, which is between 1:1,000,000 and 1:10,000,000. A founder effect is also apparent in Sardinia, where there have been 18 recorded cases of Werner syndrome.<ref name=epidemiology />\n\n==Popular culture==\nOn the episode \"Stargazer in a Puddle\" from the television series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', the victim has Werner syndrome, the team discovering in the course of the investigation that her mother killed her daughter because she was dying of another disease and worried that her daughter would have nobody to look after her afterwards, with the tragic twist that the mother began to recover from her disease after her daughter's death.\n\nWerner syndrome is featured in the 1989 film ''[[The Fly II]]'', starring [[Eric Stoltz]], where his character was born as a 2 year old baby. He never sleeps and grows 5 times his normal age due to his biological father having half fly genes from the first 1986 film ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''\n\nWerner syndrome is featured in the 1996 film ''[[Jack (1996 film)|Jack]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]], in which his character ages four times faster than normal.\n\nIn an early cutscene from the game ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]'', Otacon cites \"classic Werner syndrome\" as the most likely cause of [[Solid Snake]]'s premature aging, though he goes on to say that testing had been inconclusive. It is however later said that Solid Snake's body, created as a genetically engineered clone, had been designed to break down quickly.\n\nIn season 3 episode 9, \"[[The Ballad of Kevin and Tess]]\", of the TV series ''[[The 4400]]'', Kevin is said to have Werner syndrome to hide his real condition from the public.\n\nIn ''[[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)|The Invisible Man]]'' season 1 episode 6, \"Impetus\", the new character Gloria has an experimentally altered type of Werner syndrome that causes it to become contagious.\n\nThe central character in Gail Tsukiyama's novel ''DREAMING WATER'' (2002) has Werner's syndrome.\n\nIn season 1 episode 8 ''Cold Comfort'' from TV series ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', a character has a \"form of progeria, similar to Werner syndrome\", due to genetic manipulation.

Events such as rapid telomere shortening cause Werner syndrome cells to exhibit low responses to overall cellular stress. In addition to telomere dysfunction, over-expression of [[oncogenes]] and [[oxidation]] can induce this type of response. High stress causes a synergistic effect, where WS cells become even more sensitive to agents that increase cell stress and agents that damage DNA. As a result, WS cells show a drastic reduction in replicative lifespan and enter into a stage of aging prematurely. The accumulation of these damaged cells due to telomere shortening over many years may be indicative of why Werner syndrome symptoms only appear after an individual is about twenty years old.<ref name=Multani>{{cite journal | vauthors = Multani AS, Chang S | title = WRN at telomeres: implications for aging and cancer | journal = J.

In the most severe cases, surgery may be required to implant a [[skin graft]] or amputate a limb if necessary.

This drug targets the [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38]] signaling pathway, which may become activated as a result of genomic instability and stalled replication forks that are characteristic mutations in WS. This activation of p38 may play a role in the onset of premature cell aging, skin aging, cataracts, and graying of the hair.

As a German [[ophthalmologist]], Werner described several progeria-like features and juvenile [[cataract]]s in many of his patients. He noticed these symptoms particularly in a family with four sequential children who all showed the characteristics of the syndrome at around the same age. He assumed the cause to be genetic, though most of his evidence was clinical. Between 1934 and 1941, two internists from New York, Oppenheimer and Kugel, coined the term \"Werner Syndrome,\" igniting a wave of interest and research on the disease.<ref name=Goto>{{cite book|last=Goto|first=Makoto|title=Clinical Aspects of Werner's Syndrome: Its Natural History and the Genetics of the Disease|year=2004|publisher=Eurekah.com and Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishing|page=1}}</ref>\nDuring that time, Agatson and Gartner suggested a possible link between Werner's syndrome and cancer. However, it was not until 1966 that there was a general consensus on the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for the syndrome. By 1981, [[geneticist]]s had located the WRN gene on chromosome 8, leading to its cloning in 1996. This cloning of the WRN was significant because it revealed the predicted WRN protein was made from a family of DNA [[helicase]]s.<ref name=\"Goto\"/> Prior to 1996, Werner syndrome was thought to be a model for accelerated aging. Since the discovery of the gene, it has become clear that the premature aging displayed in Werner syndrome is not the same, on a cellular level, as normal aging. The role of WRN in DNA repair and its exonuclease and helicase activities have been the subject of many studies in recent years.<ref name=\"L. Chen\" />\n\nSince the initial discovery in 1904, several other cases of Werner syndrome have been recorded. Many of these cases have occurred in Japan, where a [[founder effect]] has caused a higher incidence rate than in other populations. The incidence rate of Werner syndrome in Japan is approximately 1 case per 100 thousand people (1:100,000), a large contrast with the rate of incidence for the rest of the world, which is between 1:1,000,000 and 1:10,000,000. A founder effect is also apparent in Sardinia, where there have been 18 recorded cases of Werner syndrome.<ref name=epidemiology />\n\n==Popular culture==\nOn the episode \"Stargazer in a Puddle\" from the television series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', the victim has Werner syndrome, the team discovering in the course of the investigation that her mother killed her daughter because she was dying of another disease and worried that her daughter would have nobody to look after her afterwards, with the tragic twist that the mother began to recover from her disease after her daughter's death.\n\nWerner syndrome is featured in the 1989 film ''[[The Fly II]]'', starring [[Eric Stoltz]], where his character was born as a 2 year old baby. He never sleeps and grows 5 times his normal age due to his biological father having half fly genes from the first 1986 film ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''\n\nWerner syndrome is featured in the 1996 film ''[[Jack (1996 film)|Jack]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]], in which his character ages four times faster than normal.\n\nIn an early cutscene from the game ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]'', Otacon cites \"classic Werner syndrome\" as the most likely cause of [[Solid Snake]]'s premature aging, though he goes on to say that testing had been inconclusive. It is however later said that Solid Snake's body, created as a genetically engineered clone, had been designed to break down quickly.\n\nIn season 3 episode 9, \"[[The Ballad of Kevin and Tess]]\", of the TV series ''[[The 4400]]'', Kevin is said to have Werner syndrome to hide his real condition from the public.\n\nIn ''[[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)|The Invisible Man]]'' season 1 episode 6, \"Impetus\", the new character Gloria has an experimentally altered type of Werner syndrome that causes it to become contagious.\n\nThe central character in Gail Tsukiyama's novel ''DREAMING WATER'' (2002) has Werner's syndrome.\n\nIn season 1 episode 8 ''Cold Comfort'' from TV series ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', a character has a \"form of progeria, similar to Werner syndrome\", due to genetic manipulation.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]].

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life.

He was tutored at home by a relative and attended [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] on a scholarship (1911, A.B.; 1915, A.M.). Finances influenced his decision to attend [[Georgetown University School of Medicine]] (1915, M.D.) and to follow with an internship at [[Sibley Memorial Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] A lifelong interest in research was sparked during medical school.\n\n==Career==\nParran volunteered at a health laboratory operated by the District of Columbia, under Dr. [[Joseph J. Kinyoun]], founder of [[Public Health Service]]'s [[Hygienic Laboratory]] (renamed the [[National Institute of Health]] in 1930). Kinyoun recruited Parran to join a field team of young physicians under PHS's Dr. [[Leslie L. Lumsden]], building privies and surveying conditions in the [[Southern United States]]. In March 1917, Parran reported to [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma]], for the first of many assignments in rural sanitation.\n\nAfter receiving an Assistant Surgeon's commission in September 1917, Parran continued on assignments in rural health services administration, sanitation, and the control of communicable diseases; between field assignments, Parran tasted life as an administrator in Washington, DC. In October 1923, he joined a group of young medical officers who attended 6 months of coursework at the Hygienic Laboratory, receiving the practical equivalent of a [[master's degree]] in [[public health]]. Parran's first leadership position was as Chief of PHS's Division of [[Venereal Disease]]s (September 1926), a program begun during [[World War I]]. Parran worked to sway public sentiment away from moral condemnation of venereal diseases and toward consideration of [[syphilis]] as a medical condition and threat to public health.\n\nHis talents in rural health administration would soon lead him temporarily in a new direction. A reform-minded governor, [[Franklin Roosevelt]], requested for to Parran be loaned to the State of [[New York (state)|New York]], where in April 1930 Parran took up his post as state health commissioner. His primary task was chairing a [[Special Health Commission]] whose recommendations (1932) provided a framework to bolster county health departments in the face of needs in the [[Great Depression]]. Few of the Commission's recommendations were enacted. Parran's work on syphilis achieved more success. The [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] inadvertently launched his campaign after radio executives censored the phrase \"syphilis control\" from a talk, leading Parran to cancel his appearance. Newspapers across the United States reprinted the censored speech.\n\n==Surgeon General==\nParran became active in [[New Deal]] politics in New York and entered national politics as well. In 1934, his former supervisor, now [[President of the United States]], Roosevelt, appointed Parran to the [[Committee on Economic Security]], which drafted the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935; Title VI authorized millions for public health departments and for biomedical research. After Surgeon General [[Hugh S. Cumming]]'s term, President Roosevelt appointed Parran as [[Surgeon General of the United States]]; he was sworn in on 6 April 1936.\n\nParran's syphilis control campaign was in full swing by the fall of 1936. Title VI funds supported efforts to identify and treat syphilis, and the [[La Follette-Bulwinkle Act|National Venereal Disease Control Act of 1938]] made funds available for rapid treatment centers that employed the new [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa]] drugs and, later, [[penicillin]]. During 1937 his book about syphilis, ''Shadow on the Land,'' was published and very well received.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parran |first=Thomas |year=1937 |title=Shadow on the Land: Syphilis |location=New York City, N.Y. |publisher=[[Reynal & Hitchcock]] |pages=1\u2013309 |asin=B00085AB5G |oclc=587745}}</ref> However, unpublished essays with little and/or misleading evidence have suggested that his work against syphilis is tainted by the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]] (1932-1972) and the [[Guatemala syphilis experiment]]s (1946-1948), which were conducted by the PHS's Division of Venereal Diseases, partially during his tenure as Surgeon General.<ref name=\"vergano\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], reports from Europe indicated that the public health situation was dire, prompt action was needed, and a highly qualified medical officer was required to direct the Public Health Division of the [[Civil Affairs]] Branch (G-5) of the newly formed headquarters. Because all of the senior Army medical officers with competence in this field were already holding highly important positions, the Army turned to Dr. Parran for help, and he released his deputy, Dr. [[Warren Fales Draper]], to the military headquarters. Draper became a member of General [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s staff as the Chief of the Public Health Branch and the top public health adviser for Supreme Headquarters, American Expeditionary Forces with the rank of [[brigadier general]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Stanhope |first1=Bayne-Jones |last2=Turner |first2=Thomas B. |year=1976 |pages=412\u201321 |contribution=Planning and Preparation for the European Theater of Operations |title=Preventive Medicine in World War II |volume=XII |location=Washington D.C. |publisher= Office of the Surgeon General, United States Army |url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/civilaffairs/chapter12.htm |accessdate=January 1, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to syphilis control, Surgeon General Parran left his mark on the scope and structure of public health, both at home and abroad. World War II brought quick expansion and new opportunities for expanded duties. In response Parran and his deputies rewrote the statutes underlying PHS operations, the Public Health Service Acts of [[Public Health Service Act of 1943|1943]] and [[Public Health Service Act of 1944|1944]], establishing a four-bureau structure that would remain in place through 1967 deftly arranged for the transfer of wartime research contracts from the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], creating an extramural grants program for NIH. Parran also served as a mentor to a generation of [[Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] physicians, to whom he gave the leeway to create new institutions and programs in the areas of clinical research into [[cancer]] and other conditions, [[mental health]], [[tuberculosis]] control, prevention of [[malaria]] and other communicable diseases, construction of nonprofit [[hospital]]s, and international health. Parran's leadership role in international health affairs dated back to the 1930s with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[Pan American Health Organization]]. Parran chaired the [[International Health Conference]] where the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) draft constitution was adopted (1946) and led subsequent U.S. delegations.\n\nParran was an early and committed advocate of national health insurance, shielding PHS from direct conflict with those who opposed insurance by tempering his public advocacy with a focus on creating a regionally-organized health services infrastructure to precede federal dollars for care. The [[Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946]] (Hill-Burton) was a signal step in this direction. Nevertheless, Parran was attacked by [[American Medical Association]] editorialist [[Morris Fishbein]] for supporting President Truman's proposed national insurance program. Truman's decision not to reappoint Parran in the spring of 1948 may have been an outcome of public disputes over this issue. Parran declined the position of Director of the World Health Organization to attempt to maintain the independence of the Public Health Service from the newly-created bureaucracy, the Department of Health Education and Welfare. He lost that fight and his job, only to move on again to further advances in the health education field.\n\n==Later life==\nOn 1 October 1948, Surgeon General Parran retired from PHS to begin a career in academic administration, to serve as the first dean of the new [[University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health|School of Public Health]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Parran made [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] a proving ground for ideas developed during his tenure at PHS, recruiting the school's first generation of senior faculty and bringing his deputy surgeon general and veteran international health administrator, Dr. [[James A. Crabtree]], who succeeded him as dean in 1958. Beyond his tenure as Surgeon General, Parran remained prominent in international health, active in the [[Pan American Sanitary Organization]] and in [[Rockefeller Foundation]] programs. On retiring from Pittsburgh in 1958, Dr. Parran became president of the [[Avalon Foundation]], affiliated with the [[Andrew W. Mellon|Mellon family]], and became active in the [[A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust]], where he had served as a trustee since 1955. He continued his work in [[philanthropy]] and public health until his death in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The home of the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, [[Parran Hall]], was renamed for Parran in 1969.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://pittnews.com/article/133336/news/board-of-trustees-unanimously-votes-to-rename-parran-hall/ | title=Board of Trustees unanimously votes to rename Parran Hall| date=2018-07-11}}</ref>\n\nA collection of his papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/parran204|title=Proposed ten-year postwar program of the United States Public Health Service / Thomas Parran 1944|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref> Most of his papers concerning his tenure as Surgeon General and his work after are held at the University of Pittsburgh.<ref>Parran Papers, University of Pittsburgh Archives Service Center.
