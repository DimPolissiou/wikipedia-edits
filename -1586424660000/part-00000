It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by [[Virgin Records]] ([[EMI|EMI France]]). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist [[Kelly Rowland]], who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by [[Nervo (DJs)|Nervo]].\n\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album ''[[Here I Am (Kelly Rowland album)|Here I Am]]'' (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed the song]], focussing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Take Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to [[Coldplay]]'s 2002 hit single \"[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]].\"\n\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from ''One Love''. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest charting single on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, ''Billboard'' named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging [[electronic dance music]] trend in America at its time of release.\n\nIn the song's accompanying [[music video]], Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, [[NRJ Music Awards]] and the [[World Music Awards]]. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual [[Miss Universe 2009|Miss Universe]] competition. The single earned seven Platinum [[List of music recording certifications|certification]]s as well as five Gold certificates, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"MUNDO URBANO TV Magazine\">{{cite news|title=David Guetta \u2013 What I Did For Love ft Emeli Sand\u00e9|url=http://www.mundourbano.tv/david-guetta-what-i-did-for-love-ft-emeli-sande/|publisher=MUNDO URBANO TV Magazine|accessdate=March 16, 2015|date=March 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/features/official-charts-flashback-2009-cascada-evacuate-the-dancefloor-3267/<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->][https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=312921450&s=143441<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->] Sottraendo dal totale complessivo delle copie vendute con i singoli le vendite delle altre hits, si ottengono le copie vendute individualmente da ''When Love Takes Over''</ref> Additionally, it earned Guetta two [[52nd Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations for \"[[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]]\" and \"[[Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical|Best Non-Classical, Remixed Recording]]\", the latter of which Guetta won for his \"Electro Extended Mix\" of \"When Love Takes Over\".\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kelly Rowland 12, 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Kelly Rowland]] performing in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 2012.]]\nRowland has acknowledged on several occasions that although she loved [[dance music]], it was not really the type of music she would record.

She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo ([[Nervo (DJs)|Nervo]]).<ref name=\"Blues & Soul\"/> However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his ''[[One Love (David Guetta album)|One Love]]'' album.<ref name=\"Browne\">{{cite web |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/generating-hit-songs-on-the-double/story-fn6ck8la-1225976132620 |title=Generating hit songs on the double |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |work=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]] |last=Browne |first=Sarah |date=25 December 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref> After getting selected for the album, \"When Love Takes Over\" was given to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of the song.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/> However Riesterer decided to give the track to French [[Mix engineer|mixing engineer]] Veronica Ferraro, who would later go on to say that \"Reisterer was supposed to mix it, but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out.

Following this, she decided that she would focus primarily on Rowland's vocals. {{quote|\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had the right sounds on the drums and the keyboards, so I did not change very much. I just did some standard things, with [[Equalization (audio)|EQ]] and [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and things like that. After that my obsession was to get the vocals to sound as good as possible. When I'm mixing a track, I want something to happen, something that takes the listener somewhere. You want the right things in the right place, but it's not a technical issue. It's actually an artistic issue to have everything in the right place \u2013 the mixing has to be magic. It was not difficult in this case, because I knew the song would be a hit, but I did my best to make the vocal sound magical, like an angel singing, so that the hit quality of the song was immediately obvious. I wanted to make sure that the voice takes you from the beginning to the end and doesn't lose you.\"<ref name=\"Tingen\"/>}}\nFerraro told ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' that she did add a [[bass drum]] sample, as she felt that the kick was missing something. \"Rather than equalise it, I added a little bit of my sample to make the BD track sound bigger\". However she did alter the two piano elements of the song, using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay. Additionally, Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track's instruments, including the violin, [[String section|strings]] and guitar samples.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/> She then moved on to Rowland's vocals, which \"were extensively processed\", including [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[de-essing]]. Then upon completion of her work on the song, Ferraro sent \"When Love Takes Over\" to her husband, Bruno Gruel, and his Elektra Mastering Suite which is located in the same building as the Super Sonic Scale Studio. Gruel received the song in a standard Pro Tools format, [[24-bit]]/[[44,100 Hz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]]. He used several pieces of software to realign all of the elements of the song, particularly the bass drums and low [[synthesizer|synth]]s.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/>\n\n== Composition ==\n{{Listen |filename=David Guetta - When Love Takes Over (feat.

Other elements of the song such as the \"bed of synthistrings, a skippy beat, a breakdown, some riffing glassy electronics and a dramatic, cinematic bottom end drone\" were praised. McAlpine also praised Rowland's appearance on the track, commenting who she sounded \"entirely unlike herself, so that even SHE is all buffed up and shiny.\" He described the marriage of Rowland's vocals and Guetta's production by stating that \"[Rowland's] got a spiralling, sky-scraping melody to sing too.\"<ref name=\"McAlpine\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2009/06/david_guetta_kelly_rowland_whe.shtml |title=David Guetta feat.

It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by [[Virgin Records]] ([[EMI|EMI France]]). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist [[Kelly Rowland]], who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by [[Nervo (DJs)|Nervo]].\n\nAccording to Rowland, the song inspired her to pursue a more dance-oriented sound for her album ''[[Here I Am (Kelly Rowland album)|Here I Am]]'' (2011), while Guetta noted \"When Love Takes Over\" for providing the framework for his future musical explorations and inspiring him to experiment with more urban sounds. Guetta and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Riesterer produced the song with piano riffs and a melodic backing track. Veronica Ferraro [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed the song]], focussing primarily on giving Rowland's vocals a magical and inspiring tone. Critics would later state that Rowland's vocals on \"When Love Take Over\" helped to establish herself as a solo vocalist. The song's lyrics carry a message of the euphoria one feels when in love with a significant other, while the production bears some similarities to [[Coldplay]]'s 2002 hit single \"[[Clocks (song)|Clocks]].\"\n\n\"When Love Takes Over\" received universal acclaim. Most noted the addition of Rowland's powerful and emotionally charged vocals which made the single the most memorable song from ''One Love''. The song was praised for its lush production and euphoric sentiments. It achieved worldwide success by topping the charts in ten countries, including in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland. At the time of release, it became Guetta's highest charting single on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Rowland's second number one single in the United Kingdom. \"When Love Takes Over\" ranked at number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Best of 2009 Dance Club Songs chart. In 2013, ''Billboard'' named \"When Love Takes Over\" its number one dance-pop collaboration of all time, in addition to noting the lasting cultural impact that the collaboration would have on dance music and its indication of the emerging [[electronic dance music]] trend in America at its time of release.\n\nIn the song's accompanying [[music video]], Rowland and Guetta reminisce of how the song came together. It follows the duo as they prepare for a party before coming together for the final result. \"When Love Takes Over\" was promoted mainly at award shows, including the MTV Latin Music Video Awards, [[NRJ Music Awards]] and the [[World Music Awards]]. Guetta and Rowland reunited in late 2009 to perform \"When Love Takes Over\" for the annual [[Miss Universe 2009|Miss Universe]] competition. The single earned seven Platinum [[List of music recording certifications|certification]]s as well as five Gold certificates, selling over 5.5 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"MUNDO URBANO TV Magazine\">{{cite news|title=David Guetta \u2013 What I Did For Love ft Emeli Sand\u00e9|url=http://www.mundourbano.tv/david-guetta-what-i-did-for-love-ft-emeli-sande/|publisher=MUNDO URBANO TV Magazine|accessdate=March 16, 2015|date=March 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/features/official-charts-flashback-2009-cascada-evacuate-the-dancefloor-3267/<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->][https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=312921450&s=143441<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente -->] Sottraendo dal totale complessivo delle copie vendute con i singoli le vendite delle altre hits, si ottengono le copie vendute individualmente da ''When Love Takes Over''</ref> Additionally, it earned Guetta two [[52nd Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations for \"[[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]]\" and \"[[Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical|Best Non-Classical, Remixed Recording]]\", the latter of which Guetta won for his \"Electro Extended Mix\" of \"When Love Takes Over\".\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kelly Rowland 12, 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Kelly Rowland]] performing in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] in 2012.]]\nRowland has acknowledged on several occasions that although she loved [[dance music]], it was not really the type of music she would record.

Following this, she decided that she would focus primarily on Rowland's vocals. {{quote|\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric had the right sounds on the drums and the keyboards, so I did not change very much. I just did some standard things, with [[Equalization (audio)|EQ]] and [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] and things like that. After that my obsession was to get the vocals to sound as good as possible. When I'm mixing a track, I want something to happen, something that takes the listener somewhere. You want the right things in the right place, but it's not a technical issue. It's actually an artistic issue to have everything in the right place \u2013 the mixing has to be magic. It was not difficult in this case, because I knew the song would be a hit, but I did my best to make the vocal sound magical, like an angel singing, so that the hit quality of the song was immediately obvious. I wanted to make sure that the voice takes you from the beginning to the end and doesn't lose you.\"<ref name=\"Tingen\"/>}}\nFerraro told ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' that she did add a [[bass drum]] sample, as she felt that the kick was missing something. \"Rather than equalise it, I added a little bit of my sample to make the BD track sound bigger\". However she did alter the two piano elements of the song, using the Flex Studio Tool to widen the sound of the piano element without the delay. Additionally, Ferraro used a number of French plug-in software to amplify many of the track's instruments, including the violin, [[String section|strings]] and guitar samples.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/> She then moved on to Rowland's vocals, which \"were extensively processed\", including [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[de-essing]]. Then upon completion of her work on the song, Ferraro sent \"When Love Takes Over\" to her husband, Bruno Gruel, and his Elektra Mastering Suite which is located in the same building as the Super Sonic Scale Studio. Gruel received the song in a standard Pro Tools format, [[24-bit]]/[[44,100 Hz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]]. He used several pieces of software to realign all of the elements of the song, particularly the bass drums and low [[synthesizer|synth]]s.<ref name=\"Tingen\"/>\n\n== Composition ==\n{{Listen |filename=David Guetta - When Love Takes Over (feat.

Fishes of myriad varieties are the main predators in most of the world's water bodies, both freshwater and marine. The rest of the vertebrate species are tetrapods, a single lineage that includes amphibians (with roughly 7,000 species); mammals (with approximately 5,500 species); and reptiles and birds (with about 20,000 species divided evenly between the two classes). Tetrapods comprise the dominant megafauna of most terrestrial environments and also include many partially or fully aquatic groups (e.g., sea [[snakes]], penguins, cetaceans).\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are several ways of classifying animals. [[Evolutionary taxonomy|Evolutionary systematics]] relies on [[anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[evolution]]ary history, which is determined through similarities in anatomy and, if possible, the [[genetics]] of organisms. [[Cladistics|Phylogenetic classification]] is based solely on [[phylogeny]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Australian water bugs: their biology and identification (Hemiptera-Heteroptera, Gerromorpha & Nepomorpha)|year=2004|publisher=Apollo Books|isbn=978-87-88757-78-1|author=Andersen, N.M.|author2=Weir, T.A. |page=38}}</ref> Evolutionary systematics gives an overview; phylogenetic systematics gives detail.

This classification is the one most commonly encountered in school textbooks, overviews, non-specialist, and popular works. The [[extant taxon|extant]] vertebrates are:<ref name=\"Romer\"/>\n\n* '''Subphylum Vertebrata'''\n** Class [[Agnatha]] (jawless fishes)\n** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fishes)\n** Class [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fishes)\n** Class [[Amphibia]] (amphibians)\n** Class [[Reptilia]] (reptiles)\n** Class [[Aves]] (birds)\n** Class [[Mammalia]] (mammals)\n\nIn addition to these, there are two classes of extinct armoured fishes, the [[Placodermi]] and the [[Acanthodii]].\n\nOther ways of classifying the vertebrates have been devised, particularly with emphasis on the [[phylogeny]] of [[labyrinthodontia|early amphibians]] and reptiles.

It was released on 10 January 2011 by [[RCA Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the album. The song was produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], who co-wrote the song with Lavigne. According to Lavigne, she wrote the song as her \"personal message for freedom\".\n\nUpon its release, \"What the Hell\" received positive reviews from music critics with many complimenting its [[catchiness]] and comparing it to her 2007 single \"[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]\". The song was successful, reaching number one in Japan, the top five in Asia, the Top 10 in Europe, Australia, South America, Mexico, Canada, and the Top 20 in the US and the UK, peaking at eleven and sixteen, respectively.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the song was directed by [[Marcus Raboy]] and premiered on 23 January. \"What the Hell\" was performed by Lavigne on several television programs such as ''Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve'', ''Daybreak'', ''The View'', ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' and on the Much Music Video Awards, ''America's Got Talent'' and ''Britain's Got Talent''. Additionally, she added the song to the setlist of [[The Black Star Tour]] (2011).\n\n==Background==\n\"What the Hell\" is written by Lavigne, [[Max Martin]], and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], while the latter two produced the song. It was recorded at [[Maratone Studios]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. This is the second song these three have written together, the first one being [[Miranda Cosgrove]]'s \"[[Dancing Crazy]]\". In November 2010, Lavigne announced via a blog on her official website that her fourth album, ''[[Goodbye Lullaby]]'', had been completed for a year and cited her record company as the reason for the album's delays. She revealed in the blog that \"What the Hell\" would be the first single from the album.{{r|AHN}} The song was premiered on 31 December 2010 on [[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest|''Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve'']]{{r|billboardlipshutz}} during a pre-taped segment along with a performance of \"[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]\".{{r|musicmixqa}} Lavigne described \"What the Hell\" as \"a really fun, upbeat party song, so it worked out really well to play it for the first time on ''New Year's Rockin' Eve''.\"{{r|popeater}} The following day, \"What the Hell\" was available as a free download for 48 hours from Lavigne's official [[Facebook]] page.{{r|facebook}}\n\n==Composition==\n\"What the Hell\" has been described as \"[[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] [[Pop punk|pop-punk]]\"{{r|digitalspy}} and [[synthpop]] song.<ref name=\"Unreality Shout\">{{cite web|url=http://unrealityshout.com/blogs/single-review-avril-lavigne-what-the-hell|title=Single Review: Avril Lavigne - 'What The Hell?'|last=Hickey|first=Dara|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Access Hollywood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/on-the-download-avril-lavignes-what-the-hell_article_41817|title=On The Download: Avril Lavigne's 'What The Hell'|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> The song has been compared to previous Lavigne's single, \"[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]\" (2007). It is written in the verse\u2013pre-chorus\u2013chorus form. The track opens with its characteristically \"retro keyboard riff\" and hand-claps.{{r|mtvreview}} The inclusion of the keyboard has drawn comparisons to the [[garage rock]] genre and the band [[The Hives]].{{r|mtvreview|rsreview}} The song also features guitars during the chorus.{{r|mtvreview}} The song is performed in the key of [[A major]] at a tempo of 150 beats per minute.

It was released on 10 January 2011 by [[RCA Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the album. The song was produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], who co-wrote the song with Lavigne. According to Lavigne, she wrote the song as her \"personal message for freedom\".\n\nUpon its release, \"What the Hell\" received positive reviews from music critics with many complimenting its [[catchiness]] and comparing it to her 2007 single \"[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]\". The song was successful, reaching number one in Japan, the top five in Asia, the Top 10 in Europe, Australia, South America, Mexico, Canada, and the Top 20 in the US and the UK, peaking at eleven and sixteen, respectively.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the song was directed by [[Marcus Raboy]] and premiered on 23 January. \"What the Hell\" was performed by Lavigne on several television programs such as ''Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve'', ''Daybreak'', ''The View'', ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' and on the Much Music Video Awards, ''America's Got Talent'' and ''Britain's Got Talent''. Additionally, she added the song to the setlist of [[The Black Star Tour]] (2011).\n\n==Background==\n\"What the Hell\" is written by Lavigne, [[Max Martin]], and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], while the latter two produced the song. It was recorded at [[Maratone Studios]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. This is the second song these three have written together, the first one being [[Miranda Cosgrove]]'s \"[[Dancing Crazy]]\". On November 2010, Lavigne announced via a blog on her official website that her fourth album, ''[[Goodbye Lullaby]]'', had been completed for a year and cited her record company as the reason for the album's delays. She revealed in the blog that \"What the Hell\" would be the first single from the album.{{r|AHN}} The song was premiered on 31 December 2010 on [[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest|''Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve'']]{{r|billboardlipshutz}} during a pre-taped segment along with a performance of \"[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]\".{{r|musicmixqa}} Lavigne described \"What the Hell\" as \"a really fun, upbeat party song, so it worked out really well to play it for the first time on ''New Year's Rockin' Eve''.\"{{r|popeater}} The following day, \"What the Hell\" was available as a free download for 48 hours from Lavigne's official [[Facebook]] page.{{r|facebook}}\n\n==Composition==\n\"What the Hell\" has been described as \"[[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] [[Pop punk|pop-punk]]\"{{r|digitalspy}} and [[synthpop]] song.<ref name=\"Unreality Shout\">{{cite web|url=http://unrealityshout.com/blogs/single-review-avril-lavigne-what-the-hell|title=Single Review: Avril Lavigne - 'What The Hell?'|last=Hickey|first=Dara|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Access Hollywood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/on-the-download-avril-lavignes-what-the-hell_article_41817|title=On The Download: Avril Lavigne's 'What The Hell'|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> The song has been compared to previous Lavigne's single, \"[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]\" (2007). It is written in the verse\u2013pre-chorus\u2013chorus form. The track opens with its characteristically \"retro keyboard riff\" and hand-claps.{{r|mtvreview}} The inclusion of the keyboard has drawn comparisons to the [[garage rock]] genre and the band [[The Hives]].{{r|mtvreview|rsreview}} The song also features guitars during the chorus.{{r|mtvreview}} The song is performed in the key of [[A major]] at a tempo of 150 beats per minute. Avril Lavigne's vocals span from F#<sub>3</sub> to F#<sub>5</sub>.\n\nAlthough Lavigne simply described the song as \"a broad message about personal freedom\",{{r|AHN}} critics have interpreted it in various ways. Gil Kaufman of [[MTV.com]] suggested that it is a \"declaration of independence from a former teen star who is storming back onto the scene\". Kaufman proposed Lavigne's public divorce from [[Sum 41]] singer [[Deryck Whibley]], along with friction between her and her record company, as possible themes.{{r|mtvreview}} Jody Rosen of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine called the song \"an anthem about a good girl... staying out late, swapping boys and exacting psychological revenge.\"{{r|rsreview}} Heather McDaid of Stereoboard.com was critical of the song's theme being about Whibley: \"with such an upbeat song it's hard to envisage divorce as the underlying subject matter as you listen.\"{{r|stereoboard}} Holly Thomas of ''[[Frost Magazine]]'' suggested Lavigne was \"starved of affection from the one she truly loves.\"{{r|frost}} Lavigne described the song as \"more reminiscent of some of my old [[pop rock]] stuff\",{{r|popeater}} calling it her \"most pop track on the record\" and the least personal song from the album.{{r|AHN}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n{{Album ratings |state=plain\n| rev2 = [[Blogcritics]]\n| rev2Score = (positive){{r|blogcritics}}\n| rev3 = [[Digital Spy]]\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|5|5}}{{r|digitalspy}}\n| rev4 = ''[[Frost Magazine]]''\n| rev4Score = (positive){{r|frost}}\n| rev5 = [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]\n| rev5Score = (positive){{r|idolator}}\n| rev6 = MTV\n| rev6Score = (positive){{r|mtvreview}}\n| rev7 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev7Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}{{r|rsreview}}\n| rev8 = Stereoboard.com\n| rev8Score = (mixed){{r|stereoboard}}\n}}\n\n\"What the Hell\" has received positive reviews from music critics, who have noted similarities between \"What the Hell\" and Lavigne's previous single, \"[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]\".{{r|mtvreview|frost}} Gil Kaufman of [[MTV#Internet|MTV.com]] stated \"What the Hell\" has \"rousing cheerleader energy\" and an \"infectious groove and peppy vibe\".{{r|mtvreview}} Jody Rosen of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine said \"the music is easily some of Avril's catchiest yet\", describing it as \"Avril in a nutshell\".{{r|rsreview}} [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] described the song as a \"guilty pleasure\" and called it \"the kind of track we only select after double-checking no one's eyeing our iPod.\"{{r|idolator}} Nick Levine of [[Digital Spy]] gave the song a perfect rating. He explained that Lavigne is \"snottier than a tissue tossed in the bin down the flu clinic [but] what's more, she's pulling it off.\" Levine added that \"What the Hell\" was not \"quite as undeniable\" as \"Girlfriend\" but praised the chorus of the song.{{r|digitalspy}}\n\nHeather McDaid of Stereoboard.com notes that it \"isn't a revolutionary piece musically but it encompasses the pop-rock sound Avril has been creating over the years\".
