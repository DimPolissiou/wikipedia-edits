It is covered in fur and spines and has a distinctive [[snout]] and a specialized [[tongue]], which it uses to catch its insect prey at a great speed. Like the other extant [[monotreme]]s, the short-beaked echidna lays [[egg (biology)|eggs]]; the [[monotremes]] are the only group of [[mammal]]s to do so.\n\nThe short-beaked echidna has extremely strong front limbs and claws, which allow it to burrow quickly with great power. As it needs to be able to survive underground, it has a significant tolerance to high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] and low levels of [[oxygen]]. It has no weapons or fighting ability but repels [[Predation|predators]] by curling into a ball and deterring them with its [[Spine (zoology)|spines]]. It lacks the ability to sweat and cannot deal with heat well, so it tends to avoid daytime activity in hot weather. It can swim if needed. The snout has [[mechanoreceptor]]s and [[Electroreception|electroreceptors]] that help the echidna to detect its surroundings.\n\nDuring the [[Australia]]n winter, it goes into deep [[torpor]] and [[hibernation]], reducing its [[metabolism]] to save energy. As the temperature increases, it emerges to [[mating|mate]]. Female echidnas lay one egg a year and the mating period is the only time the otherwise [[solitary animals]] meet one another; the male has no further contact with the female or his offspring after mating. A young echidna is the size of a [[grape]] but grows rapidly on its mother's milk, which is very rich in nutrients. Baby echidnas eventually grow too large and spiky to stay in the pouch and, around seven weeks after hatching, are expelled from the pouch into the mother's burrow. At around six months of age, they leave the burrow and have no more contact with their mothers.\n\nThe species is found throughout Australia, where it is the most widespread [[Mammals of Australia|native mammal]], and in coastal and highland regions of eastern [[New Guinea]], where it is known as the ''mungwe'' in the [[Dadibi language|Daribi]] and [[Kuman language (New Guinea)|Chimbu]] languages.<ref name = \"Flannery\">Flannery, T. 1990. ''Mammals of New Guinea'' Robert Brown & Associates {{ISBN|1-86273-029-6}}</ref> It is not threatened with extinction, but human activities, such as hunting, habitat destruction, and the [[Invasive species in Australia|introduction]] of foreign predatory species and parasites, have reduced its distribution in Australia.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe short-beaked echidna was first described by [[George Shaw]] in 1792. He named the [[species]] ''Myrmecophaga aculeata'', thinking that it might be related to the [[giant anteater]]. Since Shaw first described the species, its name has undergone four revisions: from ''M. aculeata'' to ''Ornithorhynchus hystrix'', ''Echidna hystrix'', ''Echidna aculeata'' and finally, ''Tachyglossus aculeatus''.<ref name=a5/><ref>Iredale, T. and Troughton, E. 1934.

The snout is visible on the right.]]\nThe [[muscle|musculature]] of the short-beaked echidna has a number of unusual aspects. The [[panniculus carnosus]], an enormous muscle just beneath the skin, covers the entire body.<ref>Griffiths M, Walton DW (Editor), Richardson BJ(Editor), ''Fauna of Australia Volume 1B'', AGPS Canberra, 1989. [https://www.environment.gov.au/science/abrs/publications/fauna-of-australia/fauna-1b][https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/a117ced5-9a94-4586-afdb-1f333618e1e3/files/15-ind.pdf]</ref> By contraction of various parts of the panniculus carnosus, the short-beaked echidna can change shape, the most characteristic shape change being achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened, so protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines. It has one of the shortest [[spinal cord]]s of any mammal, extending only as far as the [[thorax]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hassiotis | first1 = M. | last2 = Paxinos | first2 = G. | last3 = Ashwell | first3 = K.W.S. | year = 2004 | title = Anatomy of the central nervous system of the Australian echidna | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales | volume = 125 | issue = | pages = 287\u2013300 }}</ref> Whereas the human spinal cord ends at the first or second lumbar vertebra, for the echidna it occurs at the seventh thoracic vertebra.<ref name=a53>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 53.</ref> The shorter spinal cord is thought to allow flexibility to enable wrapping into a ball.<ref name=a53/>\n\nThe musculature of the face, jaw and tongue is specialised for feeding. The tongue is the animal's sole means of catching [[prey]], and can protrude up to {{convert|180|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} outside the snout.<ref name=e38/> The snout's shape, resembling a double wedge, gives it a significant mechanical advantage in generating a large moment, so makes it efficient for digging to reach prey or to build a shelter.<ref>Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 103\u2013104.</ref> The tongue is sticky because of the presence of [[glycoprotein]]-rich mucus, which both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites, which adhere to it. The tongue is protruded by contracting circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forwards and contracting two genioglossal muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the [[mandible]]. The protruded tongue is stiffened by a rapid flow of blood, which allows it to penetrate wood and soil. Retraction requires the contraction of two internal longitudinal muscles, known as the sternoglossi. When the tongue is retracted, the prey is caught on backward-facing [[keratin]]ous \"teeth\", located along the roof of the buccal cavity, allowing the animal both to capture and grind food.<ref name = \"Murray\"/><ref name=a105/> The tongue moves with great speed, and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute.<ref name=e38/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Doran | first1 = G.A. | last2 = Baggett | first2 = H. | year = 1970 | title = The vascular stiffening mechanism in the tongue of the echidna (''Tachyglossus aculeatus'') | url = | journal = Anatomical Record | volume = 167 | issue = 2| pages = 197\u2013204 | doi=10.1002/ar.1091670207| pmid = 5462922 }}</ref> This is partly achieved through the elasticity of the tongue and the conversion of [[elastic potential energy]] into [[kinetic energy]].<ref name=a105/> The tongue is very flexible, particularly at the end, allowing it to bend in U-turns and catch insects attempting to flee in their [[labyrinthine]] nests or mounds.<ref name=a104>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 104.</ref> The tongue also has an ability to avoid picking up splinters while foraging in logs; the factors behind this ability are unknown.<ref name=a105>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 105.</ref> It can eat quickly; a specimen of around {{convert|3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} can ingest {{convert|200|g|oz|abbr=on}} of termites in 10 minutes.<ref name=a106/>\n\nThe echidna's stomach is quite different from other mammals. It is devoid of secretory glands and has a cornified stratified epithelium, which resembles horny skin.<ref name=a106>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 106.</ref> Unlike other mammals, which typically have highly acidic stomachs, the echidna has low levels of acidity, almost neutral, with [[pH]] in the 6.2\u20137.4 range.<ref name=a106/> The stomach is elastic, and gastric peristalsis grinds soil particulates and shredded insects together. Digestion occurs in the small intestine, which is around {{convert|3.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. The insect exoskeletons and soil are not digested, being ejected in the waste.<ref name=a106/>\n\nNumerous [[physiological adaptations]] aid the lifestyle of the short-beaked echidna. Because the animal burrows, it must tolerate very high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] in inspired air, and will voluntarily remain in situations where carbon dioxide concentrations are high. It can dig up to a metre into the ground to retrieve ants or evade predators, and can survive with low oxygen when the area is engulfed by bushfires. The echidna can also dive underwater, which can help it to survive sudden floods.<ref name=a116/> During these situations, the heart rate drops to around 12&nbsp;beats per minute, around one-fifth of the rate at rest. This process is believed to save oxygen for the heart and brain, which are the most sensitive organs to such a shortage; laboratory testing has revealed the echidna's cardiovascular system is similar to that of the seal.<ref name=a116/> Following the devastation of a bushfire, echidnas can compensate for the lack of food by reducing their daytime body temperature and activity through use of torpor, for a period of up to three weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nowack |first=Julia |last2=Cooper|first2= Christine Elizabeth|last3=Geiser |first3=Fritz  |date=13 April 2016 |title=Cool echidnas survive the fire |url= https://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/128414/NowackCooperGeiser_CoolEchidnasSurviveFire_ProcB2016.pdf|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=283 |issue=1828 |page= 20160382|doi= 10.1098/rspb.2016.0382|access-date=16 January 2017 |pmc=4843662 |pmid=27075255}}</ref>\n\nThe echidna's optical system is an uncommon hybrid of both mammalian and reptilian characteristics. The cartilaginous layer beneath the sclera of the eyeball is similar to that of reptiles and avians.<ref name=a55/> The small [[cornea]]l surface is keratinised and hardened, possibly to protect it from chemicals secreted by prey insects or self-impalement when it rolls itself up, which has been observed.<ref name=a56>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 56.</ref> The echidna has the flattest lens of any animal, giving it the longest [[focal length]]. This similarity to primates and humans allows it to see distant objects clearly.<ref name=a57>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 57.</ref> Unlike placental mammals, including humans, the echidna does not have a ciliary muscle to distort the geometry of the lens and thereby change the focal length and allow objects at different distances to be viewed clearly; the whole eye is believed to distort, so the distance between the lens and retina instead changes to allow focusing.<ref name=a57/> The visual ability of an echidna is not great, and it is not known whether it can perceive colour; however, it can distinguish between black and white, and horizontal and vertical stripes. Eyesight is not a crucial factor in the animal's ability to survive, as blind echidnas are able to live healthily.<ref>Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\nIts ears are sensitive to low-[[frequency]] sound, which may be ideal for detecting sounds emitted by termites and ants underground.<ref name=iggo/> The pinnae are obscured and covered by hair, so predators cannot grab them in an attack, and prey or foreign material cannot enter, although [[tick]]s are known to reside there.<ref name=a58>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 58.</ref> The [[macula of saccule|macula]] of the ear is very large compared to other animals, and is used as a gravity sensor to orient the echidna.

Termites from the [[Rhinotermitidae]] family are avoided due to their chemical defences. Scarab beetle larvae are also a large part of the diet when and where available. In the New England study, 37% of the food intake consisted of beetle larvae, although the echidna had to squash the prey in its snout as it ingested it, due to size.<ref name=a98/>\n\nEchidnas are powerful diggers, using their clawed front paws to dig out prey and create burrows for shelter.

It is covered in fur and spines and has a distinctive [[snout]] and a specialized [[tongue]], which it uses to catch its insect prey at a great speed. Like the other extant [[monotreme]]s, the short-beaked echidna lays [[egg (biology)|eggs]]; the [[monotremes]] are the only group of [[mammal]]s to do so.\n\nThe short-beaked echidna has extremely strong front limbs and claws, which allow it to burrow quickly with great power. As it needs to be able to survive underground, it has a significant tolerance to high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] and low levels of [[oxygen]]. It has no weapons or fighting ability but repels [[Predation|predators]] by curling into a ball and deterring them with its [[Spine (zoology)|spines]]. It lacks the ability to sweat and cannot deal with heat well, so it tends to avoid daytime activity in hot weather. It can swim if needed. The snout has [[mechanoreceptor]]s and [[Electroreception|electroreceptors]] that help the echidna to detect its surroundings.\n\nDuring the [[Australia]]n winter, it goes into deep [[torpor]] and [[hibernation]], reducing its [[metabolism]] to save energy. As the temperature increases, it emerges to [[mating|mate]]. Female echidnas lay one egg a year and the mating period is the only time the otherwise [[solitary animals]] meet one another; the male has no further contact with the female or his offspring after mating. A young echidna is the size of a [[grape]] but grows rapidly on its mother's milk, which is very rich in nutrients. Baby echidnas eventually grow too large and spiky to stay in the pouch and, around seven weeks after hatching, are expelled from the pouch into the mother's burrow. At around six months of age, they leave the burrow and have no more contact with their mothers.\n\nThe species is found throughout Australia, where it is the most widespread [[Mammals of Australia|native mammal]], and in coastal and highland regions of eastern [[New Guinea]], where it is known as the ''mungwe'' in the [[Dadibi language|Daribi]] and [[Kuman language (New Guinea)|Chimbu]] languages.<ref name = \"Flannery\">Flannery, T. 1990.

He named the [[species]] ''Myrmecophaga aculeata'', thinking that it might be related to the [[giant anteater]].

The [[panniculus carnosus]], an enormous muscle just beneath the skin, covers the entire body.<ref>Griffiths M, Walton DW (Editor), Richardson BJ(Editor), ''Fauna of Australia Volume 1B'', AGPS Canberra, 1989. [https://www.environment.gov.au/science/abrs/publications/fauna-of-australia/fauna-1b][https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/a117ced5-9a94-4586-afdb-1f333618e1e3/files/15-ind.pdf]</ref> By contraction of various parts of the panniculus carnosus, the short-beaked echidna can change shape, the most characteristic shape change being achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened, so protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines. It has one of the shortest [[spinal cord]]s of any mammal, extending only as far as the [[thorax]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hassiotis | first1 = M. | last2 = Paxinos | first2 = G. | last3 = Ashwell | first3 = K.W.S. | year = 2004 | title = Anatomy of the central nervous system of the Australian echidna | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales | volume = 125 | issue = | pages = 287\u2013300 }}</ref> Whereas the human spinal cord ends at the first or second lumbar vertebra, for the echidna it occurs at the seventh thoracic vertebra.<ref name=a53>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 53.</ref> The shorter spinal cord is thought to allow flexibility to enable wrapping into a ball.<ref name=a53/>\n\nThe musculature of the face, jaw and tongue is specialised for feeding. The tongue is the animal's sole means of catching [[prey]], and can protrude up to {{convert|180|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} outside the snout.<ref name=e38/> The snout's shape, resembling a double wedge, gives it a significant mechanical advantage in generating a large moment, so makes it efficient for digging to reach prey or to build a shelter.<ref>Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 103\u2013104.</ref> The tongue is sticky because of the presence of [[glycoprotein]]-rich mucus, which both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites, which adhere to it. The tongue is protruded by contracting circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forwards and contracting two genioglossal muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the [[mandible]]. The protruded tongue is stiffened by a rapid flow of blood, which allows it to penetrate wood and soil. Retraction requires the contraction of two internal longitudinal muscles, known as the sternoglossi. When the tongue is retracted, the prey is caught on backward-facing [[keratin]]ous \"teeth\", located along the roof of the buccal cavity, allowing the animal both to capture and grind food.<ref name = \"Murray\"/><ref name=a105/> The tongue moves with great speed, and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute.<ref name=e38/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Doran | first1 = G.A. | last2 = Baggett | first2 = H. | year = 1970 | title = The vascular stiffening mechanism in the tongue of the echidna (''Tachyglossus aculeatus'') | url = | journal = Anatomical Record | volume = 167 | issue = 2| pages = 197\u2013204 | doi=10.1002/ar.1091670207| pmid = 5462922 }}</ref> This is partly achieved through the elasticity of the tongue and the conversion of [[elastic potential energy]] into [[kinetic energy]].<ref name=a105/> The tongue is very flexible, particularly at the end, allowing it to bend in U-turns and catch insects attempting to flee in their [[labyrinthine]] nests or mounds.<ref name=a104>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 104.</ref> The tongue also has an ability to avoid picking up splinters while foraging in logs; the factors behind this ability are unknown.<ref name=a105>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 105.</ref> It can eat quickly; a specimen of around {{convert|3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} can ingest {{convert|200|g|oz|abbr=on}} of termites in 10 minutes.<ref name=a106/>\n\nThe echidna's stomach is quite different from other mammals. It is devoid of secretory glands and has a cornified stratified epithelium, which resembles horny skin.<ref name=a106>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 106.</ref> Unlike other mammals, which typically have highly acidic stomachs, the echidna has low levels of acidity, almost neutral, with [[pH]] in the 6.2\u20137.4 range.<ref name=a106/> The stomach is elastic, and gastric peristalsis grinds soil particulates and shredded insects together. Digestion occurs in the small intestine, which is around {{convert|3.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. The insect exoskeletons and soil are not digested, being ejected in the waste.<ref name=a106/>\n\nNumerous [[physiological adaptations]] aid the lifestyle of the short-beaked echidna. Because the animal burrows, it must tolerate very high levels of [[carbon dioxide]] in inspired air, and will voluntarily remain in situations where carbon dioxide concentrations are high. It can dig up to a metre into the ground to retrieve ants or evade predators, and can survive with low oxygen when the area is engulfed by bushfires. The echidna can also dive underwater, which can help it to survive sudden floods.<ref name=a116/> During these situations, the heart rate drops to around 12&nbsp;beats per minute, around one-fifth of the rate at rest.

However, areas where the land has been completely cleared for single crops that can be mechanically harvested, such as wheat fields, have seen extinctions.<ref name=a120/> Over a decade-long period, around one-third of echidna deaths reported to wildlife authorities in Victoria were due to motor vehicles, and the majority of wounded animals handed in were traffic accident victims.<ref name=a121/> Studies have shown they often choose to traverse drainage culverts under roads, so this is seen as a viable means of reducing deaths on busy roads in rural areas or national parks where the animals are more common.<ref name=a121/>\n\nDespite their spines, they are preyed on by [[birds of prey]], the [[Tasmanian devil]],<ref name=dpiw/> [[dingo]]es,<ref name=e38/> snakes, lizards, [[goanna]]s, cats, and foxes,<ref name=a1201>Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 120\u2013121.</ref> although almost all victims are young. Goannas are known for their digging abilities and strong sense of smell, and are believed to have been the main predators of the echidna before the introduction of eutherian mammals.<ref name=a1201/> Dingoes are known to kill echidnas by rolling them over onto their backs and attacking their underbellies.<ref name=a120/> A tracking study of a small number of echidnas on Kangaroo Island concluded that goannas and cats were the main predators, although foxes\u2014absent in Kangaroo Island\u2014would be expected to be a major threat.<ref name=a1201/>\n\nThey were eaten by [[indigenous Australians]] and the early European settlers of Australia.<ref name=dpiw/> Hunting and eating of the echidna in New Guinea has increased over time and caused a decline in the population and distribution areas; it is now believed to have disappeared from highland areas. The killing of echidnas was a taboo in traditional culture, but since the tribespeople have become increasingly Westernised, hunting has increased, and the animals have been more easily tracked down due to the use of dogs.<ref name=a119>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 119.</ref>\n\nInfection with the introduced parasitic tapeworm ''[[Spirometra erinaceieuropaei]]'' is considered fatal for the echidna. This waterborne infection is contracted through sharing drinking areas with infected dogs, foxes, cats, and dingos, which do not die from the parasite. The infection is seen as being more dangerous in drier areas, where more animals are sharing fewer bodies of water, increasing the chance of transmission.<ref name=a121>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 121.</ref> The Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland runs an Australia-wide survey, called Echidna Watch, to monitor the species. Echidnas are also known to be affected by other tapeworms, protozoans and herpes-like viral infections, but little is known of how the infections affect the health of the animals or the populations.<ref name=a122>Augee, Gooden and Musser, p. 122.</ref>\n\nAlthough it is considered easy to keep echidnas healthy in captivity,<ref>Augee, Gooden and Musser, pp. 122\u2013125.</ref> breeding is difficult, partly due to the relatively infrequent cycle.

Biddy Mulligan was the representation (caricature, parody and stereotype) of a Dublin street-seller, with all the working-class repartee, wisdom and failings implicit. He made a number of recordings of sketches starring Mrs. Mulligan.<ref>''Irish Times'', 6 November 1931</ref> Biddy Mulligan is referenced in many Dublin music hall songs such as \"[[Biddy Mulligan the Pride of the Coombe]]\", \"Daffy the Belle of the Coombe\" and \"The Charladies' Ball\".\n\nO'Dea made some film appearances, such as ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' (1959) in which he played King Brian of the little people and ''[[Johnny Nobody]]'' (1961).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47894222|title=The search for an Aussie leprechaun fan|first=Amy|last=Stewart|date=April 14, 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ada3bea|title=Johnny Nobody (1961)|website=BFI}}</ref> He also had a successful career in pantomime and toured Ireland and England many times, and is much associated with actress [[Maureen Potter]] (1925-2004), with whom he often partnered.\n\nO'Dea was also a prolific songwriter in his day.
