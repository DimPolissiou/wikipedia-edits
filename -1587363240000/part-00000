Drawing on this ethnography, the book interrogates the liberal and secular epistemologies that inform dominant understandings of modern Islamic politics, freedom, and agency. The book's key theoretical interventions include examining Aristotelian discourses on ethics as they are taken up in both the Islamic tradition and continental thought; critically engaging anthropological theory on cultural and embodied practice, including the work of Marcel Mauss, Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault; and intervening in feminist theory on agency, gender and embodiment, and particularly through the work of Judith Butler. In these ways, Mahmood interrogates the relationship between bodily practices and bodily form, on the one hand, and ethical and political imaginaries, on the other, while at the same time questioning the presumed separation of the domains of ethics and politics.<ref>https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9563.html</ref>\n\nThe second edition of Politics of Piety was published in 2011. In the Preface, Mahmood addressed the book's critics who had argued her engagement with the women's piety movement was \"an abandonment of feminism\u2019s emancipatory mandate.\" She wrote that her critics \"ignore the fact that I was not interested in delivering judgments on what counts as a feminist versus an anti-feminist practice.\" She argued that an analysis that leads with a moral evaluation of the women's movement does not yield a better understanding of it. \u201cMy task as a scholar,\" she wrote, \"is not simply to denounce, but to try to understand what motivates people to be involved in such movements.\u201d<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/saba-mahmood-dead.html</ref>\n\n=== ''Religious Difference in a Secular Age: A Minority Report'' (2015) ===\nIn this book, Mahmood challenges liberal conceptions of secularism as religion's opposite as well as celebratory views of secularism as the solution to religious discrimination. Drawing on the intertwined history of secularism in the Middle East and Europe, and  extensive fieldwork on the experiences of Copts and Bahais in Egypt, Mahmood explores the conceptual, discursive and lived paradoxes of political secularism. Mahmood concludes that \"political secularism is the modern state's sovereign power to reorganize substantive features of religious life, stipulating what religion is or ought to be, assigning its proper content, and disseminating concomitant subjectivities, ethical frameworks, and quotidian practices.\"<ref>https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10580.html</ref>\n\n== WikiLeaks ==\nMahmood's name appeared in the [[WikiLeaks]] documents, in the material obtained from the Turkish President (then Prime Minister) Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan's son-in-law [[Berat Albayrak]].

Along with her ceaseless political passions and trenchant analyses, she keened to the beauty of the wilderness, the poetry of Ghalib, the delights of cooking and sharing excellent food. She cultivated with joyous attention her relationships with family and friends.  She mentored her students with remarkable care and intensity, demanding their best work, listening, responding with a sharp generosity, coming alive in thought, and soliciting others to do the same. In her final months, she affirmed the values of thought and love, leaving now a vibrant legacy that will persist and flourish among all whose lives were touched by her life and work.

She cultivated with joyous attention her relationships with family and friends.  She mentored her students with remarkable care and intensity, demanding their best work, listening, responding with a sharp generosity, coming alive in thought, and soliciting others to do the same. In her final months, she affirmed the values of thought and love, leaving now a vibrant legacy that will persist and flourish among all whose lives were touched by her life and work.

On his return to Thailand he gained work experience at Siam Makro, a company in which C.P. Group was then a shareholder. He also gained financial experience by working with Soltext Federal Credit Union in the US and Vinylthai, one of Thailand's leading petrochemical companies. He joined TelecomAsia Corporation, Thailand's largest telecommunication company, in 1992 and worked his way up from a Senior Officer to senior management where his positions included chief operations and planning officer, executive vice-president for business, and senior vice-president for planning, project coordination and support.<ref name = TrueDream>Pattanapan Wongpan and Disanee Nakcharoen., Suphachai Chearavanont: Dream Catcher CEO Making of True.{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe also served as chief operations officer of UTV Cable Television and founded a number of subsidiaries for the [[True Corporation|TelecomAsia Group]], such as Asia Wireless Communication Company Limited, a PCT (Person Communication Telephone) operator; Asia Infonet Company Limited, which operates internet businesses; Asia Multimedia Company Limited, a broadband operator; and Wire and Wireless Company Limited, a construction and distribution business.\n\n==Career==\n\n===True Corporation===\n\n====Starting the telecommunications business====\n\nThe years 1992 to 1996 were a boom era for the Thai telecommunications industry. The government had granted concessions to allow the private sector to invest in fixed-line, mobile and other new telecom services. Many private companies received both domestic and overseas loans to invest in the Thai telecom business. C.P. Group was one of the few privately owned Thai companies with the potential to operate such a business and it was invited to compete with foreign companies in a bid for concessions, which C.P. Group won.<ref name = RightMan>Supattha Sukchoo and Napaporn Chaikhankaew, May 3, 2012.  [http://www.gotomanager.com/news/printnews.aspx?id=94068 Print News]</ref>\n\nChearvanont first worked in the company's operations room and gradually gained knowledge about the fixed-line business where he worked as the senior officer for the president's office. He was promoted until he was responsible for managing network rollout, being responsible for the overview of the business and for leading the installation of a network of 2.6 million fixed-line phones. The network was successfully installed within two years.<ref name=\"TrueDream\"/>\n \nAs with most Thai companies, TelecomAsia was affected by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] which saw the Thai Baht collapse from 25 Baht/USD to 55 Baht/USD. The company's debt almost doubled to around 90 billion Baht and it was unable to repay its obligations within the due date and had to negotiate delayed repayment and enter a restructuring process.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nChearvanont explained to creditors that the fixed-line business was still growing and that evolving technology would lead to the development of data services which TelecomAsia would be able to commercially exploit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suphachai Chearavanont l Bio l Cambridge Institute for Family Enterprise - 17 Next Generation Leaders of 2017 |url=https://cfeg.com/nextgenleaders2017/bio/suphachai-chearavanont.html |accessdate=2018-12-17}}</ref>  The creditors approved TelecomAsia's restructured debt-repayment program. Once the economy had recovered from the Asian financial crisis, the company developed a diverse range of new marketing activities which helped improve its financial position and revenue base. In 1999, Chearvanont was promoted to the position of President and CEO.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Recovery and consolidation====\n\nIn 2003, Chearvanont and then TelecomAsia invested heavily in building up the country's third national wireless carrier, over a decade behind competitors. TA Orange grew rapidly during its first years under heavy and innovative marketing campaign. Chearvanont and TA Orange soon ran into trouble when [[France Telecom]] acquired Orange (UK) and France Telecom refused to increase capital and funding into the TA Orange joint venture. TA Orange, thus, was unable to keep up with competitor investments and expand its network fast enough. In 2005, TelecomAsia struck a deal to buy out France Telecom's stake in TA Orange for 1 Thai baht. Upon the buyback of TA Orange, TelecomAsia transformed itself into \"True Corporation\". Chearvanont soon also took a controlling stake in UBC, then the country's leading independent pay TV provider, and transformed it into True Visions.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nUnder Chearvanont's leadership, TelecomAsia transformed from a fixed-line phone provider to Thailand's leading telecommunications conglomerate, being Thailand's largest internet service provider, cable TV and pay TV provider, and the country's third-largest wireless carrier with some 24 million subscribers. In June 2015, Chearvanont was elected President of The Telecommunications Association of Thailand under The Royal Patronage.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Charoen Pokphand Group===\n\nOn January 9, 2017, Chearavanont was appointed CEO with Soopakij Chearavanont appointed as Chairman and [[Dhanin Chearavanont]] progressing towards the position of Senior Chairman of the Charoen Pokphand Group.<ref name=\"XX\">{{Citation |last=Ono |first=Yukako |date=January 17, 2017 |title=CP Group's Dhanin elevates 2 sons to chairman, CEO |publisher=[[Nikkei Asian Review]] |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/CP-Group-s-Dhanin-elevates-2-sons-to-chairman-CEO |accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, Chearavanont was honored by [[Muhammad Yunus]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureate, to give a keynote speech at the closing ceremony of \u20182019 Social Business Day\u2019, marking the ninth time the event was organized and the first of its kind in Thailand.

On his return to Thailand he gained work experience at Siam Makro, a company in which C.P. Group was then a shareholder. He also gained financial experience by working with Soltext Federal Credit Union in the US and Vinylthai, one of Thailand's leading petrochemical companies. He joined TelecomAsia Corporation, Thailand's largest telecommunication company, in 1992 and worked his way up from a Senior Officer to senior management where his positions included chief operations and planning officer, executive vice-president for business, and senior vice-president for planning, project coordination and support.<ref name = TrueDream>Pattanapan Wongpan and Disanee Nakcharoen., Suphachai Chearavanont: Dream Catcher CEO Making of True.{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe also served as chief operations officer of UTV Cable Television and founded a number of subsidiaries for the [[True Corporation|TelecomAsia Group]], such as Asia Wireless Communication Company Limited, a PCT (Person Communication Telephone) operator; Asia Infonet Company Limited, which operates internet businesses; Asia Multimedia Company Limited, a broadband operator; and Wire and Wireless Company Limited, a construction and distribution business.\n\n==Career==\n\n===True Corporation===\n\n====Starting the telecommunications business====\n\nThe years 1992 to 1996 were a boom era for the Thai telecommunications industry. The government had granted concessions to allow the private sector to invest in fixed-line, mobile and other new telecom services. Many private companies received both domestic and overseas loans to invest in the Thai telecom business. C.P. Group was one of the few privately owned Thai companies with the potential to operate such a business and it was invited to compete with foreign companies in a bid for concessions, which C.P. Group won.<ref name = RightMan>Supattha Sukchoo and Napaporn Chaikhankaew, May 3, 2012.  [http://www.gotomanager.com/news/printnews.aspx?id=94068 Print News]</ref>\n\nChearvanont first worked in the company's operations room and gradually gained knowledge about the fixed-line business where he worked as the senior officer for the president's office. He was promoted until he was responsible for managing network rollout, being responsible for the overview of the business and for leading the installation of a network of 2.6 million fixed-line phones. The network was successfully installed within two years.<ref name=\"TrueDream\"/>\n \nAs with most Thai companies, TelecomAsia was affected by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] which saw the Thai Baht collapse from 25 Baht/USD to 55 Baht/USD. The company's debt almost doubled to around 90 billion Baht and it was unable to repay its obligations within the due date and had to negotiate delayed repayment and enter a restructuring process.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nChearvanont explained to creditors that the fixed-line business was still growing and that evolving technology would lead to the development of data services which TelecomAsia would be able to commercially exploit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suphachai Chearavanont l Bio l Cambridge Institute for Family Enterprise - 17 Next Generation Leaders of 2017 |url=https://cfeg.com/nextgenleaders2017/bio/suphachai-chearavanont.html |accessdate=2018-12-17}}</ref>  The creditors approved TelecomAsia's restructured debt-repayment program. Once the economy had recovered from the Asian financial crisis, the company developed a diverse range of new marketing activities which helped improve its financial position and revenue base. In 1999, Chearvanont was promoted to the position of President and CEO.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Recovery and consolidation====\n\nIn 2003, Chearvanont and then TelecomAsia invested heavily in building up the country's third national wireless carrier, over a decade behind competitors. TA Orange grew rapidly during its first years under heavy and innovative marketing campaign. Chearvanont and TA Orange soon ran into trouble when [[France Telecom]] acquired Orange (UK) and France Telecom refused to increase capital and funding into the TA Orange joint venture. TA Orange, thus, was unable to keep up with competitor investments and expand its network fast enough. In 2005, TelecomAsia struck a deal to buy out France Telecom's stake in TA Orange for 1 Thai baht. Upon the buyback of TA Orange, TelecomAsia transformed itself into \"True Corporation\". Chearvanont soon also took a controlling stake in UBC, then the country's leading independent pay TV provider, and transformed it into True Visions.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nUnder Chearvanont's leadership, TelecomAsia transformed from a fixed-line phone provider to Thailand's leading telecommunications conglomerate, being Thailand's largest internet service provider, cable TV and pay TV provider, and the country's third-largest wireless carrier with some 24 million subscribers. In June 2015, Chearvanont was elected President of The Telecommunications Association of Thailand under The Royal Patronage.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Charoen Pokphand Group===\n\nOn January 9, 2017, Chearavanont was appointed CEO with Soopakij Chearavanont appointed as Chairman and [[Dhanin Chearavanont]] progressing towards the position of Senior Chairman of the Charoen Pokphand Group.<ref name=\"XX>{{Citation |last=Ono |first=Yukako |date=January 17, 2017 |title=CP Group's Dhanin elevates 2 sons to chairman, CEO |publisher=[[Nikkei Asian Review]] |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/CP-Group-s-Dhanin-elevates-2-sons-to-chairman-CEO |accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, Chearavanont was honored by [[Muhammad Yunus]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureate, to give a keynote speech at the closing ceremony of \u20182019 Social Business Day\u2019, marking the ninth time the event was organized and the first of its kind in Thailand.
