In 1919, he joined the [[Bolsheviks]] and served in the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. After graduating from [[Frunze Military Academy]] in 1926, Konev gradually rose through the ranks of the Soviet military. By 1939, he had become a candidate to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]].\n\nFollowing the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, Konev took part in a series of major campaigns, including the battles of [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and [[Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942|Rzhev]]. Konev further commanded forces in major Soviet offensives at [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]], in the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive|Dnieper-Carpathian]] and [[Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive|Vistula-Oder]] offensives. In February 1944, he was made a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. In the eve of German defeat, Konev's [[1st Ukrainian Front]] was pitted against the armies of [[Georgy Zhukov]] in the [[Race to Berlin]]. Konev was the first Allied commander to enter [[Prague]], the capital of [[Czechoslovakia]], after the [[Prague uprising]].\n\nAfter the war, Konev replaced Zhukov as commander of Soviet ground forces. In 1956, he was appointed [[Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization|commander of the Warsaw Pact armed forces]], and led the violent suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. Konev remained a popular military figure in the Soviet Union until his death in 1973.\n\n==Early life==\nKonev was born December 28, 1897 in the village of [[Podosinovsky District|Lodeyno]] to a peasant family of Russian ethnicity. Konev graduated from a parish school in the village of Yakovlevskaya Gora in 1906, and later the Nikolo-Pushemsky Zemstvo School in the neighboring village of Schetkino in 1912. At the age of 15, he found work as a forester and lumberjack at [[Podosinovets]] and [[Arkhangelsk]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Ivan Stepanovich Konev 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Konev as a regimental commander]]\nIn the spring of 1916, he was conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army. Konev was sent to the 2nd Heavy Artillery Brigade at Moscow and then graduated from artillery training courses. In 1917, he was sent to the 2nd Separate Heavy Artillery Battalion on the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] as a junior sergeant and fought in the [[Kerensky Offensive]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] broke out in 1917 he was demobilised and returned home, but in 1919 he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik party]] and the [[Red Army]], serving as an artilleryman. During the [[Russian Civil War]] he served with the Red Army in the Russian [[Far Eastern Republic]]. His commander at this time was [[Kliment Voroshilov]], later a close colleague of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Commissar]] for defence. This alliance was the key to Konev's subsequent career.\n\nIn 1926 Konev completed advanced officer training courses at the [[Frunze Military Academy]], and between then and 1931 he held a series of progressively more senior commands, becoming head of first the [[Transbaikal]] then the [[North Caucasus Military District]]s. In July 1938 he was appointed commander of the [[2nd Red Banner Army]]. In 1937 he became a Deputy of the [[Supreme Soviet]] and in 1939 a candidate member of the Party [[Central Committee]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=698|website = warheroes.ru|access-date = 19 February 2016|language = Russian|trans-title = Konev Ivan Stepanovich}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Ivan Konev 1945.jpg|thumb|upright|Konev on the Eastern Front, 1945]]\nWhen [[Nazi Germany]] [[invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Konev was assigned command of the [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th Army]] in the [[Vitebsk]] region, and waged a series of defensive battles during the Red Army's retreat, first to [[Smolensk]] and then to the approaches to Moscow.\n\nHe commanded the [[Kalinin Front]] from October 1941<ref name=GeorgyZhukov>{{Cite book |last=Zhukov |first=Georgy |title=Marshal of Victory, Volume II |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]] Ltd. |year=1974 |ISBN=9781781592915 |page=26}}</ref> to August 1942, playing a key role in the fighting around [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and the [[Soviet counter-offensive during the winter of 1941\u201342]]. For his role in the successful defence of the Soviet capital, Stalin promoted Konev to Colonel-General. In the summer of 1942 Konev led the Kalinin Front and later the Western front in the [[Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942|battle on the Rzhev salient]].<ref>Gerasimova, Rzhev Slaughterhouse, p. 172.</ref>\n\nKonev held \"[[Front (military formation)|Front]]\" (army group) commands for the rest of the war. He commanded the [[Soviet Western Front]] until February 1943, the [[North-Western Front]] February\u2013July 1943, and the [[2nd Ukrainian Front]] from July 1943 (later further the [[1st Ukrainian Front]]) until May 1945.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:\u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432.jpg|thumb|Konev as commander of the [[Steppe Front]] with [[Georgy Zhukov]] during the Battle of Kursk, 1943]]\nHe participated in the [[Battle of Kursk]], commanding the southern part of the Soviet counter-offensive, the Steppe Front, where he was an active and energetic exponent of [[Russian military deception|maskirovka]], the use of [[military camouflage]] and [[military deception|deception]].<ref name=Glantz153>Glantz, 1989. P. 153.</ref> Among the ''maskirovka'' measures he adopted to achieve tactical surprise were the camouflaging of defence lines and depots; dummy units and supply points; a dummy air defence network; and the use of reconnaissance units to verify the quality of his army's camouflage and deception works. In David Glantz's view, Konev's forces \"generated a major portion of the element of surprise\".<ref name=Glantz153/>\n\nThe result was that the Germans seriously underestimated the strength of the Soviet defences. The commander of 19 Panzer, [[Gustav Schmidt (general)|General G. Schmidt]], wrote that \"We did not assume that there was even one fourth [of the Russian strength] of what we had to encounter\".<ref>Glantz, 1989. Pp. 153\u2013154.</ref>\n\nAfter the victory at Kursk, Konev's armies retook [[Belgorod]], [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Kiev]]. The subsequent Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive led to the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] which took place from 24 January to 16 February 1944. The offensive was part of the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]]. In it, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, commanded, respectively, by [[Nikolai Vatutin]] and Konev, trapped German forces of [[Army Group South]] in a pocket or cauldron west of the [[Dnieper river]]. During weeks of fighting, the two Red Army Fronts tried to eradicate the pocket; the subsequent [[Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Korsun battle]] eliminated the cauldron. According to [[Milovan Djilas]], Konev openly boasted of his killing of thousands{{source needed|date=April 2020}} of German prisoners of war: \"The cavalry finally finished them off. 'We let the Cossacks cut up as long as they wished. They even hacked off the hands of those who raised them to surrender' the Marshal recounted with a smile.\"<ref name=\"Djilas\">Djilas p. 54</ref>\n\n[[File:Prague liberation 1945 konev.jpg|thumb|Konev at the liberation of Prague by the Red Army in May 1945.]]\nFor his achievements in the Ukraine (and ignoring his atrocities{{source needed|date=April 2020}}), Konev was promoted by Stalin to [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] in February 1944. He was one of Stalin's favourite generals and one of the few senior commanders whom even Stalin admired for his ruthlessness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=35|title=Ivan Konev|last=Chen|first=Peter|date=|website=World War II Database|access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1944 Konev's armies advanced from [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] into [[Poland]] and later into [[Czechoslovakia]]. In May he participated in an unsuccessful invasion of the [[Balkans]], (the [[first Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]]) together with Generals [[Rodion Malinovsky]] and [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]].\n\nBy July he had advanced to the [[Vistula]] River in central Poland, and was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. In September 1944 his forces, now designated the [[4th Ukrainian Front|Fourth Ukrainian Front]], advanced into [[Slovakia]] and helped the Slovak partisans in their rebellion against German occupation.\n\nIn January 1945 Konev, together with [[Georgy Zhukov]], commanded the Soviet armies which launched [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|the massive winter offensive]] in western Poland, driving the German forces from the Vistula to the [[Oder River]]. In southern Poland his armies seized [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Soviet historians, and generally Russian sources, claimed that Konev preserved Krak\u00f3w from Nazi-planned destruction by ordering a lightning attack on the city.<ref name=Gareev>[[Makhmut Gareev]], [http://www.redstar.ru/55_yar/12_04_1.html Marshal Konev] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013152242/http://redstar.ru/55_yar/12_04_1.html |date=13 October 2007 }}, ''[[Krasnaia Zvezda]]'', 12 April 2001</ref> Konev's January 1945 offensive also prevented planned destruction of the [[Silesia]]n industry by the retreating Germans.\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u0438 24 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 1945 \u0433.

Konev's forces entered the city first, but Stalin gave Zhukov the honour of [[Battle of Berlin|capturing Berlin]] and hoisting the Soviet flag over the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]]. Konev was ordered to the south-west, where his forces linked up with elements of the [[United States Army]] at [[Elbe Day|Torgau]] and also retook [[Prague]] shortly after the official surrender of the German forces.\n\n===Post-war career===\nAfter the war Konev was appointed head of the Soviet occupation forces in [[East Germany|Eastern Germany]] and also Allied High Commissioner for [[Austria]]. In 1946 he became commander of Soviet ground forces and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, replacing Zhukov. He held these posts until 1950, when he was appointed commander of the [[Carpathian Military District]].\n\nAfter Stalin's death, however, Konev returned to prominence. He became a key ally of the new Party leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], being entrusted with the trial of the Stalinist police chief, [[Lavrenty Beria]] in 1953. He was again appointed First Deputy Minister of Defense and commander of Soviet ground forces, posts he held until 1956, when he was named [[Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization|Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact]]. Shortly after his appointment he led the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]].\n\n[[File:Szent Istv\u00e1n k\u00f6r\u00fat a Falk Miksa (N\u00e9phadsereg) utca fel\u0151l a Honv\u00e9d utca fel\u00e9 n\u00e9zve.

In 1961\u201362, however, he was recalled and was again commander of the Soviet forces in East Germany. He was then appointed to the largely ceremonial post of Inspector-General of the Defense Ministry.\n\nFollowing the [[Prague Spring]], Konev headed a delegation that visited Czechoslovakia in May 1968, ostensibly to celebrate the anniversary of the Soviet victory during World War II. Konev visited military units in Czechia in order to obtain first-hand information to better assess the situation in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaimakov|first=Anton|url=https://www.radio.cz/ru/rubrika/tema/marshal-konev-i-vtorzhenie-1968-neperevernutaya-stranica-istorii|title=\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430\u043b \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432 \u0438 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 1968|date=19 June 2018|work=Czech Radio|access-date=11 April 2020|url-status=live|language=Russian|trans-title=Marshal Konev and the invasion of 1968}}</ref>\n\nKonev remained one of the Soviet Union's most admired military figures until his death in 1973.

It was later translated into English in the same year and published by [[Progress Publishers]], Moscow. This work discusses Konev's taking of Berlin, Prague, his work with Zhukov, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], his field meeting with General [[Omar Bradley]] and [[Jascha Heifetz]]. In English, the book was titled ''I. Konev&nbsp;\u2013 Year of Victory''.

In 1919, he joined the [[Bolsheviks]] and served in the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. After graduating from [[Frunze Military Academy]] in 1926, Konev gradually rose through the ranks of the Soviet military. By 1939, he had become a candidate to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]].\n\nFollowing the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, Konev took part in a series of major campaigns, including the battles of [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and [[Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942|Rzhev]]. Konev further commanded forces in major Soviet offensives at [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]], in the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive|Dnieper-Carpathian]] and [[Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive|Vistula-Oder]] offensives. In February 1944, he was made a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. In the eve of German defeat, Konev's [[1st Ukrainian Front]] was pitted against the armies of [[Georgy Zhukov]] in the [[Race to Berlin]]. Konev was the first Allied commander to enter [[Prague]], the capital of [[Czechoslovakia]], after the [[Prague uprising]].\n\nAfter the war, Konev replaced Zhukov as commander of Soviet ground forces. In 1956, he was appointed [[Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization|commander of the Warsaw Pact armed forces]], and led the violent suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. Konev remained a popular military figure in the Soviet Union until his death in 1973.\n\n==Early life==\nKonev was born December 28, 1897 in the village of [[Podosinovsky District|Lodeyno]] to a peasant family of Russian ethnicity. Konev graduated from a parish school in the village of Yakovlevskaya Gora in 1906, and later the Nikolo-Pushemsky Zemstvo School in the neighboring village of Schetkino in 1912.

Konev was sent to the 2nd Heavy Artillery Brigade at Moscow and then graduated from artillery training courses. In 1917, he was sent to the 2nd Separate Heavy Artillery Battalion on the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] as a junior sergeant and fought in the [[Kerensky Offensive]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] broke out in 1917 he was demobilised and returned home, but in 1919 he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik party]] and the [[Red Army]], serving as an artilleryman. During the [[Russian Civil War]] he served with the Red Army in the Russian [[Far Eastern Republic]]. His commander at this time was [[Kliment Voroshilov]], later a close colleague of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Commissar]] for defence. This alliance was the key to Konev's subsequent career.\n\nIn 1926 Konev completed advanced officer training courses at the [[Frunze Military Academy]], and between then and 1931 he held a series of progressively more senior commands, becoming head of first the [[Transbaikal]] then the [[North Caucasus Military District]]s. In July 1938 he was appointed commander of the [[2nd Red Banner Army]]. In 1937 he became a Deputy of the [[Supreme Soviet]] and in 1939 a candidate member of the Party [[Central Committee]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=698|website = warheroes.ru|access-date = 19 February 2016|language = Russian|trans-title = Konev Ivan Stepanovich}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Ivan Konev 1945.jpg|thumb|upright|Konev on the Eastern Front, 1945]]\nWhen [[Nazi Germany]] [[invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Konev was assigned command of the [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th Army]] in the [[Vitebsk]] region, and waged a series of defensive battles during the Red Army's retreat, first to [[Smolensk]] and then to the approaches to Moscow.\n\nHe commanded the [[Kalinin Front]] from October 1941<ref name=GeorgyZhukov>{{Cite book |last=Zhukov |first=Georgy |title=Marshal of Victory, Volume II |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]] Ltd. |year=1974 |ISBN=9781781592915 |page=26}}</ref> to August 1942, playing a key role in the fighting around [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and the [[Soviet counter-offensive during the winter of 1941\u201342]]. For his role in the successful defence of the Soviet capital, Stalin promoted Konev to Colonel-General. In the summer of 1942 Konev led the Kalinin Front and later the Western front in the [[Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942|battle on the Rzhev salient]].<ref>Gerasimova, Rzhev Slaughterhouse, p. 172.</ref>\n\nKonev held \"[[Front (military formation)|Front]]\" (army group) commands for the rest of the war. He commanded the [[Soviet Western Front]] until February 1943, the [[North-Western Front]] February\u2013July 1943, and the [[2nd Ukrainian Front]] from July 1943 (later further the [[1st Ukrainian Front]]) until May 1945.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:\u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432.jpg|thumb|Konev as commander of the [[Steppe Front]] with [[Georgy Zhukov]] during the Battle of Kursk, 1943]]\nHe participated in the [[Battle of Kursk]], commanding the southern part of the Soviet counter-offensive, the Steppe Front, where he was an active and energetic exponent of [[Russian military deception|maskirovka]], the use of [[military camouflage]] and [[military deception|deception]].<ref name=Glantz153>Glantz, 1989. P. 153.</ref> Among the ''maskirovka'' measures he adopted to achieve tactical surprise were the camouflaging of defence lines and depots; dummy units and supply points; a dummy air defence network; and the use of reconnaissance units to verify the quality of his army's camouflage and deception works. In David Glantz's view, Konev's forces \"generated a major portion of the element of surprise\".<ref name=Glantz153/>\n\nThe result was that the Germans seriously underestimated the strength of the Soviet defences. The commander of 19 Panzer, [[Gustav Schmidt (general)|General G. Schmidt]], wrote that \"We did not assume that there was even one fourth [of the Russian strength] of what we had to encounter\".<ref>Glantz, 1989. Pp. 153\u2013154.</ref>\n\nAfter the victory at Kursk, Konev's armies retook [[Belgorod]], [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Kiev]]. The subsequent Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive led to the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] which took place from 24 January to 16 February 1944. The offensive was part of the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]]. In it, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, commanded, respectively, by [[Nikolai Vatutin]] and Konev, trapped German forces of [[Army Group South]] in a pocket or cauldron west of the [[Dnieper river]]. During weeks of fighting, the two Red Army Fronts tried to eradicate the pocket; the subsequent [[Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Korsun battle]] eliminated the cauldron. According to [[Milovan Djilas]], Konev openly boasted of his killing of thousands{{source needed|date=April 2020}} of German prisoners of war: \"The cavalry finally finished them off. 'We let the Cossacks cut up as long as they wished. They even hacked off the hands of those who raised them to surrender' the Marshal recounted with a smile.\"<ref name=\"Djilas\">Djilas p. 54</ref>\n\n[[File:Prague liberation 1945 konev.jpg|thumb|Konev at the liberation of Prague by the Red Army in May 1945.]]\nFor his achievements in the Ukraine (and ignoring his atrocities{{source needed|date=April 2020}}), Konev was promoted by Stalin to [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] in February 1944.

In May he participated in an unsuccessful invasion of the [[Balkans]], (the [[first Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]]) together with Generals [[Rodion Malinovsky]] and [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]].\n\nBy July he had advanced to the [[Vistula]] River in central Poland, and was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. In September 1944 his forces, now designated the [[4th Ukrainian Front|Fourth Ukrainian Front]], advanced into [[Slovakia]] and helped the Slovak partisans in their rebellion against German occupation.\n\nIn January 1945 Konev, together with [[Georgy Zhukov]], commanded the Soviet armies which launched [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|the massive winter offensive]] in western Poland, driving the German forces from the Vistula to the [[Oder River]]. In southern Poland his armies seized [[Krak\u00f3w]].

Konev's forces entered the city first, but Stalin gave Zhukov the honour of [[Battle of Berlin|capturing Berlin]] and hoisting the Soviet flag over the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]]. Konev was ordered to the south-west, where his forces linked up with elements of the [[United States Army]] at [[Elbe Day|Torgau]] and also retook [[Prague]] shortly after the official surrender of the German forces.\n\n===Post-war career===\nAfter the war Konev was appointed head of the Soviet occupation forces in [[East Germany|Eastern Germany]] and also Allied High Commissioner for [[Austria]]. In 1946 he became commander of Soviet ground forces and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, replacing Zhukov. He held these posts until 1950, when he was appointed commander of the [[Carpathian Military District]].\n\nAfter Stalin's death, however, Konev returned to prominence. He became a key ally of the new Party leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], being entrusted with the trial of the Stalinist police chief, [[Lavrenty Beria]] in 1953. He was again appointed First Deputy Minister of Defense and commander of Soviet ground forces, posts he held until 1956, when he was named [[Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization|Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact]]. Shortly after his appointment he led the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]].\n\n[[File:Szent Istv\u00e1n k\u00f6r\u00fat a Falk Miksa (N\u00e9phadsereg) utca fel\u0151l a Honv\u00e9d utca fel\u00e9 n\u00e9zve.

In 1961\u201362, however, he was recalled and was again commander of the Soviet forces in East Germany. He was then appointed to the largely ceremonial post of Inspector-General of the Defense Ministry.\n\nFollowing the [[Prague Spring]], Konev headed a delegation that visited Czechoslovakia in May 1968, ostensibly to celebrate the anniversary of the Soviet victory during World War II. Konev visited military units in Czechia in order to obtain first-hand information to better assess the situation in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaimakov|first=Anton|url=https://www.radio.cz/ru/rubrika/tema/marshal-konev-i-vtorzhenie-1968-neperevernutaya-stranica-istorii|title=\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430\u043b \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432 \u0438 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 1968|date=19 June 2018|work=Czech Radio|access-date=11 April 2020|url-status=live|language=Russian|trans-title=Marshal Konev and the invasion of 1968}}</ref>\n\nKonev remained one of the Soviet Union's most admired military figures until his death in 1973.

Filipino Religious Consciousness. Quezon City: Institute for Studies in Asian Church and Culture.</ref>\n\n== Cosmology ==\nUnlike early western religions, with their great emphasis on pantheons of deities. Religion among Tagalogs was intimately intertwined with their day-to-day lives, as Almocera points out:<blockquote>''Aside from their own social structure, they believed in an invisible society coexisting with their own. This society, they believed, was inhabited by spirits that included dead ancestors, deities, and lesser gods.  Pre-Hispanic Filipinos honored these spirits with rituals and feast days because these supernatural beings were considered able to preside over the whole gamut of life, including birth, sickness, death, courtship, marriage, planting, harvesting, and death.  Some of these spirits were considered friendly; others were viewed as tyrannical enemies.''<ref name=\"Almocera2005\"/></blockquote>\n\nAncient Tagalogs initially believed that the first deity of the sun and moon was [[Bathala]], as he is a primordial deity and the deity of everything. Later on, the title of deity of the moon was passed on to his favorite daughter, Mayari, while the title of deity of the sun was passed on to his grandson and honorary son, Apolaki. One of his daughters, [[Tala (goddess)|Tala]] is the deity of the stars and is the primary deity of the constellations, while Hanan was the deity of mornings and the new age. The Tagalog cosmic beliefs is not exempted from the moon-swallowing serpent myths prevalent throughout the different ethnic peoples of the Philippines. But unlike the moon-swallowing serpent stories of other ethnic peoples, which usually portrays the serpent as a god, the Tagalog people believe that the serpent which causes eclipses is a monster dragon, called ''Laho'', instead. The dragon, despite being strong, can easily be defeated by Mayari, the reason why the moon's darkness during eclipses is diminishes within minutes.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/laho-moon-eater/</ref>\n\n== \"Pag-aanito\": \"offering\" or \"act of worship\" ==\nBecause of the limitations of language and of personal religious biases, Spanish chroniclers often recorded different interpretations of Tagalog words relating to worship. The word \"anito\" is one of these words which had differing interpreters. Scott<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> notes that missionaries eventually reinterpreted the word to mean \"all idols\", including the middle eastern gods mentioned in the bible, whenever they were included in their homilies. As a result, in modern times, the word \"anito\" has come to mean the various figurines or \"idols\" which represent Filipino deities. However, the Tagalog words for such representations was \"''larauan''\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\nIn his 1613 Dictionary ''[[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]]'', Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\">{{cite book | title=Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala | author=Buenaventura , Pedro de San | authorlink=Pedro de San Buenaventura | year=1613 | location=[[Pila, Laguna]]}}</ref>{{rp|page=361}} explains:<blockquote>''More appropriately  would it be called an offering because ''\"anito\"'' does not signify any particular thing, such as an idol, but an offering and the prayer  they would make to deceased friends and relatives... [or] an offering made to anything they finished, like a boat, house, fishnet, etc., and it was mats, cooked foodk, gold, and other things.''</blockquote>\n\nThe unnamed author of the anonymous 1572 \"''Relaci\u00f3n de la conquista de la isla de Luz\u00f3n''\" (translated in Volume 3 of Blair and Robertson),<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\">{{Cite book|title=Relation of the Conquest of the Island of Luzon|work=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898|publisher=Arthur H.

When the guests are all assembled and the feast set forth in a few plates on the ground inside the house, they seat themselves also on the ground to eat. In the midst of the feast (called manganito or bayl\u00e1n in their tongue), they put the idol called Batala and certain aged women who are considered as priestesses, and some aged Indians\u2014neither more nor less. They offer the idol some of the food which they are eating, and call upon him in their tongue, praying to him for the health of the sick man for whom the feast is held. The natives of these islands have no altars nor temples whatever. This manganito, or drunken revel, to give it a better name, usually lasts seven or eight days; and when it is finished they take the idols and put them in the corners of the house, and keep them there without showing them any reverence.\"''</blockquote>\n\n== \"Bathala\": the \"almighty\" or \"creator\" ==\n{{main|Bathala}}\nAccording to the early Spanish missionaries, the Tagalog people believed in a creator-god named \"''Bathala''\",<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> whom they referred to both as ''maylicha'' (creator; lit. \"actor of creation\") and ''maycapal'' (lord, or almighty; lit. \"actor of power\"). Loarca and Chirino reported that in some places, this creator god was called \"''Molaiari''\" (Malyari) or \"''Dioata''\" (Diwata).<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott (1989) notes:<blockquote>''\"Bathala was described as \"may kapal sa lahat [maker of everything],\" kapal meaning to mould something between the hands like clay or wax.\"''<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/></blockquote>\n\nFrancisco Demetrio, Gilda Cordero Fernando, and Fernando Nakpil Zialcita summarize a number of Tagalog beliefs regarding Bathala: <blockquote>\"''The Tagalogs called their supreme god Bathala Maykapal or Lumikha (The Creator). An enormous being, he could not straighten up due to the lowness of the sky. And the sun burned brightly near him. One day, Bathala got a bolo and pierced one of the sun's eyes so that it could generate just enough heat to sustain life. At last, Bathala was able to straighten up and with his hands pushed the cooler sky to its present level. Bathala is also known as the grand conserver of the universe, the caretaker of things from whom all providence comes, hence the beautiful word 'bahala' or 'mabahala' meaning 'to care'.''\"</blockquote>\n\nThe missionaries who observed the Tagalog peoples in the 1500s noted, however that the Tagalogs did not include Bathala in their daily acts of worship (pag-a-anito). Fray Buenaventura noted in the [[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]] that the Tagalogs believed Bathala was too mighty and distant to be bothered with the concerns of mortal man, and so the Tagalogs focused their acts of appeasement to the immediate spirits which they believed had control over their day-to-day life.<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\n== Other deities and powers ==\nBecause Bathala was considered a \"distant\" entity, the Tagalog people focused their attention more on some scholars term to be \"lesser\" deities and powers,<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> which could be more easily influenced than Bathala.<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\nBecause the Tagalogs did not have a collective word to describe all these spirits together, Spanish missionaries eventually decided to call them \"anito,\" since they were the subject of the Tagalog's act of ''pag-aanito'' (worship). According to Scott, a careful search of sources from the 1500s reveals that:<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><blockquote>''\"there was no single word in Tagalog for the other deities to whom Bathala was superior: when necessary, Spanish lexicographers referred to them all as anito.\"''<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Scott, accounts and early dictionaries describe them as intermediaries (\"Bathala's agents\"), and the dictionaries used the word \"abogado\" (advocate) when defining their realms. These sources also show, however, that in practice, they were addressed directly: \"''in actual prayers, they were petitioned directly, not as intermediaries.''\" Scott cites the example of a farmer's prayer to Lakapati, where a child would be held over a field, and the farmer would pray: \"''Lakapati, pakanin mo yaring alipin mo; huwag mong gutumin'' [Lakapati feed this thy slave; let him not hunger]\"<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/>{{rp|page=361}}\n\nDemetrio, Fernando and Zialcita, in their 1991 reader \"The Soul Book\", categorize these spirits broadly into \"Ancestor spirits\" and \"non-ancestor spirits, but then further sub-categorize them into: \"Ancestor spirits, nature spirits, and guardian spirits.\"<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/>\n\n=== Tagalog spirits described in early firsthand accounts===\nScott, drawing from firsthand accounts and descriptions in early dictionaries, describes some of these Tagalog spirits specifically:\n* '''Lakan Bakod''' was \"''the lord of fences (bakod),\"''and ''\"was invoked to keep animals out of swiddens''\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott quotes San Buenaventura<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/>{{rp|page=361}} as saying Lakanbakod's larauan (image/idol) \"''had gilded genitals as long as a rice stalk\", and \"was offered eels when fencing swiddens - because, they said, his were the strongest of all fences.''\" \n* '''Aman Sinaya''' was an ancestor spirit who was invoked by Fishermen as a guardian spirit. Scott notes that he was \"the inventor of fishing gear, [and] was named when first wetting a net or fish hook\"<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Lakapati''' \"was worhipped in the fields at planting time\" and \"was fittingly represented by a hermaphrodite image with both male and female parts\"<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Aman Ikabli''', the patron of hunters\n* '''Dian Masalanta''', the patron of lovers and childbirth. \n* '''Mankukutod''', protector of coconut palms, given an offering by Tuba tappers before climbing a tree,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> lest they fall from the trunk.  \n* '''Uwinan Sana''', guardian of grasslands or forests,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> acknowledged as overlord of grasslands or forests whenever entering them, to avoid being regarded as trespassers.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Lakambini''', the advocate (Spanish dictionaries used the term \"abogado\")<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> of the throat, was invoked in case of throat ailments.\n* '''Haik''', the sea God, called upon by seamen in a major ceremony,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> asking for fair weather and favorable winds.  \n* lesser deities like '''Linga''' and '''Bibit''', who caused illness if not given recognition in the ordinary course of daily activities.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n== Katalonan (priests or priestess) ==\n{{main|Katalonan}}\nThe priest or priestess of the Tagalogs and Kapampangans were called \"Katalonan\" (also spelled Catalonan; or Catulunan in [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]), and was equivalent of the [[Visayans|Visayan]] term \"[[Babaylan]].\" The term apparently springs from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word \"''katalo''\", which means \"''in good terms with'',\" such that the Catalonan are those \"in good terms with the [[Anito]] spirits\".<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\nHistorian and Spanish Missionary [[Pedro Chirino|Pedro Chirino, SJ]] noted that their long hair is a symbol of their commitment to their religion.<ref name=\"Chirino1604\">Chirino, Pedro (1604).

Although the behaviors of numerous birds and lizards were said to be omens, particular attention was paid to the tigmamanukan.\n\nAccording to San Buenaventura's Dictionary,<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/> the Tagalogs believed that the direction of a tigmamanukan flying across one's path at the beginning a journey indicated the undertaking's result. If it flew from right to left, the expedition would be a success. This sign was called \"''labay''\", a term still present in some Filipino languages with the meaning \"proceed\". If the bird flew from left to right, the travelers would surely never return.\n\nIt was also said that if a hunter caught a tigmamanukan in a trap, they would cut its beak and release it, saying \"''Kita ay iwawala, kun akoy mey kakawnan, lalabay ka.''\" (\"You are free, so when I set forth, sing on the right.\")\n\nWhile the name \"tigmamanukan\" is no longer used today, some early western explorers say that the specific bird referred to by the name is a fairy bluebird (genus ''[[fairy-bluebird|Irena]]'', family ''[[Irenidae]]'').

The first is known as the ''kakambal'' (literally means twin), which is the soul of the living. Every time a person sleeps, the ''kakambal'' may travel to many mundane and supernatural places which sometimes leads to nightmares if a terrible event is encountered while the ''kakambal'' is travelling. When a person dies, the ''kakambal'' is ultimately transformed into the second form of the Tagalog soul, which is the ''kaluluwa'' (literally means spirit). In traditional Tagalog religion, the ''kaluluwa'' then travels to either ''Kasanaan'' (if the person was evil when he was living) or ''Maca'' (if the person was good when he was living). Both domains are ruled by [[Bathala]], though Kasanaan is also ruled by the deity of souls.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref>\n\nDue to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was forcefully introduced to the Tagalog. In Roman Catholicism, a good person is sent to Heaven while a bad person is sent to Hell to burn in scalding oil.\n\n== Dream beliefs ==\nThe Tagalog people traditionally believe that when a person sleeps, he may or may not dream the omens of [[Bathala]]. The omens are either hazy illusions within a dream, the appearance of an omen creature such as [[tigmamanukan]], or sightings from the future. The dream omens do not leave traces on what a person must do to prevent or let the dream come true as it is up to the person to make the proper actions to prevent or make the dream come true. The omen dreams are only warnings and possibilities 'drafted by Bathala'.\n\nAdditionally, a person may sometimes encounter nightmares in dreams. There are two reasons why nightmares occur, the first is when the ''kakambal'' soul encounters a terrifying event while travelling from the body, or when a ''[[Batibat|bangungot]]'' creature sits on top of the sleeping person in a bid of vengeance due to the cutting of her tree home. Majority of the nightmares are said to be due to the ''kakambal'' soul encountering terrifying events while travelling.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref><ref>https://vanwinkles.com/11-mythical-sleep-creatures-from-around-the-world</ref>\n\n== Traditional burial practices ==\nThe Tagalog people had numerous burial practices prior to Spanish colonization and Catholic introduction. In rural areas of [[Cavite]], trees are used as burial places. The dying person chooses the tree beforehand, thus when he or she becomes terminally ill or is evidently going to die because old age, a hut is built close to the said tree. The deceased's corpse is then entombed vertically inside the hollowed-out tree trunk. Before colonization, a statue known as ''likha'' is also entombed with the dead inside the tree trunk. In [[Mulanay, Quezon]] and nearby areas, the dead are entombed inside limestone sarcophagi along with a ''likha'' statue. However, the practice vanished in the 16th century due to Spanish colonization. In [[Calatagan, Batangas]] and nearby areas, the dead are buried under the earth along with ''likha'' statues. The statues, measuring 6-12 inches, are personified depictions of ''anitos''. ''Likha'' statues are not limited to burial practices as they are also used in homes, prayers, agriculture, medicine, travel, and other means.<ref name=\"DPPS\">Tacio, Henrylito D.

Jocano (2001) notes:<blockquote>''\"Except for a few artifacts and identified loanwords that have been accepted as proofs of Indian-Philippine relations, there are meager intrusive materials to sustain definite views concerning the range of Indian prehistoric influence in the country. Many generalizations [that] have so far been advanced merely obscure the basic issues of Philippine cultural development. Even archeological data, mostly trade items, must be critically evaluated before they are judged as evidence of direct contacts.\"''<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|pages=138\u2013139}}</blockquote>\n\nHe notes that the various streams of the evidence which support the assertion that this influence reached the Philippines include:<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/> ''\"Syllabic writing; artifacts in the form of different figurines made of clay, gold, and bronze that were dug in various sites in the Philippines; and 336 loanwords identified by Professor Francisco to be Sanskrit in origin, with 150 of them identified as the origin of some major Philippine terms.\"''\n\nRegardless of how and when it actually happened, historiographers specializing in Southeast Asia note that this \"influence\" was cultural and religious, rather than military or political in nature. For example, Osborne, in his 2004 history of Southeast Asia, notes:<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/>{{rp|page=23}}<blockquote>''Beginning in the 2nd and third centuries C.E. there was a slow expansion of [Indian] cultural contacts with the Southeast Asian region. It was an uneven process, with some areas receiving Indian influence much later than others, and the degree of influence varying from century to century. [...]Indianization did not mean there was a mass migration of Indian population into sea. Rather, a relatively limited number of traders and priest scholars brought Indian culture in its various forms to Southeast Asia where much, but not all, of this culture was absorbed by the local population and joined to their existing cultural patterns.''</blockquote>\n\nOsborne further emphasizes that this \"indianization\" of Southeast Asia did not per-se overwrite existing indigenous patterns, cultures, and beliefs: <blockquote>\"''Because Indian culture \u201ccame\u201d to Southeast Asia, one must not think that Southeast Asians lacked a culture of their own. Indeed, the generally accepted view is that Indian culture made such an impact on Southeast Asia because it fitted easily with the existing cultural patterns and religious beliefs of populations that had already moved a considerable distance along the path of civilization.[\u2026] Southeast Asians, to summarize the point, borrowed but they also adapted. In some very important cases, they did not need to borrow at all.''\"<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/>{{rp|page=24}}</blockquote>\n\nHistoriographers, both from Southeast Asia in general,<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> and the Philippines specifically<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Jocano2001\">{{cite book  | last = Jocano  | first = F.

For a different reason \u2013 distant geographical location \u2013 neither did the Philippines participate in this process.\"''</blockquote>\n\nJocano furthers:<blockquote>''\"The Philippines is geographically outside the direct line of early commerce between India and the rest of Southeast Asia. Moreover, the island world of Indonesia, with Sumatra and Java controlling the traffic of trade, functioned as a sieve for whatever influence (cultural, social, and commercial) India might have had to offer beyond the Indonesian archipelago.[...]Thus, it can be said that Indian Influence filtered into the Philippines only indirectly.''\"<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|page=139}}</blockquote>\n\nAfter reviewing threads of evidence for the various views concerning the date and mechanism of \"Indian prehistoric influence in the country\", Jocano concludes: <blockquote>''\"Philippine-Indonesian relations during precolonial times became intensified during the rise of the Madjapahit Empire. It was during this time that much of the so-called Indian cultural influence reached the Philippines through Indonesia. But what penetrated into our country, particularly in the seaport communities, was already the modified version of the original Hindu cultural traits.\"''<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|page=142}}</blockquote>\n\n\n\nFray Diego de Herrera noted that inhabitants in some villages were \"Muslim in name only\", and sborne also notes that the Luzones who visited [[Portuguese Malacca]] in the 1510s to 1540s were \"nominally Muslim\".<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> The unnamed author of the Anonymous 1572 ''Relaci\u00f3n''<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/> goes into further detail:<blockquote>''\"In the villages nearest the sea some do not eat pork, the reason for their not eating it, which I have already given, being that, in trading with the Moros of Burney, the latter have preached to them some part of the nefarious doctrine of Mahoma, charging them not to eat pork. [....] When[...]any of them are asked why they do not eat it, they say that they do not know why; and if one asks them who Mahoma was and what his law commands, they say that they do not know the commandment or anything about Mahoma, not even his name; nor do they know what his law is, nor whence it came. It is true that some of them who have been in Burney understand some of it, and are able to read a few words of the Alcor\u00e1n; but these are very few, and believe that he who has not been in Burney may eat pork, as I have heard many of them say.\"''<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Present day beliefs ==\nModern day scholars such as Scott,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Jocano,<ref name=\"Jocano1975\">F.

Religion among Tagalogs was intimately intertwined with their day-to-day lives, as Almocera points out:<blockquote>''Aside from their own social structure, they believed in an invisible society coexisting with their own. This society, they believed, was inhabited by spirits that included dead ancestors, deities, and lesser gods.  Pre-Hispanic Filipinos honored these spirits with rituals and feast days because these supernatural beings were considered able to preside over the whole gamut of life, including birth, sickness, death, courtship, marriage, planting, harvesting, and death.  Some of these spirits were considered friendly; others were viewed as tyrannical enemies.''<ref name=\"Almocera2005\"/></blockquote>\n\nAncient Tagalogs initially believed that the first deity of the sun and moon was [[Bathala]], as he is a primordial deity and the deity of everything. Later on, the title of deity of the moon was passed on to his favorite daughter, Mayari, while the title of deity of the sun was passed on to his grandson and honorary son, Apolaki. One of his daughters, [[Tala (goddess)|Tala]] is the deity of the stars and is the primary deity of the constellations, while Hanan was the deity of mornings and the new age. The Tagalog cosmic beliefs is not exempted from the moon-swallowing serpent myths prevalent throughout the different ethnic peoples of the Philippines. But unlike the moon-swallowing serpent stories of other ethnic peoples, which usually portrays the serpent as a god, the Tagalog people believe that the serpent which causes eclipses is a monster dragon, called ''Laho'', instead. The dragon, despite being strong, can easily be defeated by Mayari, the reason why the moon's darkness during eclipses is diminishes within minutes.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/laho-moon-eater/</ref>\n\n== \"Pag-aanito\": \"offering\" or \"act of worship\" ==\nBecause of the limitations of language and of personal religious biases, Spanish chroniclers often recorded different interpretations of Tagalog words relating to worship. The word \"anito\" is one of these words which had differing interpreters. Scott<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> notes that missionaries eventually reinterpreted the word to mean \"all idols\", including the middle eastern gods mentioned in the bible, whenever they were included in their homilies. As a result, in modern times, the word \"anito\" has come to mean the various figurines or \"idols\" which represent Filipino deities. However, the Tagalog words for such representations was \"''larauan''\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\nIn his 1613 Dictionary ''[[Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala]]'', Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\">{{cite book | title=Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala | author=Buenaventura , Pedro de San | authorlink=Pedro de San Buenaventura | year=1613 | location=[[Pila, Laguna]]}}</ref>{{rp|page=361}} explains:<blockquote>''More appropriately  would it be called an offering because ''\"anito\"'' does not signify any particular thing, such as an idol, but an offering and the prayer  they would make to deceased friends and relatives... [or] an offering made to anything they finished, like a boat, house, fishnet, etc., and it was mats, cooked foodk, gold, and other things.''</blockquote>\n\nThe unnamed author of the anonymous 1572 \"''Relaci\u00f3n de la conquista de la isla de Luz\u00f3n''\" (translated in Volume 3 of Blair and Robertson),<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\">{{Cite book|title=Relation of the Conquest of the Island of Luzon|work=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898|publisher=Arthur H.

When the guests are all assembled and the feast set forth in a few plates on the ground inside the house, they seat themselves also on the ground to eat. In the midst of the feast (called manganito or bayl\u00e1n in their tongue), they put the idol called Batala and certain aged women who are considered as priestesses, and some aged Indians\u2014neither more nor less. They offer the idol some of the food which they are eating, and call upon him in their tongue, praying to him for the health of the sick man for whom the feast is held. The natives of these islands have no altars nor temples whatever. This manganito, or drunken revel, to give it a better name, usually lasts seven or eight days; and when it is finished they take the idols and put them in the corners of the house, and keep them there without showing them any reverence.\"''</blockquote>\n\n== \"Bathala\": the \"almighty\" or \"creator\" ==\n{{main|Bathala}}\nAccording to the early Spanish missionaries, the Tagalog people believed in a creator-god named \"''Bathala''\",<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> whom they referred to both as ''maylicha'' (creator; lit. \"actor of creation\") and ''maycapal'' (lord, or almighty; lit. \"actor of power\"). Loarca and Chirino reported that in some places, this creator god was called \"''Molaiari''\" (Malyari) or \"''Dioata''\" (Diwata).<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott (1989) notes:<blockquote>''\"Bathala was described as \"may kapal sa lahat [maker of everything],\" kapal meaning to mould something between the hands like clay or wax.\"''<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/></blockquote>\n\nFrancisco Demetrio, Gilda Cordero Fernando, and Fernando Nakpil Zialcita summarize a number of Tagalog beliefs regarding Bathala: <blockquote>\"''The Tagalogs called their supreme god Bathala Maykapal or Lumikha (The Creator). An enormous being, he could not straighten up due to the lowness of the sky. And the sun burned brightly near him. One day, Bathala got a bolo and pierced one of the sun's eyes so that it could generate just enough heat to sustain life. At last, Bathala was able to straighten up and with his hands pushed the cooler sky to its present level. Bathala is also known as the grand conserver of the universe, the caretaker of things from whom all providence comes, hence the beautiful word 'bahala' or 'mabahala' meaning 'to care'.''\"</blockquote>\n\nThe missionaries who observed the Tagalog peoples in the 1500s noted, however that the Tagalogs did not include Bathala in their daily acts of worship (pag-a-anito). Fray Buenaventura noted in the [[Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala]] that the Tagalogs believed Bathala was too mighty and distant to be bothered with the concerns of mortal man, and so the Tagalogs focused their acts of appeasement to the immediate spirits which they believed had control over their day-to-day life.<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\n== Other deities and powers ==\nBecause Bathala was considered a \"distant\" entity, the Tagalog people focused their attention more on some scholars term to be \"lesser\" deities and powers,<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> which could be more easily influenced than Bathala.<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\nBecause the Tagalogs did not have a collective word to describe all these spirits together, Spanish missionaries eventually decided to call them \"anito,\" since they were the subject of the Tagalog's act of ''pag-aanito'' (worship). According to Scott, a careful search of sources from the 1500s reveals that:<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><blockquote>''\"there was no single word in Tagalog for the other deities to whom Bathala was superior: when necessary, Spanish lexicographers referred to them all as anito.\"''<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Scott, accounts and early dictionaries describe them as intermediaries (\"Bathala's agents\"), and the dictionaries used the word \"abogado\" (advocate) when defining their realms. These sources also show, however, that in practice, they were addressed directly: \"''in actual prayers, they were petitioned directly, not as intermediaries.''\" Scott cites the example of a farmer's prayer to Lakapati, where a child would be held over a field, and the farmer would pray: \"''Lakapati, pakanin mo yaring alipin mo; huwag mong gutumin'' [Lakapati feed this thy slave; let him not hunger]\"<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/>{{rp|page=361}}\n\nDemetrio, Fernando and Zialcita, in their 1991 reader \"The Soul Book\", categorize these spirits broadly into \"Ancestor spirits\" and \"non-ancestor spirits, but then further sub-categorize them into: \"Ancestor spirits, nature spirits, and guardian spirits.\"<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/>\n\n=== Tagalog spirits described in early firsthand accounts===\nScott, drawing from firsthand accounts and descriptions in early dictionaries, describes some of these Tagalog spirits specifically:\n* '''Lakan Bakod''' was \"''the lord of fences (bakod),\"''and ''\"was invoked to keep animals out of swiddens''\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott quotes San Buenaventura<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/>{{rp|page=361}} as saying Lakanbakod's larauan (image/idol) \"''had gilded genitals as long as a rice stalk\", and \"was offered eels when fencing swiddens - because, they said, his were the strongest of all fences.''\" \n* '''Aman Sinaya''' was an ancestor spirit who was invoked by Fishermen as a guardian spirit. Scott notes that he was \"the inventor of fishing gear, [and] was named when first wetting a net or fish hook\"<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Lakapati''' \"was worhipped in the fields at planting time\" and \"was fittingly represented by a hermaphrodite image with both male and female parts\"<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Aman Ikabli''', the patron of hunters\n* '''Dian Masalanta''', the patron of lovers and childbirth. \n* '''Mankukutod''', protector of coconut palms, given an offering by Tuba tappers before climbing a tree,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> lest they fall from the trunk.  \n* '''Uwinan Sana''', guardian of grasslands or forests,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> acknowledged as overlord of grasslands or forests whenever entering them, to avoid being regarded as trespassers.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Lakambini''', the advocate (Spanish dictionaries used the term \"abogado\")<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> of the throat, was invoked in case of throat ailments.\n* '''Haik''', the sea God, called upon by seamen in a major ceremony,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> asking for fair weather and favorable winds.  \n* lesser deities like '''Linga''' and '''Bibit''', who caused illness if not given recognition in the ordinary course of daily activities.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n== Katalonan (priests or priestess) ==\n{{main|Katalonan}}\nThe priest or priestess of the Tagalogs and Kapampangans were called \"Katalonan\" (also spelled Catalonan; or Catulunan in [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]), and was equivalent of the [[Visayans|Visayan]] term \"[[Babaylan]].\" The term apparently springs from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word \"''katalo''\", which means \"''in good terms with'',\" such that the Catalonan are those \"in good terms with the [[Anito]] spirits\".<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\nHistorian and Spanish Missionary [[Pedro Chirino|Pedro Chirino, SJ]] noted that their long hair is a symbol of their commitment to their religion.<ref name=\"Chirino1604\">Chirino, Pedro (1604).

Although the behaviors of numerous birds and lizards were said to be omens, particular attention was paid to the tigmamanukan.\n\nAccording to San Buenaventura's Dictionary,<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/> the Tagalogs believed that the direction of a tigmamanukan flying across one's path at the beginning a journey indicated the undertaking's result. If it flew from right to left, the expedition would be a success. This sign was called \"''labay''\", a term still present in some Filipino languages with the meaning \"proceed\". If the bird flew from left to right, the travelers would surely never return.\n\nIt was also said that if a hunter caught a tigmamanukan in a trap, they would cut its beak and release it, saying \"''Kita ay iwawala, kun akoy mey kakawnan, lalabay ka.''\" (\"You are free, so when I set forth, sing on the right.\")\n\nWhile the name \"tigmamanukan\" is no longer used today, some early western explorers say that the specific bird referred to by the name is a fairy bluebird (genus ''[[fairy-bluebird|Irena]]'', family ''[[Irenidae]]'').

The first is known as the ''kakambal'' (literally means twin), which is the soul of the living. Every time a person sleeps, the ''kakambal'' may travel to many mundane and supernatural places which sometimes leads to nightmares if a terrible event is encountered while the ''kakambal'' is travelling. When a person dies, the ''kakambal'' is ultimately transformed into the second form of the Tagalog soul, which is the ''kaluluwa'' (literally means spirit). In traditional Tagalog religion, the ''kaluluwa'' then travels to either ''Kasanaan'' (if the person was evil when he was living) or ''Maca'' (if the person was good when he was living). Both domains are ruled by [[Bathala]], though Kasanaan is also ruled by the deity of souls.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref>\n\nDue to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was forcefully introduced to the Tagalog. In Roman Catholicism, a good person is sent to Heaven while a bad person is sent to Hell to burn in scalding oil.\n\n== Dream beliefs ==\nThe Tagalog people traditionally believe that when a person sleeps, he may or may not dream the omens of [[Bathala]]. The omens are either hazy illusions within a dream, the appearance of an omen creature such as [[tigmamanukan]], or sightings from the future. The dream omens do not leave traces on what a person must do to prevent or let the dream come true as it is up to the person to make the proper actions to prevent or make the dream come true. The omen dreams are only warnings and possibilities 'drafted by Bathala'.\n\nAdditionally, a person may sometimes encounter nightmares in dreams. There are two reasons why nightmares occur, the first is when the ''kakambal'' soul encounters a terrifying event while travelling from the body, or when a ''[[Batibat|bangungot]]'' creature sits on top of the sleeping person in a bid of vengeance due to the cutting of her tree home. Majority of the nightmares are said to be due to the ''kakambal'' soul encountering terrifying events while travelling.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref><ref>https://vanwinkles.com/11-mythical-sleep-creatures-from-around-the-world</ref>\n\n== Traditional burial practices ==\nThe Tagalog people had numerous burial practices prior to Spanish colonization and Catholic introduction. In rural areas of [[Cavite]], trees are used as burial places. The dying person chooses the tree beforehand, thus when he or she becomes terminally ill or is evidently going to die because old age, a hut is built close to the said tree. The deceased's corpse is then entombed vertically inside the hollowed-out tree trunk. Before colonization, a statue known as ''likha'' is also entombed with the dead inside the tree trunk. In [[Mulanay, Quezon]] and nearby areas, the dead are entombed inside limestone sarcophagi along with a ''likha'' statue. However, the practice vanished in the 16th century due to Spanish colonization. In [[Calatagan, Batangas]] and nearby areas, the dead are buried under the earth along with ''likha'' statues. The statues, measuring 6-12 inches, are personified depictions of ''anitos''. ''Likha'' statues are not limited to burial practices as they are also used in homes, prayers, agriculture, medicine, travel, and other means.<ref name=\"DPPS\">Tacio, Henrylito D.

Jocano (2001) notes:<blockquote>''\"Except for a few artifacts and identified loanwords that have been accepted as proofs of Indian-Philippine relations, there are meager intrusive materials to sustain definite views concerning the range of Indian prehistoric influence in the country. Many generalizations [that] have so far been advanced merely obscure the basic issues of Philippine cultural development. Even archeological data, mostly trade items, must be critically evaluated before they are judged as evidence of direct contacts.\"''<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|pages=138\u2013139}}</blockquote>\n\nHe notes that the various streams of the evidence which support the assertion that this influence reached the Philippines include:<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/> ''\"Syllabic writing; artifacts in the form of different figurines made of clay, gold, and bronze that were dug in various sites in the Philippines; and 336 loanwords identified by Professor Francisco to be Sanskrit in origin, with 150 of them identified as the origin of some major Philippine terms.\"''\n\nRegardless of how and when it actually happened, historiographers specializing in Southeast Asia note that this \"influence\" was cultural and religious, rather than military or political in nature. For example, Osborne, in his 2004 history of Southeast Asia, notes:<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/>{{rp|page=23}}<blockquote>''Beginning in the 2nd and third centuries C.E. there was a slow expansion of [Indian] cultural contacts with the Southeast Asian region. It was an uneven process, with some areas receiving Indian influence much later than others, and the degree of influence varying from century to century. [...]Indianization did not mean there was a mass migration of Indian population into sea. Rather, a relatively limited number of traders and priest scholars brought Indian culture in its various forms to Southeast Asia where much, but not all, of this culture was absorbed by the local population and joined to their existing cultural patterns.''</blockquote>\n\nOsborne further emphasizes that this \"indianization\" of Southeast Asia did not per-se overwrite existing indigenous patterns, cultures, and beliefs: <blockquote>\"''Because Indian culture \u201ccame\u201d to Southeast Asia, one must not think that Southeast Asians lacked a culture of their own. Indeed, the generally accepted view is that Indian culture made such an impact on Southeast Asia because it fitted easily with the existing cultural patterns and religious beliefs of populations that had already moved a considerable distance along the path of civilization.[\u2026] Southeast Asians, to summarize the point, borrowed but they also adapted. In some very important cases, they did not need to borrow at all.''\"<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/>{{rp|page=24}}</blockquote>\n\nHistoriographers, both from Southeast Asia in general,<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> and the Philippines specifically<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Jocano2001\">{{cite book  | last = Jocano  | first = F.

For a different reason \u2013 distant geographical location \u2013 neither did the Philippines participate in this process.\"''</blockquote>\n\nJocano furthers:<blockquote>''\"The Philippines is geographically outside the direct line of early commerce between India and the rest of Southeast Asia. Moreover, the island world of Indonesia, with Sumatra and Java controlling the traffic of trade, functioned as a sieve for whatever influence (cultural, social, and commercial) India might have had to offer beyond the Indonesian archipelago.[...]Thus, it can be said that Indian Influence filtered into the Philippines only indirectly.''\"<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|page=139}}</blockquote>\n\nAfter reviewing threads of evidence for the various views concerning the date and mechanism of \"Indian prehistoric influence in the country\", Jocano concludes: <blockquote>''\"Philippine-Indonesian relations during precolonial times became intensified during the rise of the Madjapahit Empire. It was during this time that much of the so-called Indian cultural influence reached the Philippines through Indonesia. But what penetrated into our country, particularly in the seaport communities, was already the modified version of the original Hindu cultural traits.\"''<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|page=142}}</blockquote>\n\n\n\nFray Diego de Herrera noted that inhabitants in some villages were \"Muslim in name only\", and sborne also notes that the Luzones who visited [[Portuguese Malacca]] in the 1510s to 1540s were \"nominally Muslim\".<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> The unnamed author of the Anonymous 1572 ''Relaci\u00f3n''<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/> goes into further detail:<blockquote>''\"In the villages nearest the sea some do not eat pork, the reason for their not eating it, which I have already given, being that, in trading with the Moros of Burney, the latter have preached to them some part of the nefarious doctrine of Mahoma, charging them not to eat pork. [....] When[...]any of them are asked why they do not eat it, they say that they do not know why; and if one asks them who Mahoma was and what his law commands, they say that they do not know the commandment or anything about Mahoma, not even his name; nor do they know what his law is, nor whence it came. It is true that some of them who have been in Burney understand some of it, and are able to read a few words of the Alcor\u00e1n; but these are very few, and believe that he who has not been in Burney may eat pork, as I have heard many of them say.\"''<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Present day beliefs ==\nModern day scholars such as Scott,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Jocano,<ref name=\"Jocano1975\">F.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and shares continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. The series was produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and F&B Fazekas & Butters, with Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas, and Chris Dingess serving as [[showrunners]].\n\n[[Hayley Atwell]] reprises her role of Carter from the film series and One-Shot. In the series, Carter must balance life as a secret agent with that of a single woman in 1940s America. Development on a series inspired by the short film had begun by September 2013, with Atwell's involvement confirmed in January 2014. That May, ABC ordered the show straight to series, with [[James D'Arcy]], [[Chad Michael Murray]], and [[Enver Gjokaj]] starring alongside Atwell; they are joined by [[Shea Whigham]] for the first season. The series introduces the origins of several characters and storylines from MCU films, while other characters from the films also appear.\n\nThe [[Agent Carter (season 1)|first season]], consisting of eight episodes, originally aired from January 6 to February 24, 2015, while the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]], consisting of 10 episodes, originally aired from January 19 to March 1, 2016. Both seasons aired during mid-season breaks of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' Despite a positive critical response, viewership fell steadily, and on May 12, 2016, ABC canceled ''Agent Carter''.<!-- Do not add a reference here per WP:LEADCITE.

Carter is assisted by Stark's butler, [[Edwin Jarvis]], to find those responsible and dispose of the weapons.<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"Synopsis2\" /> In the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]], Carter moves from New York City to [[Los Angeles]] to deal with the threats of the new [[Atomic Age]] by the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]], gaining new friends, a new home, and a potential new love interest.<ref name=\"Season2Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"S2SynopsisLong\" />\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{Main|List of Agent Carter characters}}\n<!-- MAIN CAST BASED ON THESE SOURCES: http://marvel.com/news/tv/23724/marvels_agent_carter_to_debut_with_a_2-hour_premiere and http://screenrant.com/agent-carter-season-2-synopsis-story/ PLEASE DON'T CHANGE WITHOUT A NEW RELIABLE SOURCE -->\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]]: <br />An SSR agent initially stuck doing administrative work.<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /> Butters said Carter's \"superpower is the fact that other people underestimate her.

She knew his character and she saw a kindred spirit in him. So I think she's grieving the loss of him but she's also determined to make sure that his work wasn't in vain.

Some of it is influenced by James D'Arcy himself and his strengths.\"<ref name=\"THRJan2015\" /> D'Arcy was initially nervous about portraying Jarvis's comedic side, given his history of \"predominantly play[ing] psychopaths\".<ref name=\"ColliderTCAJan2015\" /> He did not study [[Paul Bettany]]'s performance as J.A.R.V.I.S. when approaching the character.<ref name=\"D'ArcyCBRFeb2015\" /> D'Arcy later reprised his role in the 2019 film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"D'ArcyEndgame\" />\n* [[Chad Michael Murray]] as Jack Thompson: <br />A war veteran and agent with the SSR,<ref name=\"MurrayIntel\" /> described as chauvinistic and \"chest-puffing\".<ref name=\"EWJan2015\" /><ref name=\"TVLineJan2015\" /> Murray compared the character to [[Indiana Jones]], and stated that \"he's working his way up to become the head of the SSR. His goal in life is to just be great at his job. So he has a large chip on his shoulder, which gives him an attitude.\"<ref name=\"MurrayIntel\" /> Murray also noted that, unlike his character on ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', Thompson does not serve as the \"moral compass\", which meant that he would not be \"confined to a box\" and would instead be allowed to \"really play things up and do what's unexpected\".<ref name=\"MurrayZap2it\" /> For the second season, Thompson is made chief of the East Coast SSR office.<ref name=\"S2SynopsisLong\" />\n* [[Enver Gjokaj]] as [[Daniel Sousa (character)|Daniel Sousa]]: <br />A war veteran who is an agent with the SSR and experiences prejudice due to his crippled leg.<ref name=\"TVLineJan2015\" /><ref name=\"GjokajDeadline\" /> \"He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ...

There's no telling what any of them experienced last year.|source=\u2014Co-creator Christopher Markus on exploring the dynamic of 1940s characters.<ref name=\"CBRJuly2014\" />}}\n\nMarkus and McFeely stated in March 2014 that the series would be set in 1946 initially, occurring in the middle of the timeline established in the One-Shot, and would focus on one case for Carter. Additional seasons would then advance a year and examine a new case.<ref name=\"AgentCarterMar2014\" /> Despite working on ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' at the same time, Markus and McFeely remained involved with the series after writing the first script.<ref name=\"CreatorsColliderJan2015\" /> When the showrunners joined the series, they went on a \"mini-camp\" with Markus and McFeely to develop the series from a pilot script written by the pair.<ref name=\"MiniCamp\" /> They looked to several different influences outside of Marvel in developing the series, including ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'', and the works of author [[James Ellroy]].<ref name=\"LATimesJan2015\" /> Elaborating on deviating from the comics, Fazekas said, for example, \"if we're using a minor character or a bad guy from an old comic book, we don't have to adhere to what that character was in that comic book from 1945. Because there are so many different iterations of a specific character, you can't be true to every single one.\"<ref name=\"THRJan2015Grilled\" /> ABC asked the producers to not have the series follow a \"Gadget of the Week or Bad Guy of the Week\" model, and instead focus on telling the story of Carter balancing her personal and professional lives. Fazekas called this \"such a nice change\" from previous television experience, with the group feeling free to drop whole story ideas in favor of focusing on the series' central storyline.<ref name=\"MiniCamp\" />\n\nOn the time periods the series could potentially explore following the first season given Carter's role in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Atwell said, \"I think the great thing about the fact that I've already played her at the end of her life means that we know ... [Now] we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth [seasons], we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life\u2014and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season\u2014if it goes onto that\u2014we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that.\"<ref name=\"IGNJan2015\" /> However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"ButtersCBRMar2015\" /> This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.<ref name=\"ComicConIGN\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nAtwell, who portrayed Carter in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', and the ''Agent Carter'' short film, expressed interest in returning as the character in October 2013,<ref name=\"CarterAtwell\" /> before Lee confirmed her involvement in January 2014.<ref name=\"CarterConfirmed\" /> That August, [[Chad Michael Murray]] and [[Enver Gjokaj]] were cast as SSR agents Jack Thompson and Daniel Sousa, respectively,<ref name=\"GjokajDeadline\" /> while [[James D'Arcy]] was cast the next month as Edwin Jarvis,<ref name=\"D'Arcy\" /> the character who would eventually inspire the [[artificial intelligence]] [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] from the MCU films.<ref name=\"Jarvis\" /> [[Shea Whigham]] was also cast, as SSR chief [[Roger Dooley]].<ref name=\"Whigham\" /> Atwell, D'Arcy, Gjokaj, and Murray returned for the second season.<ref name=\"S2SynopsisLong\" />\n\n=== Design ===\n==== Costumes ====\nThe costume designer for the series is Giovanna Ottobre-Melton, who felt comfortable with the series' period setting after spending months researching American styles in the 1940s for the 2013 television series ''[[Mob City]]''.<ref name=\"CostumeMeet\" /> She noted that \"many comic books were all blended by the color, style, and fabrics\" from 1940s New York.<ref name=\"CostumeSneak\" /> Due to the large amount of action in the series, fabrics \"with the feel and texture of the 1940s\" had to be sourced in large quantities, to allow for the creation of four, five, or more of each costume.<ref name=\"CostumeMeet\" /> Ottobre-Melton's process \"for each episode, [is to] read the script first, and then search for historic photos that relate to what the episode is about. Afterwards I chose the fabrics, and then begin to design the outfits.\"<ref name=\"CostumeSneak\" />\n\n==== Props ====\nWhen creating the gadgets for the series, the writers noted the need to combine the period setting with the influence of Howard Stark, who opens the door to \"things that are fantastic for the time period\". They worked closely with the props department to develop technology that appears \"both retro and futuristic at the same time\", with Fazekas explaining that the goal was to avoid a [[science fiction]] look, so the fantastical aspects were reserved solely for function while the aesthetic was kept within the realms of that time period.<ref name=\"EPsCBFeb2015\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming for the series took place in Los Angeles, with the story's location shifting from New York City to Los Angeles with the second season to capitalize on this.<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /><ref name=\"MadameMasque\" /> [[Gabriel Beristain]], cinematographer for the One-Shot and the first season of the series, used a combination of modern digital technology and traditional analog techniques to replicate the feel of classic films that are set in the 1940s, but to also have the convenience and consistency of modern technology, such as using the [[Arri Alexa]] digital camera, along with Leica Lenses and silk-stocking diffusion nets.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /><ref name=\"BeristainOS\" /> Edward J. Pei took over as cinematographer for the second season.<ref name=\"PeiDoP\" /> Stunt coordinator Casey O'Neill, who also worked on the One-Shot and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', incorporated the specific fighting styles of the characters, such as the more \"CIA-trained\" fighting of Carter or the more acrobatic, \"[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]\"-inspired style of antagonist [[List of Agent Carter characters#Dottie Underwood|Dottie Underwood]].<ref name=\"O'NeillResume\" /><ref name=\"Stunts\" />\n\n=== Visual effects ===\nSheena Duggal serves as visual effect supervisor, returning in the same capacity from the ''Agent Carter'' One-Shot,<ref name=\"DuggalMOS\" /> with the visual effects for the series created by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Base FX]],<ref name=\"ArtVFX\" /> and later [[Double Negative (VFX)|DNeg TV]].<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /><ref name=\"CrackEffects\" /> Duggal worked closest with ILM, who coordinated with Base and DNeg to ensure a \"seamless workflow\". The majority of the series' visual effects work focuses on set extensions to depict the period setting, as well as the more fantastical aspects such as Howard Stark's inventions,<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> or [[Darkforce|Zero Matter]] and Jason Wilkes' intangibility in the second season.<ref name=\"CrackEffects\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nIn June 2014, [[Christopher Lennertz]], who composed the music for the ''Agent Carter'' One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito \"told me last summer at Comic-Con that there was a possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that if he was going to be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too.\"<ref name=\"LennertzLikely\" /> In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series.<ref name=\"LennertzConfirmed\" /> Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is \"always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality.\"<ref name=\"LennertzCBR\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Agent Carter (season 1)#Music|first season]] was released on [[iTunes]] on December 11, 2015,<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /> and the single \"Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)\" from the [[Agent Carter (season 2)#Music|second season]] was released on March 18, 2016.<ref name=\"WatchaGonnaDo\" />\n\n=== Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=We work really closely with Eric Carroll in Marvel Studios. He's sort of the guy who tells us, \"Well, you can't really do this to that thing, because that's going to step on this project.

You don't have to go, 'Howard Stark's wearing the same pants that Tony wears!' ... Everything is enhanced just by the knowledge that its all connected.\"<ref name=\"CreatorsColliderJan2015\" /> Butters said, \"We always want to feel like you see us as a piece of [the MCU]. But because of our time period, we kind of are on our own a little bit.\"<ref name=\"ButtersIGNJan2016\" />\n\nIn July 2014, Fazekas explained the series' relationship with the One-Shot by saying, \"The short really is the basis for the series. [Carter]'s working at SSR, post-war...If you think of the short as sort of the end of the series, the series would be leading up to that moment where she gets assigned to S.H.I.E.L.D.\"<ref name=\"IGNJul2014\" /> Markus reiterated this in January 2015, but acknowledged that it would be harder to keep continuity with the short the longer they made the series.<ref name=\"CreatorsColliderJan2015\" /> The first season introduces the origins of the Black Widow and [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]] programs, which both appear in several MCU films,<ref name=\"ExploresBW\" /><ref name=\"MarkusMcFeelyFeb2015\" /><ref name=\"FazekasButterEWFeb2015\" /> while the second season shows the discovery of the [[Darkforce]] (known as Zero Matter in the series), which previously appeared in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and has ties to both [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]].<ref name=\"EPsJan2016CBR\" /><ref name=\"CloakDarkforce\" />\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ABOUT ENDGAME HERE, IT IS ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE CAST AND FUTURE SECTIONS -->\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Broadcast ===\n''Agent Carter'' aired on ABC in the United States,<ref name=\"PremiereSynopsis\" /> in [[720p]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] and [[5.1 surround sound]].<ref name=\"Picture/Audio\" /> It also aired on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada, and [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] in New Zealand.<ref name=\"Canada\" /><ref name=\"NZ\" /> In October 2014, [[Channel 4]], the channel that airs ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' in the United Kingdom, stated that they did not \"have any current plans [to air] ''Agent Carter''\".<ref name=\"C4NoPlans\" /> In June 2015, [[Fox (UK and Ireland)|FOX UK]] purchased the broadcast rights for the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"FOXUK\" /> with the series premiering on July 12, 2015.<ref name=\"FOXUKDate\" /> In February 2016, the series was announced to air on [[7flix]] in Australia.<ref name=\"Australia\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"3\"| [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] release dates\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]\n|-\n!

They have to be evaluated within the context of the overall value they bring to any entertainment colossus, and what ''Agent Carter'' adds to Disney-ABC is simply too valuable to give up ... [bringing] something different to the company's superhero portfolio.\" She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast, that it should explore other opportunities, such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app, or being sold to Netflix, where \"fans of super-heroic storytelling already flock to\" and ''Agent Carter''{{'}}s \"status as a period piece\u2014which may have harmed it on broadcast\u2014could be a real draw for Netflix viewers\". Ryan also felt Marvel \"could copy what [[CBS]] is [[Star Trek: Discovery|doing with ''Star Trek'']]\" by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee, where consumers could access Marvel's films and televisions shows \"as well as premium exclusives like a third season of ''Agent Carter''\". Ryan concluded, \"A third ''Agent Carter'' season could help solidify Marvel's standing not just with female fans, but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling.\"<ref name=\"RyanVarietyMar2016\" />\n\nIn March 2016, Fazekas said the producers felt \"bad\" about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she \"would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever. I doubt that there's a [[Netflix]] play for it.\" She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers would find a way to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed.<ref name=\"EWEPsS2End\" /> On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series.<ref name=\"Canceled\" />\n\nLoeb stated in August 2016 that he did not understand the cancellation, as \"there were no conversations\" regarding the series' future between ABC and Marvel, with the latter simply receiving a call from ABC saying ''Agent Carter'' was canceled.<ref name=\"LoebAug2016\" /> He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, \"if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour ''Agent Carter'' [film special] for May 2017,' {{em|boom}}. We'll put together the greatest ''Agent Carter'' movie we can.\"<ref name=\"LoebAug20162\" /> Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it \"a network political thing\" since ABC wanted her to headline the more \"mainstream\" drama ''[[Conviction (2016 TV series)|Conviction]]'' \"to get their ratings up\" instead of staying on ''Agent Carter'', which Atwell felt had gained a \"cult following\".<ref name=\"AtwellJuly2017\" /> After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer [[Ted Sarandos]] stated the streaming service passed on reviving ''Agent Carter'' because it is \"looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have\" [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|original Marvel series]]. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting \"deal complexities\" for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air ''Agent Carter'' globally, as \"some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [deals]. Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one.\"<ref name=\"NetflixResponse\" />\n\nWhen the series was canceled shortly after the release of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', in which Carter dies, Meagan Damore of [[Comic Book Resources]] felt that \"for all intents and purposes\" Carter had \"effectively been phased out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", and the universe had subsequently lost \"a wonderful role model and...inspiration\" to fans of the character and series. Damore lamented the fact that the second season's [[cliffhanger]] ending had been left unresolved, and that viewers would never get the chance to see Carter's \"happy ending\", despite knowing she gets one, leaving the character's \"fate unfulfilled, languishing in the obscurity of 'what could have beens{{'\"}}. She also noted that Marvel had now lost \"the opportunity to show several prominent MCU events, not the least of which is the founding of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", and added that despite making \"leaps and bounds for women in the MCU, the same [could not] be said for people of color\", wishing the series had addressed Asian American women like [[Hazel Ying Lee]], one of 38 [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] who died in the line of duty, or Black women like Harriet Ida Pikens and Frances Wills, the first two Black members of the [[United States Naval Reserve]].<ref name=\"CBRCancellation\" />\n\n==Future==\n===Suggested spin-off podcast===\nIn March 2015, Butters revealed that there had been discussions with ''[[Thrilling Adventure Hour]]'' co-creator Ben Blacker about turning the fictional ''Captain America Adventure Program'' radio show from the first season into a real podcast. Butters said these well-received segments had not been part of their original pitch to Marvel, and that a second season renewal for the series would help the podcast's chances. She said the potential episodes would be \"little fifteen-minute storylines\".<ref name=\"ButtersCBRMar2015\" />\n\n===Planned third season===\nBefore the cancellation, Atwell said on the series' future, \"We think that there could be more to come....the [second season] finale doesn't suggest that that's it and they live happily ever after; that's the end. We know that's not the case. They've done it in a very clever way which wraps up and that gives the audience a very satisfying conclusion but they're not quite finishing it\".<ref name=\"AtwellS3Potential\" /> Fazekas explained that an early idea from Markus and McFeely was to set the third season in London, but \"you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [The location is] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell. I loved [Los Angeles]. I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would be very happy to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it.\"<ref name=\"EWEPsS2End\" /> Fazekas added that seeds for a third season had been planted throughout the second, and that the end of the second season\u2014with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file\u2014was \"very much tied to a third season arc\", with the shooter and their reasoning already determined.<ref name=\"IGNFazekasS2End\" /> Atwell said the third season would have gone \"further back into [Carter's] past\" while having \"a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [her] family\". She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.<ref name=\"AtwellJun2016\" /> Writer [[Jose Molina (writer)|Jose Molina]] expanded on this in July 2018, stating that the season would have focused on the investigation of the assassination attempt on Thompson, along with the revelation that Michael was still alive and involved in some \"very nefarious, super-villainous shenanigans\".<ref name=\"MolinaJul2018\" />\n\n===Feature films and potential revival===\nD'Arcy went on to reprise his role as Jarvis in the MCU film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.<ref name=\"D'ArcyEndgame\" /> While promoting ''Endgame'', Markus and McFeely were asked about the potential for ''Agent Carter'' to be revived by Disney's new streaming service [[Disney+]].

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and shares continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. The series was produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and F&B Fazekas & Butters, with Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas, and Chris Dingess serving as [[showrunners]].\n\n[[Hayley Atwell]] reprises her role of Carter from the film series and One-Shot. In the series, Carter must balance life as a secret agent with that of a single woman in 1940s America. Development on a series inspired by the short film had begun by September 2013, with Atwell's involvement confirmed in January 2014. That May, ABC ordered the show straight to series, with [[James D'Arcy]], [[Chad Michael Murray]], and [[Enver Gjokaj]] starring alongside Atwell; they are joined by [[Shea Whigham]] for the first season. The series introduces the origins of several characters and storylines from MCU films, while other characters from the films also appear.\n\nThe [[Agent Carter (season 1)|first season]], consisting of eight episodes, originally aired from January 6 to February 24, 2015, while the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]], consisting of 10 episodes, originally aired from January 19 to March 1, 2016. Both seasons aired during mid-season breaks of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' Despite a positive critical response, viewership fell steadily, and on May 12, 2016, ABC canceled ''Agent Carter''.<!-- Do not add a reference here per WP:LEADCITE.

Carter is assisted by Stark's butler, [[Edwin Jarvis]], to find those responsible and dispose of the weapons.<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"Synopsis2\" /> In the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]], Carter moves from New York City to [[Los Angeles]] to deal with the threats of the new [[Atomic Age]] by the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]], gaining new friends, a new home, and a potential new love interest.<ref name=\"Season2Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"S2SynopsisLong\" />\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{Main|List of Agent Carter characters}}\n<!-- MAIN CAST BASED ON THESE SOURCES: http://marvel.com/news/tv/23724/marvels_agent_carter_to_debut_with_a_2-hour_premiere and http://screenrant.com/agent-carter-season-2-synopsis-story/ PLEASE DON'T CHANGE WITHOUT A NEW RELIABLE SOURCE -->\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]]: <br />An SSR agent initially stuck doing administrative work.<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /> Butters said Carter's \"superpower is the fact that other people underestimate her. And she often uses that to her advantage\".<ref name=\"EWJan2015\" /> On the influence that the apparent death of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] has on Carter, Atwell explained that \"he was the greatest person she ever knew\u2014even before he took the serum and became Captain America. She knew his character and she saw a kindred spirit in him. So I think she's grieving the loss of him but she's also determined to make sure that his work wasn't in vain.

Some of it is influenced by James D'Arcy himself and his strengths.\"<ref name=\"THRJan2015\" /> D'Arcy was initially nervous about portraying Jarvis's comedic side, given his history of \"predominantly play[ing] psychopaths\".<ref name=\"ColliderTCAJan2015\" /> He did not study [[Paul Bettany]]'s performance as J.A.R.V.I.S. when approaching the character.<ref name=\"D'ArcyCBRFeb2015\" /> D'Arcy later reprised his role in the 2019 film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.<ref name=\"D'ArcyEndgame\" />\n* [[Chad Michael Murray]] as Jack Thompson: <br />A war veteran and agent with the SSR,<ref name=\"MurrayIntel\" /> described as chauvinistic and \"chest-puffing\".<ref name=\"EWJan2015\" /><ref name=\"TVLineJan2015\" /> Murray compared the character to [[Indiana Jones]], and stated that \"he's working his way up to become the head of the SSR. His goal in life is to just be great at his job. So he has a large chip on his shoulder, which gives him an attitude.\"<ref name=\"MurrayIntel\" /> Murray also noted that, unlike his character on ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', Thompson does not serve as the \"moral compass\", which meant that he would not be \"confined to a box\" and would instead be allowed to \"really play things up and do what's unexpected\".<ref name=\"MurrayZap2it\" /> For the second season, Thompson is made chief of the East Coast SSR office.<ref name=\"S2SynopsisLong\" />\n* [[Enver Gjokaj]] as [[Daniel Sousa (character)|Daniel Sousa]]: <br />A war veteran who is an agent with the SSR and experiences prejudice due to his crippled leg.<ref name=\"TVLineJan2015\" /><ref name=\"GjokajDeadline\" /> \"He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ...

Additional seasons would then advance a year and examine a new case.<ref name=\"AgentCarterMar2014\" /> Despite working on ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' at the same time, Markus and McFeely remained involved with the series after writing the first script.<ref name=\"CreatorsColliderJan2015\" /> When the showrunners joined the series, they went on a \"mini-camp\" with Markus and McFeely to develop the series from a pilot script written by the pair.<ref name=\"MiniCamp\" /> They looked to several different influences outside of Marvel in developing the series, including ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'', and the works of author [[James Ellroy]].<ref name=\"LATimesJan2015\" /> Elaborating on deviating from the comics, Fazekas said, for example, \"if we're using a minor character or a bad guy from an old comic book, we don't have to adhere to what that character was in that comic book from 1945. Because there are so many different iterations of a specific character, you can't be true to every single one.\"<ref name=\"THRJan2015Grilled\" /> ABC asked the producers to not have the series follow a \"Gadget of the Week or Bad Guy of the Week\" model, and instead focus on telling the story of Carter balancing her personal and professional lives. Fazekas called this \"such a nice change\" from previous television experience, with the group feeling free to drop whole story ideas in favor of focusing on the series' central storyline.<ref name=\"MiniCamp\" />\n\nOn the time periods the series could potentially explore following the first season given Carter's role in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Atwell said, \"I think the great thing about the fact that I've already played her at the end of her life means that we know ... [Now] we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth [seasons], we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life\u2014and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season\u2014if it goes onto that\u2014we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that.\"<ref name=\"IGNJan2015\" /> However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"ButtersCBRMar2015\" /> This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.<ref name=\"ComicConIGN\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nAtwell, who portrayed Carter in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', and the ''Agent Carter'' short film, expressed interest in returning as the character in October 2013,<ref name=\"CarterAtwell\" /> before Lee confirmed her involvement in January 2014.<ref name=\"CarterConfirmed\" /> That August, [[Chad Michael Murray]] and [[Enver Gjokaj]] were cast as SSR agents Jack Thompson and Daniel Sousa, respectively,<ref name=\"GjokajDeadline\" /> while [[James D'Arcy]] was cast the next month as Edwin Jarvis,<ref name=\"D'Arcy\" /> the character who would eventually inspire the [[artificial intelligence]] [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] from the MCU films.<ref name=\"Jarvis\" /> [[Shea Whigham]] was also cast, as SSR chief [[Roger Dooley]].<ref name=\"Whigham\" /> Atwell, D'Arcy, Gjokaj, and Murray returned for the second season.<ref name=\"S2SynopsisLong\" />\n\n=== Design ===\n==== Costumes ====\nThe costume designer for the series is Giovanna Ottobre-Melton, who felt comfortable with the series' period setting after spending months researching American styles in the 1940s for the 2013 television series ''[[Mob City]]''.<ref name=\"CostumeMeet\" /> She noted that \"many comic books were all blended by the color, style, and fabrics\" from 1940s New York.<ref name=\"CostumeSneak\" /> Due to the large amount of action in the series, fabrics \"with the feel and texture of the 1940s\" had to be sourced in large quantities, to allow for the creation of four, five, or more of each costume.<ref name=\"CostumeMeet\" /> Ottobre-Melton's process \"for each episode, [is to] read the script first, and then search for historic photos that relate to what the episode is about. Afterwards I chose the fabrics, and then begin to design the outfits.\"<ref name=\"CostumeSneak\" />\n\n==== Props ====\nWhen creating the gadgets for the series, the writers noted the need to combine the period setting with the influence of Howard Stark, who opens the door to \"things that are fantastic for the time period\". They worked closely with the props department to develop technology that appears \"both retro and futuristic at the same time\", with Fazekas explaining that the goal was to avoid a [[science fiction]] look, so the fantastical aspects were reserved solely for function while the aesthetic was kept within the realms of that time period.<ref name=\"EPsCBFeb2015\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming for the series took place in Los Angeles, with the story's location shifting from New York City to Los Angeles with the second season to capitalize on this.<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /><ref name=\"MadameMasque\" /> [[Gabriel Beristain]], cinematographer for the One-Shot and the first season of the series, used a combination of modern digital technology and traditional analog techniques to replicate the feel of classic films that are set in the 1940s, but to also have the convenience and consistency of modern technology, such as using the [[Arri Alexa]] digital camera, along with Leica Lenses and silk-stocking diffusion nets.<ref name=\"Beristain\" /><ref name=\"BeristainOS\" /> Edward J. Pei took over as cinematographer for the second season.<ref name=\"PeiDoP\" /> Stunt coordinator Casey O'Neill, who also worked on the One-Shot and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', incorporated the specific fighting styles of the characters, such as the more \"CIA-trained\" fighting of Carter or the more acrobatic, \"[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]\"-inspired style of antagonist [[List of Agent Carter characters#Dottie Underwood|Dottie Underwood]].<ref name=\"O'NeillResume\" /><ref name=\"Stunts\" />\n\n=== Visual effects ===\nSheena Duggal serves as visual effect supervisor, returning in the same capacity from the ''Agent Carter'' One-Shot,<ref name=\"DuggalMOS\" /> with the visual effects for the series created by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Base FX]],<ref name=\"ArtVFX\" /> and later [[Double Negative (VFX)|DNeg TV]].<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /><ref name=\"CrackEffects\" /> Duggal worked closest with ILM, who coordinated with Base and DNeg to ensure a \"seamless workflow\". The majority of the series' visual effects work focuses on set extensions to depict the period setting, as well as the more fantastical aspects such as Howard Stark's inventions,<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> or [[Darkforce|Zero Matter]] and Jason Wilkes' intangibility in the second season.<ref name=\"CrackEffects\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nIn June 2014, [[Christopher Lennertz]], who composed the music for the ''Agent Carter'' One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito \"told me last summer at Comic-Con that there was a possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that if he was going to be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too.\"<ref name=\"LennertzLikely\" /> In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series.<ref name=\"LennertzConfirmed\" /> Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is \"always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality.\"<ref name=\"LennertzCBR\" /> A soundtrack album for the [[Agent Carter (season 1)#Music|first season]] was released on [[iTunes]] on December 11, 2015,<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /> and the single \"Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)\" from the [[Agent Carter (season 2)#Music|second season]] was released on March 18, 2016.<ref name=\"WatchaGonnaDo\" />\n\n=== Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=We work really closely with Eric Carroll in Marvel Studios. He's sort of the guy who tells us, \"Well, you can't really do this to that thing, because that's going to step on this project.

You don't have to go, 'Howard Stark's wearing the same pants that Tony wears!' ... Everything is enhanced just by the knowledge that its all connected.\"<ref name=\"CreatorsColliderJan2015\" /> Butters said, \"We always want to feel like you see us as a piece of [the MCU]. But because of our time period, we kind of are on our own a little bit.\"<ref name=\"ButtersIGNJan2016\" />\n\nIn July 2014, Fazekas explained the series' relationship with the One-Shot by saying, \"The short really is the basis for the series. [Carter]'s working at SSR, post-war...If you think of the short as sort of the end of the series, the series would be leading up to that moment where she gets assigned to S.H.I.E.L.D.\"<ref name=\"IGNJul2014\" /> Markus reiterated this in January 2015, but acknowledged that it would be harder to keep continuity with the short the longer they made the series.<ref name=\"CreatorsColliderJan2015\" /> The first season introduces the origins of the Black Widow and [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]] programs, which both appear in several MCU films,<ref name=\"ExploresBW\" /><ref name=\"MarkusMcFeelyFeb2015\" /><ref name=\"FazekasButterEWFeb2015\" /> while the second season shows the discovery of the [[Darkforce]] (known as Zero Matter in the series), which previously appeared in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' and has ties to both [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]].<ref name=\"EPsJan2016CBR\" /><ref name=\"CloakDarkforce\" />\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ABOUT ENDGAME HERE, IT IS ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE CAST AND FUTURE SECTIONS -->\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Broadcast ===\n''Agent Carter'' aired on ABC in the United States,<ref name=\"PremiereSynopsis\" /> in [[720p]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] and [[5.1 surround sound]].<ref name=\"Picture/Audio\" /> It also aired on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada, and [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] in New Zealand.<ref name=\"Canada\" /><ref name=\"NZ\" /> In October 2014, [[Channel 4]], the channel that airs ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' in the United Kingdom, stated that they did not \"have any current plans [to air] ''Agent Carter''\".<ref name=\"C4NoPlans\" /> In June 2015, [[Fox (UK and Ireland)|FOX UK]] purchased the broadcast rights for the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"FOXUK\" /> with the series premiering on July 12, 2015.<ref name=\"FOXUKDate\" /> In February 2016, the series was announced to air on [[7flix]] in Australia.<ref name=\"Australia\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 8px\" colspan=\"3\"| [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] release dates\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]]\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\"| [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]]\n|-\n!

They have to be evaluated within the context of the overall value they bring to any entertainment colossus, and what ''Agent Carter'' adds to Disney-ABC is simply too valuable to give up ... [bringing] something different to the company's superhero portfolio.\" She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast, that it should explore other opportunities, such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app, or being sold to Netflix, where \"fans of super-heroic storytelling already flock to\" and ''Agent Carter''{{'}}s \"status as a period piece\u2014which may have harmed it on broadcast\u2014could be a real draw for Netflix viewers\". Ryan also felt Marvel \"could copy what [[CBS]] is [[Star Trek: Discovery|doing with ''Star Trek'']]\" by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee, where consumers could access Marvel's films and televisions shows \"as well as premium exclusives like a third season of ''Agent Carter''\". Ryan concluded, \"A third ''Agent Carter'' season could help solidify Marvel's standing not just with female fans, but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling.\"<ref name=\"RyanVarietyMar2016\" />\n\nIn March 2016, Fazekas said the producers felt \"bad\" about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she \"would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever. I doubt that there's a [[Netflix]] play for it.\" She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers would find a way to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed.<ref name=\"EWEPsS2End\" /> On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series.<ref name=\"Canceled\" />\n\nLoeb stated in August 2016 that he did not understand the cancellation, as \"there were no conversations\" regarding the series' future between ABC and Marvel, with the latter simply receiving a call from ABC saying ''Agent Carter'' was canceled.<ref name=\"LoebAug2016\" /> He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, \"if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour ''Agent Carter'' [film special] for May 2017,' {{em|boom}}. We'll put together the greatest ''Agent Carter'' movie we can.\"<ref name=\"LoebAug20162\" /> Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it \"a network political thing\" since ABC wanted her to headline the more \"mainstream\" drama ''[[Conviction (2016 TV series)|Conviction]]'' \"to get their ratings up\" instead of staying on ''Agent Carter'', which Atwell felt had gained a \"cult following\".<ref name=\"AtwellJuly2017\" /> After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer [[Ted Sarandos]] stated the streaming service passed on reviving ''Agent Carter'' because it is \"looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have\" [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|original Marvel series]]. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting \"deal complexities\" for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air ''Agent Carter'' globally, as \"some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [deals]. Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one.\"<ref name=\"NetflixResponse\" />\n\nWhen the series was canceled shortly after the release of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', in which Carter dies, Meagan Damore of [[Comic Book Resources]] felt that \"for all intents and purposes\" Carter had \"effectively been phased out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", and the universe had subsequently lost \"a wonderful role model and...inspiration\" to fans of the character and series. Damore lamented the fact that the second season's [[cliffhanger]] ending had been left unresolved, and that viewers would never get the chance to see Carter's \"happy ending\", despite knowing she gets one, leaving the character's \"fate unfulfilled, languishing in the obscurity of 'what could have beens{{'\"}}. She also noted that Marvel had now lost \"the opportunity to show several prominent MCU events, not the least of which is the founding of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", and added that despite making \"leaps and bounds for women in the MCU, the same [could not] be said for people of color\", wishing the series had addressed Asian American women like [[Hazel Ying Lee]], one of 38 [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] who died in the line of duty, or Black women like Harriet Ida Pikens and Frances Wills, the first two Black members of the [[United States Naval Reserve]].<ref name=\"CBRCancellation\" />\n\n==Future==\n===Suggested spin-off podcast===\nIn March 2015, Butters revealed that there had been discussions with ''[[Thrilling Adventure Hour]]'' co-creator Ben Blacker about turning the fictional ''Captain America Adventure Program'' radio show from the first season into a real podcast. Butters said these well-received segments had not been part of their original pitch to Marvel, and that a second season renewal for the series would help the podcast's chances. She said the potential episodes would be \"little fifteen-minute storylines\".<ref name=\"ButtersCBRMar2015\" />\n\n===Planned third season===\nBefore the cancellation, Atwell said on the series' future, \"We think that there could be more to come....the [second season] finale doesn't suggest that that's it and they live happily ever after; that's the end. We know that's not the case. They've done it in a very clever way which wraps up and that gives the audience a very satisfying conclusion but they're not quite finishing it\".<ref name=\"AtwellS3Potential\" /> Fazekas explained that an early idea from Markus and McFeely was to set the third season in London, but \"you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [The location is] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell. I loved [Los Angeles]. I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would be very happy to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it.\"<ref name=\"EWEPsS2End\" /> Fazekas added that seeds for a third season had been planted throughout the second, and that the end of the second season\u2014with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file\u2014was \"very much tied to a third season arc\", with the shooter and their reasoning already determined.<ref name=\"IGNFazekasS2End\" /> Atwell said the third season would have gone \"further back into [Carter's] past\" while having \"a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [her] family\". She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.<ref name=\"AtwellJun2016\" /> Writer [[Jose Molina (writer)|Jose Molina]] expanded on this in July 2018, stating that the season would have focused on the investigation of the assassination attempt on Thompson, along with the revelation that Michael was still alive and involved in some \"very nefarious, super-villainous shenanigans\".<ref name=\"MolinaJul2018\" />\n\n===Feature films and potential revival===\nD'Arcy went on to reprise his role as Jarvis in the MCU film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.<ref name=\"D'ArcyEndgame\" /> While promoting ''Endgame'', Markus and McFeely were asked about the potential for ''Agent Carter'' to be revived by Disney's new streaming service [[Disney+]]. McFeely acknowledged that the series' fanbase was \"really dedicated\", but was unsure if there was enough support to justify the cost of making the series and its period setting.<ref
