Sections of mycoplasmas reveal that their cells are essentially built of three organelles: the cell membrane, ribosomes, and a circular double stranded DNA tightly packed molecule. Their mode of replication is no different from that of other [[prokaryotes]] dividing by [[binary fission]]. For binary fission to happen, cytoplasmic division must fully synchronize with genome replication and in mycoplasmas cytoplasmic replication lags behind genome replication, which ultimately results in the formation of multinucleated filaments.\n\nFrom ''in vitro'' cultivation of mycoplasmas it has been discovered that they are \"fastidious\", i.e. difficult to cultivate. The reasons for these difficulties for species such as ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' and ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' is the lack of all the genes involved in amino acid synthesis, making them dependent on exogenous supply of amino acids and other nutrients. This dependence on exogenous supplies of fatty acids and cholesterol serves as an advantage to conduct further studies on these organisms. In order to compensate for these deficiencies mycoplasmas are grown on complex media, usually consisting of beef heart infusion, peptone, yeast extract, and serum with various supplements.\n\nMycoplasmas' lack of a cell wall makes them good models for membrane studies. Due to this reason the availability of these membranes in pure state have enabled their chemical, enzymatic and antigenic characterization. The membrane is made of 60% to 70% protein with the remaining 20% to 30% being lipids.<ref name = \"Razin\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Razin S, Hayflick L | title = Highlights of mycoplasma research\u2014An historical perspective | journal = Biologicals | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 183\u201390 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20149687 | doi = 10.1016/j.biologicals.2009.11.008 }}</ref>-->\n\n== Characteristics ==\nOver 100 species have been included in the genus ''Mycoplasma''.

Further more the lack of cell wall (no peptidoglycan layer) is the reason that they are gram negative. Despite this, the cells often present a certain shape, with a characteristic small size (it is the smallest free-living bacteria), with typically about 10% of the volume of an ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cell. These cell shapes presumably contribute to the ability of mycoplasmas to thrive in their respective environments. Most are [[Coccus|pseudococcoidal]], but there are notable exceptions. Species of the ''M. fastidiosum'' cluster are rod-shaped. Species of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cluster, including ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'', possess a polar extension protruding from the pseudococcoidal cell body. This tip structure, designated an attachment organelle or terminal organelle, is essential for adherence to host cells and for movement along solid surfaces (gliding motility), and is implicated in normal cell division. ''M. pneumoniae'' cells are pleomorphic, with an attachment organelle of regular dimensions at one pole and a trailing filament of variable length and uncertain function at the other end, whereas other species in the cluster typically lack the trailing filament. Other species like ''[[Mycoplasma mobile|M. mobile]]'' and ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'' have similar structures with similar functions.\n\nMycoplasmas are unusual among bacteria in that most require [[sterols]] for the stability of their [[cytoplasmic membrane]]. Sterols are acquired from the environment, usually as cholesterol from the animal host. Mycoplasmas generally possess a relatively small [[genome]] of 0. 58-1. 38 megabases, which results in drastically reduced biosynthetic capabilities and explains their dependence on a host. Additionally they use an alternate [[genetic code]] in which the [[codon]] UGA encodes the amino acid [[tryptophan]] instead of the usual [[stop codon]]. They have a low [[GC-content]] (23\u201340 [[Mole (unit)|mol]]).-->\n<!--== First isolation ==\n posible [[WP:COPYVIO]] In 1898 Nocard and Roux reported the cultivation of the causative agent of CBPP, which was at that time a grave and widespread disease in cattle herds.<ref name=\"Nocard_Roux_1898\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nocard EIE, Roux E | title = The microbe of pleuropneumonia. 1896 | journal = Rev.

After fifteen to twenty days, the fluid inside of the recovered pouch was opaque, indicating the growth of a microorganism. Opacity of the fluid was not seen in the control. This turbid broth could then be used to inoculate a second and third round and subsequently introduced into a healthy animal, causing disease.

Now ''Mycoplasma'' is a genus in Mollicutes.\n\nHistorically, the description of a bacterium lacking a cell wall was sufficient to classify it to the genus ''Mycoplasma'' and as such it is the oldest and largest genus of the class with about half of the class' species (107 validly described), each usually limited to a specific host and with many hosts harboring more than one species, some pathogenic and some commensal. In later studies, many of these species were found to be phylogenetically distributed among at least three separate orders.\n\nA limiting criterion for inclusion within the genus ''Mycoplasma'' is that the organism have a vertebrate host. In fact, the type species, ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides|M. mycoides]]'', along with other significant mycoplasma species like ''M. capricolum'', is evolutionarily more closely related to the genus ''[[Spiroplasma]]'' in the order ''Entomoplasmatales'' than to the other members of the genus ''Mycoplasma''. This and other discrepancies will likely remain unresolved because of the extreme confusion that change could engender among the medical and agricultural communities.\n\nThe remaining species in the genus ''Mycoplasma'' are divided into three nontaxonomic groups, ''hominis, pneumoniae'' and ''fermentans'', based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.<br />The ''hominis'' group contains the phylogenetic clusters of ''[[Mycoplasma bovis|M. bovis]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'', and ''[[Mycoplasma hominis|M. hominis]]'', among others. ''[[Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae|M. hyopneumoniae]]'' is a primary bacterial agent of the porcine respiratory disease complex.\n\nThe ''pneumoniae'' group contains the clusters of ''[[Mycoplasma muris|M. muris]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma fastidiosum|M. fastidiosum]]'', ''[[Ureaplasma urealyticum|U. urealyticum]]'', the currently unculturable [[haemotrophic mollicutes]], informally referred to as [[haemoplasmas]] (recently transferred from the genera ''Haemobartonella'' and ''Eperythrozoon''), and the ''M. pneumoniae'' cluster. This cluster contains the species (and the usual or likely host) ''[[Mycoplasma alvi|M. alvi]]'' (bovine), ''[[Mycoplasma amphoriforme|M. amphoriforme]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma gallisepticum|M. gallisepticum]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma imitans|M. imitans]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma pirum|M. pirum]]'' (uncertain/human), ''[[Mycoplasma testudinis|M. testudinis]]'' (tortoises), and ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'' (human). Most, if not all, of these species share some otherwise unique characteristics including an attachment organelle, homologs of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cytadherence-accessory proteins, and specialized modifications of the cell division apparatus.\n\nA study of 143 genes in 15 species of ''Mycoplasma'' suggests that the genus can be grouped into four clades: the ''M. hyopneumoniae'' group, the ''M. mycoides'' group, the ''M. pneumoniae'' group, and a ''Bacillus''-''Phytoplasma'' group.<ref name=\"pmid17687503\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Oshima K, Nishida H | title = Phylogenetic relationships among mycoplasmas based on the whole genomic information | journal = J.

Sections of mycoplasmas reveal that their cells are essentially built of three organelles: the cell membrane, ribosomes, and a circular double stranded DNA tightly packed molecule. Their mode of replication is no different from that of other [[prokaryotes]] dividing by [[binary fission]]. For binary fission to happen, cytoplasmic division must fully synchronize with genome replication and in mycoplasmas cytoplasmic replication lags behind genome replication, which ultimately results in the formation of multinucleated filaments.\n\nFrom ''in vitro'' cultivation of mycoplasmas it has been discovered that they are \"fastidious\", i.e. difficult to cultivate. The reasons for these difficulties for species such as ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' and ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' is the lack of all the genes involved in amino acid synthesis, making them dependent on exogenous supply of amino acids and other nutrients. This dependence on exogenous supplies of fatty acids and cholesterol serves as an advantage to conduct further studies on these organisms. In order to compensate for these deficiencies mycoplasmas are grown on complex media, usually consisting of beef heart infusion, peptone, yeast extract, and serum with various supplements.\n\nMycoplasmas' lack of a cell wall makes them good models for membrane studies. Due to this reason the availability of these membranes in pure state have enabled their chemical, enzymatic and antigenic characterization. The membrane is made of 60% to 70% protein with the remaining 20% to 30% being lipids.<ref name = \"Razin\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Razin S, Hayflick L | title = Highlights of mycoplasma research\u2014An historical perspective | journal = Biologicals | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 183\u201390 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20149687 | doi = 10.1016/j.biologicals.2009.11.008 }}</ref>-->\n\n== Characteristics ==\nOver 100 species have been included in the genus ''Mycoplasma''.

Some live as [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytes]] but the majority are parasites of plants and animals. The parasitic nature is due to the inability of mycoplasmal bacteria to synthesise the required growth factor.\n\n=== Cell morphology ===\nDue to the lack of a rigid cell wall, Mycoplasmataceae can contort into a broad range of shapes, from round to oblong.  They therefore cannot be classified as rods, [[cocci]] or [[spirochetes]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Clinical Microbiology made ridiculously simple|last=Gladwin, MD|first=Mark|last2=Trattler, MD|first2=William|last3=Mahan, MD|first3=C.

Further more the lack of cell wall (no peptidoglycan layer) is the reason that they are gram negative. Despite this, the cells often present a certain shape, with a characteristic small size (it is the smallest free-living bacteria), with typically about 10% of the volume of an ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cell. These cell shapes presumably contribute to the ability of mycoplasmas to thrive in their respective environments. Most are [[Coccus|pseudococcoidal]], but there are notable exceptions. Species of the ''M. fastidiosum'' cluster are rod-shaped. Species of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cluster, including ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'', possess a polar extension protruding from the pseudococcoidal cell body. This tip structure, designated an attachment organelle or terminal organelle, is essential for adherence to host cells and for movement along solid surfaces (gliding motility), and is implicated in normal cell division. ''M. pneumoniae'' cells are pleomorphic, with an attachment organelle of regular dimensions at one pole and a trailing filament of variable length and uncertain function at the other end, whereas other species in the cluster typically lack the trailing filament. Other species like ''[[Mycoplasma mobile|M. mobile]]'' and ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'' have similar structures with similar functions.\n\nMycoplasmas are unusual among bacteria in that most require [[sterols]] for the stability of their [[cytoplasmic membrane]]. Sterols are acquired from the environment, usually as cholesterol from the animal host. Mycoplasmas generally possess a relatively small [[genome]] of 0. 58-1. 38 megabases, which results in drastically reduced biosynthetic capabilities and explains their dependence on a host. Additionally they use an alternate [[genetic code]] in which the [[codon]] UGA encodes the amino acid [[tryptophan]] instead of the usual [[stop codon]]. They have a low [[GC-content]] (23\u201340 [[Mole (unit)|mol]]).-->\n<!--== First isolation ==\n posible [[WP:COPYVIO]] In 1898 Nocard and Roux reported the cultivation of the causative agent of CBPP, which was at that time a grave and widespread disease in cattle herds.<ref name=\"Nocard_Roux_1898\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nocard EIE, Roux E | title = The microbe of pleuropneumonia. 1896 | journal = Rev.

Now ''Mycoplasma'' is a genus in Mollicutes.\n\nHistorically, the description of a bacterium lacking a cell wall was sufficient to classify it to the genus ''Mycoplasma'' and as such it is the oldest and largest genus of the class with about half of the class' species (107 validly described), each usually limited to a specific host and with many hosts harboring more than one species, some pathogenic and some commensal. In later studies, many of these species were found to be phylogenetically distributed among at least three separate orders.\n\nA limiting criterion for inclusion within the genus ''Mycoplasma'' is that the organism have a vertebrate host. In fact, the type species, ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides|M. mycoides]]'', along with other significant mycoplasma species like ''M. capricolum'', is evolutionarily more closely related to the genus ''[[Spiroplasma]]'' in the order ''Entomoplasmatales'' than to the other members of the genus ''Mycoplasma''. This and other discrepancies will likely remain unresolved because of the extreme confusion that change could engender among the medical and agricultural communities.\n\nThe remaining species in the genus ''Mycoplasma'' are divided into three nontaxonomic groups, ''hominis, pneumoniae'' and ''fermentans'', based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.<br />The ''hominis'' group contains the phylogenetic clusters of ''[[Mycoplasma bovis|M. bovis]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'', and ''[[Mycoplasma hominis|M. hominis]]'', among others. ''[[Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae|M. hyopneumoniae]]'' is a primary bacterial agent of the porcine respiratory disease complex.\n\nThe ''pneumoniae'' group contains the clusters of ''[[Mycoplasma muris|M. muris]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma fastidiosum|M. fastidiosum]]'', ''[[Ureaplasma urealyticum|U. urealyticum]]'', the currently unculturable [[haemotrophic mollicutes]], informally referred to as [[haemoplasmas]] (recently transferred from the genera ''Haemobartonella'' and ''Eperythrozoon''), and the ''M. pneumoniae'' cluster. This cluster contains the species (and the usual or likely host) ''[[Mycoplasma alvi|M. alvi]]'' (bovine), ''[[Mycoplasma amphoriforme|M. amphoriforme]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma gallisepticum|M. gallisepticum]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma imitans|M. imitans]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma pirum|M. pirum]]'' (uncertain/human), ''[[Mycoplasma testudinis|M. testudinis]]'' (tortoises), and ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'' (human). Most, if not all, of these species share some otherwise unique characteristics including an attachment organelle, homologs of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cytadherence-accessory proteins, and specialized modifications of the cell division apparatus.\n\nA study of 143 genes in 15 species of ''Mycoplasma'' suggests that the genus can be grouped into four clades: the ''M. hyopneumoniae'' group, the ''M. mycoides'' group, the ''M. pneumoniae'' group, and a ''Bacillus''-''Phytoplasma'' group.<ref name=\"pmid17687503\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Oshima K, Nishida H | title = Phylogenetic relationships among mycoplasmas based on the whole genomic information | journal = J.

Chromosomal translocation and extra chromosomes help create abnormally high activity of certain [[proto-oncogenes]], which caused by these genetic abnormalities and include those encoding [[c-myc]], [[HRAS]],<ref name=\"pmid 11575494 \"/> and [[vav (protein)|vav]].<ref name=\"pmid22076306\" /> The activity of proto-oncogenes is not the only cellular function that is affected; tumour suppressor genes are affected by the chromosomal changes induced by mycoplasma, as well. Partial or complete loss of chromosomes causes the loss of important genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation.<ref name=\"pmid7479753\" /> Two genes whose activities are markedly decreased during chronic infections with mycoplasma are the [[Retinoblastoma protein|Rb]] and the [[p53]] tumour suppressor genes.<ref name=\"pmid22076306\" /> Another possible mechanism of carcinogenesis is [[RAC1]] activation by a small GTPase-like protein fragment of Mycoplasma.<ref name=\" pmid = 24172987 \">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu X, Yu J, Zhou X, Li Z, Xia Y, Luo Z, Wu Y | title = A small GTPase-like protein fragment of Mycoplasma promotes tumor cell migration and proliferation in vitro via interaction with Rac1 and Stat3. | journal = Mol Med Rep | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 173\u2013179 | date = Jan 2014 | pmid = 24172987 | url = http://www.spandidos-publications.com/mmr/9/1/173 | doi=10.3892/mmr.2013.1766}}</ref> A major feature that differentiates mycoplasmas from other carcinogenic pathogens is that the mycoplasmas do not cause the cellular changes by insertion of their own genetic material into the host cell.<ref name=\"pmid 11575494 \"/> The exact mechanism by which the bacterium causes the changes is not yet known.\n\n; Partial reversibility of malignant transformations\n\nThe malignant transformation induced by mycoplasmae is also different from that caused by other pathogens in that the process is reversible. The state of reversal is, however, only possible up to a certain point during the infection. The window of time when reversibility is possible varies greatly; it depends primarily on the ''Mycoplasma'' involved. In the case of ''M. fermentans'', the transformation is reversible until around week 11 of infection and starts to become irreversible between weeks 11 and 18.<ref name=\"pmid7479753\" /> If the bacteria are killed using [[antibiotics]]<ref name=\"pmid7479753\" /> (i.e. [[ciprofloxacin]]<ref name=\"pmid22076306\" /> or [[Clarithromycin]]<ref name=\"pmid15708077\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pehlivan M, Pehlivan S, Onay H, Koyuncuoglu M, Kirkali Z | title = Can mycoplasma-mediated oncogenesis be responsible for formation of conventional renal cell carcinoma? | journal = Urology | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 411\u2013414 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15708077 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2004.10.015 }}</ref>) before the irreversible stage, the infected cells should return to normal.\n\n==== Connections to cancer ''in vivo'' and future research ====\n\nEpidemiologic, genetic, and molecular studies suggest infection and inflammation initiate certain cancers, including those of the prostate.
